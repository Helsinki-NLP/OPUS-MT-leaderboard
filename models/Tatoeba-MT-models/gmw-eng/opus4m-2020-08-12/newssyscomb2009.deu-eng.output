Triumph of right-wing populists in Austria, totaling 29 percent
A significant weakening of both parties of the so far great coalition and a clear strengthening of the right-wing populist parties, following the first preliminary results, brought the early parliamentary elections of Sunday in Austria.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) suffered particularly severe losses, where the position of former chairman Wilhelm Molterer is seriously on the tip.
On the other hand, the election leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), Carinthian head of state Jörg Haider, prepares for a triumphal return to federal politics.
According to the previous results, S & D (SPÖ) remains strongest in the country with 29.8 percent of the votes, but loses 5.5 percent of the votes compared to the last elections in 2006.
Even worse, the ÖVP lost nearly nine percent of the votes at 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in the Austrian post-war history, and this is a really disastrous result, especially for the People's Party, which called for the early elections.
At the beginning of July, when the ÖVP had resigned from the coalition, the People's Party had a clear advantage over the SPÖ.
However, the voters probably punished the party for failing the government.
Already in the first reactions to the results there were speculations about a possible resignation of the party chairman and former vice-cancer Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could already be the case on Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the party board.
Such a development would probably pave the way to the most likely way out of the election debacle, i.e. to a renewal of the great coalition from SPÖ and ÖVP.
In view of the strengthening of both the right-wing populist parties - the Freedom Party (FPÖ) received 18 percent for the time being, the BZÖ 11 percent for the time being - the Social Democrats expressed their fears that the year 1999 could be repeated when the People's Party had agreed with the populists (at that time the FPÖ was still uniform, in 2005 it separated from the BZÖ) with regard to a common government, which had even caused sanctions from the European Union.
Jörg Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with each party, clearly relies on this development and goes on a return to Vienna to Austrian federal politics.
In addition, the Green Party moved into the Parliament, which suffered slight losses and slipped from the third to the fifth place among the Austrian political parties.
No other party has probably mastered the four-percent burden and therefore did not go to Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool off
If it is not possible to solve the problem with the Czech scientists charged in India for the illegal collection of beetles, the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenbergenberg considers that a certain cooling of the Czech-Indian relations could occur.
This was emphasized by the New York Minister after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherdshi.
"If this doesn't work out, then surely, there will be some cooling," he said after a meeting that took place on a Czech initiative.
After the talks, Mukherdshi said that in judicial matters the executive could hardly intervene.
In spite of all that, he argued that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted from the charge and received a fine, the central government with the local government in Dardjiling wanted the case law.
"His problem could be solved," said the Minister.
For Emil Kučera, who was sentenced to three years of imprisonment, Mukherdshi's view would be best if he went to a higher court in appeal.
He could thus request bail and wait freely for his judgment, says the Minister.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had also expressed himself in negotiations.
"He recommends an appeal to a higher court, then a pardon would be in question for him," said the head of the Czech diplomacy.
The only way in which the Czech side can intervene in the whole matter is to let the convicted "competent legal support" grow, said the Indian minister.
At the same time, he said that such help was already offered them through the Indian side.
"We have a great interest in maintaining good contacts with India, which have a long-term tradition.
The Indians admit that too," said Schwarzenberg.
At the same time, according to the Czech press agency ČTK, before his partner, the Czech Republic stressed the importance of the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really think it's a big mistake to arrest and accuse these Czech scientists," he said.
An answer to the question of whether he had been given a commitment from the Indian side to deal with the matter was out of the question.
"I've already been promised quite a lot," he just found.
A Czech judge about ringing around the sea floor
It approaches an electronic map showing Australia and the adjacent sea areas.
However, it does not interest the continent, but a small point, lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and together with it also the adjacent sea floor.
The area is as large as the continent itself," said Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is one of the thirty-member staff of the UN Department of Oceans and Marine Rights.
His boss, the division director, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows and complements the interpretation.
Here there is work and enthusiasm.
So far, the seabed has a little known world rich in natural sources.
Oil can be found here, also ore and other non-reproductive raw materials, but also living organisms that have been unknown so far, for example, the key to developing a drug against cancer.
A seabed bigger than the mainland
Today, the neighbouring countries have vehemently declared their claim to the new marine areas.
After a UN convention, they use their rights to which they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
It is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often reaches up to a few hundred kilometers from the shore of a country into the sea.
According to the Convention, this country has an exclusive right to all sources of the continental shelf.
"Simplified as a continental shelf, the part of the seabed and its soles is considered to be a natural continuation of the continent below the sea surface.
It exceeds the borders of the shore sea, often also the border of two hundred nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The application submitted by the relevant country to the Commission to establish the external borders of the continental shelf must be documented by a comprehensive scientific and technical documentation based on many cost-intensive studies and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide legal and technical support to the Commission.
The Commission has so far negotiated five applications, namely Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three countries have been successful," Mikulka adds.
An international echo recently hit Australia’s success, which was the first country to significantly expand its sea areas.
However, New Zealand is also a winner - the extension of the seabed, which was approved by the Commission last week, is about 1.6 million square kilometres, about six times the size of the actual state.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the investigations.
The profit that will flow to them from the use of the seabed will, as they promise, have an invaluable value.
Other countries will also submit their applications gradually.
You can do this for ten years from the moment they ratify the Montego Bay agreement.
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean floor, which the Convention calls "common heritage of humanity", begins.
No state has a special position here.
The right to promote in this area shall be granted by an international institution established by the Convention.
"But the sea floor is not a gold tomb country," says director Mikulka, with a little exaggeration, adding that "the individual areas are legally defined and the system is secured by contract".

Part of the seabed is now also part of the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states of the former Eastern Bloc within the framework of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
It received the status of a so-called groundbreaking investor in 1991 under the Convention, as did the investors of a few fewer states.
The organization has the right to promote in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Silent Ocean between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The sea floor is divided there, it is a kind of tatra on the sea floor.
"You can promote there on an area of a total of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area is a rich site of polymetallic concretes containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," said another lawyer, the Inder Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian employee of the Rober Sandev division brings such a concrete pattern.
It reminds of a small potato or, with some imagination, of the fabulous twilight that the legend has brought to life after the Golem.
German specialists were on-site in hostage liberation
The Egyptian government had requested help from Germany to solve the hostage crisis - the experts came.
When it became serious, the special units were ready, but they were not used.
In the circumstances of the liberation of eleven European tourists abducted in Egypt, more and more details are known.
According to the Ministry of Defence and Interior, German specialists were indirectly involved in the rescue action.
According to this, specialists of the Bundeswehr as well as officials of the GSG 9 were the Flyer Staff of the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Office and logistics experts of the Technical Aid Agency at the place of liberation.
However, as spokespersons of the ministries continued to say on Monday evening, the German forces were not needed because the hostages had their prisoners run and fled when they recognized signs of violent liberation.
The Egyptian government had accepted the aid offered by Germany to involve it as local support forces.
"Unfortunately, it didn't happen," said a spokesperson of the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
Assailants had kidnapped the group from the five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian, and their eight Egyptian companions in southern Egypt on September 19.
After the kidnapping in a desert area in southern Egypt, the hostages had been dragged back and forth in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
Until recently, the identity of hostages remained unclear as well as the details of the liberation or possible ransom payments.
The prisoners have arrived in Cairo in the meantime.
Steinmeier said that the liberated hostages were in the custody of the German Embassy.
He did not express himself on details of release.
In Berlin there was no information at first when they returned to Germany.
According to "Image" newspaper, the five holidaymakers and the specialists are to be flown out with an Airbus of the Air Force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
US House of Representatives rejects rescue package
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress made the 700 billion-dollar rescue package for the financial markets very scarcely fail.
The Dow Jones sprang into the depths.
With 206 votes to 227, the U.S. House rejected the government's rescue package for the financial markets.
Despite all the appeals by U.S. President George W. Bush and leading politicians from both parties, there was no majority in favour of the programme that would limit the chaos on the financial markets.
In a dramatic action, the supporters had desperately tried to convince the critics of the $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiators, had called on Members to vote, even if the plan was unpopular.
"It is difficult to get political recognition for the avoidance of something that has not yet occurred," he admitted.
In the course of the vote, the Dow Jones broke down by more than six percent or by 600 points.
The reason for concern was investors that the state rescue package could fail.
He recovered just before the end of the vote, and then, after the announcement of the failure, fell again.
Experts now expect further severe turbulence in international financial markets.
The entry into force of the programme requires the approval of both the House of Deputies and the Senate.
Organizers record increasing booking figures
It seems to be a good winter for the German tour operators:
In the case of travel bookings for the coming months, sales increased significantly compared to the previous year according to a study - even by more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite weak economic prospects, a study found that the Germans’ desire to travel remained unfavorable.
In the winter season bookings, the rice offices recorded a sales increase of 31 percent compared to the previous year's period, as reported by the German Travel Association (DRV) on Monday in Berlin.
According to the investigation of the market research institute GfK, booking figures have already been increased for the autumn months.
Thus, the sales increase of travel agencies in October amounted to about 11 percent compared to 2007, the DRV reported.
The basis for these results is figures from the GfK, which evaluates monthly booking data from 1200 German travel agencies and calculates high for the total market.
The travel bookings made by the end of August 2008 are included.
In particular, due to the weak dollar price, travel to the USA was required, the DRV announced.
This is where the booking growth is around one third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece as well as the domestic regions of the Germans are particularly popular destinations.
DrV President Klaus Laepple explained in particular that vacation trips are high in the course.
In view of the rising costs of energy and food, the costs here are "more calculable for the customer than for the individual organized holiday".
Among other things, money could save consumers through early-book discounts or all-inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
Also the summer months had been very well booked, so a sales increase will again be recorded compared to the previous year - although according to another study the number of Germans who made a trip decreased compared to the previous year.
My first time Octoberfest
Ballermann-Apres-Ski-Hits in the endless loop, beer from liters-crugs and Celebrities in designer dirndln.
A Wiesn debut.
Susanne Kronzucker and I actually don't have much in common.
She is blond, television presenter and wears a customized dirndl.
I have dark hair, I am a student, and my dress is second hand.
But one thing connects us: Hardly three minutes on the meadow, the photographers fall on us and cut the memory cards completely - very flattering and this on my first visit to the meadow.
That's how you make friends.
The Cheap Dirndl seems to fulfill its purpose.
Located as a Wiesn-Touri and actually north of the White Wurstäquator, the feeling of well-being in the costume remained limited to date.
But first arrived at the Theresienwiese, everything is half as bad.
Almost everyone wears dirndl or leather pants; no one looks opposed or embarrassingly touched - everything completely normal.
Strange looks at the chocolate banana stand only reaps my dirndl apron.
A Munich woman reminds me that I'd wrongfully tied the abbreviation: "Links hoast free, middle virgin, right forgiven, back widowed."
I'm gonna take the loop from the back to the left.
"Befit," it said, laughing.
Others make less effort for subtle flirting techniques and carry simple felt hats on which "To drunk to get driven!" stands and stretches the naked back to an unsolicited person.
The young man with the exhibitionist attire is called Bob, comes from England and also visits the October festival for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a long "oooooo".
That's what he'll tell me after he's gotten rid of his previously drunk.
Right next to one of these hydrants, all of whom think he's a garbage dumper.
So Bob's one of those infamous "wildbieslers."
Others are not lucky to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At around eight o'clock in the evening, paramedics run across the festival square, which has to take care of the poor sluckers.
The nurses always appear in the pack - four at once tow a covered shoulder from tent to tent.
This works like with most Wiesn visitors: Empty down, full back.
Whoever is in the Promille Sarg is beneath the plane, you can't see.
"These are those who pack gornimmer," one of the paramedics called me on request and disappeared in the tumult.
Name of the victim of the accident announced by the police
The name of a 63-year-old female pedestrian who died in the hospital after she was hit by a vehicle in Essex was announced.
Carole Paulson, living in Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the Friday afternoon accident on Shenfield Road in the city center.
She was taken to Queen's hospital in Romford, but died later.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident because of the suspicion of frivolous driving.
In the meantime, he was released on bail.
Turkey expands the diplomatic horizon
Long before Turkey sought to join the European Union, the European powers were interested in penetrated deep into the hinterland of Turkey.
On the eastern side of the Bosporus, perhaps just 20 steps within Asia, stands one of the finest relics of this failed, imperial endeavor.
The Hydarpasha railway station was designed by the two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in Neo-Renaissance style.
That's at least what the guides tell you.
The building sits riding at the end of the platform with a tower at every corner of the front and thus looks like some provincial German town hall.
The rock is dirty.
The whole building is falling apart, for example.
But once you're inside the vaulted ticket desk, there's no doubt about the grandeur of the project, its western most accessible.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, Anatolia-Baghdad Society.
Germany, which was a funnel in the imperialist game, had to implement its ambitions to dominate the Middle East, by means of a train link to Damascus, Baghdad, and further beyond what is now Saudi Arabia.
But Germany's imperialist schemes paralysed during the first world war.
His railway tracks were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and its Arabs.
The relative isolation from its surrounding region, created by the insurmountable limits of the cold war, has disappeared.
British forces came out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria
And there was also bad news for the Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, a munitions train flew into the air, destroying the artistic roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly disintegrated, largely passing from history.
Nowadays, however, this railway line serves, at least symbolically, as a gateway to Anatolia and all east of it to highlight the expansion of the diplomatic horizon of Turkey.
The ruling judicial and development party, the ACP, has introduced a completely new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the neighbouring regions, generated by the borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
Now there is a policy of approach.
Remarkably, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian splitter groups Hamas and Fatah, with Iran and Iraq and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to assess the key elements of this new foreign policy, I have boarded the night train to Ankara, Turkey's capital, to visit one of the ACP's leading foreign policy experts, Mr Suat Kinikioglu.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours later, after a bumpy ride on tracks that produced the same step of the old world in the well-known documentation "The Night Mail", I arrived in the Turkish capital, which is considered a new city, for the new secular state project to turn my back on the Ottoman past.
However, the ACP, known for its Islamist roots, represents a paradigm shift in Turkish unity
This has caused some mistrust in the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi took me to the main office of the AKP, a specially made, state-of-the-art stone and steel construction, in a developing suburb surrounded by semi-finished shopping centers and pubs where middle managers met in suits, both men and women, to complete the first business of the day.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a middle-right politician of almost any other political party in Europe.
Suit, tie, I'm sure he even packed a blackberry.
"The aim of the party's foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey with its immediate neighbours.
The Cold War was an exception," he tells me.
Turkey had been cut off from its hinterland.
Nowadays, it has to look east and west at the same time.
There wouldn't be either one or the other.
She'd have to do both.
"But surely Turkey could at some point," I asked, "be forced to decide?"
"Turkey," he said, "didn't have to make this decision."
He then raised a point that almost everyone I was talking to almost routinely said: Turkey's relations, not only to the Middle East but also to the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, are just as beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, can, in the transferred sense, drive Europe as a whole on straight rails east towards Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha's train station, after another largely sleepless night, I thought of these two German rulers, Mr. Ritter and Mr. Conu, who had watched the construction of this building 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to learn that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East could now, to a large extent, be in the hands of Turkey.
And when I was waiting for the ferry that was to take me back over the Bosporus, I remembered that in those days Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe".
At that time, at least there seemed to be little doubt as to which continent should be entitled to this fascinating country.
In memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic and Choir "Tod" Handley.
As part of his music program for the city, he founded his great youth choir, Proteus, the following year.
He was intended for young people up to 21 years, but when the choir sang in 1979 for the last time some of us were already at the end of 20 - we simply refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological changer) stood for the willingness and ability of the choir to attack any piece of music that was presented to him, whether it was a Madrigal or from the Messiah, whether a capella or with full orchestra.
The musical versatility of such a young choir was often amazing, always exciting and existed only thanks to the inspiration of that man and his enthusiasm for the music that never followed for years.
How often did death stop us to "let the music speak for itself".
He used to say, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all in the music.
So sing it!"
His way of conducting was absolutely clear and precise, never hilarious but never excessive.
However high the musical level was, he always demanded an even higher level.

If any conductor should have been beaten to knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, where he led the Guildford Philharmonic.
In the last 40 years about I have written reviews for over a hundred of his concerts and I can sincerely say that I was never disappointed by any one - often I was inspired by them.
Death Handley was that rare combination of size and personal modesty.
He hated conductors who, according to his words, simply went home with one or two well-known horses in the world."
So many of us will miss him.

In your call for William Woodruff (September 25) you write that "in 1946 he took over the teaching of economic history in Oxford again and in 1950 received a Houblon Norman research scholarship ... while at the same time he studied for a BSc, a MA and a doctorate.
This is a conclusion from an author's remark in Woodruff's book "Beyond Nab End", however, it is not true.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a lecturer of economic history at the University of Nottingham and during that time he wrote a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers, who was later published in 1958 as "The British Rubber Industry".
He was in the United States in 1950-1951 in the course of a Houblon Norman scholarship and spent the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham and went to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff wanted to cover up this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philology.
'I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino 'Flamenco and Life' because his photographs are fantastic in black and white, in documentary style.
They drew my attention to them because of their simplicity and because of the power they radiate, how they always deal with the protagonists with respect.
An exhibition that shows many feelings.
Resino knows to find the magical moments."
Second round of the excellent sale at Honda.
In November Honda starts marketing the second generation of Honda Jazz.
While his predecessor model had a large interior, this large limousine offers a much larger size.
In addition, the technical subtleties also allow for even more comfortable driving and petrol saving.
Changes before the upcoming revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although, aesthetically speaking, the new jazz has a similar line to its predecessor, the changes that have been made to this major limousine are numerous.
Among other things, the innovative design, the new room flexibility, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanics are to be emphasized.
Nevertheless, before you begin to analyze the new model, you have to say that this new jazz appears six years later after the first generation appeared on the market.
According to the first observations, Honda managed to renew this model for a shorter period of time compared to the other manufacturers.
Although the Honda Jazz is less known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon as regards its sale in the other markets.
This is a case in Japan, in the country where jazz is the most sold car of the year 2002 and also during this year 2008.
After jazz appeared on the market, approximately one million models were sold in Japan alone.
The second market was the Old Continent, with about half a million cars sold in six years.
Nevertheless, Honda tries to increase the sale of the new jazz model within the segment.
In this way, while Japanese companies sold a total of 83 000 jazz models in 2007, the expected estimates amount to 10 000 cars, which is 17% of the expected growth on the European market.
As far as the Spanish market is concerned, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 jazz models since 2002, accounting for 6.7% of total sales at Honda in Spain.
As far as the new generation of the model is concerned, the leaders of the branch in Spain expect to be able to sell 2,000 jazz models a year.
More precisely, the appearance of the new Honda Jazz model allows to cover up the sales reduction in Spain.
In reality, the leaders of the brand hope to complete the year with a total sale of 22,000 models, which is 4,000 cars less than in 2007, a reduction of 16%.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain to 1.8% compared with the previous year.
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to reach 2% in 2010.
To achieve this proportion, Honda relies on the appearance of a new model.
It is Insight, a hybrid car with 5 doors and a compact size of 4.7 metres in length, the Japanese company hopes to sell around 200,000 models a year around the world.
According to the Japanese manufacturer's market estimates, 50% of Insight models are sold in the United States, while the remaining share is distributed on the Old Continent and Japan.
Insight on the market is scheduled for the first months of the year, and for the first time its public presentation will take place in Valencia in January.
With regard to the first generation, the new jazz grows in all its sizes.
Its length is 3.90 meters (plus 5 centimetres), its width is 1.69 meters (plus 2 centimetres), and the distance between the axes is 2.50 meters, leading to the assumption that it has grown to 5 centimetres.
The height, on the other hand, does not change and remains 1,52 meters.
Together with the increase in dimensions, the interior is also enlarged.
This success is due, on the one hand, to the new spatial flexibility programme and, on the other, to the central position of the fuel tank, a solution that was also used in the previous model of jazz.
The capacity of the trunk, which has a double loading surface system, also reaches up to 339 litres, i.e. 19 litres larger than the capacity of the first generation trunk.
It must be stressed that these measures are present in the version with a 1.4 litre petrol engine, because the capacity of the Honda Jazz trunk with a 1.2-litre petrol engine is 379 liters.
Among other improvements, other than the additional equipment elements such as leather seats or the possibility of installing panoramic windows, improved access to the seats is offered.
The opening angle of the back doors is 80 degrees, with the first jazz having only 67 degrees.
The engines of the second generation of jazz are also new.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model has 2 versions of the petrol engines: 1,2 and 1.4 liters.
Both variants have i-VTEC system, which allows low fuel consumption and lower CO2 emissions, has excellent technical performance and at the same time provides torque-strong power for the entire engine life.
The first variant with 1.2 liters achieves the power of 90 hp at 6,000 rotations with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4 900 min.1 .
This petrol engine - the previous model of jazz reached 78 hp - has 5.3 liters of petrol consumption and CO2 emissions of 125 grams.
With regard to the previous engine, which reached 83 hp in the previous generation, it now manages to reach 100 hp.
The Jazz 100 PS model 1.4 has 5.4 litres of petrol consumption and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.

In order to advance the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan was inspired by nature this time, more precisely, by bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot whose flight goes back to the swarming behaviour of bees and avoids accidents.
This robot is a Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C and represents the first step in accident prevention technologies.
The engineers from the technical development centre of Nissan Motor Co. have developed this small robot in cooperation with Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology of the renowned University of Tokyo (Japan).
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Head of Technology-PR and R&D-Brand Management, the BR23C is an extension of the four-layer Nissan safety sign.
This robot is designed to ensure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid collisions.
During the flight, each bee builds its own oval air space, which is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important are the facet eyes of the bee, which can see over a 300 degree angle in all directions, which allows them to fly in their personal airspace without interruption.
To replicate the all-round perspective, the technicians developed the so-called Laser Range Finder (LRF).
It notices obstacles in front of the BR23C at a distance of up to two meters and in the radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to a board's microprocessor, which is directly translated into a signal for avoiding collision
`In the moment that obstacle is noticed, the little robot will imitate the bee flight and immediately change direction by turning its wheels around 90o or even larger angles to avoid the collision.
The biggest difference with other systems is that this elusive maneuver is absolutely instinctive.
If it were not, the robot could not be able to react with sufficient speed to avoid obstacles,' explains Toshyuki Andoh, the director of the mobility laboratory and the executive engineer of this project.
In contrast to a bee, the robot can not deviate up or down, but also not overeck; it can only move on two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to turn its wheels and not in the infinite directions and in infinite ways as the bees do.
For this reason, Nissan has used the rotation function in addition to acceleration and deceleration functions so that the small robot avoids collisions.
This device only needs to process the information for a few seconds and act on the basis of this information.
It does not require either the information or intuitive logic of the maneuvers done, so it can work continuously with only a few dozen KB of the storage space.
That sounds surprising, but it's not about the GBs and not even about the MBs of the storage space.
This is the first step in the development of technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan predicts over the next ten years with the serial cars.
The robot works with lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and longer than the diversity of lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system by satellite, in order to lead to the goal while driving and to avoid the obstacles on the road.
She's shaking before she's charged with a mortgage.
It must be recognized that the US Ministry of Finance, except that it has sufficient liquidity to provide the support, is not without skill.
Before the crisis and in order to prevent US citizens from being involved in mortgage stories of the supposedly paying banks, an entertaining and informative game has been developed for Internet surfers: 'Bad Credit Hotel', it says.
Or maybe, the 'hotel of bad loans' or the mess.
The third aspect of this accommodation and especially his receptionist is to think one, two and up to three times, whether it is the moment not to ask for credit.
And especially where you can do it, which is probably the goal of the game.
She certainly has useful information, but without details.
This is more of a side for teenagers than a place for all spectators.
What will happen when the game is extended?
Well, when a dreamy room appears at the hotel.
At least something, because it's not about buying a better house.
Morgan Stanley makes its capital available to MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) into its company, which would be the first bank in Japan to spend $9 billion and thus take over 21% of its capital, a innovation due to a strong fall in its stock exchange price.
A week after a preliminary agreement was made public, the two banks declared that MUFG will buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's common share at a uniform price of $25.25, resulting in a total of three billion dollars.
The assumed price is below 19% of the stock's price of 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional six billion dollars in the acquisition of convertible shares, which will secure a profit of 10% and can be resold at a price of 31.25 dollars.
Morgan Stanley stated that the global business will be carried out on the basis of a single average price of 29 dollars, i.e. 28 % above the current price value.
However, the Morgan Stanley share decreased by 6.79% to 23.07 dollars at 17.00 GMT.
"This strategic link represents an important opportunity to accelerate the transition from Morgan Stanley to the status of a holding bank," said John Mack, Director General of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley took on this status last week, which should enable him to expand their business to new areas, but under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.
Their connection with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces the biggest names of Wall Street to take a much more cautious attitude than before.
The arrangements presented on Monday also show that the agreement has changed over the last few days: Last Monday Morgan had simply declared that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to Japan for about 8.5 billion dollars.
"A week ago," said Toshhide Mizuno, CEO of MUFG, in Tokyo, "we thought that the stake would consist entirely of common shares.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and secure ourselves.'
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay 7% below its price for its Morgan Stanley shares.
And the business will start with a reduction in profits by about 20% per share.
The agreement provides that in one year, MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential shares into common shares if the latter are exchanged more than 50% above the sales value within a given period, i.e. approximately 47 dollars.
Morgan Stanley assures that the funds supplied by MUFG will allow him to use investment opportunities, to strengthen their balance sheet and to increase their sales.
However, a Group press spokesperson refused to provide more detailed information on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley should be able to record a debt ratio of about 15%, one of the best in this sector.
Morgan explained that he had 'clearly' reduced his balance since the end of August.
The last few weeks were hard for the group that had to look at how their stock exchange rate dropped by half, while the price of insurance against inability to pay increased.
This price decreased on Monday, but remained at a high level, at about 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only other 'survivor' of the great investment banks on Wall Street after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced last week, 15 billion dollars, partly at Berkshire Hathaway, the group of Warren Buffett.
Rafael Correa this Monday in Quito.
The Republic around 21st century socialism is re-founding.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morale and Equatorial Correa.
That was the third person who put the plan of a new constitution to the vote this Sunday, following the example of his like-minded friends and friends.
According to the public results of 80% of the votes cast, 64% voted for 'Yes' in the referendum.
According to these results, 28% voted in favour of 'No', 7% were invalid and 0.7% were empty.
For the Constitutional Project to be adopted, more than half of the votes cast must be cast.
On Sunday, two polls carried out at the polls’ exits and a census of a non-governmental organization announced a clear victory for 'yes', and he prophesied 63% to 70%.
In the night from Sunday to Monday, Rafael Correa demanded the victory of his constitutional project.
The 'constitution triumphantly triumphed', he had assured in Guayaquil, the seat of the government 280 kilometers southwest of Quito, and congratulated the Equatorials.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales, but also by his Chilean like-minded Michelle Bachelet.
The election, which was held in silence in accordance with the monitoring delegation of the Organization of the American States (OAS), referred to a text consisting of 444 points to ensure 'new socialism', for which the President is advocating.
The constitutional project transfers the power of state to the economy by leaving it with the sole right to 'development planning' in a country which lives largely from the promotion of oil by foreign companies and foreign exchange companies, which send out displaced persons to the country.
The project, driven by the Correa elected in 2006, will also grant the Head of State more comprehensive power which will be able to exercise up to two successive mandates of four years each and will have the opportunity to terminate the National Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will make use of this power and seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also ensures the principle of free medical care and education, which the President has already begun to introduce in this country with 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population live below the poverty line.
Finally, it also intends to prohibit the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington on the use of an equatorian base as the starting point for American anti-drug operations.
The 19 hostages were released in Chad
An Egyptian command began the attack on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions who had been captured ten days ago.
You're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions who were held captive in the desert for eleven days were brought back to the Egyptian capital this Monday, healthy and undamaged.
In the morning they had been freed from an Egyptian command in Chad.
Apparently in good condition, the hostages reached the military base al-Maza right next to Cairo International Airport at about 3.30 p.m. on board a special aircraft.
They were brought directly to the hospital of Maadi, an alien neighborhood of Cairo, on board a helicopter without being able to talk to the press to be investigated.
They enjoy all the 'best health' and the kidnappers 'no ransom was paid', said Egyptian tourism minister Zoheir Garanna on the rollfield.
After being captured on September 19 at a landcar safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat in the border area of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, the group of hostages was repeatedly taken by 35 unknown kidnappers from one hiding place to the next.
These are eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and eight Egyptians: two leaders, four chauffeurs, one border guard and the director of the agency Aegyptus, organizers of Safari.
One Egyptian security officer stated that 30 members of the special units, on board two helicopters, launched the attack at night, just before dawn.
"On both sides, shots fell and half of the kidnappers were killed, the rest fled," said this responsible person who wants to remain anonymous.
He stated that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special units had been sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commands.
The head of the Italian diplomats Franco Frattini reported from Belgrade, where he is now, about the role that secret agents and elements of the Italian special units have played.
"We must acknowledge that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and performance of our men from the intelligence service and from the special units," he explained without further detail.
He also denied that a ransom had been paid.
On the eve of the night, the Sudanese army had claimed to have stopped a ground vehicle in a patrol, where the kidnappers were, of which they killed six, including the leader from Chad, and two arrests.
The army declared that they were in contact with a rebel group from Darfour, the Liberation du Soudan-Unité (SLA-U), which, however, immediately disputed this movement.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture makes headlines and is central to the current election campaign.
That's all the better.
But an area of our cultural life remains forgotten.
Who will rise and condemn the pitiful sums that are granted to the small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical places that are likely to starve?
What politician will dare remind the Federal Government that it is neglecting its monuments and its culturally significant buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, there are no right laws that effectively protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French Government only provides EUR 3.5 million for the restoration of Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
With our American neighbours, the constitution of their country states that the protection of the cultural heritage belongs to the culture of the American, and that this cultural heritage must be protected by all citizens, all Members of Parliament and all districts of government, in mutual agreement.
In Quebec, in the association of the historical societies of Quebec, at least 40,000 volunteers gathered in 211 historical societies are working hard to get involved in history, to save the numerous private archives with a few groceries, and to preserve the archaeological remains.
They are also often the watchdogs of our cultural heritage that protest with the power of despair when promoters and decision-makers release their bulldozers to our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will there be a stage for history and cultural heritage?
Benelux governments government parts of Fortis Bank
With a partial nationalisation, the Benelux countries want to take advantage of the Belgian-Dutch Fortis Bank, which is in turbulence as a result of the US financial crisis: the three states provide a total of EUR 11.2 billion to the Bank and Insurance Institute, which also has offices in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands discussed the weekend at the highest level, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the Commissioner of the Competition Authority of the European Commission.
In the euro area, the Fortis is the first victim of the international financial market crisis that has been ongoing for a year, so decisions that are now being taken in connection with the Bank could be precedent.
For the purpose of the decision taken on Sunday night, all three countries buy the respective shares of the bank at about 49 percent.
The bank will probably sell part of its holdings, above all the insurance activities purchased by the Dutch ABN Amro last year.
Last week, the shares of the Fortis started a steep valley trip, and in the second half of the week serious crisis scenarios were already emerging.
However, analysts agree that the bank with its 85,000 employees is far too big for a record.
The securities of the institute fell 12% to a 14-year low on Friday.
Since January, the value of the shares has dropped by more than two thirds.
In view of the current stock prices, the Group's market value amounts to EUR 14 billion, which, according to the management, is unrealistic.
According to the management, the USD 700 billion US rescue package and the uncertainty in the markets caused by it are the fault of the Fortis shares.
On Monday, however, the courses rose slightly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed the new Director-General of the Bank.
The money institution was also looking for a private buyer, but it did not find any interested person with a factual offer.
However, the Belgian government was trying to calm down - no investor should tremble for his money, it was said.
There has so far been no panic among customers, the bank's branches have not been stormed.
In Hungary, the Fortis has independent branches, but it also calls leasing companies its own.
Fuchs in the chicken barn
Because of the drug use of a person, life insurance and health insurance in America often refuse to conclude a contract with a customer.
Data protection experts fear that the data market could become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programs that link the use of the drug data in any case to the consent of the data subject.
These should be in independent hands, otherwise we entrust the chickens to the fox" - quotes Washington Post Richard Dick, developer of the program for tracking prescription data.
Insurance shall determine the fees and payment amounts in case of damage, depending on the health status of the customer, and should the risk be overestimated, the insurance will not be completed at all.
In the past, the customer was sent to a medical examination and the contract was only concluded in knowledge of the results of the investigation.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a much cheaper method: Based on the customer's identification number, he draws the data of the last one and a half years from the pharmacies, which means which preparations were bought, and the program calculates the illness of the customer and what his health is like.
For example, when he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol-decreasing drugs, it can be concluded that his blood fat levels are untreatedly high, which would automatically turn him into a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the program in circulation - some even define a risk multiplier, so the insurances only have to handle the paperwork more, but there are smaller difficulties.
One of the disadvantages is that many medications can be taken for different purposes, such as migraine and heat walls, as well as depression.
The latter is a high-risk factor from the insurer's point of view, while the aforementioned do not.
For the purpose of querying and processing the data, own companies have formed which, before obtaining the data, ask the patient for his consent.
They now have to do this by law, although omissions have not yet been made.
Some companies even process the results of laboratory investigations and link them to the data on drug use. This gives them an even more accurate picture of the health status of the patients.
More and more companies have access to the data, and the control of their use is becoming more difficult at the same time.
While there is a separate data protection law for health data, its effect is limited only to health sector providers and insurance companies.
The draft law has already been submitted to the Congress, according to which the authorities could also control the data processing companies.
Dick Richard sees that this is too little, so he wants to develop his program so that the data can only be passed on with the consent of the data subject.
Another question, of course, is that the data subject may hardly be able to prevent access to his data, as the insurance companies do not otherwise conclude a contract with him.
And so the chickens are only somehow left to the grace of fox.
Global Food Plan from Marseilles
European Union and India doubling trade
After the European Union and India are each other's leading trading partners, this was the main topic in addition to other global problems at the ninth summit.
Today, the French-Indian Summit is also taking place, where cooperation in the nuclear energy sector is mainly discussed.
While the European Union recognises that India is an emerging, democratic great power, which should be given more votes and participation in international matters, the Member States have not yet been able to agree whether or not to support the permanent membership of New Delhi in the UN Security Council.
This issue was not discussed at the ninth meeting yesterday in Marseille.
The French President and current EU President-in-Office Nicolas Sarkozy and Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Chief Diplomat Javier Solana received the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. An agreement was reached to double trade over the next five years, i.e. to increase to just over EUR 100 billion.
Given that the exchange of goods had increased from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this objective is not even so ambitious.
In this respect, the 26 existing civil aviation agreements with India have also been legally incorporated into an agreement to enable air transport to be promoted in the future.
By 2009, India intends to sign the Free Trade Agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the pact.
The objective is to achieve a balance in the current imbalance between the EU and India: while the Union is the partner's number one India, New Delhi is only 9th among the EU partners.
The summit was devoted to global concerns.
Among them was the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, or terrorism, which both sides strongly condemned. The convocation of a UN conference was also engendered.
The Doha Round should also be completed, with both sides to blame for its failure.
The EU stressed its commitment to its energy and climate programme, i.e. to reduce pollutant emissions by at least 20% by 2020.
This was also accepted by India, as well as by the proposal to make a kind of global compromise at the forthcoming climate summit and to reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 percent by 2050.
Food prices should also be combated, so both support the convening of an international conference on the issue of financial crisis.
The Indian head of government is visiting the French capital today, where he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, however, orders to French companies worth EUR 20 billion for the construction of nuclear reactors in India are hoped.
According to the Agency, the agreement is to be decided at 15 years.
Over 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the International Frankfurt Book Fair.
Over 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th Book Fair, the most important international event for the acquisition of rights.
The international Frankfurt Book Fair awaits more than 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries for the current event. They will spread over 171.790 square meters of the fair and present more than 403,000 titles. Turkey will be the guest of honour of the event.
The Under-Secretary for the Ministry of Cultural Goods and Cultural Activities Maria Giro will represent the Italian Government during the opening ceremony in the exhibition hall: Italy will be represented by the 264 m2 exhibition space "Punto Italia".
This will be followed by a press conference close to the Room Structure in the exhibition hall 5.0 of the Book Fair: on this occasion figures, trends and perspectives about the publishing industry in Italy will be discussed.
According to the data, the importance of books by foreign writers is declining throughout the whole, but especially in the adult and youth sector.
The billionaire Steve Fossett's small aircraft disappeared a year ago
Steve Fossett's small plane, which disappeared on September 3, 2007 on a flight over the desert of Nevada, was discovered.
The items have been found on a high plateau of 3000 m altitude, in the area of the Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes between the states of California and Nevada.
However, no human remains were found inside the plane.
The sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, completely dispeled the last doubts during a press conference: "The plane has been localized, whereupon a force has been sent out. Now we are confident that it is the plane that Steve Fossett flew on the day of his disappearance."
Mr. Anderson also confirmed that no human remains were found on the plane or its proximity.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Road Safety Office (NTSB) noted that a crew had been sent out just a few hours after the aircraft was sighted, identifying the machine: it was the Bellanca 8kcab, which was lost on September 3, 2007, after Fossett had launched a three-hour flight in Yerington, Nevada.
Yesterday, also in California, near the border with Nevada, some of Fossett's personal items were found by a couple near her home on Mammoth Lakes.
These are two cards with the name Fossetts, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a jacket.
The search for Fossett had been abandoned one month after its disappearance.
The billionaire had conquered a place in history through a long series of records.
In 2002 he succeeded in the sixth run, when the first person to circle the world ball in a hot air balloon: a two-week, lonely flight.
Three years later, he flew around the world in a single flight without a port of call with an airplane.
Among his numerous records is also an altitude flight of 15445 m above the Andes, but this one with a co-pilot.
glk, the advertising you don't expect
A suv that falls from the traditional schemata due to its original design and the special lines, the widening surface and its clear angles.
Mercedes-Benz has tried with this offroder to breathe the sector new breath.
Due to its exceptional characteristics, the Suv Gulk performance will also be unconventional, which will be shown in the Mercedes-Benz showroom from October 17th.
The advertising drum, which will accompany the appearance of the new model, will also appear in a new dress, namely in the form of a 3D campaign – this will be a new feature in the car sector in the backward Italy.
A project with a maximum effort to be carried out in different phases, which will take the central shopping mile of Milan, the Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase will consist of the presentation of the car in form, whereby 3D glasses distributed near the Corso Como will give the whole a special look: the new Suv will appear in its almost real dimensions as a three-dimensional model.
In fact, the car will seem to emerge from the poster on which it is depicted.
Then, with the help of the Elumina8 technology, the new glk is illuminated in all its details at different moments, in order to put it together again as a whole.
There is no doubt that Mercedes' concern with this advertising is to introduce a new type of autoclams into this rather stereotyped field.
But will it succeed to arouse the interest of future buyers? We will see it.
Now it is clear who the Italian Hooligans are
They come from the Triveneto – now they risk bans on stadiums
Who are only these 150-200 boys and girls, for whom all of Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia", which has been travelling after years of the Italian national team and which, honestly, until recently did not cause any serious problems.
Never before have there been clashes with opposing fans.
The origin of the group is in the right environment.
The sponsors come from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
Other smaller groups from Campania and Puglia were found in Sofia.
They carry the Tricolori, on which the cities of the militants appear: but they were removed on Saturday to avoid identification.
Their models are the English fans.
In Bulgaria, there was now a collision with a truly right-wing fan scene, that of Levski.
From the Figc the Italian fans had been provided 144 cards for the game: all were issued by name and thus easy to control.
In fact, they were all controlled by the Viminal: among those who traveled to Sofia, no one was under a ban on the stadium.
Four fans of the Italian team who were already pre-taxed in this respect were refused the ticket and the trip to Bulgaria.
Now the Viminal is waiting for the reports of the Bulgarian police to take further steps: in this case the arrested or in the outcrop identified Tifosi can expect a stadium ban of at least five years.
This is an international ban which prevents access to the stadiums across Europe.
So our Hooligans won't set foot in a stadium anymore.
Thank God.
But now, of course, there is fear of imitations who could follow this little more than 150.
"This fire must be immediately removed, and it will not give such a behaviour the possibility to justify it," says the Viminal.
That's why, "Eyes to especially with a view to the game of the national team on Wednesday in Lecce."
Indeed, there is a small core of the Italian ultras in Puglia.
Tomorrow, the Osservatorio (Sport Supervision) gathers on Tuesday the Cassms, which can count on part of the Aise, i.e. the intelligence services dealing with the problem of stadium violence.
"Duce-Duce calls and the raised right arm during the anthem of Mameli? In Bulgaria this is not a crime..."
This is the idea of Domenico Mazzilli (expressed without joy) who has been the director of the Osservatorio on the Viminal for a few weeks (he took over the post of Francensco Tagliente and Felice Ferlizzi).
Previously, Mazzilli was the police president of Trieste, where a core of supporters of Ultras Italia, founded in 2002.
It is true, says Mazzilli, that in Bulgaria it is not against the law to praise the Duce, but undoubtedly the behaviour of these 150-200 people was a shame.
"I am not a sociologist – add the No. 1 of the Osservatorio – crimes are committed in the country of their deed.
So far, this group had kept to itself, but now it has to be considered what has happened and will happen.
But we also talk about the whistles during the anthem Mamelis: even this is not a crime, but they allow me, because the education is missing ...".
