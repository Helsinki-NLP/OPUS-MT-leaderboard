A Republican strategy to counter Obama's re-election
The leaders of Republicans justify their policies with the need to combat election fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter to be a myth, confirming that the election fraud in the US is rarer than the number of people killed by lightning.
By the way, Republican lawyers have recorded only 300 cases of election fraud in the United States in 10 years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on electoral participation.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the US democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the US states are responsible for conducting the elections in the individual states.
In this sense, since 2009, the majority of American governments have announced new laws that make it difficult to register or pass urns.
This phenomenon has gained importance after the November 2010 elections, in which 675 new Republican representatives could be recorded in 26 states.
As a result, 180 draft laws were introduced in 2011 alone, restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to present a photo identification and proof of US citizenship.
In addition, these laws also shorten the periods for early voting, the right to register as voters on the election day, and the right of citizens to vote for which a court act exists.
Before the 2006 elections, no U.S. state required the voters to show a photo identification.
Indiana was the first state to claim such a claim.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed the constitutionality of the law of Indiana in 2008.
The Republican authorities rushed to extend this practice to other states.
Over the last two years, in 34 states, they have promoted draft laws to force voters to show a photo ID card.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, the US citizens do not have a universal ID card such as the health insurance card.
Indeed, 11% of US citizens, 21 million eligible persons, do not have a photo identification issued by a government authority of their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such an ID card.
However, often more than a hundred dollars are to be paid to obtain the necessary ID card.
Young people, minorities and low-income people are disproportionately affected by the new restrictions.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over 65 years and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years do not have the necessary photo identification.
This is enough.
Students who are considered to be voters who increasingly vote for democratic candidates are not allowed to use their photo identification issued by their institution in several countries.
On the other hand, the same States allow members of fishing or hunting associations to choose more strongly for the Republican side to use the maps issued by those associations for elections.
Before 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to be elected.
Arizona was the first state to introduce such a claim.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove their US citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting hypanic votes.
For it is obvious that two of three Hispanic voters prefer the democratic party.
In addition, Republican legislators in 2011 promoted laws in eight states that abolished the registration of voters on election day.
In addition, you have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to those voters who wish to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, campaigns to register voters in the 2004 general elections have contributed to the registration of approximately 10 million citizens.
Because the measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the share of registration of new voters in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.
In addition, the Republican legislators have passed laws in five other states aimed at shortening the period for early voting.
For example, in the 2008 general elections in Florida, 33% of the voters who voted in advance were African Americans, although they were only 13% of the voters of the state.
The same applies to the Hispanic population.
The latter accounted for only 11% of the voters, but 24% of the citizens who voted in advance.
In contrast, the whites, which represented 76% of the voters, accounted for only 46% of the voters who voted in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their followers have strongly opposed the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
Several draft laws were blocked by the Vetos of democratic governors.
The U.S. Advocate General has intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID.
However, the new rules introduced in 2012 will undoubtedly make the exercise of the right to vote difficult.
The democratic critics condemn the party-political nature of the passed laws and see in them as a clear objective the influence of the results in the countries that are determining the outcome for 2012.
A 2011 report by the Brennan Center shows that those States that have passed these laws make up 171 of the 270 votes required by the Electoral Board to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these changes in the electoral system legislation will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on electoral participation.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the US democratic system.
Prostate cancer early detection: should the test be done or not?
In fact, the PSA test has sometimes shown faulty results, with false negative or false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to greater hesitation of the men who have already decided to carry out early detection tests.
Should the test be done or not?
We have obtained the opinion of two specialists.
The studies carried out in the USA have had a number of disturbances between the control groups, making it difficult to interpret these data and make clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, concluded that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without early detection.
This study has also shown that in follow-up to 12 years, the probability of metastasis formation is 30% to 40% higher if no early detection has been performed.
That is why I recommend the test from the age of 50 or 40 years, if you have a direct relative who was already suffering from prostate cancer.
There is also a higher risk for men of African-American origin.
The most important thing is to make the right decision once cancer has been detected.
There are cancers that are aggressive and others that are indolent.
The patient needs to understand the extent of the risk of his cancer by showing him the possible options in which prostate cancers can remain untreated if he does not affect the quality of life in the long term, and in these cases he chooses to actively monitor the disease.
Today, there is no treatment for many men who have been diagnosed with cancer, since their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to their lives.
They are proposed to be actively monitored and offered treatment as the disease progresses.
It is increasingly accurate to determine the criteria for deciding who should be treated and who should not.
That's why I still recommend carrying out the test.
The most important thing, however, is to talk to his doctor to determine whether he should be performed or not.
In cooperation with the international society for urology, Movember has developed an instrument to assess the advantages and disadvantages of the PSA test.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure to prevent cancer.
Despite the advances in research, the adoption of a healthy way of life remains the best way to reduce the risk of his illness.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if everyone ate well and moved sufficiently.
"If there were no more smokers, this value would increase to at least 50%," says André Beaulieu, spokesperson of the Canadian cancer society.
However, about 10% of cancers are expected to be caused by inheritance.
Several also remain completely unexplained.
The fight against tobacco dependence remains a priority for the Canadian cancer society, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several other cancers.
It greatly damages people's health.
"Today there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," laments the speaker André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after leaving the cigarette, the risk of dying cancer is reduced by half.
Weight
According to the Canadian cancer society, overweight and obesity also promote the outbreak of the disease.
They seem to increase the risk of breast, intestinal, gastrointestinal, esophagus, pancreas and uterine cancer.
"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against gastrointestinal cancer," he adds.
The diet
The organization also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too large a amount, it increases the risk of developing a Grimm or mast cancer.
Wheat products should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage the body cells and lead to the development of cancer," he explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have investigated the relationship between vitamin additives and cancer.
However, their investigations are not at present inconclusive.
According to the Canadian cancer society, vitamin E studies are contradictory.
While one study found out the reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another was more likely to increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been clearly demonstrated.
Mr Beaulieu also stressed the importance of talking to his doctor about his concerns and his family predicament.
"The carrying out of an early detection test does not lead to cancer."
Higgs boson analyzed
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson has aroused some attention last summer, and this for good reason.
In fact, it is believed that this boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And finally, it is the last particle whose existence was predicted by the standard model - our best or " least false" explanation of nature and the behavior of matter - but has not yet been observed empirically.
But for the physicists it is not yet completely certain that it is really the Higgs.
We know without the shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particle, and that it is very similar to the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, this seems to be confirmed by new data presented this week at a large physics congress in Kyoto, but there is still no data to be absolutely sure about it.
Still, let's assume that it's actually the Higgs, as there seems to be only a small risk of being deceived, and let's look at what's going on.
There is an indispensable law in this world that makes two objects cannot be present at the same time in the same place.
It is not possible to violate this rule - and do not try it too hard, as you are getting hurt.
For even if particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that such a law also applies to them: the Pauli exclusion principle, which means that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time when they are in the same "quantity state", where this "state" consists largely of some of their properties.
Based on this, the physicists divide the particles into two categories.
In a corner are the good citizens, who are called Fermione, who obey the Pauli principle.
And in the other, the Bosons, an evil band of anarchists who are not sacred - certainly not this principle, which means that they can indeed be in the same place at the same time.
According to the website The Particle Adventure, these bosons are divided into two groups by the Berkeley laboratories (which, by the way, is absolutely amazing): the mesons that we will not treat here and the "particles" through which the great forces of nature spread and with which the Higgs boson would somehow be related.
But it must be stressed here that these bosons are not all so exotic creatures as one could think.
If you are able to read this chronicle, then only thanks to a bosons of exceptional banality: the photon or the "light particle" which is the "bote" of electromagnetic force.
In fact, if a particle accelerates with an electric charge or changes the direction, the electromagnetic field is "disturbed" at this point, about like a pebble that was thrown into a pond.
This "interference" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon and thus one of the bosons "carriers of power".
More Stable Field
The same applies to the Higgs boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, must be "disturbed" so that this boson shows up.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen must achieve very high energies, a little comparable to a frozen pond, whose surface could only be crushed by a very large rock.
Therefore, a huge particle accelerator like the CERN is necessary - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a size of 27 km! - to achieve such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again helpful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, they are not all particles and not all materials interacting with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but others do not - for example, a sheet of paper would never automatically keep to the refrigerator.
And likewise, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do have a mass, while the others (like the photon) have no mass.
What can all these research be "good" for now, asks Mrs Plamondon?
For science they are used to review the standard model (SM), and they also enable physicists to examine in detail all deviations between the observations and the predictions of the SM.
There are by the way numerous physicists who eagerly hope that such deviations will be found, as the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and plug some holes of the model.
One has to say that the latter still has great shortcomings, as it does not explain the gravity (ups!) and the dark matter that forms about 80% of the matter of the universe (again ups!).
However, such deviations have not been found in the CERN.
Impact
The impact of these research on the general population is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there is no such thing.
By the way: in the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in the Bell labs did not suspect that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in the 1960s, and who himself developed the first permanent laser (the first were pulsed) in 1962 - has already told us that the laser was initially regarded as rather a "laboratory".
Imagine...
In addition, applications can also come from all the instruments surrounding research.
Willard Boyle, for example, developed a small light sensor during his works in optics in 1969.
Although it was not the original purpose, today this sensor serves all digital cameras worldwide as an "eye" and brought him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily change our lives, but it means that you can never really know...
Palliative care - the best way to die...  Roger Le Devoir
Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life with its "Death in Dignity" committee.
The debate must be resumed soon, although a draft law is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this important area.
Le Devoir has tried to take a closer look at this.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that devoured him had left him a two-year period.
"They gave me five years to live, I made seven years," he said half-heartedly, lying in his bed in the house for palliative care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he had arrived the day before.
"However, it's always a shock, you can't be prepared for it," he says.
The disease does its work: an immense weakness prevents him from going to the toilet alone and even eating himself.
Sitting at the table in front of a delicious lunch, he agrees to let himself be helped with food.
Courageously, he even manages to smile and talk to the strangers who are busy around him, bring him his medications, and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is to cure my diarrhoea, as this is humiliating," he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
"In the course of our life, we learn that a man is pinking in the face," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at Victor-Gadbois' home.
To return to childhood is an unacceptable humiliation for certain people.
"This depends on the person's ability to take a step back, he notes.
In the view of several people who work in palliative care, great events take place in the midst of these steps.
The patients who are sent to the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois all suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, doctors and nurses who take care of them will no longer be overcrowded with so-called "healing" care.
For Mrs. A., 89 years, the worst fear is to die "consciously and by suffocation".
But because of the illness, I really got to know my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I don't have any more wishes in life," she says before she accepts that she is put on a mask that helps her breathe.
In the next few days, she is still expecting a last visit from her son, who comes from Italy.
In the home Victor-Gadbois is offered with a group of volunteers personal care and assistance in food intake.
The palliative care is used when there are no other possibilities.
To make dying more pleasant.
In Quebec there is a bed for palliative care on 11,700 inhabitants.
That's very little when you take into account that one day we'll all die.
Here, life is continued under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
Depending on the desire of the deceased, one grants a mouth care with Brandy or Pepsi.
Diabetics no longer need to control their blood sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served Mr. X a beer that died during the night.
This morning his son will drink the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help family members and patients alike," reports Nathalie Savard, Director of Care.
At home Victor-Gadbois is not a day like the other one.
In addition to an old man of 93 years who enjoys the last family meeting in the yard and is well supported by his pillows, while one finds himself in honor, a young man of 36 years who is surrounded by his parents, his wife, and his two little children dies in a tragic way after he has tried everything to survive.
"For six months, three to five beds have always been filled with cancer patients under the age of 45," Dr. Christiane Martel says alarmedly.
53% of patients sent to the home of Victor-Gadbois come from their home, 47% coming from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care that should relieve the suffering of patients when the latter have reached the end stage of their lives, both at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the home Victor-Gadbois and the home palliative care company in Greater Montreal, specialize more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely this major inadequacy in the health care of Quebec that makes sure that several doctors specialising in palliative care look forward to the adoption of a law on the regulation of death and assisted suicide with concerns.
Since October, a manifesto has been in circulation, signed by prominent palliatives such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec's health system is not efficient enough to ensure that all rights to high quality palliative care are maintained before you accept to go to death.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who was in the emergency room for 14 days with great pain, without taking measures to ease her.
I fear that patients will only die because they do not receive adequate health care.
And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients in spite of worst predictions by the last day.
Hélène Richard's chances of survival were minimal when she broke down a difficult chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was going to stop the treatment, she replied to me that she was sorry I gave up the fight, she told me.
However, she had told me that I was at the end!
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who have asked to die thank the nurses for not accepting this wish after their pain has been eased by a team of palliative care.
However, it must be clearly stated that palliative care in pain treatment is not omnipotent.
According to Elsie Monereau, head of palliative care of the community of home palliative care in Greater Montreal, 8% of patients do not respond to pain treatment.
Thus, at the end of life, the doctors often resort to the terminal sedation, which is intended to sleep in the patient either sporadically or permanently until the time of his death.
We can't do it any longer than we can't see this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief will increasingly have the opportunity to resort to this terminal sedation.
Patients whose pain is not relieved all say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that does not necessarily mean, "I want you to put me to sleep", but "I want my pain to be eased."
The implementation of this report was possible due to a scholarship from Canadian health research institutes.
Real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials of the Road Construction Office, the main construction company, policy-makers and specialists of the Italian Mafia tell us every day what they know about a great "system" in which construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso are ensnared.
An industry that was very expensive for Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It is strange how the system has been disintegrated since drastic measures have been taken," says Jacques Duchesneau, Quebec MP and former head of Montreal Police.
The scandal was revealed by him as a result of an in-depth investigation of the confusion in connection with the road construction contracts in Quebec, which the then Prime Minister had reluctantly agreed to.
The "Duchesneau Report" established a direct connection between industry, secret financing of parties and bribery of officials.
"Since the start of the investigation in 2010, he emphasises that "the Ministry of Transport alone saved a billion dollars in the contracts," because some of them shirked their instincts to get their share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought down two mayors", he adds, hoping that it will succeed in "showing the tactics behind the individuals".
A permanent unit of anticorruption launched in 2011
The permanent anti-corruption unit set up in 2011 is also making great efforts with its troops on accountants, investigation and analysts of the government.
In addition, the "Marteau-Truppe" police, which has caused the Montreal "channelization cartel" since 2009, are more reticent in the artificial inflatation of the contracts...
In the last few weeks, she has carried out a series of house searches and has made accusations of fraud and corruption against municipal agents such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, who is the mayor of a suburb.
The next one on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his office as mayor of Laval, the third largest city in Quebec.
He is suspected of having repeatedly accepted lubrication fees in exchange for public contracts.
By the way, engineers of the Montreal Road Construction Office, as well as entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambia, were specifically charged.
The latter aroused attention by declaring to the Commission the functioning of the "system" for the receipt of public contracts.
For several years he himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal to an intermediary associated with the Mafia, who transferred the money to the Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
In the 2000s, Mr. Zambia had his hand at stake everywhere, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (approx. 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to those then in power.
He also admitted to have organised an illegal procurement of funds for former liberal vice-president Nathalie Normandeau.
Channelling contracts whose costs have been artificially bloated by it
In Montreal the "system" of corruption worked smoothly.
Former construction engineer Gilles Surprenant described this in detail before the Commission: in ten years he received gifts from the construction company, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as bribes of $736,000 in return for sewerage contracts, which he artificially inflated.
Other officials of the Road Construction Office admitted that they could be lubricationd by artificially blowing up the bills with false additional services by 30-40%.
In addition, an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr Tremblay of deliberately looking beyond a shadow budget that filled his cash registers with black money.
As a result of these revelations, Mr Tremblay resigned at the beginning of November, which caused Montreal to fall into a serious crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first members of Montreal to strike the alarm.
As mayor of the district of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, from 2010 onwards, she objected to the sale of a municipal property that was purchased for 5 million dollars and sold to 1.6 million builders in the booming real estate market.
70% Black money in the election campaigns
From the investigation, which is ultimately carried out, she says that "it pulls on a thread that allows it to understand the functioning of the system of ants that is under way to stop the evil and to condemn the guilty".
She says that the procedure is "painful, but positive."
However, we are in the process of cleaning the wound, but we need an investigation unit only for Montreal, as well as supervision to prevent the return of questionable practices.
How to clean up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, notes that "officials have stolen several hundred million dollars", but above all, they are concerned about the role of the "mandate carriers who are in the picture about tactics" if they were not involved in fraud!
Based on a 70% share of black money in financing the campaign in Quebec, he jokes: "I was told that this is only a weak waste of reality."
The Quebec Government proposes limiting the donations to 100 dollars, which it believes would not change the situation: "As long as election expenditure is not strictly limited, black money will be in circulation in politics."
He recommends a complete revision of the public procurement system and the financing of the parties: "We cannot fall deeper; by working with courage on things, we can rebuild the house on a more solid basis with more controls and laws."
If this story damages Quebec's international reputation and Montreal's reputation, Mr. Duchesneau asks those who laugh to take a look at their own backyard...
"PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
This season you have taken on a new scale with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
It can be explained by a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have come.
Every day I make progress on her side.
Technical staff have also given me a lot.
These elements encourage me to improve my level of play every day.
And in a game this is even easier.
In football everything goes very fast.
But I don't get excited.
From my beginnings in the centre of the preparatory training of INF Clairefontaine to my playing time at Saint-Etienne, I have always made gradual progress.
So they take advantage of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The new additions of this summer are used to playing games very high levels.
You also know that every training unit is crucial.
This leads to a player like me who has to offer his forehead and do his best.
By the way, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot about my game position.
He's supported by co-trainers like Claude Realle who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the task?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technicians.
In Ligue 1 there is currently no comparable person, and he is one of the best trainers in Europe.
He looks back at a rich experience and has won many titles with prestigious clubs.
He was in contact with big players.
I think he'll win more titles in Paris.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
At that time I had just recovered from a series of injuries.
The confidence he has placed in me is also an explanation of my achievements.
What do you think about the first part of the season of the PSG?
In Ligue 1 Lyon took the place of the top rider.
But we're in ambush.
One of our most important goals is the Champions League: we have thus qualified for the eighth finale.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
We'll try to get as far as we can.
Everything is possible from now on.
However, we will have to speak our words against very good European teams.
First of all, we want to become first of our group in front of Porto so that we can replay the eighth finale as a home game.
Can the PSG be a major European association in the short term?
He already has the budget for it...
In order to become a large European club, Paris has to win the title and make a long-term name.
This is not the case today.
In financial terms, the PSG gives itself the means to take concrete forms of this project.
Would it be a great failure not to win the title in Ligue 1 as was the case in the last season?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year it is really our heart to see this title.
Last season we were close.
In May we were disappointed because we were strong enough to bear the victory.
We ended the season with a very strong performance.
We've finished with 79 points.
Usually you should be master with 79 points...
But another team, Montpellier's team, has achieved an even better season.
I think this year is the right one.
Even though the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are around the title, I think we have the stuff to win it.
Do you think the media expect too much from the PSG?
Given what has been invested and the players we have, it is normal that much is expected of us.
We totally accept that.
However, if we win at a home game against Troyes 4-0, and you still find something you can accuse us of, that is certainly a bit frustrating.
People wonder what else people are expecting.
We could never win every weekend with 4-0.
We're not the Barcelona FC!
We're trying to set up a game concept.
A team builds up over time.
In the Champions League we have proven strength.
Consider Manchester City, an association that has not been able to qualify for the eighth finale since two seasons, and which has also done huge spending!
In terms of the sums invested, you were believed to be the lead for the break with 15 points!
This means that our opponents and the French championship would be ignored.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not good in the last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we will be the smiling winner and tell us that, despite all the difficulties, we have finally won them.
The PSG seems to be completely dependent on the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
It's all the better to talk about a "Zlatan dependency."
That means that Ibrahimovic is powerful and shoots many goals.
That's why he came and he proves that he's the star of Ligue 1.
Everywhere he played, he showed that he was a great player and a world star.
Within the team we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects those who surround him.
What he did is really extraordinary.
This encourages others to improve their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone else to make progress.
How did you experience the EM 2012 with the French national team?
Like a disappointment.
It was my heart to participate in this EM.
Unfortunately, my injury has prevented me from taking out some playtime.
I've seen things there that have strengthened me.
Today I manage to make good games in the national team.
This has been my hope since my baptism with the "Bleus".
From what has happened in Ukraine, we have drawn our teaching, and today we have to show an exemplary behavior.
What do you think about the first months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "Bleus"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualification group for the World Cup.
The national trainer is strict, is close to the players and stimulates victory.
As it was Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the EM.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the "Bleus" to Brazil.
Is the final decision forced in Spain on 16 October (1:1) an start?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone's been working for everyone else.
Before this meeting in Spain I have never experienced a similar game in my career.
Bitcoin is possible to pay and sell without a bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchange based on central banks, identified transactions and handling fees between the parties.
Moreover, as so often in these technologies, a political vision is tangible: the conviction that the current monetary system, designed by bank monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, the bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is both a virtual currency (but converted into dollars, euros, etc.) and a protocol for secure exchange such as BitTorrent, which allows the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers on the network, about 200,000 transactions have already been recorded.
Some thousand websites accept Bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment.
After the Bitcoin price reached a maximum of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, it fell five months later to 2 dollars before recovering today to around ten dollars (the rates are listed on the Bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing particularly impressive compared to world trade in real currencies or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown interest in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes Bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the greatest success", "in competition with the dollar or euro" and "like the conventional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as the "Credits" that are used to move forward in a video game that can be won or bought through games (and sometimes exchanged back).
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, each time trade is controlled and processed by a central authority.
With Bitcoin all network nodes are at the same time keepers of the invoice book, auditors, money issuers as well as buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail.
With the difference that the user can choose a different address for each payment, which ensures anonymity.
A series of the related data is signed electronically by a double encryption system.
In this way, the network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Using the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the traded Bitcoins are available in the public-accounts invoice book distributed throughout the network.
The crucial step is to enter this new transaction into this book.
This is done through a mathematical task that is started on the computers, with the winner, who is a kind of provisional central banker, privileged to add this additional line.
This is a piece of the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file into a shorter and unique electronic fingerprint.
Computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before the whole thing gets "cracked".
The goal is to find the number that gives a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
When this number has been found, the other nodes can easily check if it is the right one.
The transaction is therefore permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If one user wants to pay twice as fast (less than 10 minutes) with the same money for fraud, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other would remain unconnected, since both have different fingerprints.
The computer who solved the task receives 50 bitcoins.
To prevent inflation, this reward is halved regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The bitcoins in circulation are therefore limited to 21 million, but can be divided into a hundred billionths, leaving a certain margin...
In addition, the difficulty of the task is increased with any improvement in the computing power.
The life of the network has already had heights and depths.
The websites that provide Bitcoin services have been attacked and the Bitcoin deposits have been stolen.
"The vulnerability used does not affect the actual protocol," assures Pierre Noizat, who just introduced Paymium, which is a company for payment with real money and uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB shall also report on the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service.
However, cash also shows these shortcomings.
Important actors such as Wikipedia deny donations of this kind.
They are accepted by others like the WordPress blog platform.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the invoice book and showed that almost 80% of bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November, a "mega-closed sale" was launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," says Jon Holmquist, who works for the Coinabul company, who converts bitcoins to gold.
Pierre Noizat, also author of a book on this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a network of transactions.
Its Paytunia system corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses bitcoin to validate the transactions that are therefore cheaper.
In addition, the holder manages its identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented by dealers, and the latter does not need to install new terminals or computer programs.
You just have to provide an address that can be "photographed and recognized" by a phone, Pierre Noizat states that he has thousands of users.
There is a general trend in which hierarchical systems are considered in favour of more horizontal-oriented systems.
"It will take some time for Bitcoin to prevail, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.
By the way, the ECB's report foresees re-evaluating the various risks that are considered highly regarded today in the event of the success of this currency.
We moved from Afghanistan.
And after that?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the USA are expected to follow at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to seize the possession of its territory again, and for the Afghan people to decide their future without expecting everything from us.
In particular, we have punished Afghan farmers by viewing them as terrorists.
And ourselves with our 88 soldiers killed, as well as the wounded and the wounded.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often also of peasants who refuse an armed foreign presence, such as at the time of the Soviet Union.
They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even though jihadists, Pakistani, Arabs, Uzbekistan and Tajiks have joined them.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by the local insurgents, the latter will no longer be there when Western countries become more discreet.
The withdrawal of the French troops from the base in Nyrab, which I observed from a hill planted with almond trees, which was financed by French loans, was carried out properly.
The truck and tank convoys flown by helicopters have reached Kabul without being attacked.
From the end of 2014, there will be no more flow of the Taliban into Kabul.
Since its irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996, the conditions have changed.
At that time Kabul was empty and the country was covered by war due to the struggles of the various insurgent groups.
At the time, their takeover of power was considered a kind of liberation and return to security.
Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of the peasants overwhelmed by the organization Al-Qaida, but their situation has not improved to this day.
Former Mudahedin, Afghan government and current Taliban have the common desire to hold women in a subordinate position.
The most important personalities of the anti-Soviet war came back to power in 2001.
They have turned into business makers by seizing government land to sell it to refugees from Iran and Pakistan as a building land, thus benefiting from the massive American subcontracting of subcontracts.
They have brought themselves into disrepute, and most of them were not themselves involved in the fights.
As I have heard in the campaigns, people wish for a government not composed of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, as did those who have been able to make use of American subsidies: capital escape is considerable.
The young people are full of war and its ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have had contact with the modern world and have enjoyed its advantages.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is one fifth of the total population.
In the cities the state schools are full of girls like boys.
These young people, who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders, will have to be provided with jobs.
All, including the armed parties, are possessed of mobile phones; television with its Turkish series, which represent a modern world, is watched everywhere.
An army is now in place.
Is the authorities under whose command it will be regarded as legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already trying to restore the militias in the province that will escape the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the country of the mountains with strong local identities, should have benefited from a certain decentralization on the example of the Western nations, but by abolishing the office of the Prime Minister, which existed since the Constitution of 1964, the US wanted to make it a centralized state with a strong presidential power.
President Karzaï does not want foreign controls, especially on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, its country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and long before.
Industries have not been rebuilt, functional dams are not present and important irrigation systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported; except fruit and vegetables, nothing is produced.
The private initiative is given priority.
In a country based on 30 years of war, a state control of infrastructure would have been necessary.
The rumor was spread that Afghanistan possessed immense land resources.
This adds to the impression that the Western countries were only on site to seize it.
Without energy to process the iron or copper ore on site, or without means of transport for export over the mountains, no mining is possible.
The Chinese have already almost left the copper mine of Mes Aynak, have the international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) make their excavations on the huge Buddhist site and remain the most important employers of the province.
One day, it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports are largely dependent, to restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of the French martial troops was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional assistance: girls and boys, French University Institute, French Institute, military, legal, medical and agricultural cooperation, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a service "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was discontinued in 2012, has carried out numerous non-profit work and measures in dozens of mountain villages for the remediation of agriculture and has been carried out by a small French non-governmental organisation to try to "gain hearts and spirits" and achieve the impossible task of reconciling aid and offensive actions.
This work, for which many local workers were required, has helped to suppress the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increase agricultural land.
What souvenir do we leave behind after military spending of two billion euros?
A much more modest budget will contribute to improving local living conditions, which are often very hard in these valleys at a height of more than 2,000 metres.
The Embassy has received dozens of written requests from small agricultural projects from municipalities in the province of Kapisa.
In order for farmers to rid themselves of the uprising conducted by foreign groups, which they wish to see, the continuation of small, well-controlled and directly involved civilian aid would be necessary in their behalf.
A Constitution with the Brechstenge in Egypt
It is a new poker game by President Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt remains divided more than ever with regard to the declaration of constitution which temporarily grants it unlimited authority, it has decided to place everything on a map.
To surprise everyone, he announced on Wednesday that the Constitutional Assembly would adopt its final version the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of state had granted this assembly two additional months for the completion of its work.
For almost two years now, Egypt has been based on a provisional text, which has changed several times, which weakens institutional stability and leads to a legal confusion.
This new initiative has only made the country even more divided.
For his opponents, the president persists in his "autocratic delirium" by continuing to "break his word" and "step the right with feet".
On the side of its supporters, it is assured that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as soon as possible and speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period of time that forces the brothers to renounce their intention to explain the text section by section to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way of regaining his public and democratic legitimacy while protesting throughout the country rages.
After confirmations in an interview with the American weekly show Time, Muhammad Mursi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote benevolently.
Especially the Egyptian people with this recourse to an hasty vote is put an ultimatum: "Either you vote for my draft or I reserve the unlimited authority", the latter should, after the adoption of the Constitution, put an end to it.
85 mostly Islamic members of this constitutional assembly adopted the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of the Liberals have not complied with the call.
Shortly before the Constitutional Declaration in mid-November, they have turned their backs on the idea that they have not been able to express their views.
Representatives of human rights organisations, religious minorities or civil society have acted equally.
To achieve the decision-making capacity, 11 persons, alternate members, were added in all speeds yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslims.
It is not surprising that the articles were generally adopted unanimously.
The commentators found it entertaining that the only difference of opinion of the day... was expressed in the time of prayer, as some members of the committee felt that the pendulum watch of the constitutional assembly did not go exactly.
The text, which was adopted last night, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which attracted all attention, remains ultimately identical to that of the 1971 Constitution and states that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law".
The Salafist parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is an important requirement, had the hope of replacing "the principles" with "the rules", which would have made it possible to apply more strictly.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is proof of their good will and respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.
The liberals, who see this as a propaganda blow, reply to "sacrifice".
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution takes place through other articles.
In particular, they consider Article 220, which grants the University of Al-Azhar an advisory role, in particular with regard to the verification of conformity with the laws of Sharia.
According to Egypt's specialist Sophie Pommier, this is disturbing because "the people who are asked for an opinion have not been elected and have no democratic legitimacy at all.
You can see here the first signs of a theocracy".
The fears of the liberals are also nourished by the fact that the next rector of this university should be far less moderate than the current one.
"At present, there is no concrete religious commitment.
With this constitution we remain within the framework of the bourgeois state.
Most lawyers who have worked on this text are not ulema, but academics who have been trained in the French system in part," says Alexis Blouet, who writes a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
He admitted, however, that "with regard to Article 220, there can be a ambiguity, since the terms used are derived from the religious vocabulary.
In particular, reference is made to the "Fiqh" [Islamic case law, note "Red.].
And in the future, the question could be raised as to the extent to which civil judges are competent to decide."
In addition to his religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is strongly criticised for the far-reaching powers he grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslims argue that these are significantly reduced compared to the former regime.
Another issue: the powers of the army.
In line with the military's wish, the examination of the defence budget is not submitted to Parliament but to a national defence council.
Nor will there be a ban on civil proceedings in military courts, as the human rights defence organisations have called for.
The latter also share their fears about the text they consider to be a threat to freedom.
The Blasphemy's record is being maintained, and insults are now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression, especially for the press.
In addition, no more article refers to the protection of women, emphasizes Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
In your opinion, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to express himself on television last night, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
The proponents of the head of state will march on Saturday.
In Israel Ukrainian tourists await sacred sites, the navel of the world and a sea of brine
The Promised Land unites in itself the glory of Bible truths, modern comfort, and unspoiled nature.
AIF gives you the five main reasons for visiting Israel.
Bend in front of the holy places
Visit the river Jordan, where Jesus was baptized.
It means that all who bathe in this river receive God's blessing.
Galilee is the place where Jesus performed his miracles: the conversion of water into wine at a wedding celebration, the walking on the water, the breastfeeding of the sea tower and the fishing.
Here, Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
Most of the sanctuaries, however, are found in Jerusalem.
Believers here take the path of suffering or the path of the cross of Jesus Christ (on Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The path begins at the Roman fortress Antonia, Pretorium, where the court was, and leads through the streets of the old town to the tomb church on Mount Golgotha, where there are the crucifixion, the anointing stone and the tomb of Jesus.
Here, according to the Christian view, is the navel of the world, symbolizing the salvation of humanity.
The monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem stands at the place where, according to a Christian legend, the tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus grew.
In Jerusalem there is also the most holy place of the Jews - the complaint wall, the remains of a temple that was destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
Traditionally, there people of different faiths leave papers with desires that are then fulfilled.
Make a journey up to the level
The ruins of the Massada fortress are the remains of the secret hiding place from enemies that Herod the Great built for his family in 25 AD.
They are located on a rock face in the mountains at 450 meters above sea level.
Only mountaineers can reach the ruins of their own strength.
All others bring an air cable car to this historic summit.
In the north of the country at 1600 to 2040 meters altitude is the famous ski resort Hermon, in which it attracts countless tourists in the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain you can get there with a shuttle bus.
The ski slopes have a total length of 45 kilometers.
According to an ancient legend, pagan gods were supposedly living on the summit.
Visit Unique Museums
There are almost 300 museums in this country.
On only one trip, not all of them can be visited.
But at least the five most interesting of them should be paid a visit.
Among these is once the Israel Museum, not far from the Knesset (parliament).
There, ancient Qumran manuscripts or scrolls from the Dead Sea found in caves in the Judean desert are kept, as well as about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
There the collection of works by the impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso is on display.
In Akko you can visit the museum in the Bad Al Basha, which houses several rooms of old Turkish baths with sculptures of the visitors and bathers at that time.
In Caesarea you should visit the unique private Ralli Museum, where you can admire sculptures of Dali and Rodin.
There are no museum guides or souvenir shops there.
Admission is free and donations are refused in principle.
The fifth museum, namely the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells of one of the most shocking chapters of history.
The most touching department is the memorial to the children, built to commemorate the 1.5 million children who were destroyed in the concentration camps and gas chambers.
When entering the room there is complete darkness.
Stars sparkle.
And the names of the Jewish children and the countries in which they died came.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Doing something for health
The three main recreation areas of Israel lie on the shores of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of the three places there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanariums.
Amazingly, in the Red Sea, the water temperature is not below 21 °C and the air warms up to 23 °C even in the winter months.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and bathed all year round.
By the way, this unusual sea with a position of 417 meters below sea level is the deepest sea in the world.
Its turquoise blue water has a high salt content and thus even wears non-swimmer easily on the surface.
The landscape landscape is indescribably beautiful.
Visitors come here for treatments using salt water (natural salt soles) and healing sludge, as well as for the treatment of skin inflammation, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and the calming of stressed nerves.
The Secrets of Ancientity Touch
These secrets surround the old town of Tel Aviv, the town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through this city was the famous seaway, which connected Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to tradition, Noah built his ark right here, and Perseus saved here the beautiful Andromeda with which he lived a long and happy life in this place.
Tourists like to stroll through the narrow alleyways named after zodiac signs.
Fortuna is said to be the legend after all who touch the walls in the alley with their star sign.
In Jaffa you can find newly married couples from all over Israel and even other countries at photo dates.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can roam through the Roman theatre and conquer the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the most important city of Judea and residence of the Roman governors, including Pontius Pilate.
Today evening concerts and operas are performed in the carefully restored theatre.
Favourites for tourists
If you're going to Israel, don't worry about your bad English skills: about 30% of the Israelis speak Russian.
The money in the trip is rather taken in no Euros, but in dollars, which can simply be changed in shekels (current exchange rate: 1 dollar to 3.8 shekels).
In the city you usually get by bus, but in Jerusalem there is also a highway and in Haifa the only underground line of the country with six stations connecting the lower city to the upper city.
In fact, it's an underground cable car.
A journey within the city costs 6 shekels regardless of the transport, which is enough to change for a trip of up to 1.5 hours.
According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated in Israel on Saturdays.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, markets and shops are closed, and public transport rests.
And on Sunday morning the working week begins.
In many cafés, restaurants and restaurants only kosher food is served, excluding pigmeat, marine products, fish without sheds and food containing both milk and meat products.
Instead, you have the choice between different dishes with hammock and beef, soups and desserts (prepared with coconut milk), traditional Jewish humus paste, various sauces, fried balls made of pure beans and peas (palafel) as well as fruits and vegetables.
In the streets of Israeli cities there are no stranding dogs.
For this, there are many well-nourished cats who plow comfortably and unlit through the streets.
In the evening you can even see them sleeping on the roofs of parking cars.
The cats like lively places and don't say no to treats.
A car rental cost between 37 dollars per day (Hyundai Getz) and 188 dollars (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance costs an additional $15 a day.
And bike rental costs 15 shekels a day.
On average, admission tickets for museums cost 30 shekels.
In figures
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most adventurers and recreational seekers came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the USA and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists came to the Promised Country, which corresponds to an increase of 51% compared to the period of comparison in 2010, prior to the abolition of the visa obligation on 9 February 2011.
"The great and powerful" leads to Moscow: Migrants save money for language
While MEPs and civil rights activists discuss the benefits of the law on binding language tests for migrants, criminals are already dealing with fake certificates
Each year 13 million guest workers come to Moscow, St Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are the citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money for the maintenance of the families remaining in the home.
On 1 December, a law came into force requiring every migrant to take a test to certify knowledge of the Russian language.
To date, this scheme applies only to migrants who wish to work in the services sector, in the municipal housing industry and in the retail sector.
However, in the future, the tests will become compulsory for all guest workers, according to the Federal Migration Authority.
Not only language tests, but also tests on Russian history and the foundations of legislation must be carried out.
Language skills must be demonstrated both for the receipt and extension of the work permit.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries where Russian is an official language.
Also excluded from this law are persons who received their training certificates and diplomas prior to the break-up of the USSR in 1991.
Meaning, problem and protection of rights
The whole of the examination bodies will be under the aegide of the Puschkin Institute for Russian Language, the Russian University of People's Friendship, the Moscow State University, the St Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
Migrants can take the tests in all cities; already more than 160 corresponding centres have been opened in Russia.
The initiative to launch the tests was supported by the representatives of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Authority.
However, before the entry into force of the law in the press, civil rights activists asked the following question several times: What does the whole thing actually bring?
What changes does the rule of having to show language skills, both for the Russians and for the guest workers?
Above all, spokespersons from the Migration Authority, it is about reducing the number of forced workers.
"Many are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers," says the head of the representative office of the Federal Migration Authority in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelev.
However, their rights must be protected from departure.
Only organized recruitment will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
Migrants without a job, education, language skills and medical evaluation are facing problems.
Sebelev is convinced that a future migrant without language skills will inevitably encounter people with evil intentions who put him in a dark, narrow barracks under the pretext of help, where he will endure with dozens of his equal months without food and documents and created 12 to 14 hours a day.
We reach many complaints from our migrants.
"In the home country, you will be promised the One, and on arrival you will be deceived, their passports will be taken off and will not receive the promised wage," confirms the head of the main labour migration administration of the Tajik Migration Authority, Tolib Schwaripov.
Don't beg your pardon, boss!
Nevertheless, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who want to earn their money in Russia admit that they cannot only control the language of the target country, but can hardly express themselves in writing in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much their fault, but rather the evil: only a few Turkmen, Uzbekistan and Tajiks can afford only reasonable primary education.
For in their families there is not even money to feed the children, let alone buy them decent clothes, shoes and school items.
As a teenager, these children immediately take the first opportunity to earn money.
"It's difficult without language skills," they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
Civil rights activists emphasize the following important aspect of the law.
Only migrants with legal status must take the test.
If you do not have this status, there is no examination and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile, most of the guest workers continue to reside illegally in Russia.
"Welcome welcome" or "forbidden entry for unauthorized persons"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic obstacles and, of course, linguistic difficulties.
In addition, the legalization costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration can be made quickly and only for a thousand and a half.
The staff of the Russian police know that our documents are mostly faked and we are not registered, and that results in cases of extortion.
"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," says the Tajik Umed Huschkadamov to journalists.
"Just don't shy away from the cost of false papers"
Already on the day the law came into force, it turned out that not only the registration documents of migrants can be faked.
Some fake certificates certifying the completion of the language test have already been confiscated by employees of the Federal Migration Authority.
The fake papers were printed with an ordinary colour printer.
Of course, the new owners did not get them for nothing: every migrant who hoped to save themselves the tests paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: this costs a migrant worker three thousand rubles.
The most important direct task is to protect the system from corruption so that certificates cannot be bought easily, both officials and civil rights activists agree.
For the moment, the authorities can only promise guest workers who fall through the test for the first time that they will get time for a basic language course.
In addition, newcomers without language skills are offered jobs in areas where active communication with people is not necessary.
Interior Ministry of Illegal Weapons Market
Share of legal weapons in criminal offences extremely low
The Russian Interior Ministry plans to tighten up the arms law for private weapons owners.
The authorities are thus responding to recent events: Injured at shootings at weddings as well as seven deaths in the amokrund of the Moscow lawyer Dmitri Winogradov.
The police want to ban the carrying of non-killing weapons in the public and raise the age of possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal supported the chairman of the Duma Security and Corruption Committee, Irina Jarrowaja, and promised that the amendments to the Arms Act would be submitted to the Duma shortly.
Not all are satisfied with the fact that the Russian authorities want to fight the problems by "drawing the screws".
An open letter has been published on the Internet, whose author - representatives of various arms associations - calls on the authorities to refrain from "insane intensifications".
The percentage of crimes involving registered weapons is very low, said the criminal lawyer, Wasilij Lesnikov, the Russian service of the BBC.
According to the Ministry of Interior statistics, 142 crimes involving the use of registered weapons were committed over the course of six months in 2012, while a total of 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded for the period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that strengthening the law for private arms owners will not prevent criminals from using themselves on the black market.
According to the authors in Moscow, any weapon for little money can be found.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior stresses that the spread of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The weapons reach the black market via several channels.
There are five such main channels, says a former Colonel Viktor Baranez, who worked for ten years in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of a website that accepts weapons orders
The first channel is the army or the military, i.e. weapons stolen during the battles in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by both the Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," says Baranez.
On the second channel come illegal weapons that are stolen from criminals' guardians.
Baranez explains that these include weapons stolen from both the police's arms chambers and directly from law enforcement staff.
Other illegally sold weapons come from military weapons camps.
In many military camps, explosions often occurred.
"There is evidence that some cases were arson to cover up the lack of weapons," says the former military member.
According to Baranez, the arms manufacturers also make a contribution to the black market.
"Today, there are countless private arms factories that do not withstand international competition and are therefore squandering weapons under the hand of the black market, for example in Moscow," the expert reports.
Another channel of the black market is the smuggling.
Especially many guns and guns come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is an own, sometimes craft production, as well as a mafia that organizes the smuggling," explains the former military member.
Where did the weapons come from?
Experts calculated the proportion of each of the five channels in the supply of illegal weapons to the black market.
In 2011, a report was prepared by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Government Administration.
The experts analysed reports from the Ministry of Interior and the Federal Service for State Statistics, criminological literature and publicly accessible data on portals on arms.
According to the investigators, the majority of the illegal weapons are from the army and the law enforcement authorities.
Half of all weapons on the black market are there by the "debt of those responsible for their work related to weapons", says the report.
According to the researchers, 17% of weapons come from conflict areas, 14% go back to thefts in arms production, and 5% come from illegal excavations.
A sales consultant from a arms store who does not want to be called by name ensures that weapons found in illegal excavations have not been bought for a long time since they are obsolete.
According to him, it is more common for dealers to get the supply in a arms camp.
A gun, for example, a TT-type gun, is purchased via an insignia.
The gun is issued and handed over through the fence.
"The dealer takes the gun to the city and sells it there for 900 euros per piece with two magazines," he says.
"Of course, the police know everything and therefore, if they are unable to comply with the plan to detect crime, they will carry out periodic control purchases at traders offering illegal weapons," adds the sales advisor.
"As in the luxury store"
Buyers and sellers find each other most about acquaintances.
I had looked at websites and blogs when someone became aware of me and suggested to come to the station "Begowaya" where a person would wait for me, who would take me to a certain place where we could then negotiate the price.
The price for the gun I only learned there
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
"To get a gun, I need a friend who has contacts," says the sales advisor. "I have such a acquaintance, but I don't trust him."
There are dealers in the markets, but there you have to go and date with a code like "by Ivan Ivanovich, who lets the daughter lose a tooth".
At the moment, I even come across a few strokes about a friend I trust.
He's also giving me the hit rings because he knows I'm not whacking him.
Newbies are looking for weapons in different ways.
In the middle of the 1990s, former military member Viktor Baranez tried to buy illegal weapons when he wrote an article on this subject.
According to him, the schemes have not changed.
He got a photo album in which "everything possible" was pictured.
"I felt like I was in the luxury shop," remembers the military member.
According to Baranez, the buyer does not get the cat in the bag, but can try everything.
As a potential customer, I not only buy, but drive with the seller into the forest, and there we set a target.
"I can shoot there, and if I'm convinced that the gun has a good shot, we'll negotiate with each other," the expert describes the procedure.
Shopping from the sofa
Internet search engines show search results on websites and groups in "Vkontakte" where weapons are offered "for various purposes".
No papers are needed or there are personal meetings.
"You only need the right sum of money," says the advertisement on the website "Buying a gun or a gun".
There users place their orders and make inquiries.
Is also sold to minors?
"Of course without a license", asks user "Iwan" (literally quotation).
"Buy a TT. Moscow" is the laconic request of "Fedorenkow".
The Federal Security Service recently switched countless fake websites, and buyers who want to purchase weapons go to the network together.
People come like hungry fish at feeding and then land in Siberia and are allowed to shake coal
Military commentator and former military member Viktor Baranez
I have heard of the following scheme: The website is normally registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
The controllers accept the orders.
The buyer transfers the money via a bank machine.
"In response, he receives a photo and a description of the hiding place of the weapon," reports the press spokesperson of the non-profit organization "Pravo na oryzhie" Dmitrij Kislow.
Viktor Baranez emphasizes that you can finally go out empty and get behind grids when you place a request on a website.
The Federal Security Service recently switched countless fake websites, and buyers who want to purchase weapons go to the network together.
"People come like hungry fish at feeding and then land in the Siberian labour camp and are allowed to shake coal," he says.
One Makarrow for 100 US dollars
According to experts, prices of illegal firearms range from 100 to 900 US dollars.
According to Dmitrij Kislow of the organization "Pravo na oryzhie", you can buy a Makarrow gun for 100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait up to a month and a half.
The weapon is issued in medium-range military weapons camps.
According to the Ministry of the Interior's official statistics, the number of crimes involving illegal weapons across Russia fell by 7% to 22.9 thousand from January to October 2011, while the number of detected cases of theft and extortion related to weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosives decreased by 7.8%.
In the USA, fast food and supermarket workers strike
Every fourth U.S. youth is sitting behind McDonald's cash register sometime.
In recent days, there have been massive protests against low wages in stores of Walmart and restaurants of popular fast food chains such as Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one can predict yet whether the protests will be further swelling or whether they will soon be back in the air.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several left-wing non-profit organisations.
In addition to increasing the modest wages of simple Walmart and fast-food workers, the organizers of the protests pursue the goal of establishing unions.
So far, this industry of the economy has hardly been organized in trade unions.
46 cents a year?
The protests started last week after Thanksgiving, on the so-called Black Friday, where sales took place in the U.S., which attracted millions of customers, sometimes leading to volumes of hands.
On that day, some Walmart employees, of whom 2.2 million exist worldwide, laid down their work and, together with trade unions and left activists, distributed branches of the chain whose target group are low and medium incomes.
Walmart sells all products, from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The product in the Walmart branches is averaged between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That is why many of the slightly paid Walmart employees buy only at their own workplace.
The prices and range of goods made Walmart one of the largest companies in the USA.
According to critics, Walmart can often only sell the goods so cheaply because the employees are badly paid.
The latter also complain about heavy working conditions, for example missing forklifters or hand scanners.
The participants in the protests at the "Black Friday" called for wage increases and expressed their anger that the contribution to company health insurance had increased from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
A typical Walmart employee, who earns 9.5 US dollars the hour, could not afford this increase, they said.
Researchers from the California University in Berkeley prove that if the company raised the average wage to 12 dollars per hour, it would cost Walmart 3.2 billion dollars.
That is about 1.1% more than they now donate for wages.
If Walmart had completely changed the wage increases to customers, each purchase would cost them only 46 cents more in the future.
This would be for them per year in comparison with today's extra expenditure of only 12.39 dollars.
Supporters of Walmart are pleased to note that only nine states made protests and did not cause any losses to the company.
The Black Friday lasted at its shop from 8 p.m. on Thursday to midnight the next day, and during that period Walmart sold about 5000 items per second.
All in all, the Walmart Cases carried out nearly 100 million transactions on "Black Friday".
In an interview on the website of the left-wing Huffington Post, the spokesman of the company, Dan Fogelman, claimed that a total of "less than five" Walmart staff put down the work and that the protest action was merely "another PR trick" of the union that organized the protests.
Free cash register!
The protests continued this week in New York, but their goal was not Walmart branches (which are not desired in this progressive city and are therefore inexistent so far), but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says the company sells billions of portions, and yet they don't give you sick days, and you won't be paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member of the New York City Council
At present, the minimum wage is 7.25 dollars per hour in accordance with federal and New York legislation.
In fast food restaurants the minimum wage is increased gradually, but not too strong, and on average their simple employees in New York get $8.90 per hour.
Less than she deserves no one in this expensive city.
As it is possible to get out in New York with so little money, I am incomprehensible.
There was once a time when almost a quarter of all U.S. youths were behind the counter after school at McDonald's, but the young people were still living with their parents.
Hardly one saw in it the main source of income or planned to stay there longer.
Now, in interviews with McDonald's employees, people constantly meet me who complain that they have to deal with this wage and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment in the Forum of the Wall Street Journal, whose author notes that it is not responsible to have children if you do not know how to feed them.
The participants of the protests, which began on Thursday at 6.30 a.m. in front of McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashiers and cooks of fast food restaurants receive a minimum wage of 15 US dollars per hour, more than a doubling of the current minimum wage.
They continued to demand the formation of trade unions in the fast-food industry.
The US law forbids corporate governance to stand in the way of this goal and to warn or dismiss union members.
On the other hand, the management does not make it easy for them.
The creation of trade unions in the fast-food industry is also difficult for objective reasons.
The most important reason is the high number of personnel fluctuation.
Dissatisfied
Soundly protests took place that day also before many other fast food restaurants in Manhattan.
The highlight of the protests was a meeting in front of the McDonald's in Times Square, where some local democrats spoke, including city councillor Jumaane Williams, who said, "McDonald's say it sells billions of portions, and yet they don't give you sick days, and you won't be paid for your honest work!"
The demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York democrats, such as Mayor Mayor Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should jointly support the fast-food staff so that they can get a fair wage and achieve the economic prosperity that each New Yorker deserves!".
According to New York Times, this was the largest action of its kind in the history of the US fast food industry.
However, only a few hundred people were on site, many of whom are not all employed in the fast-food industry, where tens of thousands work in New York.
It is not yet to be seen whether the spark of these protests will mobilize entire masses.
"The brain can only be overshadowed so far"
The topic of expanded reality, popular with modern technologies, has recently been usually perceived by the lens of a special eyeglass.
At first, Google presented a working model at its annual conference in summer, and in November it was announced that Microsoft had also filed a corresponding patent.
In conversation with the head of the group for interactive 3D technologies in the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, however, it is clear that the glasses were only a transit station for the scientists of the company.
It stimulates the ability to manipulate virtual objects in the air with bare hands and create virtual open spaces.
- Please describe briefly what research your group is doing.
- We deal with the interaction of man and machine, but we want to expand the limits of this interaction.
So far, mankind has largely remained stuck in the phase of working with pixels on flat screens, which are sometimes also touched.
However, we want to look ahead for 5-10 years and predict the radical changes in this interaction.
For example, Xbox consoles and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and nowadays no Xbox is sold without Kinect, as everyone is interested in motion control.
- What do we expect in the future?
- Although Kinect has brought the interaction to a physical level, much is still happening on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the output not yet decisive.
We try to change this, work on real three-dimensional representations based on various technologies, including projections.
We have to release the computer world into our physical world and make it more tangible.
However, it is necessary that not only the user but also his environment be recognized.
Then we could complement the real world much easier with virtual objects.
And first of all, we should get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about language control?
She's popular, but isn't she overrated?
- It is certainly not the all-purpose solution, as it raises questions about privacy, because one does not always want to inform everyone about his actions and intentions.
Actually, any kind of interaction with computers is good, but any one in their particular niche.
For example, in the field of the control of objects in public places, we worked on a project in which we experimented with short and narrow gestures instead of exhilarating gestures.
The gestures were not recorded by the object camera, but by a bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, but could theoretically be reduced to the size of a watch.
But overall, the future belongs to mixed control types, such as gestures and language.
- How's that?
For example, we'd ask you to give me that spray can?
They say it and at the same time they point to it.
- Usually I just say it.
- Oh, that would be very hard to recognize.
- Does that mean that you want the user to adapt to what a machine can do at the time and not what?
- Not necessarily, but this is a mutual approach.
I think that we will need to work in the near future, in particular, on the development of new sensor types, which will enable people to take a closer look at their reactions.
This can be laser sensors, for example, as they offer a good resolution at depth, which is very important.
- What demands do you make from your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors on modern cameras?
Is there a lack of resolution, depth or anything else?
- The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 fps would not be bad.
But the main thing is not the megapixel itself, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
Thus, all current technologies are not good enough for us, as the developers of algorithms have more work.
It must not only take into account the resolution along the X and Y axes, but also along the Z axis.
The speed and the number of images per second are also important.
The movements of the human being are extremely dynamic and openly said, the present 30 fps in particular for gestures are too little.
Stephen Betisches developed a touch sensor in our laboratory in Redmond with a adjustable processing delay of between 1 and 100 milliseconds, with today's commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not everyone understands how much that affects the interaction of man and machine.
For my work, I needed just one device, only without control of contact and with more pictures per second.
- Shouldn't the number of cameras be increased?
- Kinect is currently working with three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other is a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB camera.
It is not used to calculate the depth of the object.
More cameras could possibly solve the problem...
Or strengthen the problem as more calculations are needed.
Nice would be a flexible, Kinect-like system in which we could play with different camera inclinations to determine how this helps us to determine a position in three-dimensional terms.
- If I remember correctly, unlike Google, Microsoft did not present his glasses to the public.
Don't you think that with regard to the application of the technology of expanded reality in everyday life, the glasses have the best prospects?
- Of course it's not pleasant to keep a smartphone in the raised hand on the way, but I think the greatest variant would be a "changing" extended reality in which we could switch from glasses to the smartphone via a cloud,
The glasses are a personal gadget and it contains their strength (privates can only see you), but at the same time their weakness, because an extended reality through glasses prevents you from working on virtual objects together with others.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is not only accessible to Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also to normal mortals.
There is a problem, often pointing to the critics of this idea: there is no tangible reaction!
Your hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group want to give to this objection?
- In my lectures, I often speak of the expanded reality as the seventh breakthrough in interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth breakthrough could be the integration of tactile perception.
An interesting method is currently the use of the second hand as a somewhat unusual projection document.
She sees pressure excellently!
But there are also technologies that are actually aimed at giving the "images in the air" something hand-resistant, for example, the interference of some directed ultrasonic rays creates at a certain point where the finger is located, a feeling that is currently as weak as someone was pusting over the handballs.
There are also straps for the wrist that affect the nerve endings in the fingers, which is also a potential direction.
- Did you try to outdo the brain?
It makes you think it feels what it should feel when it just sees something?
- That's a good idea, so we haven't tried yet.
Here is another task that we will have to struggle with for a long time, namely to let a person who is physically in a closed room believe that he is instead in an open, virtually infinite space; here we work on concepts with treadmills (other than in gyms), mobile platforms and large balls.
So far, the brain can only be overstated moderately, and we have many working years ahead.
This is what makes the work in the field of virtual reality so appealing to a researcher: on many topics we are only at the beginning.
Own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "Petersburger Avantgarde", dedicated to city dwellers who form the avant-garde of art and culture.
On the selected list, high-ranking representatives of the Petersburg art scene, whose successes go beyond the borders of the city and who often find recognition in Europe without being known in the rest of Russia, have already landed.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, the bearded in red, who is once at the Russian Museum, sometimes at the summer garden, sometimes at scene meetings or on vernissagen.
Wherever the pictures of Kirill Miller are displayed, they attract large masses of people.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg-based social-philosophical artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a bright personality of the Petersburg avant-garde at the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s.
He is also a man of the city and, by his presence on the street, enchants his fellow citizens with a smile in the face and gives them a good mood.
Recently he caught a rotating organ and became a St. Petersburg organ player, as he finally felt ready for this difficult role in terms of his artist's existence, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you always in red and not in yellow or turquoise in the city?
I chose the color red as a fashion designer, which deals with the look and the image.
In this world, Red is the compromise between artist, image consultant and society.
In society, everything that deviates from the gray standard creates aggression and bad behavior.
But I want to talk to people through my provocations.
Each of my past provocations was an invitation to the conversation.
- When did you know you had to be a painter?
- At an exhibition at the Kulturpalast Newskij, where my works were exhibited.
I understood I had to go this way.
Then the time of the old free but not officially recognized painters ended, and new and free painters like me were incomprehensible.
I became friends with the painters of the new generation, i.e. with the representatives of the "Gazonewschina", from which "Puschkinskaja 10" was created, and then it was only last.
It attracts me to the theatre, to fashion, to music, to anything but literature.
And all of this was united in your art clinic... it was important to me to be at the centre of Petersburg culture, where the best creative artists should gather.
In 1995, I occupied a room in the Pushkinskaya 10, and there, up to the renovation works, there was a musical-artic club for the Bohemian, the House of the Petersburg Bohemia.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzzz, and I also remember how cord came there with his project "Ucho Van Goga".
String and his friends sang simple songs for the playback, wore tight jerseys, and among them was today's famous composer Igor Wdowin.
When the group started to play live, it became her "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the time of "Halli-Galli".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it began his great career, but he learned the basics from us.
The gallery "D 137" or the club "Gribudov" also originates in the art clinic.
Our staff and regular guests went there.
I'm a hero of the last century when culture meant something.
In 2000, there was a survey in the press on the award "Personalities of Our City".
I won in the category "Artists of the Year" and that made me reach the peak.
It is not easy to work in new times according to old rules; I am a person of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: You can be famous without making a cultural contribution.
- Your work has an unmistakable style.
- Many of my pictures are real pearls and express clearly the topicality and sharpness of the thoughts.
I will have an exhibition with the theme "The Russian Museum as clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
I used to be social, but now it hurts and is afraid to be like that.
In a clown, all this blurs and loses its tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and I have grotesque ideas.
For example, let us save the world by prescribing that everyone has to dress completely.
Now everyone takes care of the clothes and is focused on the outside and not on the inside of man.
But maybe you can't give a man your hand, but you should spit him in the face.
The deception disappears by disguise.
- Recently, we saw you in the role of the city organ player.
Who, if not me?
- Can commercial art be beautiful?
- Nowadays, commercial art must be cautious, considerate and flattering.
We see the decay of cultures.
In the past, people formed large groups: Bohemian people loved one another and the simple people the other.
Now there are microcommunities, and it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a one hundred-dollar note everyone likes.
Now you have to think about who you're gonna like.
Now each cult star has about 100 followers.
- To the performances of Stas Michailow come several thousand!
- To him abandoned women come, where the sexual-social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons 300 people come and not 10 thousand, so there is less management, money, and everything goes down.
I have followers, and the most important thing is not to cheat on them and not to destroy the achieved.
In my youth I painted such pictures that even hung in a row with the works of Falk and Larionow.
I started with pictures that usually only come at the end of the career.
These days, there are often misunderstandings.
It means: spiritual culture and consumer culture.
Consumption has no culture at all, it's quite different.
I am a person of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money to paint.
This is the culture I support.
- Kirill, what's wrong with Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
It is said that cultural servants.
But not each of them can deal with culture.
With the real tsars it was different, because the tsars may not understand much of culture, but they understood that right experts are necessary.
There are currently good consultants in Moscow.
In Petersburg we have some who may be experts, but they are blocked because it requires higher-ranking experts to assess the first ones correctly and clear the way for them.
Now it's just your own taste.
The same applies to the Erarta, however, with the difference that they honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and therefore some painters have to look for other museums.
- What's Petersburg for you?
- Petersburg is not the Capital of Culture; in Moscow there is much more culture and a corresponding breeding ground.
On our stones, art can only grow hard.
We need a cultural breeding ground, for for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that is not correct.
In Europe there are many curious people who visit exhibitions or concerts.
It's a lot less with us.
Art must be modern again, as at the beginning of the last century.
The project is financed by grants from the City of St Petersburg
Birth in space
Earth in danger.
Global warming or collision with killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with earth inhabitants on board are looking for a substitute planet.
To save mankind, how can we reproduce in gravity or on the substitute planet?
I do not think there are many options.
De facto, there are only two real planets that we could at least inhabit hypothetically.
"The name of Mars and Venus," says the scientific assistant of the Astronomical Sternberg Institute Vladimir Surdin.
However, while the conditions on Mars are comparatively life-friendly, on the surface of Venus there is a temperature of 500 degrees.
Life would only be possible at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus, i.e. in space.
The researchers first addressed the question of reproduction in space with regard to the flora.
Experiments with plants were carried out half a century before.
The fourth generation of peas bred in orbit did not differ least from the earthly species.
It followed the breeding of insects, more precisely of tiny fruit flies (drosophila), in orbit.
In 1979, guards were sent to space to explore the impact of weightlessness on the development of embryos.
It develops a very normal chick.
But then the problem begins.
"The problem is that the chick has to find a stop; it has to be able to stand on its legs and start moving," explains the laboratory director of the Institute for Medical-Biological Problems RAN, Vladimir Sychew.
Without a solid surface, the chicks overflowed wildly.
Ten hours later, the instincts of the newborns were completely dulled.
The chicks did not respond to light and noise.
Four days later, they simply died.
"Two times we let chicks slip and then stopped the whole thing, because it is simply impossible to work with them there," said Vladimir Sychew for the failed experiment with the chicks in space.
The last breeding cage with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, on the biosatellite "Bion" there will be only same-sex species.
There was an experiment with rats already fertilized in space.
In principle, nothing special has been found.
"That was just with the biosatellites, but again it was just a single experiment, and the research has to be continued," said Vladimir Sychew.
After landing, the space rats were given offspring.
So far, the problem of reproduction directly in space has not been solved.
The task is difficult.
Animals that are torn out of their natural habitat simply cannot follow their reproductive impulse.
Unlike animals, man could in principle do so.
The Homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can create a similar emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not carried out.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
There was the greatest risk at Tereshkova.
The most valuable thing mankind has is the female organism.
Our gull flew away, and no one on earth could have answered the following question: Does it survive the space flight?
Will she be able to bring a child to the world after this flight?
"Finally, no one answered this question," says space veteran Wagang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, only one year after her space flight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, bore a daughter.
The father of the child, Andrijan Nikolayev, was also cosmonaut.
In 1988 the second woman in space, Svetlana Sawizkaja, who was twice in orbit and even worked outside the spacecraft, bore a son.
Still, there's a risk.
We have very few cosmonauts, where after long flights everything went well and they got healthy offspring.
"The more, the more dangerous it is even in flights in the orbit," concludes Cosmonaut Waleri Polyakov, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation.
Yet humanity must look for new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
The hydro lab in the preparation center of the cosmonauts is a mandatory station during the preparation of the flight.
Here in a floating state, the cosmonauts gain routine for work in open space.
The water represents gravity.
Even if adults feel water to be pleasant, it is a strange environment; yet infants feel water as a natural element.
It is as if the little Ichtyanders bear witness to the fact that life on the land escaped the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is in the womb of the mother for about 9 months in the fruit water, and that it can get used to water more easily.
In principle, this is logical, since only 2 weeks pass from birth to first swimming.
"It's too little time to forget something," says baby swimming teacher Marina Aksenowa.
Thus, while weightlessness is a much more natural condition for a newborn child, the woman does not come out without gravity.
In the state of gravity, the abdominal and pelvic muscles are rapidly developing and thus the ability to push out the child is reduced.
All right, let's get around the tool.
For example, the birth could also take place in a special chamber to push out the child.
"But what happens then?" is the not insignificant question of Waleri Poljakow.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the imagination, the organism cannot train the skeleton and the muscles.
In orbit, a newborn child cannot be put into a suit like an adult for training.
He will simply lack what is of fundamental importance to his life.
"This experiment, which we are doing together, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead to the birth of a disabled person, a completely unadapted person," predicts the head of the Bioethics Commission of the Institute for Medical-Biological Problems RAN, Igor Pestow.
So far, the birth of children in space is mere theory.
At some point, however, it becomes a reality when the earth's inhabitants in their spaceships set out to become a distant planet that will be home to their descendants born in space.
NKÚ Chief: Black system control fails due to political indebtedness
The Czech Republic has good control bodies and adequate laws in connection with public procurement, but falls back on their application.
In the discussion for Aktuálně.cz this is said by the Vice-President of the Supreme Control Office (Neuvyšší kontrolní úřad, NKÚ), Miloslav Kala.
"A law is never perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and I do not think this is the case with us," Kala comments on the current situation.
A similar result appears to be a joint control by Czech and German auditors.
As a negative example of practice, he leads the attitude of Prime Minister Petr Nečas to the so-called "black system".
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not bother entrepreneurs with controls - is the system now prohibited or permitted?
"A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then the chairman of the government cannot simply come, and the control office, whose duty is to control compliance with the law, can hinder its activity," Kala notes.
At the meeting of the Chamber of Deputies' Control Committee, you discussed a joint Czech-German project in which the laws of both countries relating to public procurement were compared.
What was that specifically about?
This is a parallel examination that we started about two years ago.
In simple terms, it is a matter of European legislation defining how public procurement can be handled, on which the national legislation is based, and finally there is the actual practical application.
We compared all of this with each other, and although the examination has not yet been completed, we were able to see very interesting differences. In general, the laws are perhaps even more "harder and more perfect", but the actual application in Germany is better in some parameters.
This confirms that it is not enough to set new and more precise rules over and over again. One must also consider the actual application of the law.
How can the project help you? What is the result of this project for you?
This kind of joint control could help us to stop constantly trying to perfect the laws and reduce and erode thresholds if this does not seem to have a particularly positive effect.
Economic efficiency means acquiring a thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and excluding unlawful enrichment or even criminal acts.
But the reduction of thresholds for contracts does not guarantee that we also achieve this goal.
Perhaps it is even so that in this way we burden the system only with excessive "paperwork" and those looking for gaps in the system have much easier to use the system than if the thresholds remained higher.
They talk about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech procurement law.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an authority similar to our NKÜ, or does the system work differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the German counterpart to the NKÚ of the Bundeskonsultshof, which is similar to that of us and also has a college, which is just a little different, but in principle, both authorities work similarly.
The competences are also comparable to some extent, but Germany is a state, i.e. there are these accounting courts in the individual federal states - in this the German system differs from ours.
The BRH can only control federal funds, which corresponds to our state resources.
Public funds managed by the districts and municipalities are subject to the control of the national accounting authorities.
As far as German legislation is concerned, is it easier than ours?
In general, I would be reluctant to compare this without specific information. Nevertheless, Germany is often referred to as a model in some respects, but one certainly cannot say that Germany is better in all things.
Is that perhaps because the examiners are better there?
That certainly does not happen, but, as I said, I do not particularly like such comparisons.
It should also be noted that those countries that are a model for us also face problems.
Otherwise they wouldn't have anything to do with working with our authority, would they?
As far as Czech legislation is concerned, what was the significance for your authority of the amendment of the award law, do you already feel any impact?
In view of the fact that this amendment is only in force for a short time, it does not yet have an effect on our tests.
As our controls take place later, we have to expect a certain amount of delay here.
So far, we are more likely to experience effects in the preparatory phase of future controls - so we have introduced the new control instrument "Acknowledgment of risks of inefficiency" and tested and analysed with this nearly 14,000 public procurement - here the changes will naturally have an effect, as the thresholds change, the conditions for certain types of tenders have been modified, among other things.
Do you see the adoption of this law more positively, or is the system burdened with further bureaucracy?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction and I hope that this adoption will be confirmed.
However, the problem may arise that the rules will become "more stringent" and can no longer be complied with.
Already under the previous rules, the persons subject to an audit are accountable to the institution (for example, in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, the Regional Council) to the effect that any non-compliance with the award law is equivalent to a breach of budgetary discipline.
But does it make sense to make the law even more stringent?
I do not think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system and not punish those who have made a formal error that does not affect the actual decision-making process.
Such a system puts only red tape under even greater pressure.
Where's the way out?
Let us first say which way is not targeted.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not relieve entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called "black system" - what exactly does that mean?
Is the black system now prohibited or allowed?
After all, a law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then it cannot simply come to the chairman of the government, and the control office, whose duty is to control compliance with the law, can hinder its activity.
He can say, "We change the law and allow the thing," but he cannot say that we do as if nothing were happening.
The award law contains relatively strict rules on the formal execution of certain transactions - and this is also right for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, it is also tragic if the bidder is excluded with the best offer only due to form errors.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and that is what my E. lacks.
On the streets there are single ice sheets, but they are mostly dry.
On the streets of the Czech Republic there are some snow and ice sheets.
Most of the roads, however, are well accessible, sometimes with increased caution.
Karlsbad
In the district of Karlovy Vary, the streets were well accessible this morning, and some snow and ice smooths ruled.
Temperatures dropped to -5 to -10 °C, during the day it should become slightly warmer.
In the region it no longer snows, and in the lower altitudes only a thin snow cover remains.
However, about 30 cm of snow lies on the ridges of the Erzgebirge.
According to the district road guard there was limited visibility due to fog.
The R6 motorway and the first class roads in the region are currently fully accessible.
However, attention should be paid, for example, to bridges on which the lanes are sometimes required and smooth.
Also accessible are all traffic routes of the second and third class, including mountain roads.
However, snow remains on these roads in part required or eliminated.
Increased attention is therefore needed, particularly in the higher levels.
Districts of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
On some streets of East Bohemia there is danger due to ice smooths, in higher locations and in the mountains there is sometimes an excavated layer of snow on the roads, the road and motorway management reports on its websites.
The road championships warn drivers of ice smoothing, which may occur in higher locations in the district of Pardubice.
In particular, ice smoothing may occur on roadways of the second and third class in the districts of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy and Vysoké Mýto.
Roads I/43 and I/34 at Svitavy are chemically treated.
Snow lies especially on the streets in the Giant Mountains and in the Orlické hory mountain range.
An excavated layer of snow lies on the streets of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In Eastern Bohemia it is mostly sunny or cheerful today, and it remains largely precipitation-free.
Temperatures move between -3 and +1 °C, a weak wind blows.
Pilsen District
The streets in the district of Pilsen are well accessible today, but local attention is needed, and the driving style is to be adapted to the weather.
This is frosty in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below the freezing point.
As it has snowed before and the temperatures subsequently fell, ice smoothing may occur on the streets.
In addition, fog is expected to occur locally, but the view will be improved in the course of the day.
This information is from the district road championships.
The D5 motorway is virtually fully accessible, but increased attention is recommended by the road championships between the 80th and the 131th kilometers.
The roadways of the first class are mainly dry, but frozen.
However, in the south of the circles Pilsen and Tachov, ice smooths can occur in part.
The roadways of the second and third classes are damp, and therefore the reference to possible required sections is also valid here.
Drivers should be particularly careful on the less frequent roads in the area of Bohemian forest.
Olomouc District
Today, snow mache has to expect riders in the direction of the altitudes in the Olomouc district.
After the use of scattered vehicles, snowmach remains on the pass Červenohorské sedlo and on the road towards Videlský kříž.
Night snow driving forced the road championships to use, in the Šumperk district about 3 cm of new snow fell according to the road administration.
In the other areas of the district, the lanes are usually fully accessible.
"In the Šumperk circle, snow remains in the altitudes.
On the pass Červenohorské sedlo the drivers have to count on snowmach in the direction of Jeseník," said a staff member of the Šumperk Road Administration today to the agency ČTK.
Their colleagues in the Jeseník district also had to get out at night, according to their data, the roads are free and wet to the altitudes after chemical treatment.
In the Olomouc district, the roads are fully accessible, but in the Šternberk district, drivers have to drive cautiously in forest sections, as the tracks are still wet.
Ústí nad Labem District, Liberec District
In northern Bohemia, the road championships report several badly accessible sections of the road.
In addition to several places with snow or ice smooths, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice in the district of Ústí n.K. is closed according to the traffic police.
The temperatures remain below zero, so that snow and ice will remain on the streets. There are no problems from the low plains, especially southeast of the Bohemian mid-mountain, and the roads are usually dry there.
No traffic disturbances have been reported so far.
Ice creams are reported from the Štětí area in particular.
According to meteorologists, there were ideal conditions during the night - during the day rain and melting snow, at night cloudless sky and frost.
The main routes and road I/13 on the border of the districts Ústí n.L. and Liberec report bad traffic conditions.
The blockage of the road between Telnice and Knínice was necessary due to branches that were pressed from the snow load to the road.
Šimon Ornest: At our concerts we want to collect positive energy
What do you think is going to happen in less than a month of the world downfall?
This is one of the reports of disasters that we people like to jump to.
With our band The Tap Tap, we're rather funny about it and say that we're the only band in the world that can collect enough positive energy to stop or prevent the world's downfall.
In December you will also realize a unique project with three concerts against the world's downfall.
Can you introduce the project to our readers?
It is a national benefit event that we have been planning for two years.
For this purpose, we want to use the marketing potential of the Maya calendar, which is forecast for the end of December 21st at 11:10 a.m.
On the day before, i.e. on December 20, three concerts will be held in Prague, Brno and Ostrava at the same time as from 21:00.
The end of the concerts is to be about the time when the Maya calendar ends on the Pacific Island of Kiribati, which is in a time zone around 12 hours before us.
Who's this idea from?
Originally probably from me, then we designed the idea together with our graphic artist Honza Augusta.
Not only do we want to collect enough positive energy to prevent the world's downfall, but we also want to think together with the public about the state in which we once hand over this world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Maya calendar, we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags and keychains against the global downfall, with which people can also support us with their purchase via www.e-tap.cz.
The band The Tap Tap, together with other performers, also recorded the so-called anthem against the world's downfall, entitled "World Fall Out".
Already today the anthem is very popular on YouTube. Will it also sound at the benefit concerts?
Of course, at the very end, provided that everything works and the world's downfall does not take place...
The anthem is to be sung simultaneously by all performers on all three concerts.
In addition, the anthems are broadcast live in a direct circuit by Czech television.
The text of the anthem comes from Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main character of Jesus in the video clip, also sings Xindl X with...
How did you get to work with both of them?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, which is linked to the fact that we realize many benefit events and concerts...
We strive to involve these people intensively in our projects.
It has shown that most people are interested in working with us and have fun.
What is the purpose of the proceeds of the concerts against the downfall of the world?
For the establishment of the barrier-free educational centre Studeo, which we have been working on for six years together with the Tap Association at the Jedlička Institute.
The students of the Jedlička Institute are regularly cared for by readers who help them with various leisure activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the means to visit the readers, we want to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedlička Institute, we are to create our own building in which we will then move in with this project.
At each concert several groups and performers perform.
What criteria did you choose?
We wanted to put together a program that addresses all generations including children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, support lesbians, illustration with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý perform.
You can find everything else on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar major events planned for the future?
In May we will perform for the first time in Prague Spring, and also for this concert we will prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year, we would also like to appear in the Czech House in New York, and I personally - if we are in the United States - would also like to link this with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not very small, so far you have already occurred in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap, however, is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you handle these trips logistically and organizationally?
It's not as bad as it appears at first sight.
Five of our members are wheelchairs, i.e. the wheelchairs have to be transported in the luggage room. In addition, of course, we have to carry many instrument suitcases and other luggage with us...
Nevertheless, it has always been without problems so far, ČSA and British Airways have always been very well prepared for us, that sometimes I have already wondered.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
Through your travel abroad, you have a comparison of what it looks like in the individual countries with accessibility, how to deal with disabled people, etc.
How have you experienced these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than with us, we were witnessing in Russia that everything in the East is still in its beginnings.
Moscow is absolutely not disabled-proof against Prague. There it is still unusual if someone is travelling in the wheelchair alone in the city centre.
It is not even natural there for example to present a wheelchair driver in the elevator.
Fortunately, there are associations that try to point out the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what way do we need to catch up with the more developed countries?
There's a lot of things we're gonna hang out in after...
It should be noted, however, that improving the situation always depends on the efforts of those concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is absolutely common for people with severe disabilities to move independently in public space, go to the museum, use toilets, etc.
But it is not common for a larger group of disabled people to actively participate in social events there, in which we are a little ahead of the West with the band The Tap Tap!
Respect in the public and accessibility is one thing, but only when important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come from our ranks will things really start to change.
So far, these are only individual cases of particularly willful personalities.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but if we go back a few years, what motivated you to start a band in 1998?
At that time I started as a supervisor at the Jedlička Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in dealing with something very intensive.
And since I am a musician myself and play saxophone, among other things, I have founded a music AG together with a colleague.
Well, with time, as our moderator, Láća Angelovič, has said, it has become out of control (laughs).
But has the band become known only in recent years, or am I mistaken?
It is true that the collaboration with well-known singers has helped us; in addition, we have also started to actively advertise for us.
We have become aware that if you do something and you can't see it outside, your own performance doesn't exist in a sense.
Thanks to the EU funding, we can also afford good readers, high-quality equipment and so on.
Was it your goal to get it so far with The Tap Tap?
From the very beginning, I have felt the potential that things can be dealt with differently.
In the show business today, one often copies the other.
This is logical in his way, as all new things are considered with caution and only after a long time accepted.
There are only a few really unique things, and I dare to say that Tap Tap is part of it.
Of course, the first impression most of the spectators have is pity; that's only natural...
But this pity is absolutely superfluous, because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned beings that we should regret.
They are people who can live and develop a full life, provided that they have the necessary means to do so.
I always say that when people with disabilities succeed, this is not only a step forward for themselves, but for society as a whole.
Was it also helpful for this success that you are a strict boss, how to hear from many people?
If you want to do something good, you must not compromise in many things and you must also demand a certain discipline.
In my view, this is perfectly normal.
Some come to us with romantic ideas, and if they find that they have twice a week of trial, have to do preparatory phases, and spend a lot of time on concert trips, then the enthusiasm with many will be lost quickly.
But that's how it works everywhere, in every band that wants to work seriously and achieve something.
Currently, The Tap Tap has twenty members.
How many of them have been there since the beginning, i.e. since 1998?
Only one: Láża Angelovič.
We're an open group, people come and go.
Whoever has the will and the desire to participate is always welcome with us.
Takes place on the day before the forecasted world downfall, Thursday, 20.12.2012 at 21:00
The venues include: Incheba-Arena/Prag, Fléda/Brno and Plynojem/Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
All three venues are finally connected by live circuit and it sounds like a common interpretation of the anthem of the band The Tap Tap.
The aim of the concert is to raise the resources for the provision of a multifunctional disability education centre, which is to be established under the name of STUDEO at the Jedlička Institute in Prague. Cost point: 25 million CZK
Admission costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years free of charge, tickets are available on pre-sale at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and space.
Last week, Poland was accepted as the 20th member of this Space Authority at a Council of Ministers meeting of the member countries of the European Space Agency ESA. Poland is thus the second member country from the former Eastern Bloc (according to the Czech Republic, which became ESA member on 12 November 2008).
Poland started working closely with ESA in 1994 and participated in several ESA projects in the following years.
The path of Poland to space, of course, began much earlier.
Before the Second World War, Polish cosmos enthusiasts were already engaged in space travel, and they did not always come to understand it.
I recall, for example, the lecture by A. Šternfeld on 6 December 1933 at the Warsaw Observatory, where the author presented ideas from his pioneering work "Entry to Cosmonautics".
However, the ideas of the young engineer (b. 1905) left the listeners cold, and after years Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld won the Prix REP-Hirsch, donated by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch, for "Entry to Cosmomics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became an important advocate of astronomy and space.
In Polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski's internationally recognized contribution to the development of space was appreciated, among other things, by the fact that one of the craters on the earth's side of the moon was named after him.
As early as 1925, a railway draisine was built in Poland, for which a rocket engine was planned.
The author of the draft and the details of this project unfortunately remained unknown.
It is not even clear whether the rocket should be used to launch or brake the drain.
The information comes exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry began to deal with rocket-powered shots.
The research was carried out by the Institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslav Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
It can be seen from the documents that have been passed that research had reached the stage of practical tests.
The research was, of course, interrupted by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937, the design of a photoelectric hunting rocket appeared in the specialist press of Rohoziński, and the following year, the work "Rakieta - torpeda powietzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" was published by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky.
Both projects dealt with the military use of the rocket drive.
Shortly before the war, all the projects for the military use of rocket technology were coordinated by the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Committee Doradczo-Naukowy).
The Committee was set up in 1937, but after two years of work its work was finished from the beginning of the war.
Further articles on space were published after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Space Society (Polkie Towarzystwo Astronautczne) in the Polish press.
The first mention of this society was made in 1954 in the November issue of the magazine Problemy, in which four extensive articles of space are devoted.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal for the establishment of a space society.
At the time there were already the first projects on satellite technology, and it was to be noted that the exploration of space would have future.
Already in its beginnings in 1956, the Polish Space Society PTA sought to join the International Federation for Space, founded in 1951, and in fact the PTA became a regular member as early as autumn 1956.
The following year the first PTA President, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), was appointed Deputy President of the International Federation of Space.
In 1959, he was appointed to the post of President of the United States.
Since 1956, the PTA has played a major role in the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish rocket for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first one was launched on 10 October 1958.
The rocket with a maximum flight height of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and did not weigh quite 5 kg.
Later, an improved version, the RM-1A, was built, and in 1959 the Błędów desert began flight tests with the two-stage RM-2 rocket.
The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another stage of development should already be able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should reach altitudes of up to 14.5 km and be used for the observation of altitude winds.
However, further development was discontinued in 1962.
The first RM rocket was replaced by the Meteor 1 rocket developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket, its total length was 510 cm and the starting weight was 32,5 kg.
Three types (meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed from this rocket, which differed in the size of the transport space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a transport room with a capacity of 0.4 litres, meteor-1B over 0.34 litres and meteor-1C over 0.62 litres.
The maximum flight altitude was 37 km for all three types.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor 2 rocket was developed at the Aviation Institute, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to transport a payload of 10 kg at a height of about 60 km.
The Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were then built.
Also worth mentioning is Poland's accession to the Committee for Space Research (COSPAR) in 1960, followed two years later by the establishment of a national COSPAR committee.
Poland also participated in space research with Soviet satellites as part of the Intercosmos programme, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became second intercosmonaut after the Czech Vladimír Remek.
The abolition of the law on non-profit work is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court lifted the law on non-profit work.
This decision aroused a lively discussion in the public.
It is certainly interesting to look at the problem from a broader perspective.
The liberal economy systems in the EU and in the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the final analysis, this means that the individual economies are in a permanent conflict.
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and the free, unlimited movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with careless financial speculation.
Due to the large differences in the value of labour (wages), price tensions occur.
This term refers to a condition in which the manufacturer tries to exist in economic competition through imports of cheap goods, by "subscribing" competition, in order to create a greater market share and increase its profits.
On a large scale, this means that most companies move their production abroad or buy it cheaply, or give up their business. The result is high unemployment in countries with comparablely high labour costs.
Since private capital does not bear any social responsibility and therefore does not bear any responsibility for the unemployment caused by it, public expenditure necessarily increases.
This situation is reinforced by the fact that Mr. Entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and thereby replace the overall social and economic damage they cause.
This situation is generally known, so that concrete statistics are unnecessary at this point.
The reckless practice of private capital creates a situation in the individual economies in which governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own population and thus lure foreign capital into the country.
In other words, governments deliver private capital to their own peoples without regard for the social consequences.
This is reflected in particular in amendments to existing legislation.
The aim of these measures is to force their own people to accept the private capital dictatorship, particularly in the area of wages.
This is done on the one hand by economic compulsion in the event of long-term unemployment, and on the other by the circumcision of workers' rights.
The result is growing poverty, as well as increasing differences between the poor and the rich.
In Germany, there have been public food tax offices for poor people for some years now, which are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work.
The number of persons concerned is already going to the millions.
As a result of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there are regular cases where workers receive such a low wage that the state has to increase its income up to the minimum level of existence.
Such a scandal has also been detected in the case of auxiliary workers employed in the German Bundestag.
The austerity measures will undoubtedly go out of line with the same situation in which people are forced to emigrate under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of their social level (as was the case in the 19th century) or to pay for a hunger wage on the outskirts of society, hoping that sometime private investment capital will flow into the country.
Here, of course, the question arises of where this capital comes from?
When it comes from another EU country, only poverty migrates from one country to another; or capital remains completely out of place, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt or Africa, workers work for a fraction of European wages.
This concerns all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and media claim until now that the state is not allowed to participate in its own economy with capital, and that planning economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital insists closely on its view that the state should not intervene in the economy.
But then one has to wonder whether private capital does not influence or even govern politics and thus the entire state in its own selfish sense.
Here is the clear answer: Yes.
The proof of this is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and omnipresent lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, mutual prejudice, a legislation in which practically everything is tough but nothing punishable.
In Germany, the situation is such that a state ministry, because of a lack of finance, is entrusted with the preparation of legislative drafts for private legal entities closely related to industry.
These draft laws will then be adopted in the Bundestag.
All violence is no longer from the people, as the Western constitutions proclaim, but from strong financial groups that prefer their own interests.
Clearly, the liberal democracies are now rapidly getting into a situation as described by Appian in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic at the time of Caesar and Pompeius: "The state had long been in decay, and the offices were occupied with violence.
Against lubricating money, through unlawful proliferation of benefits or with stone and sword.
Corruption grew inconsistency, and the people went to the election with already bought voices" ... "People with character did not apply for offices, so that the state did not have a consul for eight months as a result of this downfall" ... "You really started to talk about the only medicine in this difficult situation being an exclusive rulership, and that a strong man had to be elected"... While Appian thought of Pompey, the strong man was finally Caesar, who permanently replaced democracy with the rule of his own.
As can be seen, today's society, as in ancient times, is based on the unrelenting preference of its own advantage, without paying attention to the interests of society as a whole.
From its very nature, private capital is not able to recognize and enforce the advantage for society as a whole.
The result today, as at the time, is an unprecedented decadence of the elites, who are not in the least seeking deeper reforms.
The cause of the rise of fascism and Communism must therefore be looked for in the ruthless liberalisation of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
From today's state, the demise of these regimes can be seen as a certain break in favour of liberal democracy, in which the next round is already taking place.
Especially disastrous is the fact that today's elites face the possible losses of hundreds of thousands of human lives, the humanitarian and social disasters we are witnessing today, as well as the crimes against humanity, as we know them from older and more recent history, in perfect ignorance.
The abolition of the law on non-profit work is not a solution here, at least not a permanent one.
Under the pressure of global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue looking for ways to lower the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore system-related.
The only solution is targeted political and social reforms, which increase the state's participation in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society in favour of the state.
Israel: Laboratory of Chaos.
"...that nothing arises from violence, or could ever arise," sings Sting in the song Fragile, whose most important verse is in the chorus: "...so that we don't forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons didn't want war, there wouldn't be any," says the dying Good Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there were, as always, a number of reactions.
Some of them stand behind Israel and argue with its right to self-defense while calling the Palestinians terrorists; others support the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the Israeli state, with the genocide committed on the Palestinian Arabs, and call the State of Israel a terrorist.
At this point, I do not want to write about those who are guilty and who are victims in these recurring waves of killing; in the end, today's inhabitants of Israel, including self-government, were born into the current political situation and did not experience the beginning of violence itself.
It's about opening the eyes of the readers behind the scenes, looking at who the 95 years of tension (calculated from the Balfour declaration in November 1917) in the small spot country in the Middle East are especially useful.
My thoughts are partly based on accessible historical facts, others are derived from them, and my own understanding shows who or what group of people has a significant influence on the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is primarily a story of the struggle for power.
In every epoch, we can make up an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
That which is less obvious is the question whether it was really always these personalities themselves who autonomously determined their steps, or whether they were behind their throne someone who directed their actions towards a predetermined goal.
We must admit that we are living at a time when the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hands of fewer individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power has not arisen within the life span of a generation.
Among these astronomicalally rich families, there is a particularly prominent one that could be described as head of the crack (I don't know if there's anyone above them, but I don't rule it out) - the Rothschilds.
Much is not written about them.
Understandably.
The first press agency (Reuters) was purchased by the Rothschilds in the 1990s in order to prevent the connection of its name with highly criminal acts, in which the strengthening of its power, the increase of its assets or both always stood.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all central banks of the world, and against the countries in which they are not involved in central banks, they wage wars or prepare for them (before the attack on Afghanistan, there were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq, there were 5 countries, after the fall of Ghaddafis, only four more, with Russia now subordinated its central bank to the Russian government).
Whoever tried to oppose this family had to pay for it with life.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew Rothschild's bank of America as a central bank, began to issue his own (state) banknotes during the civil war, and was murdered in a theater in 1865.
J.F. Kennedy began to issue his own banknotes and wanted to abolish the FED - he was murdered in 1963; Louis McFadden's Member was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the FED for triggering the global economic crisis in 1929.
In the years 1859 - 1871, the Rothschild's global desire for power led to the formulation of a plan for the development of three world wars by Albert Pik, a freemason of the 33rd and thus highest degree of knowledge.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great monarchistic states of Europe, the second war should break the colonial rule of Britain in particular, and the third war should reduce the world's population to about 0.5 - 1 billion people (such a number would provide for their amenities and luxury and would not consume so many resources), create a universal religion (ecumenicalism is nothing more than the prelude here) and ultimately lead to the taking over of absolute power.
The method with which the group of the richest families with the Rothschilds is at the forefront is the triggering of a crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution (order from chao - order from chaos).
These solutions, however, are false and always lead to the deterioration of the situation (see founding of the FED so that crises such as those caused by them in 1907 do not repeat themselves).
After they had succeeded in triggering the First World War through the murder of the Habsburg throne successor Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the Russian Tsar Empire by the Bolshevik Revolution.
The First World War ended with the sudden, military and economically unfounded capitulation of Germany (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of the Russian Tsar empire), then the disintegration of the Central European great power of Austria-Hungary took place.
In order to facilitate World War II, the bankers created a latent conflict situation through politics by occupying Germany with huge war repairs, creating the condition of poor masses, so that they only had to cheer the Germans under a sufficiently strong leader who offered the debtors designated and simple solutions; another factor was the creation of the multi-national state of Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which should occupy the function of a fifth five, and also took on the function of fueling the war fire.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds initiated the establishment of the Zionist movement, in which a branch sought the establishment of a Jewish state, as far as possible in the historical territory of Judea with Jerusalem as capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration mentioned earlier created the prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; there were first conflicts with the native Arab population.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler was tearing away from the chain in which the international bankers had initially held him, or whether everything was going according to plan, it is difficult to estimate, in any case, the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the prerequisite for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and just as the war repairs against Germany prepared the ground for World War II, the proclamation of the state of Israel represents the creation of the focal point for World War III.
If the international bankers are able to unleash this war, the Jewish people will become a victim in the front line of battle, this time together with the Arab and Muslim populations of the Middle East, as in the Second World War.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of strife and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (you only remember how sharply people divide themselves into followers and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim of the conflict between Palestinians and Israelites, where injustice only causes injustice in an endless spiral of violence, in the beginning the greed of individuals and their quest for global power?
It is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leadership, but the international bankers in Israel, as well as with us, the people, only place their own candidates for election.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, the falke Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascism-prone international banker loyally devoted politician, who is doing everything possible to incite a war with Iran, which, in the face of Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), could quickly expand to a global conflict, and in which, because of Iran's control over the only two-mile-wide road from Hormus, over which 20% of the world's oil supplies run, the world economy could be destroyed.
In what light do the words of David Rockefeller from 1994 appear: "The only thing we need is an all-encompassing crisis, and people will welcome the new world order."
In its imagination, the new world order is a world of lords and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves a small group of financial aristocrats.
A world in which every newborn at birth is implanted a chip to subdue this being to total control.
"And it does that the little ones and the great ones, the rich and the poor, the frees and the servants all give themselves a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, that no one can buy or sell, but he has the sign, namely, the name of the beast or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom, and whoever has understanding, let him consider the number of the beast.
For there is a man number, and his number is sixty-six hundred."
The film Argo: If it's worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of demonstrating Islamic students occupied the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats as hostages.
For their release, they demanded the delivery of the crashed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled to the United States after the revolution, who had kept the cartridge over his regime for decades.
There was no positive way out of this situation for the American government - it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, as this would have greatly damaged the trust of its allies in other countries.
At the same time, it was unable to enforce the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was a severe blow to the reputation of the united states, and the subsequent Fiasco in the violent attempt to release hostages made everything worse.
The prisoners were finally released after 444 days after negotiations by the Algerian government had been arranged.
The fate of the hostages caused at home a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranic moods.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to Jimmy Carter's defeat against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film Argo by director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story that gave the USA a small partial victory.
Immediately before the occupation of the message, six embassies succeeded in fleeing.
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to bring the refugees from Iran; an extravagant story helped them to hide their true identity - they traveled with Canadian passports disguised as members of a film stand, allegedly visiting film locations in the country for a science fiction film.
Combination of genres
The plan developed by the expert for "Exfiltration", Tony Mendez, also required the cooperation of Hollywood.
To make the cover credible, articles about this film project appeared in journals, press conferences were held, and the fictitious production company had a real office.
The details of this operation were kept secret for a long time, based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a special combination of several film genres.
On the one hand, he is a realistic political thriller, but at the same time a so-called "Caper Movie", i.e. the story of a successful Husar piece such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
Thus the mood levels alternate in the film - on the one hand the documentary scenes from Tehran (in the title sequence iconic contemporary photographs are shown, and also in the film version of the same situations there are no major differences).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, which come ironically and slightly uppermost.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at the meeting table, on the official hallways, on the phone...
With this film, Ben Affleck has succeeded in a remarkable restart to his career.
A smiled actor has become a respectable director, and as an actor he is no longer the goal of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after the Krimi No Children's Game (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the Thriller City without Grace (2010).
At the same time, it is Affleck's first film that doesn't play in the director's home Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of the place was one of the features that removed the previous films of this director from the standard Hollywood.
Affleck proves this feeling, however, in Argo, where Tehran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film play in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that have really taken place - the opening sequence of the first storm of the message is very impressive in its clarity, yet conveys the feeling of confusion and unpredictability that occurs when the story moves somewhere.
Affleck and his team have a similar effect in fictitious scenes (the wrong film staff on a bazaar in Tehran).
Too much action in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story does not really offer many exciting scenes in the cinematic sense.
With the few, however, he works quite successfully, sometimes helping with reality - which does not always seem so elegant (the scenes in which the imminent crisis at the airport in Tehran is averted by a telephone call in America, or also the pursuit on the runway, appear somewhat artificial).
The weakness of Argo is its all too wide scatter, which is due to the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, but their figures deserve more space, so they are far from alone in the film.
Affeck’s film thus loses a bit of tensile strength. It is a film that can be followed with a certain interest and the design and the retro-style reminiscent of a thriller from the 70th years.
But enthusiasm is hard to awaken.
However, as a reminder of a piece of history that is still alive in a certain way today and as evidence of how overlaid the ideas of all-powerful and all-knowing intelligence services are, he is sufficient.
Guidelines for inflating balloons, bananas and circuses
The www.bankovnipoplatky.com server, which launches an annual survey of the most absurd bank fees, decided this year to organise the competition "Absurdest Regulation or Idea from the EU Workshop".
"On this idea, the recent EU plan to introduce a 40% women's rate in the management of large European companies" said Patrik Nacher, who takes care of the organisation of this survey, to the newspaper Právo.
For example, there is the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the harmonization of insurance rates for men and women.
Until then, women have enjoyed an advantage in life insurance because they represent an objectively lower risk for insurance companies.
"More incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will take place until the end of February 2013", said Nacher.
Controversial EU regulations include the binding addition of bioethanol to fuels that are consequently harmful to nature, the prohibition of reliable mercury thermometers, only because they contain a relatively small amount of this dangerous substance, or the directive on the size of chicken cages, which has made eggs much more expensive this year.
Criticism also reaped in the past the factual ban on the use of the term "butter spread" or also the ban on sale for conventional light bulbs.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU apparat often decides under pressure from this or that lobby of trade and industry, whose claims are usually represented in Brussels by one or more Member States (for example, the Czech Republic is currently trying to enforce the demands of Czech banks with veto threat).
Lobby interests also insisted that bananas of the highest class of trade in the EU should be at least 14 cm long and should not have a "shrinking anomaly".
The European Commission defended itself with the argument that it merely harmonises the uniform national standards that would hinder trade.
Standards on fruit and vegetables have already been weighed by the EU against the resistance of some countries to the fact that the previous directives would lead to food waste.
A candidate for victory in this survey may be the EU Regulation of last year, which, according to balloons, must be indicated when selling that children under eight years of age are not allowed to blow up the balloon without the supervision of an adult.
The EU called for an American study, which according to balloons is the leading cause of the suffocation of children.
A similar restriction already applies to children up to 14 years of age when using market torts.
Curiose Ideas There Are Also At Home
It is also relatively absurd for a directive that concerns European officials themselves - anyone who has an official role in the EU must not use the name Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the topic to Greece and must instead say FYROM (Former Yugoslavia Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankovnípoplatky.com server nominated, in cooperation with the Association of Liberal Economists Laissez Faire, alongside the above-mentioned absurdities, the EU regulation on the extent of food supplies in the field of a member country.
The EU thus set the maximum level of food supplies that could be found in the Czech Republic on the day of our accession.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the fixed volume for mushroom canning, which threatened us with a high fine.
The organisers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for not having a sea, or for the idea of providing funding for applications for grants.
These ideas were of course not from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are disadvantaged by having no sea.
We will apply for a refund from the EU," said the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he argued that the grain harvest had been very high and that the state camps had been overcrowded as a result of the so-called intervention purchases.
As the Czech Republic has another way to seaports, according to Palas, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
Finally, the European Commission met the Czech Republic so far that it organised a tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
Funding for applications for grants offered the municipalities the Ministry of Regional Development under the direction of Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), which should be the funding for setting up grant applications to Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
While regulations in the Member States are becoming easily the target of criticism, the EU's efforts to regulate and thus also to develop effectively and effectively the whole of the European Union, some experts believe they deserve more recognition.
In the opinion of these experts, a more serious problem is the EU funding for projects that have nothing to do with the deepening of European integration, but which were forced into the budgetary negotiations of individual Member States.
Emotions also highlight the fact that the Czech Republic, like other Member States in Brussels, must fight for the right to use specific designations of traditional products and not always win this fight.
However, after a six-year struggle with Germany and Austria, the Czech Republic was able to defend the name "Olomoucké tvarůžky", the native centre (Tuzemský rum), whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, but our manufacturers had to rename it to "Tuzemák".
The name Rum must only be used for products made from sugar cane distillate, not sugar beet products.
In the official list of products registered in the EU, the company of the world-famous cheese varieties Feta and Gorgonzola, the Lübeck Marzipan or the Parma ham now also includes the Karlovy Vary Zwieback, carp from Pohořelice and Třeboň, or the Saaz hop.
With an EU brand, the Pardubicer gingerbread or the Hořicer roles can be brewed.
"People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur," says Okamura.
Mr Senator, how can we find the idea of running for the President's office?
It's not about being Senator or President.
If everything worked without problems in our country, I wouldn't run anywhere.
But I can no longer look at how the Republic has been plundered for 20 years, how thieves are running freely, while people are increasing taxes and retirement age.
I had no ambitions to become a politician.
But if I see something that I do not like, I try to propose a solution to change it.
And since I'm already over 40, and independent and non-partisan, I have no other way to influence things than to run for the office of a senator or president.
You made it to the Senate and then you set out for the castle.
Don't you turn your back on your voters?
I have always told myself that I will take up the fight for the castle after the result of the Senate elections.
Later I specified this and said that I would run for the President's office if I was elected Senator.
My goal, however, is not the function. The function is an instrument with which I can realize my visions.
This requires as much influence as possible and a strong mandate as possible.
The difficulty, however, is not only that as a people in the pub and in front of the TV, we are scoffing at anyone who wants to change something.
In addition, the media, who want to rob one of the honors, and who confuse the freedom of the word with freedom to lie.
About me, for example, it was claimed that I would bribe journalists or that I was a consultant to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your visions.
You have taken up the struggle for the castle with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians as well as with retroactive statements of assets over 20 million crowns.
To do this, you need to change laws.
As President, you have no powers in this respect, and only the Senate as a whole can make legislative proposals.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I have worked to ensure that the guide remains a free trade, and this could be enforced.
The problem is small-minded policy - if someone comes from the right or from the left with a good proposal, this is deliberately rejected, and this only stops the population.
As an independent partyless person, I have a far greater potential to gain support from all parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that I can take from any party what is best for our country without any drawers and party dogs.
Do you see yourself as a person in politics rather right or left?
From a Czech point of view, it seems to me that people see me on the left.
For me, however, this right-left thinking is completely unimportant.
For me, it's important that we move on.
It's not about whether someone belongs to the left or to the right camp; I want to connect people.
I always publicly support every good solution, even if it comes from the KSČM or from the ODS, and I will also oppose bad ideas.
You don't like it if someone calls you populists.
But don't you confirm that by what you just said?
If you create a business plan in a company, you also have an ideal goal and a vision.
And you want to approach this one.
This can be described as populism in my opinion, but all the proposals I have spoken about are already working in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without support in Parliament, you will be left with only keywords.
And you will not get far in politics in the long term.
Or do you think that if you only talk to the people long enough, you will be able to enforce, for example, physical and criminal liability?
I have no other way.
To convince politicians, journalists and the public and to try to bring them to our side in order to achieve these objectives.
As President, it would not be a problem for me to ask the chairmen of the parliamentary parties to anchor legally the substantive and criminal liability of politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And if so, those addressed would have to say why they refuse to do so.
A strong personality, pointing to abuses, can exert pressure on the political scene.
Take only once the direct election of the President who was a merit of public pressure.
I say quite clearly that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my views and visions.
I have just started politics and tried to find the support of the majority for my programme.
I always try to judge things myself; and if it doesn't work, I'll go back to the private sector in six years.
It sounds a little like Okamura was supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that I do not achieve anything alone; that is why I have talked to several well-known personalities about whether they do not want to run for the Senate.
For example, I spoke to Radim Jančura, who, however, refused to do so because of overload.
In addition, I supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who exposed fraud in trading light fuel oil.
My candidacy began with the condition that people are deeply dissatisfied, but now I am no longer sure.
Sixty percent of the electorate did not go to the elections at all, and those who left have mostly elected representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independents.
People have chosen such a Senate composition that changes will be very difficult to enforce.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, e.g. for the direct election of the mayors and district chief men.
Are you thinking about setting up your own party?
I haven't thought about that yet, because I don't have time to review the past of any potential party member, nor do I have the money for it.
I don't even have money for the presidential campaign yet; on my transparent account there are only 20,000 CZK.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about asset statements, what do you look like?
My private assets are estimated at approximately CZK 60 million.
In Prague I have a property worth 25 million, an apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection worth about 10 million, as well as an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Škodu Superb worth about a million, and then I have a few million on the account.
By the way, the Aston Martin was a child's dream - James Bond always liked me driving in the car, being gallant to women and at the same time fighting against evil.
You drive an Aston Martin, have a fortune of 60 million and don't have any money for your campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to invest your own money in it.
That's not exactly convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Do you want me to make debts?
I've already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have sponsors shows that my program probably doesn't arouse too much interest.
And I'm not obliged to fight the campaign from my own resources.
The cost of the campaign is basically covered by my salary as a senator.
But I couldn't live from the senator's salary alone; for example, I couldn't finance my son's school that costs 30,000 a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I wouldn't run for anything.
So are you continuing to work as an entrepreneur in order to have your income?
Didn't you say you're going back to these activities?
But this is not related to the amount of the salary.
As I promised, I partially took back my activities.
For example, my deputy becomes Managing Director of the travel agency in spring.
People want to see me as a Samaritan saving the Republic.
But I have to live on something.
What monthly income were you used to as an entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and that is still the case.
As President, however, I would entirely stop my business.
The full discussion can be found in the Saturday edition of Právo.
The MVRDV architects prove that the true adventures are not only in the head - by the example of nails and the recently built Buchenbergenberg - 2 photos
"I find the building funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there's something interesting to see again," says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby on the roadside.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a nearby large-scale company, says, "But it's beautiful, the house."
But I wonder what we still need a library for today.
All have Internet, iPad and e-books.
No one goes to one of these old-style libraries voluntarily today, right?
Spikenis, a hardly-observed sleeping town in front of the gates of Rotterdam, is a strange recordholder.
The 80,000-inhabitant community has the lowest educational rate in the whole of the Netherlands.
A few years ago, in order to counter this stupid circumstance, it was decided to contribute to general education and to rebuild the seven fictitious bridges shown on the euro notes as beautifully painted concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And so the city fathers realized that there was only one way to become master of statistics: a library must be here!
Winy Maas from the Rotterdam architectural office MVRDV, master of the great-kneading beam diagrams and producer of funny, yes often cynical buildings, took the thing with usual serenity and appeared for the competition hearing anno 2003 with five books under the arm and a grin in the face.
And while the jury was still mutilated to look around and tangled with the armpits, the naughty Maas stacked his noble charms of greatness into a pyramid and finished his actionist-backed speech with the words: "Dear city community!"
So this is it, my proposal for the Buchenberg von Spikenisse, for the so-called Buchenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million euros of expensive mountain was poured out.
It is part of a revitalization project, including underground garage, supermarket, post office and a few adjacent residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Buchenberg was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Thus, the faceless small town resorts, which up to now had no more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and an inconceivable ugly town hall, behind whose white facades one would tend to suspect a dairy factory to a piece of contemporary architecture richer.
In particular, however, nails now have the first public culture building in the history of their existence.
The long way to the book
The first impression: Bucheldorado under cheese bell.
There is a lift that leads through the mountain massif, but the true pleasures of space and reading open up during the walking climb of topography.
The fully glazed interior is bright and clear, the burned clinker floor and the elegant street lights clearly speak the language of a public city square.
The urban ambience is perfect.
You're already looking for parkbank, dog and football-playing boys and girls.
And books, books, books everywhere.
"Normally, the bookshelfs stand along the facade, and in the middle lies a large, dark room, which is mostly uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We have put the classic room configuration on our head and have the reading area from the inside to the outside.
The interior of the Buchenberg is skillfully used: in the middle are offices, Internet library, chess club, environmental center and house technology center.
A special delight are the black bookshelfs, which are sometimes wall paneling, sometimes scaffolding, sometimes climbers.
Optics, hapticism and smell are strange.
Even incarcerated architects and construction engineers shake the head of the unknown building material.
"We wanted to work with recycling materials here," explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality of Spikenisse, at the request of the standard.
And so one day in a Frisian farm we found a suitable waste product from agriculture.
For many years in the Netherlands, one mm of non-plastic material has been used in greenhouses and fields.
It's cheap and time-efficient.
The thin textile lasts, two seasons, after which it is ripe for the blocked waste.
For the library, the nonwovens - for the first time in these quantities - were pressed to four centimeters thick plates.
Under heat and pressure, the so-called Agricultural Plastic (KLP) discolors itself to a dark, homogeneous, loadable material that smells a bit like new cars and a bit like sports shoes.
After 105 steps you have reached the summit.
At the end of the almost 500-metre-long hiking trip, you will be rewarded not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch crocodiles and potted ficus trees.
They provide for atmosphere, but above all for the right humidity in the Literary Mountains.
Donations for the new soul
"You wouldn't believe it, but despite the many glass surfaces, this house is a demonstration project in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.
Heated and cooled with earth heat.
Although the Bucherberg is under a glass fall, the sun only shines in the interior on sunny days.
The wide wooden glue binders, which stand across the glass facade, serve as shade and capture much of the sunlight.
The room climate is very pleasant.
The rest of them do fully automatic rollos.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptics from the IT industry, already ventured to the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who even calls the Buchenberg "long overdue soul".
The reason: To open a few weeks ago, every resident was invited to donate a book from his personal inventory.
For the time being, the optical gaps in the library - currently 70,000 pieces - are to be filled.
The concept has risen.
The shelves are filled up to the top.
"Nothing is worse than a half-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation, every resident now has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it's only for the ornament.
Thus MVRDV has succeeded in the king's discipline, which is called the Identity Foundation in the Jargon.
Cuneiforms have written literature history.
As young and as uneducated as she may be.
That's finally a starting point for identity.
Szabo: "Germans have to play a bigger role"
Germany has abstained in the vote on the reception of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, expert on US-European relations, Berlin is thus balancing on a narrow diplomatic level.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had first signaled that it would vote against the request for observer status of the Palestinians at the United Nations.
But then Berlin included itself.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.
Now, however, Germany must be cautious because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I do not think it supports the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without, however, being too critical of Israel.
During the insurrection in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it was about setting up a flight ban zone.
This was finally enforced by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on important international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because it is turning its foreign policy away from a policy managed by the US, so to speak, towards a German foreign policy.
In addition, it is difficult to see that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
So the Germans find themselves between the fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still touching on their role, but they are on their way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy such as France or Great Britain.
What does a "normal" foreign policy mean in concrete terms from the German point of view?
It shows the willingness to take positions with national interests that are independent of those of the US or European partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. of exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of the other major powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests affected the attitude in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
On the one hand, Germany has large sales markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf States.
Therefore, it must be careful not to face the public, but also the elites, in the Arab countries.
This certainly plays a role.
But I wouldn't want to give too much weight to this either, that's not a completely one-sided relationship.
But it certainly plays an important role in German considerations.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the United States by abstaining from the vote in important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I believe that there is a great deal of understanding of the German position in Europe and even in the USA.
That's why I don't think this was such a dramatic break, as in the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany will even show some respect for it.
Because it does signal that as an international player it must be taken seriously and its interests must be considered.
There are different opinions on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The US, on the other hand, has clearly declared itself to be a veto.
Are there differences between the US and many European nations?
These differences have always existed because of American domestic policy.
I believe that the government under Obama is secretly well aware of the European position.
But because of the political situation here, the government cannot, of course, represent this position publicly.
I believe that the actual differences of opinion are not as big as they always appear.
If you look at the relations between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not so excited about Netanyahu's politics.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the USA on the one hand and the position of the main partners in the EU on the other?
I think that's what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, which is not the case at present.
So they cannot be part of a broader line and must instead drive things out of their own position.
That's what they're doing with the euro.
I believe that in future Germany will play a leading role in pushing Europe into a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, even because of the relationship with Israel.
That has always been a sensitive issue.
But I think the Germans are clear that they need to play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself in the role as an important international player - does Germany even want to play a leading role?
Or does Germany still have a difficult leadership role?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a greater role.
For example, if we look at the euro crisis, there will be a wide range of anti-German feelings free every time Germany assumes a greater role.
That doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
That's actually the old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
In this way, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the USA.
It must be receptive to different neighbors and opinions and that is not easy.
Now, the US's influence in European politics is constantly decreasing, but the EU is filling this vacuum at the moment, who else is?
The Germans will simply have to play a bigger role.
Even if they do not like it, it is unpleasant to them and makes it much more unpopular - c'est la vie!

"Brand protection" in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a well-known brand, Polo Ralph Lauren.
But what is Armani Polo?
There is a name which is officially registered in China, but which has nothing to do with the companies of origin.
Nevertheless, it enjoys protection as long as the actual names don't complain.
And even then, it's not clear whether they get right.
"It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, attorney at Taylor Wessing, who specializes in copyright infringements in Far East.
Every week a new case ends up on my desk.
A few additional letters are enough for the imitations to register their brands.
So Gucci simply becomes Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada you can register Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied in this way, such as the sports goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with registrations of the trade mark office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company had the trademark Zegna DF Puma protected, an art name that was also used at the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
The fact that the Chinese world champions are in copying and in the injured intellectual property is known.
In the big cities there are multi-storey department stores that sell almost exclusively forgery.
However, Pattloch's cases are different: On behalf of his clients, however, he acts that Chinese companies are officially given the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere by the brand office.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai", a passenger brand.
The word is based on "Bang Dakuan".
This means women fishing for rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt
"That's business-damaging, you have to fight it," says Pattloch.
"The brand is watered down, the solitude disappears, the image damage is enormous."
The financial losses and the process costs of the sectors concerned go to the millions, especially in the case of expensive products.
According to the market research company CLSA, China with a volume of 15 billion euros per year is the third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing.
However, deletions of dubios entries in the trademark register are difficult to reach and go into the money.
Up to nine years, the procedure can go, with uncertain outcome.
Pattloch reports cases in which the court rejected actions because after the long duration of the contested name had become "marketability".
If the plaintiff has a bad luck, he even has to pay the plagiator money because he violated his brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes the law of the jungle prevails here.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009 Daimler lost a dispute with the construction machine manufacturer Sany, the company that recently took over the German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
The Chinese can therefore still use an emblem similar to the Mercedes star.
The Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue-and-white logo that reminded of BMW; the dispute was settled, Geely had to change it.
The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China against imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore who had the famous crocodile look in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
The CTMO brand office in Beijing admitted that there were bottlenecks there in 2010 due to too little personnel and space equipment.
Last year, however, one had returned to normality from the "necessary situation in the course of work".
Thus, the stock of unprocessed opposition proceedings fell by 22 percent.
Almost 57,000 such cases were completed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 objections still await completion in the office.
Taking action against it costs a lot
As so often in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than 2010.
This is a record and means that for the tenth time in a row, China is leading the list of new registrations around the world.
This also applies to the stock of all valid trademarks, a total of 5,000 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan were collected.
This means that each application costs an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
By contrast, it costs a lot, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the Group has been fighting a Chinese plagiator.
Although the Germans were able to achieve the removal of their illegal manufacturing of imitated parts of the motor vehicle.
However, the imitation continued to secure the Chinese rights of the Freudenberg brand.
This has been missed, as family names could not be protected in Germany, says Hanno Wentzler, the chairman of the management of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO brand office rejected the Municher's opposition.
In the next two instances Freudenberg got right, but the opponent continues to fight to this day.
You have to look out for the hell.
Now the case is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a good conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "The procedure is extremely complex and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs could hardly be estimated that the company archive had even had to look through a hundred-year-old file in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the opposite in vain a "high six-digit euro amount" for settlement.
"By this one sees how much it is worth to us," says Wentzler.
The dangers in the Far East are even threatening to return to Europe.
Then, when imitators secure unprotected brands there.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
The Group has long since given up this business segment, but it has still been able to avert registration.
"You have to take care of the hell," Wentzler says.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be very careful in business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights, but rather the foreigners should "register everything that is worth protecting in China", says Wentzler.
Otherwise, this can be much more expensive than registration.
In fact: If Freudenberg was in the last act of his brand drama, then one would probably have to pay license fees for one's own name to the opposite side, Wentzler explains.
Or we are pushed out of the market in the segment in question.
World AIDS Day: Stamping, singing, helping
In Heidelberg, the choir Imbongi - and in Swaziland, AIDS orphans are delighted.
The story of a connection that overcomes far more than 8733 kilometers.
First of all, there is the stamping: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, ladies' pumps and men's slippers are looking for the clock on the parquet floor, find it fast.
One-two-three-four.
Only then do the voices of the singers slowly swell - old, bass, tenor and soprano - crowding, enchanting and persecuting themselves.
And Fiet Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, almost lifts it out of his fabric shoes when he brings it together with his smooth wild gestures.
It is Monday evening, in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the choir imbongi tastes a new song.
The fifty singers have come, between 23 and 69 years old, from the human geneticist to the houseman.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple piece, each choir has a different text and it is also in a very foreign language: Zulu, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Aid to self-help
Worldwide, there are around 34 million HIV-infected people, estimated by Unaids, the United Nations programme to combat AIDS.
23.5 million people live in South Africa.
In Swaziland there are 245,000 AIDS orphans.
More than 40 percent of the population are now HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni the association Voices for Africa has found sponsors in Germany.
70 of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros per month you can take over a sponsorship.
She guarantees the child school fees, school uniforms and a warm daily meal in the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means "Zulu" narrators or praisers.
The bantu language fluently speaks in this room no one can, but sing.
For almost ten years, the choir has been practicing songs in this foreign language and occasionally brings them back to where they originally came from: to the South of Africa.
For 8 733 kilometres from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the voice power of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected
About 2,000 people live there, some still in simple clay and straw huts, most of them are children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents because they are killed by the HI virus.
In Esitjeni, small ones show that all of Swaziland suffers from: highest HIV infection rate, lowest life expectancy worldwide according to Unicef.
Circumcisions of the male foreskin, which are shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, are hardly accepted by the population.
More than forty percent of people in Swaziland carry the immunodeficit virus, dying with the middle of thirty is not a rarity.
During a joint African trip in spring 2005, the choir discovered the village, but above all the impongis saw many children on the streets, who lacked not only parental care, but simply everything: food, clothing, education.
Without graduation, you have no chance in a poor country.
In the beginning, it was still the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school for a few euros a year and to allow him a warm meal a day.
A year later, however, the choir founded the "Voices for Africa", which since then almost professionally cares for the AIDS whales in Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and trippers (gonorrhea).
Common viral STIs are HIV, human papilomavirs, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
Filuses and scratches belong to the parasitic STI.
Who are the main groups affected?
Syphilis and trippers occur mainly in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute assumes that at least four out of five of the syphilis cases reported in Germany are transmitted through sexual contacts between men.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia infections, trichomonades, candidosis (pilz), tripper and human papilomavirs are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults in this country is relatively low - nevertheless: about 20 percent of HIV new infections are due to this group.
Among adolescents, Chlamydia infections occur much more frequently than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people aged 15 to 25.
Human papilomavirs are also common in young people in these countries.
How did the number of infections develop?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to reporting.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has more than doubled from 1697 diseases in 2001 to 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has declined since 2007.
There were around 2,700 cases in 2011.
That's about a tenth less than the year before.
What symptoms indicate sexual illness?
The infectious diseases may cause ulcers in the genital area, urination, outflow, lower abdominal pain, blisters or warts.
Often, however, they do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection but do not provide a 100% protection.
For in some cases pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be passed on through lubricating infections and close contact with the body.
Therefore, experts especially recommend regular investigations in frequently changing sex partners.
Earlyly diagnosed, most STIs can be cured and late consequences avoided.
Through sponsorships, donations and, last but not least, the gagen that the choir sings throughout Germany, a lot comes together.
"In total, we have already sent some 200 000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, the president of the association.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a confident and strong woman, manages the funds from Germany.
She also makes sure that the orphans are well accommodated, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The Gogos, called the old women on Zulu, are the support of the village.
Some of them have taken in up to 14 orphans, give them a roof over their heads, and ensure that the children appear in their uniforms every day on time for school lessons.
If you don't have anyone, you'll get to the shelter to Khanyisile, a single woman who's paid by the club as well as the two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" has established a sewing school, built two chicken houses and organized with the American health organization PSI that many in the village have had a HIV test done.
This is not a matter of course, because as obvious as the disease is throughout the country, one prefers to keep it dead.
A king with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Actually strange in a country where the king officially holds 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, it is also due to this stately sanctioned form of life that the HI virus has spread so rapidly over the past decades.
But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus through the country.
Free condoms would exist at every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they are hardly used.
The culture is another - Flesh to Flesh."
To promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels through the South of Africa every two or three years and sings songs full of sadness, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-confidence, many of them still know from times of apartheid on the southern tip of the black continent.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language - so much recognition brings not only mood and joy, but also some gruesome border soldiers a few tears.
The journey also takes you to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their children.
Even if you can hardly find the small village on maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni River it is more than known.
"Go to Esitjeni, there's the light," the people there say.
And if you return the 8733 kilometers of airline to Heidelberg, to the stamping singers into the test room on Bergheimer Straße, then you can see it shining there.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice cover may be up to 20 meters thick.
NASA has demonstrated the existence of ice on planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the sun, there is also frozen water there, as shown by three studies published on Thursday in Science magazine.
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is an ice cover in the permanently in the shadow region of the planet.
This should be at least 30 centimetres and possibly even up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably came from comets or possibly asteroids that have been hit on Mercury.
No one connects the find of ice with the existence of life on the planet, said the chief scientist of the Messenger's probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on the Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
The findings could, however, help to clarify how water and other building blocks of life came into other areas of the solar system.
Unmarked by the earth's citizens, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix are exploring the depths of space.
From time to time, they send pictures to Earth: Small holes in infinite widths.
The picture comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, also the dwarf planet of Ceres.
Like Pluto, who orbits the sun behind Neptune, after the new definition of the International Astronomical Union of 2006 he is not a "planet".
This image selection of an infrared shot of the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless star generations: The oldest stars can be seen as blue dots, the pink "newborn" are heavier to identify in the star circle hall.
This star-forming region - called unromantic W5 by scientists - has discovered the telescope Spitzer in the constellation Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6,500 light years.
This dazzling glow of a dying star has recorded the Spitzer telescope of the Nasa.
The Donut-shaped ring is made up of material that the star sluggished out in the dying process.
In the huge Trifid Nebula, 5400 light years away from Earth, new stars arise from gas and dust.
The Spitzer telescope of the Nasa shot this photo of the galactic birthhouse.
The Plejaden cluster, also called "The Seven Sisters", can be seen with the naked eye at night.
With the telescope, however, the colors are better applied.
Like a red age, the Helix fog looks at the viewer on this infrared photo.
It is located 700 light years away in the Aquarius constellation.
Its resemblance to an earthly continent brought this fog the title North America.
A combination of normal and infrared photo ensures spectacular coloration.
This baby star could only be recorded in its full beauty by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: How these came about is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
They may be the remains of a Saturn moon that disappeared without trace 4,5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and sharpest shots of the Hubble telescope: The Hot tub galaxy
Depending on the color scheme, photographs of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image published by the European Southern Observatory shows the trifid nebula, several thousand light years away in the constellation Schütze.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (three divided, tripled), as dark dust strips the glowing heart of the star birthplace three parts.
In the constellation snake carriers astronomers have photographed the omens of a cosmic carambolage: 400 million light years away from the earth, the cores of two melting galaxies are rushing together and will inevitably collide with each other.
This star-birth recorded the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
To whom no technical abbreviations lie, they may be called by their nickname Southern Fire Wheel.
The photograph of the space telescope Hubble shows a cut-out from the iris nebula in the constellation Kepheus.
The 1400 light-years away fog consists of dust grains that are ten to a hundred times smaller than ordinary house dust.
This image was combined from optical and x-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light years away from Earth.

The brightest group of young stars on our Milky Way is located in this starry nebula.
The star cradle is always producing new youngsters.
Also this star cloud, connected with the rosette nebula, is constantly producing new baby stars - 5000 light years away from the earth.
In this brightly radiant galaxy with a small black hole there is no dust yet, but only gas.
Researchers suspect that it was only created shortly after the Big Bang, when hydrogen was found mainly in the universe.
Our insights into space: The most important telescopes
The telescope was invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey - even before Galileo Galilei used it for star observation a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have become ever bigger - and the insights they provide have become deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope in the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, there is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows eyes into space to be equal over two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior life of the Gran Telescopio Canaria on the Canary Islands of La Palma is huge - the mirror alone comes at 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
Nevertheless, it reaches a diameter of about 11 meters.
Disadvantage of the favorable design: The telescope is fixed in its height angle - and thus limited in its mobility.
Also the hobby Eberly telescope in Texas is fixed at the altitude angle.
Its peculiarity: the high light-gathering force.
In fact, despite the relatively low diameter of the mirror, this is sufficient for the world's largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico), researchers are listening to the space for extraterrestrial signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI), any computer owner can help by providing computing power.
View of the Observatory of the European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here's the Very Large Telescope - that makes his name all the honor.
With a total of four mirrors, the telescope can also illuminate the middle infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at the Chilean ESO Observatory.
Its main mirror should cover 42 meters - and be composed of just under 1000 mirror elements.
However, pictures can be expected at the earliest of 2018.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They offer two mirrors each with an average of ten meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna-Kea Observatory, which looks into the sky next to them with the Subaru telescope and the IRTF.
A new, huge telescope will also be created on the Mauna Kea - with a mirror average of thirty meters.
Here it is to marvel at an illustration.
The most important impressions from space, however, are provided by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, it has already provided images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets - mainly those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, the Nasa announced that 1235 planetary missionaries had been identified since the start of the mission.
The last launch preparations at the Kepler Space Telescope are documented in the picture.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be shot in space at the earliest of 2018 on board an Ariane5 rocket.
The primary mirror of the Space Infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: to search for light from the first stars and galaxies for the big bang.
Scientists assume that there is also ice on the south side of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data for this, as the messenger circles far closer to the North Pole around the planet.
Radar measurements have indicated for decades that there is ice on Mercury.
Through the messenger probe launched in 2004 - the first to circle around Mercury - the scientists now have certainty.
Drink butter every day - and get 168 years old
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a Biblically high age.
There's even a museum for durability.
A search in the country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a Biblically high age.
There's even a museum for durability.
A search in the country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
The ride through the Talysch Mountains is wildly dreamy.
The minibus rumbles over the winding road, past densely wooded hills, ripping rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, you might think you're in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here lives the Caucasian ethnic group of the Talysian, of which not much is known, except that it speaks perfectly Persian and asian and is very durable.
The end station is Lerik.
The small town is raining with too massive architecture from Soviet times, which does not want to fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, too difficult to get to Azerbaijan's capital Baku.
It takes eight hours for the 323 kilometers because the road is only one-lane.
The amazing wealth that the country owes to its oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived here in the province.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the stuff for the tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous for the Eurovision Song Festival in May - and next year we will have a festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She's the director of the Museum of Durability, probably the only one in the world.
Here the Vita is documented by about eight dozen Talyschen from the area, the older than 100. Fatulayeva points to a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136 a child was still born
However, controversial star of the museum is the shepherd of the herd of Müslümov, who is said to have grown 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And in view of the oldest documented man, who was 122 years old, Müslümov’s age seems extremely doubtful.
"He was born here in 1805 in the region, and died in 1973," Fatulayeva explains.
The man had been married three times and had had 23 children, and at the age of 136 he is said to have had a daughter.
So, at his age, did  _irali Müslümov pay for himself by a few decades?
But Rembrandt Scholz, an age researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of the high-level people in Central Asia.
"There are also a lot of very old people in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "even in Sardinia, very many very old men live."
However, due to the lack of documentation, there was no scientific evidence of age, especially as there were no registers of persons.
Butter melted every day
However, the fact is that people in the region around Lerik often reach a Bible age.
There are currently 20 people who are over 100 years old.
So why do so many people live here in the south?
The Assyrian guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talysian.
Museum Director Fatulayeva, on the other hand, believes that it's on the diet.
But that the high-calorie food of the Talyschen should be so healthy, who love meat, bread and above all dairy products and many of whom drink a glass of melted butter daily does not appear plausible either from a nutritional point of view.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? Rubaba Mirzayeva lives in Cengemiran, a tiny settlement not far from the city of Lerik.
At the age of 97, she is still relatively young for these widths.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the whole Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a butter barrel, which she untiringly rolls back and forth.
Eight people live here under a roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and a daughter, both of whom have long been grandparents.
Two toddlers also jump around.
In the kitchen you prepare tea, which is served in the typical, bellows-shaped Armadu glasses.
Mirzayevas white teeth stand perfectly in line and link, under her head towel she hides long, dark-blond heads that her son proudly reveals before us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so they never went out and kept their color.
"I never used shampoo either," says Mirzayeva.
Monthly pension is sufficient to live
She always ate only what came from her own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
All my life, I didn't buy food once in the supermarket.
Then she tells of her husband who was in the army.
It was worst in the period after the Second World War.
But everything got better when the "loved father" Heydar Aliyew took over the rowing.
The propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult, driven around the father figure of the nation, who ruled his country as a dictator, hardly knows borders in Azerbaijan.
Until 2003 he was in power, later his son Ilham took over.
After all, there is no need among Azerbaijan's old people.
230 Manat (e.g. the same amount in euro), Mirzayeva receives a monthly pension, for local conditions an amount of which one can live well.
And perhaps Mirzayevas has long since been a very rough son: "The old people enjoy high respect in our culture."
They live in the midst of the large family, are loved, cared for and are happy.
If that is no reason to stay alive as long as possible
The word "human rights" is missing in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rival rallys in Cairo reveal the deep division of the country.
The future constitution with the Sharia as a base is fiercely controversial.
The Egyptian president did not save with Pathos.
We need to make the transition.
"And that he succeeds lies in my responsibility, in front of the people and before God," he said in state television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, but above all to the Christian Copts, the liberals, enlightened Muslims and seculars.
Because all of them, so far hopelessly disputing in a conflict of opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a state of God on the Nile of graces of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
He, Muhammad Mursi said, almost apologising, temporarily curtailed the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded his competences "to save the revolution".
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who has a doctorate from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save, the Egyptians are aware of that, the world is not quite clear.
Whether the dropdowns should look like lists rather than menus
In fact, the 234 articles, which were whipped by the Islamic-dominated 100-member constitutional assembly, are partly exciting in a nocturnal, 15-hour parforce ride.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that the case law is based on the "Islamic Law" principle.
But what does "principles" mean?
That was and is a matter of interpretation and it is to be feared that the Islamists will use the gay formulation and the accompanying legal scope for a more stringent interpretation of the Sharia.
This suggests at least a newly added article: in all the issues concerning Sharia, the Al-Alsar University must be consulted, the most important Islamic institution of the country with great radiance throughout Sunni Islam.
This does not have to, but it may mean that the clergy is supervising the legislation, which de facto would result in the estuary of the judicial system.
Many things in the draft draft is interpretation matter
Also problematic: Civil military jurisdiction should continue to be maintained.
During Mubarak's reign, these courts served to suppress oppositionists.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were in military custody.
The state should also, it is in the draft, "to protect the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "to promote their morality and values".
This is legally so vaguely formulated that with the help of this article, state institutions can even control the content of film art and literature.
In plain text, that means nothing but censorship.
No article, by the way, expressly sets out gender equality.
For this, another forbids or slanders the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what is an insult and how it should be punished remains unclear.
Similarly, dubios suggests that "injury of people" is prohibited.
Is there a cartoon of the President or a joke at the expense of a lawyer?
The interpretation, as so much in the draft, which Mursi presents for signature and according to his words "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians for popular vote.
"The Revolution has returned"
The opposition has been formed for weeks against the overpower of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands gathered in unaccustomed harmony on Friday evening on the Tahrir Square in Cairo and promised to bring down the Charter before it could enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, third-placer of the presidential elections.
Nobel Peace Prize winner and ex-head of the International Atomic Energy Authority Mohamed El-Baradei stated that the draft Constitution belongs "to the garbage mountain of history".
Through short news service Twitter, he accused the followers of Mursis of wanting to lead a "putsch against democracy".
"When he proclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," said the oppositionary Jasser Said.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers is not yet reconciled," the Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that they would not want to monitor the referendum, which would invalidate it.
"The Qur'an is our constitution."
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, in turn, blew to the area demonstration, but for the sake of caution not on the Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other bank of the Nile in front of Cairo University.
Many veiled women and followers of the Salaphists participated and cried out, "The people demand the application of God's law."
They demanded of Mursi, "Clean the land!" and said, "The Qur'an is our constitution."
A struggle for the Highness over the symbolic Tahrir Square, on which everything began, would probably have conjured up civil war-like conditions.
Obviously, Mursi's followers didn't want to risk that.
The Muslim brothers said that both the opponents of the draft Constitution and the supporters had spoken out loud and clearly.
Now be the time to let the people decide in the polling council what direction the land should go.
A majority in favour of the draft of Islamists is considered safe.
"The word human rights doesn't even exist"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry about this forced constitutional process, which should have gone by February and involved all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EEHR) defended the Muslim Brothers when they were in prison or in court under Mubarak.
Not because he would share their world view, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
For this he was beaten, sentenced, detained.
"And now the word human rights is not even in the new constitution," he complains in conversation with the "world on Sunday".
Mursi's expansion of power to all three forces in the state allowed the lawyer to resign.
These measures are blatant violations of democratic rules and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the President de facto put it out of force," complains Saeda.
But without civil society organisations, democracy could not work.
Saeda feels alone, also from the international community, which looks at the ideological struggle on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could be revenge.
A demonstrator on the Tahrir warns: "You are giving birth to a monster that you can no longer control."
Rakfisk from Norway: Is that the worst-smelling fish in the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living - not only in Europe but all over the world.
Could the country’s secret of success have something to do with the local appetite for pretty bad - smelling fish?
You take a selection of overripe cheeses.
They are placed in the middle of a pile of dirty, damp sportswear.
And have fun there for a week.
For example, one must imagine the nostrilating smell of Rakfisk, one of Norway's great delicacy dishes.
I am located in the small town of Farnes, about three hours away from Oslo.
There are snow, spectacular landscapes here - and this stubborn smell in the air that just doesn't want to disappear.
Rakfisk is salt-sprayed trout, which is fermented in water for up to a year, depending on how stinking one would like its fish.
When the darkness comes over the country in Norway and the weather gets colder, Norwegians flock to a festival here in Fanzenes, which is dedicated to this very impressive speciality, now.
"You eat it raw and then rinse it down with a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works at the local fire station, but also organizes the festival as a so-called "rakfiss general".
Around us people consume small fish cubes and take in large amounts of alcohol.
"Some people like the Aquavit more than the Rakfiss," says Havard.
The spirit can crowd out the smell.
I'll cost you a couple of tips.
If you avoid getting the Rakfiss near you, it's not bad - like Sushi, who has a long bus ride behind him.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different, much poorer Norwegian era when there were no cooling possibilities and fish were watered in airtight saltwater barrels in autumn.
In the deepest winter, it was then removed after long fermentation and - no doubt under the use of alcohol - consumed.
Even a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and migrated mainly to the United States.
Today, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a thriving labour market, high wages and comprehensive healthcare.
Even from Sweden, the old rival, who was far richer than Norway not too long ago, immigrants stream.
Rakfisk is considered to be an important part of Norwegian history - an essential, though strictly smelling, part of it.
He's one of the more expensive dishes you can buy here.
But actually everything is expensive here - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs proud 10 euros.
Norway doesn't often get into the world press, and most people don't seem to disturb it.
Here one still hates to name Anders Breivik - those racist right-wing extremists who shot 77 men, women and children last year.
Instead, one refers only to the "event of 22 July".
Norwegians are hard to accept that someone in their peace-loving country is capable of such brutal murders.
Since the early 1970s, Norway's main responsibility for today's wealth has been the growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries.
"But oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well," says Anna, our waitress, distributing the round tablets with mature Rakfiss and embodying the Nordic ideal with her long blonde hair and the stinging blue eyes.
We are - as they say - a prudent people.
Your English is just like that, most people here are flawless.
We're not very sensitive, we don't like bragging.
Norway has handled its oil wealth very carefully - a large part of the sector income is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When, in the years leading up to the global economic crisis, all the money they did not own was thrown around, Norway firmly shut down its wallet.
"As long as we can go skiing in winter and go hiking in summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And, of course, eat raccoon," she adds with uncomplicated laughter.
I stand in the snow and stand for another dish - I have enough of Rakfisk.
Such an elk burger is definitely something else. The juicy meat mouths me.
But in the evening, the stinky fish is on the menu.
The hotel in which I stay is one of several venues that organize a Rakfiss dinner where guests can vote for the best fish - or perhaps the most challenging of all - that smells.
There is a live TV circuit to a fly-in-fly showmaster surrounded by telephoners with Rakfisk.
The spectacle resembles the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score do you have there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
"Here are our points, Havard."
They're laughing and laughing.
A man falls from his chair, possibly overwhelmed by the aquavit.
But maybe it's the strict thump of the whole fish.
Mexico’s Enrique Pena Nicho faces difficult start
While Mexico's future President Enrique Pena Nietto is preparing for his appointment, Will Grant of the BBC analyses the challenges ahead of him and the mixed feelings of his people.
At the moment, traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad.
Even on better days, this is a city that is always clogged, but on Monday a ring of steel was built, which locks several important traffic routes into the capital and causes chaos on the streets.
The objective, however, was not to disrupt the commuting of the commuting force on the way to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new President Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the presidential bonds and take over the leadership of the nation.
He's facing a complex task.
Under the outgoing government of Felipe Calderons, Mexico has been able to prove itself economically well, but the country is under control of a drug war that has already cost 60,000 people over the last six years.
"My government is strongly committed to reducing violence," said Pena Nieto at the Oval Office at the beginning of this week, US President Barack Obama.
I will propose a new security strategy to enable us to achieve this objective.
Before joining the U.S. president, Pena Nicho served as governor of his home country Mexico.
In this densely populated, vast part of the country surrounding the capital, opinions about the new head of state are shared.
A direct man
For example, in the remote small town of Valle del Bravo, you like to remember him.
Inhabitants of the resort attribute to him the development of tourism and the construction of the infrastructure.
To reach the city, one can drive on one of the highways that Pena Nieto had built and which represents a great improvement over the brittle, hollow roads that once existed here.
Posters with their name also hang outside a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We expect real and lasting changes from him," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who works as a congressman for the Pena Nietos party, the PRI.
In particular, as regards security and the economy, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country so urgently needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was replaced by Vicente Fox in 2000.
The Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the Presidential Palace of Los Pinos, the party has great expectations of Enrique Pena Nieto.
The accusations of the opposition, the new President lacks substance, he rejects.
He is a very direct man, very committed and has big plans for the country.
He is an excellent statesman, but above all he is also someone who can listen.
But on the other side of the state, not many people share this view of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The village is hidden under highway transfers and in many respects represents a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the community are of crucial urban nature.
At the beginning of this year, the military was engaged to fight the drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
In the last two years alone, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left behind on a spot of Brachland near a large garbage dump.
During the term of office of Governor Pena Nieto, more than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico - a statistics that exceed the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is notorious for its violence and murders of innocent women.
Critics Pena Nietos consider that he has at least not adequately addressed the problem of women's murder during his term of office.
But in the worst case, his government had closed its eyes to the problem.
In a concrete building, typical of the lowered quarter, Irinea Buendia fights with tears when she shows me pictures of her late daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes that she was murdered by her companion.
"When I arrived at her home, it seemed as if her body had been washed," recalls Senora Buendia.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the body star had already been used.
As her mother tells her story, a picture of Mariana looks down on us from the wall. It is attached next to a cross that bears a single word: justice.
But that's exactly what the family said, they've been denied her so far.
The authorities have treated me as if I were a sister-in-law, unrest-maker, Nörglerin.
They want to accept their judgment and keep their mouth shut.
"But that is not possible if there were so many wrong shapes and failures," she says.
When President Pena Nieto receives the President's tie on Saturday, he also assumes a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have suffered violent crimes over the last six years, and the new President has promised to take special care of this problem during his term of office.
"I hope he is as president as he was governor," says PRI Congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But just before that, the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza are most afraid.
The Procuratorate claims that Bradley Manning did not complain about abuse
The Procuratorate contradicts Bradley Manning's allegations of being abused in prison
The hearing deals with Manning's time in the military prison in Quantico, Virginia
The defence seeks to reject the charges due to harsh terms of detention
The U.S. Army has been accused of missing thousands of confidential documents
On Friday, the Public Prosecutor's Office tried to find that the army-free Bradley Manning - accused of the greatest disclosure of confidential information in US history - missed several opportunities to complain about his alleged abuse in military custody.
During a cross-examination of Manning during a court hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Maj. Ashden Fein explained that documents for weekly visits that prison officials had made during Manning's nine-month term in Quantico, Virginia had no complaints about his treatment.
A day before the cross-examination, which was held as a result of a request for defence to reject the charge - Manning had already been sufficiently punished by the hard term - Manning had said that he had considered suicide in prison.
The U.S. Army intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The material was then published on the Internet by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed Manning as a source of information.
During the Friday hearing, Fein went through with Manning the forms that officials had completed after their meeting with Manning during his imprisonment in the Quantico Military Prison, where he had been instigated from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officials asked Manning questions and wrote his answers.
When fine asked him about the forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he had considered the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the treatment by the institution overall as "very professional".
The forms, according to Fein, contained no complaints about abuse, although the officials had asked Manning directly for his treatment.
Manning replied that he had expressed his concerns orally and the officials had discussed them with him and had indicated that they had been dealt with, but they had not been recorded.
"They wrote (after discussing the concerns) "No problems," and that didn't necessarily mean that I didn't say anything at all," Manninging said.
The judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment when he met with a committee in January 2011 to investigate the thoughts of suicide he had mentioned on a form a few months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during this meeting was to lower his observation status to "prevention of injuries".
The military said that it had assigned to it this restrictive status - which is one step under the threat of suicide - to his and to the protection of others.
"I wanted to convince employees that I was doing well and get rid of the observation status to prevent injuries (...) in order to achieve a higher quality of life from my point of view," said Manning.
On Thursday, Manning declared his arrest and relocation to Kuwait, where he was arrested for almost two months before being transferred to the Quantico Marine Base Prison in Virginia in July 2010.
He said he had considered suicide in Kuwait and had become unconscious because of the heat.
Not to know what was happening to him or to the outside world would have been stressful.
"My world was shrinking on Camp Arafjon, on this cage," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I'd die in that cage.
When he was transferred to Quantico, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society.
He was allowed only one mattress, a blanket, flip flops, clothes and his glasses.
Manning said that he had tried to keep moving, because in the day it was forbidden to sleep or even to lie down.
He always had to sleep with light that penetrated his cell from the outside.
If he had turned around at night and guards could no longer see his face, he would have been awakened so that he would turn back.
In January 2011, Manning's lawyer formally objected to the treatment of Manning.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to the military prison of Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday, the judge Manning also questioned an accusation he had made in his statement on Thursday - so he had a night of naked sleep in his cell in Quantico and had to stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners in a morning count.
Manning had said he had never had the opportunity to cover himself with his blanket during this count.
In the Friday survey Manning stated that he had concluded from an order from his guard that he should drop the ceiling with which he could cover himself. However, he admitted that no one had asked him to do so.
On Thursday, Manning said he was forced to sleep naked the previous night, and he had tried to show an official that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning had told the official that he could have used the alliance of his underpants or his flip-flops to hurt himself, but he did not.
That night, Manning said, his underpants, flip-flops and glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account his arrest experiences and will drastically reduce his liability if he is sentenced to trial before the military court at the beginning of next year.
The defence has indicated that Manning will confess less offenses for guilt, while other charges that are considered too extreme are to be challenged.
The continuation of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend, and the Public Prosecutor's Office is expected to justify the terms of detention.
The Pentagon shall remain in its position that Manning has been held in accordance with the provisions applicable to all prisoners held under the highest security arrangements in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include the favour of the enemy, the unlawful publication of intelligence information on the Internet, the transmission of national defence information and theft of public property or documents.
If he is found guilty in all charges, he is threatened with a life sentence.
My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many people are forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to accuse the emigrants - they remind them of difficult times, he says.
Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and had arrived at the passport check-up when there was disquiet in me.
Signs referred to two queues: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicians"), another for "Extranjeros" ("Ausländer").
I stood there for a few seconds, uncertain about which I should go.
I grew up in central California, and I've been called "Mexicoian" all my life.
An ethnic accelerator - just as my friends in Boston call themselves "Iren" or my friends in New York "Italians".
Later, I decided to choose "Mexican-American".
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home, there was no need for accelerators or dashes.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, at least good enough to claim myself in this language at both ends of an interview.
But I don't have the vocabulary of a native speaker, nor do I get rid of my American accent.
So I took my American passport and put myself in the queue for Extranjeros.
I thought about that moment this week when future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet President Obama.
On the agenda were all the issues expected when the heads of these two countries met: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in talking about the growth of the Mexican economy. She is a reason for Mexicans to remain in Mexico with the same probability today instead of emigrate to the United States.
It would like to join forces with the United States and Canada and create a North American trading block, modelled on the European Union.
And Pena Nieto swore to continue the war of Mexico against the drug cartels, even if he did not mention any details in this regard.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never lost a single thought that the United States invaded Mexico in 1848 and forced the country’s leadership, under a gun, to leave them with more than half of their territory.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries and not in minutes, memories of this event are not to be overlooked.
So as soon as a U.S. government official practices even mildest criticism of Mexico, complaints are heard in the Mexican press and among the elites of the country about how the Americans are pushing the sovereignty of their neighboring country.
And the children of Montezuma go on the war path.
Yet, the biggest challenge facing Mexico is the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Would you like to talk about resentment?
There's more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. People for whom the country offers opportunities, and others for whom it does not.
The only reason why so many people of Mexican origin live in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at one point in our family tree a person - perhaps a parent or grandparents - was not offered a chance in Mexico and emigrated north.
And in most cases this person corresponded to a profile - dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our fidelity is theirs.
Not Mexico.
And although we may now be living the American dream, attending good schools and getting good jobs, we must never lose sight of the American dream we are living - not the Mexican.
Our identity may sometimes be blurred, but as far as our loyalty is concerned, this is not the case.
This clearly applies to the United States.
We are also aware that many members of the Mexican leadership do not like us.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a memorial of a humiliating defeat and look down on us because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our bands to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In your opinion, our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
And then we would not see ourselves trapped behind the silk curtain - with a pleasant life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, born in Guadalajara and legally immigrated to the United States as a child, reminds me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are - and Mexican Americans take this seriously.
While she is a U.S. citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans I know have the feeling of not belonging to one or the other country.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
One enjoys the best of both worlds, but none of them are rooted.
In Mexico we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States we are seen as Mexicans.
How I should learn during my trip, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: some Mexican leaders and parts of the educational bourgeoisie want to resume their links with Diaspora.
They want to use Mexican Americans as provisional "messengers" for Mexico, who represent their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues how great a visit to this country is and put pressure on the political leadership to intensify its ties with Mexico.
Well.
That won't happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And in view of the unjust distribution of income, unbridled corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure whether it is really a great country.
I'm afraid you'll have to go through it alone, Amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready to grant the United States to deal with Mexico a century and a half ago, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans have a grudge for how their family members were not treated so long ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more "mexican" than I thought.
Old Fights, New Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected pillar of peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to suffocate such hope in the germ.
In the midst of the usual debt allocations, countless buildings were laid in rubble and ashes, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis - and for the first time rockets from Gaza near the Israeli metropolis Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem were hit.
However, although Israelis and Palestinians seem trapped in their historical conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they want it or not - Palestinians and Israelis have become part of these confusions.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to believe that the deadly patch situation could finally end.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance, optimism seems anything but appropriate in view of the current situation.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on 21 November continues, this week's struggles have strengthened hard-earned ones on both sides.
The leader of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has been controlling the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim to have pushed the Israelis back, although his group itself had to record great losses.
Although several Hamas leaders are killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip are being invaded in one of the most desolate and densely populated corners of the planet, Israel has so far failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is winning in the West Bank, controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
And the Hamas leaders might conclude that they have time on their side.
Just as Islamists in the Arab world have gained influence, Hamas has been able to draw powerful and rich friends to her side.
Turkey, a strong regional power once known as Israel's closest Muslim ally, has taken on the Hamas party - just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf States.
Rejoicing Hamas followers believe that around Israel is an Islamic hemisphere - from Lebanon to the north, where the militant Hezbollah has the power, over Syria, where rebels could stand an increasingly Islamic influence before the overthrow of Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And in particular, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt - by far the strongest and most important Arab country - on the southern flank of Israel has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the Laizist Despot, who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time left for Hamas.
On the other hand, the brotherhood with Hamas is weakened and its leaders more dependent on popular views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could prove to be an actor who cannot even be pushed out by Israel and the United States.
The Israeli hardliners, on the other hand, have drawn an opposite conclusion.
In military terms, Hamas is no longer a danger.
The Israeli missile defense system, "Iron Dome", has proved itself and many of the Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
At least for a while, Israel will be able to sleep more quietly.
In diplomatic terms, the United States is holding its position unshakably, and many European countries have made Hamas responsible for the latest violence escalations.
Israel has done well in recent years, especially among Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of suicide offenders - not least thanks to the lockouts that enter the West Bank and thus the main part of a possible Palestinian state, which protects the Jewish settlements, which have been declared illegal in international law, are being further expanded.
Netanyahu stands well there. His Likud party, in the run-up to the elections on 22 January, allied itself with an even more fighting group under Avigdor Lieberman.
Why do these insidious Palestinians also haggle and leave them with their own state?
If they were in fact in control of the West Bank, would they not fire missiles just like their companions in the Gaza Strip?
No, it's better to keep them behind the wall in check and punish them if they dare raise their heads.
Perhaps the hardliners will be able to prevail, but the Arab spring could make them a step through the bill.
Even if the Islamists, who are now in power in Egypt and in other countries, have little left for Israel, they will first focus on the difficulties in their own country.
The defense set of Israel is larger than that of its four Arab neighbours together.
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to restore their economy.
The fact that pragmatic President Mursi joined forces with Barack Obama to achieve a ceasefire could be a promising sign - and perhaps symbolise the beginning of a new era.
Israelis should also think more long-term.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking striking steps towards democratization, Palestinians are still deprived of their right to self-determination - a powder barrel that will undoubtedly explode one day in the Israeli-occupied territories, just as this week a bus exploded in Tel Aviv.
The oppression is already suppressing democracy in the Jewish state, and the growth of the Arab population will only make this situation worse.
Bloody missions to push Hamas back in the Gaza Strip will increasingly demand their diplomatic tribute over the years.
Both sides need a boost from the outside
The right answer is that represented by the more reasonable representatives of both sides, the majority of the rest of the world, and by this newspaper: two states in which Israel resigns for security purposes.
The hope - small for the near future - is that the ceasefire will give outsiders more influence to enforce this solution.
Egypt, together with Turkey and Qatar, now has to put arms supplies into the Gaza Strips and is better positioned than ever before to convince Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, supplemented by territorial exchange and a common Jerusalem.
Outside Arab nations should also move Hamas and Fatah to an agreement.
This would have done more for the creation of a Palestinian state than for the forthcoming UN observer status.
Obama must also help to move Israel to negotiations.
During his first term of office, he missed the idea of his own peace plan.
Far away in the white house, it seems as if he were just as disapprove of participation.
But this is a pitiful, shortsighted perspective.
The United States has an important interest in a stable Middle East.
And this includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian Single Cigarette Packaging Laws enter into force
Health warnings and body parts on neutral green packs equal for all tobacco brands
The world's first laws on uniform cigarette and tobacco packaging came into force in Australia, replacing brand logos and colours with neutral, olive-green lids, which are also printed with dramatic images showing sick parts of the body and infants and children suffering from cigarette smoke.
Apart from the different health warnings and pictures, from next Saturday, the only difference between the packages in the brand names printed in identical, small type.
Australia is thus introducing the most stringent regulations for tobacco packaging in the world.
The Australian government wants to dissuade young people from smoking by removing the glamorous image of tobacco consumption.
The government is based on studies that have shown that people who have not started smoking at the age of 26 will not start smoking with 99% of the probability after that.
"You can already see with children of young age that they understand the message to try to apply the tobacco companies with their brand image," said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek. She quotes studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and the changes will only have a minor impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries are already considering similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the laws.
It was said that the laws favoured the black market, which led to cheaper and more accessible cigarettes.
"The laws will lead to serious, unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian forgeries will offer much larger quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.
Others, on the other hand, say that the laws have stimulated their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, notes that since the British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco companies failed two months ago in the Supreme Australian Court with their challenge to the law.
Zico has sold up to 6,000 units of wholesale business and is waiting for new stocks.
For us, this is a good business.
According to experts, the hook is in the popularity of social media with exactly the population group to which the plan refers.
A number of Australian laws have banished tobacco companies from the TV advertising, forbidding them to act as sports sponsors, and forced most dealers to stop interpreting cigarettes in shops. Now tobacco advertising has switched to the Internet.
The Australian government has banned Internet advertising by local companies and sites, but has no influence on international sites.
"Whoever markets tobacco and has only a small area to apply for its products does not come around the internet," says Becky Freeman, a health researcher at Sydney University.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman has seen an increase in experience reports on brands written by "normal people".
You have to ask yourself the question: Is this just a private person who likes Marlboro cigarettes so much that she even takes a video for it - or does a marketing agency have to do with it?
British American Tobacco Australia says that instead of marketing, the industry focuses on dealing with the new laws.
It has even gone so far as to pay the Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules - those countries complain to the World Trade Organisation about unjust restrictions on trade, although none of the countries are engaged in greater trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected for mid-2013.
According to Plibersek, the government has held talks with other countries considering similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to prescribe photographic warnings in 2001.
These have now been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Harder laws are being considered in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers show themselves defiantly.
The pictures don't affect me.
I'm just ignoring her.
"You just take a chicken and put the box away," says Victor El Hage when buying a cigarette box on which a photo is printed with a mouth tumor.
Honestly, there's only one reason I'd stop, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, operator of the tobacco trade "King of the Pack" in downtown Sydney, says that the uniform packaging has made filling of his shelves difficult.
"I used to need an hour to sort out a delivery, now I need four," says Yu.
"The government should have just banned cigarettes completely - then we would have said OK, that's it, we're closing down," he clearly adds.
In a constantly electrified world, it's nice to be bored even once
This Thanksgiving I spent unexpectedly five hours at the airport when our plane failed due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane.
So I had enough time to get a few thoughts into boredom.
I don't want to lie.
To wait half a day for a flight at the airport is quite annoying - even when books, magazines and iPhones (and, of course, tax-free shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and child development experts are leading boredom as something positive.
When it comes to them, it is okay for us - and our children - to occasionally be bored.
This forces the brain to lose itself in interesting thoughts, which may promote creativity.
And because most of us are now almost constantly staring at one or another screen, the benefits of boredom are no longer to our advantage.
So should we welcome boredom with open arms?
Yes.
And no.
I'll come back to that again.
Like many people, I have always assumed that boredom is a relatively up-to-date phenomenon that has developed with increasing leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011) does not see it as such.
"In fact, boredom has a very long history," he says.
Pompeii's walls adorn a Latin graffiti over boredom, which dates back to the first century.
And then there is the question of how we actually define boredom.
According to John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom has been defined and discussed in many ways.
After a long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea in front of a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues concluded that boredom can be defined as the experience of wanting to "do a satisfactory job but not be able to do it".
Therefore, boredom differs from apathy in that the person is not employed, but wants to be.
In contrast, in apathy there is no urge to do something.
The key experience of boredom, he says, is in "a disturbance of the attention process, paired with bad mood and the feeling that time is only passing slowly".
Boredom can sound almost like depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes, although these two states may be related, bored persons see the problem in their surroundings or in the world, while depressed people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we believe that we are boring, even if we have only difficulty concentrating.
In her study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention" - to German for example: "The inactive mind: The definition of boredom under the aspect of attention", which appeared in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science" in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed out an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a volume on which a person read a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud TV program from the neighboring room that had nothing to do with the content. Others heard it at low volume, so it was hardly perceptible, while the third group did not hear these sounds at all.
The people who heard hardly audible television said they felt more boredom than the two other groups - they had problems concentrating, could find no reason for them and attributed their difficulties to boredom.
When one tries to focus on a difficult or strenuous task, the disturbance of attention can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neuroscience at Guelph University in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, if one carries on one-tone activity - "just like the search for faulty products on a factory conveyor belt, music can distract and help to avoid feeling bored".
In fact, he says, we now know that claws and crickets, often interpreted as signs of boredom, can even fight them by keeping people more physically attentive.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to hammer around learn more and keep more information than those who are forced to sit still," says Professor Fenske.
All of us get bored at some point - my late flight, a roaring speaker, a particularly tiring film.
But some people get bored more easily than others.
In order to measure these differences, in the 1980s, researchers developed a "scale of boredom vulnerability".
On the scale, statements like "Many things I have to do repeat and are monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I don't have enough time for everything".
With the help of such scales, researchers have found that young people get more bored than girls, says Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of Westflorida - in particular as regards the need for more and a greater variety of external stimuli.
But in general, teenagers are quite a strained bunch.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day.
He found that 32% of adults were bored in school and doing homework, while 23% said they were bored if they were not in school.
But only 3% of parents reported feeling bored.
Today, 21 years later, Professor Larson says, he does not know whether the percentages of boredom have increased or decreased.
However, he is sure that "youth will be particularly bored", mainly because children and teenagers have no big influence on their everyday life.
So back to my question of origin: Is boredom healthy?
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases, people take extreme physical risks and fall into gambling or drugs to relieve them - that's what studies have shown.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors investigate the relationship between boredom and creativity. This opinion is Professor Vodanovich, who has been exploring the subject for more than two decades.
"With boredom, the brain wants to tell you that you should do something else," says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at New York University.
But the brain doesn't always know what to do right now.
If you are bored and you use this energy to play and cook guitar, you will be happy.
However, while television can provide for happiness in the short term, it is now disappearing in the long term.
So if you are enough for your bored child to have an iPad, you can get rid of the boredom. However, it has not learned to entertain or control yourself, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds, "self-control is transferred from one situation to another."
The child not only learns to talk but also gets more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should celebrate boredom.
Nor should we see them too critically.
Instead, our goal should be to feel comfortable away from the constant scope of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds like we have to be boring more often, but boredom is the painful, unrelenting desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that in truth people are only looking for a way to shut down and relax.
"In an environment where we are constantly being overstimulated, it is difficult to get involved once the noise is silent."
In Colorado there is no clear guideline for the new marijuana law
The 19-year-old Community College student and football player Anthony Orozco stands for a crime in the south-east of Colorado that will soon be legal in that state: the possession of a few fewer marijuana broochs and a pipe with which he smoked it.
According to Orozco, he and some friends were on their way to Kansas on a September day by car in Lamar near the border when they were stopped.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Orozco was summoned for possession of drugs and drug utensils - cavalier crimes, each with a penalty of 100 US dollars - and received a court appointment.
"We are treated like criminals," says Orozco.
But is he one?
In the uncertain weeks following the decision of the state to legalize small amounts of marijuana for its own use, the answer for hundreds of smaller drug offences depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of violations of law that revolve around marijuana are already being dropped here and in the Washington State, which approved similar measures.
The police authorities no longer persecute adults for possession to a small extent over 21 years, which will be permitted by law as soon as the new laws enter into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in the more conservative districts of Colorado have announced to continue tracking existing marijuana abuses and are still quoting people in court.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the Western Mountains, vote to prevent new, state-licensed marijuana transactions at the opening in their communities.
"This situation is developing so fast that I don't know what will happen next," says Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, located east of Denver.
And regulatory authorities in the state of Washington are scratching their heads.
They are waiting for guidance to establish a licensing system for the production, production, distribution and sale of the drug, with a deadline until 1 December 2013.
In Washington it is considered that Colorado is in any case ahead of most states as regards the regulation of marijuana, where the drug was first legalized for medical purposes and then for its own use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market. The state is therefore well suited to orientation," says Brian E. Smith, Spokesman of the Department of Spirits in Washington State.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than serve in the sense of a rough guide.
"We don't have a real precedent that we can follow," he adds.
The Washington Law, called I-502, will enter into force on 6 December and will therefore also form the end point of a grey zone in which the state licensing system does not yet exist but is legalised.
And unpleasant practical issues need to be resolved at this time - for example, how the government's requirement of "appropriate access" to licensed marijuana is to be agreed with the prohibition of cannabis shops within 300 metres around schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities.
"Nowhere will it be harder to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle conurbation area," says Ben Livingston, spokesperson for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently formed research group.
On November 21st, Chief Oates sent an e-mail to his staff in Aurora stating that the prosecutor would no longer prosecute minor marijuana abuses in persons over 21 years of age, and that the police would not seek criminal prosecutions for these crimes "from now on".
Chief Oates added that the police would continue to enforce urban requirements for the regulation of growers of medical marijuana and continue to pursue drug dealers.
In Weld County, in northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck is a more stringent view.
After the vote, he stated that his authority would continue to monitor cases of marijuana ownership, mainly in order to move consumers to withdrawal.
At present, 119 persons have to be held responsible for the possession of about 50 grams or less of marijuana in court, although many have also been charged with other crimes.
"Our authority has the duty to prosecute infringements that were committed at the time of the crime," said Buck in a statement.
The reactions are doubtful even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the district, no longer show adults for the possession of smaller quantities.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision but also decided not to drop all outstanding property proceedings.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time enforcing the law until it changes," he says.
Although 55% of voters in Colorado supported the measure, it was clear from the outset that it would not be easy to reconcile the personal consumption of marijuana with the complexity of government and legal systems.
And the contradictory reactions throughout the state promoted a profound division of dissent among local officials in view of the great green experiment.
District prosecutors are a "cultural barrier," says Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer representing the accused in court for marijuana crimes and acting as a spokesperson for the national organisation for the reform of marijuana laws.
"They have spent such a large part of their lives persecuting people for the fact that they still cannot accept legalization," he believes.
As the first countries to treat smaller amounts of marijuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington are traded as national models for the legalization of drugs.
While advocates and state officials are preparing for legal sales for an age, they are also nervously waiting for instructions from the Federal Government, which wants to continue to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana at the federal level as a criminal offence.
Advocates-General of the Legalisation Movement hope that the Ministry of Justice will give in.
Despite several spectacular arrests by consumers and sellers of medical marijuana, the Federal Government has largely allowed the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Kevin A. Sabet, former drug policy consultant to the Obama government, believes that, although criminal officials are unlikely to enter doors to seize smaller amounts of drugs, they are likely to be struggling to tolerate legal, state-regulated marijuana transactions under the new legislation.
Several cities in Colorado don't even wait for the federal authorities to act.
Even before the election day, some local municipal authorities approved Moratoria for new marijuana operations, although they could only open in about a year.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the west, decided on a six-month ban that was probably passed next week.
"We don't want to get into a position where we license someone and then face a big problem at federal level," said Bob Nicholson, member of the City Council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We focus on what the congregation has chosen and not on what the state has chosen.
There are still many questions open.
Petronella Wyatt: I was mobged from Oxford because I am Tory
Not only university students today are attacked for their views
It had always been my greatest dream to get a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had attended the university that I once thought was the greatest stamp of knowledge in the world, for a modern Greek symposia that promoted the great pillars of civilization - free thinking and tolerance.
But within two weeks of my entry into Worscester College at the end of the 1980s - there I had planned to study history - I had packed my suitcases again and thus brought the first scandal of my life.
My father broke down in tears.
My friends were confused.
In the Evening Standard it was said that I had gone because I had a problem with that fellow students had sex in the neighboring room.
Author A N Wilson said that I had left the university because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
But the truth was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran, because I suffered from systematic bullying and threats.
Not because of my rather unusual name, or because I had come from a private school.
For one reason only, I was tormented - a reason that seemed all the more narrow and cruel in this alleged cradle of enlightenment: My now deceased father Woodrow Wyatt had been an important advisor to Margaret Thatcher and I supported the Conservative Party.
Why do I mention this right now?
Well, recent reports show that a new generation of students of moderate rights suffers from similar persecution.
The organized and increasing hatred of Tory students in Oxford has now developed such dimensions that a group of them claimed the same equality protection last week to benefit gays, disabled and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College state that they are often "insulated, personally attacked and declared undesirable due to their political views".
They demand a place in their college's Equality Committee to ensure that their opinions can be expressed freely.
Her situation was worsened by a recent documentary about political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", which Tories represented as eccentric and Neonazis.
Among other things, it showed graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the Conservative Student Association of Oxford University, who rode in a Rolls-Royce, and flaunted with silver suit and silvered walking stick.
At other universities, conservative students say that they are considered "sin goats for the introduction of higher tuition fees".
The 20-year-old Luke Black, Vice President of the Conservative Student Association of Nottingham University, announced in a Sunday newspaper: "There is a growing left trend at universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even getting to know us."
Samuel Roberts, 21 and history student in Corpus Christi, who initiated the request for greater protection, believes that such a climate is "unpleasant". 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, president of the conservative student association of Oxford, says that she has seen a growing over-student of moderate rights among JCR members.
"This poses a danger to the intellectual discourse and to the well-being of the members," she says.
In my first weeks in Oxford, I belonged to such a minority.
As an incredibly shy 18-year-old, I arrived in September 1986.
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its peak.
In the previous year, the university had voted not to give Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary title due to cuts in higher education.
The atmosphere would even have caused Stalinists to be alarmed.
In the first few days of the first semester week, when new students met each other and the tutors, I got a taste of the future events.
I gained the experience that the tutors not only tolerated the ridicule of Tory students, but even took part with joy.
Political issues such as the miners' strike, the privatisation and rejection of the government of sanctions against the apartheid regime of South Africa found their way into the wood-stamped rooms of the tutorial.
At my first of these events, I should translate French texts from the 18th century into English. I would not have been interested in what should then come.
"Miss Wyatt," said the tutor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I stumbled.
Pitt was a little man with a face like cake dough, and quite hesitant.
"Does thatcher supporters refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked me.
The other students tickled.
My eyes were filled with tears.
"I suggest they take a few French hours in your spare time - so if you're not too busy with your social activities," Pitt rang at me.
I returned to my room with a hanging head.
That night I was sitting alone in college at dinner when someone slightly tapped me on the shoulder.
It was an English student from the second year called James, who introduced himself as a member of the Conservative Student Association.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
Unfortunately, it is as it is.
Anyone who is suspected of being Tory is being harassed.
It's bad enough for me, but they know that your father Margaret Thatcher is close, so it'll be worse for you.
Most Tory First Semesters pretend to be followers of the Labour Party.
In a local pub, I later tried to adjust.
I insisted that I wasn't in agreement with Mrs. Thatcher on all points.
This trick should prove unsuccessful.
A beginner in philosophy, politics and business, who ironically attended Eton College, which is considered conservative, said to me: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're dirty.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverted and dirty.
"How do Tories have sex?" one asked me.
They beat each other, don't they?
I felt the way homosexuals felt before the more liberal legislation of the United States.
Would I ever be able to live a normal life at Oxford University?
Would I be able to meet like-minded people only after dark break-in?
Should I turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural inclinations?
The three years in front of me extended before my spiritual eye to a purgatory of worship and isolation.
The only tutor who openly recognized himself as Tory was Norman Stone, professor of contemporary history, who had his seat in my college.
He was hated not only for being a conservative, but also for consulting thatcher on foreign policy and writing speeches for them.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place, found it provincial and petty and rejected it for his Marxist-Determinist perspective on music.
In 1997, he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I began commuting between Oxford and my parents ’ house and found refuge with more open friends and family members in the city.
My father told me I hated Oxford, and why I did it.
He seemed disbelieving.
During his time in the Forties, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said in no time.
They would never do anything like this, not in my city of dreaming tower peaks.
Even my communist friends always showed perfect manners.
His moist eyes were murky.
Give it a chance.
I'm sure you're just being nodded.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance became weaker.
One of my male friends, also Tory supporters, had given in to the pressure and denied his convictions.
During a tutorial the following week, when another historian had seriously claimed that I was "an enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Although I was secretly torn from shame, I admitted that my parents had subjected me to brainwashing and called her "old fools".
The relief took only a short time.
It was my father who hit the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At that time he wrote two columns a week in the Murdoch press.
My door was locked.
I was hiding in my room, and after five minutes my hares gave up.
As they left, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
You're welcome to call me a whiny cock.
But no 18-year-old should ever suffer from such intimidation and malice in an educational institution.
And even more tragic is that it was Oxford - a university that not only produced 14 Tory Prime Minister, but is still hidden behind an unworthy reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance of fame"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - Meister der Couture", which was opened this week in London, ABC talks to Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian fashion maker.
Somerset House, former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
This was acknowledged by the designer at the opening of "Valentino - Meister der Couture", a magnificent retrospective, for which more than 130 haute couture clothes were put together, created by his "Maison" in the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his distinctive Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his distinguished clientele.
Valentino always felt fascination for the sticky and distant world of the nobility.
In the first hall of this exhibition, which will still be on display until March 3, there are a variety of private letters and photos with the signature of the most selected aristocracy, from the princess Salimah Aga Khan, to the princess Marie Chantal of Greece and Margarita from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophys of his social rise from the modest fashionmaker in the city of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international jetset.
To be in love with the nobility does not have to be disadvantageous.
"At least they don't kick their chickens on your magnificent carpet, as some beautiful celebrities from pop music do," says Baronin Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the two lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We were all happy when we were invited to his house in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, who was closely friends with forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of fame.
And yet he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress by Valentino
Also, the Argentine model Valeria Mazza does not forget the charisma of the fashion maker.
Many years ago, after a fashion show at Piazza di Spagna in Rome, we went home for dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
At every detail of his apartment, decoration, food and music, he was recognized and felt his influence.
"All invited people felt important and loved," remembers the "top model", which began their career at the Haute Couture week in Paris in 1995.
"He never comes out of fashion because his designs are works of art," she concludes.
Fashion Show of Origin
The life of Garavani is not a story of abstinence, rather of mutual love.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House was transformed into a glorious and 60-metre-long runway that proposes a roll-change: the user takes the place of the model and goes along the walkway to admire a dreamy "audit" that is wearing Valentino masterpieces, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristoteles Onassis, the costumes that Monica Vitti wore in "La Notte", or a coat of wool and leather that belonged to the empress Farah Diba.
In this audience of fashion dolls there are names like that of Sibilla de Luxembourgo, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofía of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the fashion maker, 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "unforgettable".
I remember perfectly.
It was a pants, a shirt, a vest type "Gillette" and a jacket from the autumn/winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift from him," says Naty Abascal, one of the designers' museums.
"I prefer him to all others because of his great love for women and because he emphasizes our beauty," adds the ex- Duchess of Feria.
I like the colors he uses very much; they have a lot of light and underline the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and opinion leader at the fashion Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can't forget the first time she was wearing a Valentino.
When I was a teenager in Italy, I dreamed of finally having the age and the opportunity to wear one of his evening clothes...
Finally, at the end of the 1990s, it was added.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a festival in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with flying skirt and a draped top with a décolleté that makes his name honour.
"It was a dream that came true," says Rodrigo d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino doesn't depend on fashion, his obsession is timeless," explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between París, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess D'Arenberg keeps her evening dress from the fashion maker "with absolute care" "because a dress is not only a dress, but also the associated memories".
The "king" of fashion
The great finale of the exhibition in Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller for her wedding with Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "Ragazze" (as the fashionmaker called his close-ups) were necessary to make this ivory silk dress with pearls, twelve different embroiderys and a four and a half meters long tail.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority of the professional press, this dress was a milestone in the Haute Couture at the end of the 20th century, "the return to the customers of the top society".
For years with the "savoir-être" of the elite, Valentino is now her best copy.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest award of Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded with the honorary legion, Garavani accumulates as many honors as each of the husbands of his clients.
"I have always noticed his refinement, his tranquility, his well-kept and perfect exterior," admits D'Arenberg.
I saw him last time a month ago at a gala dinner at the Museum de Orsay.
He was sitting at the table of the countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
"He was flawless; the time leaves no trace of him."
And this is what a princess says...
The most difficult occupation in the world: the human work animals of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and health when they carry 70 kilos of sulphur over the steep, rocky paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others work literally in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their lives by bringing sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano to the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, it must climb down to the ground of its crater every day, where the sulphurous gas flowing from the earth solidifies in contact with the air.
After breaking out large sulphur stones that can weigh up to 70 kilos in total, he transports them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders over the sloppy paths of stone.
It is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to a height of 2386 meters, but the exhausted carriers need more than 40 minutes to climb the turtle speed, keeping the balance and taking careful steps so that they do not slip out and crash.
They know that every step can cost their lives, as happened by a French tourist who crashed on the steep slopes of Kawah Ijen years ago.
Kawah Ijen's miners earn 5 Eurocents for every kilo of sulphur they reduce.
At the top, they walk the way between the tourists who photograph them like circus monkeys and walk with the tiring heavy baskets three kilometers to the scale, which a mining company has set a little further down at an altitude of 1850 meters
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, who since 1960 has been exploiting the occurrences in the volcano and (no better said) its workers, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 Eurocent) for each kilo of sulphur.
This is then sold to the petrochemical industry for 10,000 rupees (83 Eurocents) each, because this mineral is widely used in everyday life and is used for the production of matchwoods, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for bleaching sugar.
"As we normally carry 70 kg, we receive about 46,000 rupees for each path (3.8 euros)", explains Anto, who normally makes three routes a day.
For each route it takes three hours to complete it, but at the end of the day it has 138,000 rupees (€ 11.5) together.
What looks like a miserable wage for such a sheer inhuman effort, however, is the triple of what he would earn with the field work.
"The daily wage of the miners here, where 15,000 rupees are paid at the coffee harvest (1.2 euros) per day and the average monthly income is two million rupees (167 euros), is very high," explains the carrier who previously worked as a mare on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work was not as hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village nearby, for a reason that is as important as the sulphur in Indonesia: "I married a girl from Bali where they are Hindus, and I have brought them to Java to convert them to Islam".
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are irritated because of toxic gases.
The 27-year-old Anto has been risking his life at Kawah Ijen for three years, whose sulphur has already left his first traces, although he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are irritated from the volcano because of the toxic gases.
This is the price he has to pay for reaching his dream.
"I'll work here for two more years because I want to open a shop or learn Spanish or French," he promises in a more than just acceptable English.
This sympathetic and intelligent young man, punished for life, could work as a tourist guide, waiter or at the reception of a hotel, but instead he does the work of a carry-over.
It divides a dirty wooden hut with other carriers and stands up every morning at two o'clock, because the sulphur also flows out at night, where its characteristic yellow color in the dark shines bluishly.
Challengeing the shadows, he rises in the crater in the light of a small headlight on his helmet, which he bought from his own money.
About 400 carriers load the baskets with sulphur on their shoulders on the crater floor.
Despite its great profits, the mining company has not mechanized sulphur reduction to save costs, and does not supply any equipment to the carriers that work on their own account and are paid by weight.
They also receive no share of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) supplement per camera, which the guards of this nature park, together with the entrance fee of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), demand from tourists who come to photograph the volcano and the human carrier.
"This work is for the animals and not for the people" protests Madrusin, a strong 42-year-old supporter who has been working for three decades since leaving school at Kawah Ijen.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and ensures that he continues "as long as he can" because he needs the money for raising his three children between the ages of 10 and 18.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life.
Even if the sulphur burns the throat and itches the eyes when the wind suddenly turns and the miners clamp into the thick pillars that rise from the crater, the men are so hard that no one complains about severe diseases ... of course, except for the usual respiratory problems, osteoarthrosis, pain in the knees and bladders on the shoulders that have deformed from the weight of the baskets.
With the basket on his back, Unanik is only able to carry 50 kg with his 53 years.
Every day, he and his companions break 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, transported by three trucks across a goat path between the bush and the Tamansari camp in 18 kilometres.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life," explains Unainik, opening his mouth wide, where some teeth are missing.
Of his five children, the elder with his 30 years of age also works as a sulfur carrier.
Time is passing, but poverty continues generation after generation in one of the toughest occupations in the world: those who work as human burden at Kawah Ijen.
Singapore needs babies to save the economy
The Singaporeese blame themselves for having no children, for the career, the stress and the cost of real estate and the child education.
"The population of Singapore must grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: we fulfill our civil duty and create lives!
It seems unbelievable that the verses are part of an advertisement for minzbons, but yet - or just because of this - they became a viral video on YouTube at the beginning of this year in Singapore.
The sentences are part of a rapper song, the local proverbs such as "sleep will be a "bao" (laib) in the oven to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising company BBH, which shot the video, maintains the hope that the advertising spot will reach the problem in a funny way.
Her creative director Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the power of music to get people to fulfill their "national duty".
This is something just for the Internet, so we had to make it funny and funny.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in reproduction, so we realized that this is a topic that we had to take care of.
We knew that the government had tried a lot, such as the marketing of perfume with pheromones or the organization of speed dating evenings (fast flirts).
Possible that many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily lead to success.
So we thought: Why don't we do something as creative as possible to address this problem as a rap, for example?
1,2 Children
Whoever does not take this issue easily is the government of Singapore.
Each year, she spends 1,300 US dollars on policy measures to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for couples and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax advantages.
But everything has had little success so far.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech city state in Southeast Asia, which is also known for the conservatism of its rulers and its strict social controls.
According to its national population authority, the birth rate is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time this rate was over 2 - which is also known as the replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why don't the Singapore people have children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policy of the National Population Authority, says that this is due to "better training" and "greater career opportunities".
"This has enabled people to have much more options and priorities than to marry and form a family," she explains.
These changes in social conditions have contributed to the higher number of single people and to the delay in marriage and birth, the result of which is the reduction of the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at a drastic increase in immigration in order to combat the reduction of the population led to resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where Xenophobia, which is hardly disguised, blooms against many new immigrants, especially against the Chinese who are criticized for keeping wages low and not integrating.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the government party in Singapore achieved its worst election result since independence last year.
Since the elections, an attempt has been made to correct the problem with higher contributions and charges for foreign workers.
Expected consequences
While the falling birth rate is the known impact on the economic growth of a nation with tax revenues, health costs and immigration policy, the example of Singapore also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to achieve that not so many small apartments are built.
It has already had an impact on the housing market.
The Urban Development Authority has begun to control the number of small apartments known as "shoe boxes" and may be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show a great sales success.
However, there is concern that they can promote the life style of the individual, and that they deter construction companies from building large homes for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director General of the real estate company EL Developers, says that his "shoe boxes" can be sold much faster than larger housing units.
They are so popular, and the units are sold out by days and even weeks faster than the larger housing units.
This results in them being much better for our cash flow.
However, he admits that the new standards give the developers clearer orientations, which were previously introduced to obstacles if they wanted to build too many small housing units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
Even if these new rules could pave the way for an increase in the national birth rate, the talks with the Singaporeese who work in the financial quarter show that they will not have a great impact.
"People are heavily stressed, the apartments and also the education are expensive, which is why it is pushed out by many," says a young manager.
The children can have others.
"It is important for me to have my own money and time," says another, about twenty-year-old man.
Men and women point out their career, the stress and the cost of property and education as reasons why they cannot have children.
That is why the Singaporeese have the last word when it comes to having children - the government can do so much more.
The offline private offline is online private
Privacy
According to the dictionary, this is the property of private or "the area of private life where one is entitled to protection against any kind of interference".
What's private for someone under the age of 16?
How is this definition applied to everyday life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he exposes if he makes known on the Internet situations that he would not share in real life?
El Periódico interviewed five young people between the ages of 10 and 15 who are often on the network.
In four of the cases, they linked the term to "something very own" on a personal level and "to the password and user" when they applied it to the social networks.
"My deepest secrets would not be announced in a post," says the 10-year-old Jorge trying to explain the meaning of "private" in websites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger where he has had accounts for two years.
"These are very confidential secrets, my mother may know them, but not the whole world," he confirms.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or images of games.
I also spend my time with acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a picture that's not mine, or someone who's making the fool," he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong to publish obscene photos, of nude, of crime, or to write insulting or violent comments.
Jorge assures to know 35 friends he has in FB and nine followers in Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Among them is the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I logged in to Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if anyone answers me, I just upload them up," he adds.
"The social networks are entertaining, I can quickly talk to relatives in the distance or with friends" he states.
He asked that he would never accept an invitation from an unknown person.
Even if someone told him a stranger, he would ignore it.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask, he admits not to know 20 of the people he has added to his friends list.
"That doesn't scare me because we have something in common, for example music," he says.
According to the boy, no one made any indications or asked him for his address or phone number.
"If someone pushes me or asks them for me, I'll just remove him from my user account" he admits.
José joined Ask after reading a recommendation in Twitter.
The boy is not unknown to experiences known today as cyberbullying.
A friend's acquaintance was extorted in a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never learned who it was," he assures.
According to José, the victim didn't close the user account.
"He just made it private."
After that, he explains a number of steps to safely configure a user account.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yeah, I'd do that if he was unappreciative to me or I wanted to wipe him out.
"But I know this is cyberbullying," he explains.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, a teacher for English with a university degree in education and learning, says that to guide children and young people, it must be understood that it is the purpose of social networks to inform.
"The Internet was created as a medium for searching for information; but with the appearance of these pages, the rules of the game have changed," she says.
Porras explains that academic Marc Prensky, owner of a master's title in pedagogy at the University of Yale and author of the work "Digital Natives and Immigrants" formed these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are they, the children and young people who have grown up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants to teach them, where we still learn," he says.
He explains that it is a complex issue, "because we require them to have a defined criterion on what may be disseminated, published or said, and this at an age where maturity is not sufficient."
"They should also be selective when it is most important for them to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and young people what privacy is to ask them questions that make them think.
"To tell you not to do it, doesn't work," he says.
Then Porras mentions some possibilities: There are things you would not tell a stranger. Then why do you do it on the Internet?
Or: Would you like to publish a photo of you, like the one you published from a friend?
Do you know what the others are publishing about you?
Did you ask the other people for permission before you labeled photos of celebrations?
And another question: Do everyone need to know what you are doing at any moment?
Another point is to give them understanding that they have to act online as they do offline.
They're the same rules.
"Someone outside the Internet deals with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must apply to social networks," he explains.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teachers and educational advisers, commented that it is essential that parents carefully read the guidelines of social networks.
If they understand all sections, they have solid foundations to talk to their children about the importance of opening a user account on the Internet.
"For example, the age, or what you may share or publish," he explains.
According to Guardia, the children need to be reminded of the lesson "Don't talk to strangers".
Conclusion of the UNASUR Summit without publication of the Lima Declaration
The 6th meeting of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without publication of the Lima Declaration, which was previously announced and was theoretically to be signed by the seven governments present.
Efe repeatedly tried to gain access to the signed document at the VI. Ordinary Meeting of the Heads of State or Government of the Unasur. Sources at the State and Presidential Chancellery at the beginning announced that they would hand it over after the clause, but afterwards stated that it would be published at some time on the website of the Peruvian government.
In the case of questions on the text, they indicated that the content was presented to the press by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, in brief statements.
Journalists' access to information about the summit was limited at any time.
During the day, only the image of the presidential meeting without sound was transmitted in the press room with the message "private session, limited audio".
The few information circulated among journalists was received by press speakers from some of the UNASUR’s governments present at the meeting, but not by Peruvian press spokesperson.
The only document that was disseminated during the day was the list of participating presidents, which caused displeasure among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who requested more information.
After that, the Presidential Office of Peru sent an e-mail to the media with the "declaration" of the summit, but it was the declaration of Humala and not the official document for the conclusion of the summit.
Last October Peru hosted the Third Summit of South America - Arab States (ASPA), and even on this occasion the so-called Lima Declaration, which was previously announced, was not published, despite a strong call from the press.
On the official website of the ASPA you can be sure that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities stressed the existence of information systems for journalists, but they greatly restricted access to information.
The summit also ended with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to adopt a judgment of the Court of Justice of The Hague which resolved a border conflict between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would accept the decision of the IGH, which began on Monday in The Hague, in the trial that Lima initiated against Santiago, to listen to the pleas of both sides.
"We will follow and implement the ruling on the differences we are currently making to this international court," said Humala, along with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile was, is and will continue to be a country that adheres to international laws, seeks peaceful solutions to disputes, concludes agreements and submits itself to international courts," added Piñera and greeted Humala with a handshake in front of the flags of both countries.
The two Presidents confirmed that they would submit to the IGH, following a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which considered it a serious mistake, had brought an action against the Bogotá Agreement, in which they agreed to submit to the judgments of this International Court of Justice.
The Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner were present at the summit.
Paraguay, who has been excluded from the Unasur since 2011 after the resignation of its President Fernando Lugo, did not attend the meeting.
The guest President Ollanta Humala opened the talks on the morning and ended the summit shortly after lunch in Lima.
The head of state read the final document stating that 16 decisions were taken and 31 lines of action between the South American countries were set for a total investment of $17 billion.
On the decisions taken, he said that the Unasur countries will "take significant steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, for which we extend the decisions on residence rights."
He said that measures would be promoted to "improve cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and against organised cross-border crime, as well as measures to improve access to drugs and the Internet at low prices in all areas of South America and to act jointly and efficiently in the event of natural disasters".
With the crisis in Europe, "economic consolidation (in Latin America) should not take triumphant steps, but should serve to expand our production performance and to show our peoples a better future," added Humala.
"We have decided to give priority to a number of 31 emblematic projects to improve spatial links in South America and especially in rural and border areas...and thus to unite our countries and develop new economic forms," said the Peruvian President in a read-out statement.
These projects include five Peruvians lying on the transverse axes of its territory from the coast to Brazil, and two of which are intended to provide a better connection with Ecuador, although they did not provide any further details.
The final document also referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve for its reintegration into the Union of South American nations", from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to continue to remain an integrated region for prosperity and peace and good neighbourly relations was another aspect that was highlighted at the summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, before beginning his participation in the regional meeting, said that on Saturday in Mexico he expected a meeting with his counterpart to Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, to deal respectfully with the maritime conflict following a judgment of the IGH challenged by Bogotá.
"Maybe I'll meet President Daniel Ortega on the morning of Saturday," said Santos.
"We will review all these ways - they are not exclusive, and the agreement with Nicaragua also makes talks with Nicaragua necessary," he stressed.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we will treat this matter as civilised and respectfully as possible," added Santos.
Santos and Ortega would meet on Saturday in Mexico, where they intend to be present at the office of the new President of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
As part of the summit, the Ministers of Defence of the Block met in advance to adopt the 2013 Action Plan, which aims to strengthen dialogue and consensus on the defence of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, although the latter country is currently excluded.
Peru has the Presidency at the time of the regional block.
"South America needs to learn how to integrate citizens," says Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, today confirmed that the creation of a common citizenship is an objective, with "South America can actually learn something from Europe."
Correa, who took part in the 6th Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South America Nations (Unasur), which took place in Lima, told state television in Peru that Europeans "had been killed in the second world war and in other conflicts" and "are practically a father country today."
In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship that drives the member states of Unasur.
"The free movement of citizens and workers must be achieved in all South American countries, as is already the case in the Andean community; however, there are still reactionary sectors that seek to return to the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador also supported the reorganisation of the United States (OEA) under the command to reduce the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and to take account of those who have signed the San José Agreement on Human Rights.
Those who teach never commit themselves to anything, and in return we always sign the South Americans everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is based in Washington and is financed by the United States," he explained as an allusion to the political asylum that Ecuador granted to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he did not regret this decision because he did not betray his principles, but respected his "deep democratic values and views on human rights".
He added that at the time there had been "founded presumptions that Assange would be delivered to a third country and that his proceedings would not be complied with."
He also criticised the Swedish justice that he had requested to conduct an interrogation on his territory for a alleged sexual offence, while "Swedish case law allowed this by means of a video conference that could have been carried out through the Ecuador Embassy in London."
Correa explained that there would be a risk that Assange's health and mental condition would be affected.
"Since he was in our embassy, I have not spoken to him, but the ambassador has informed me that he has a slight problem with the lungs, but not a serious one," said Ecuador's head of state.
However, there is a risk of taking physical and psychological damage because he was trapped in a narrow space and could not perform physical exercises outdoors.
"That would affect the health of every human being," he added.
Correa stated that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange at the Ecuador Embassy in London since June was the granting of a free letter enabling him to travel to Ecuador, and that this was in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe. He underlined that there had been discussions with London to find a solution for the imprisoned founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not deal with human rights, we do not use this word in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe , because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, conducts a number of proceedings on various European bodies," he said.
And "If Britain grants this free letter tomorrow, I believe it will be done."
And if Sweden questioned Mr Assange at the Ecuador Embassy in London or about Skype as it allowed Swedish case law and in other cases, the problem would have been solved.
Correa took the opportunity to confirm himself as a defender of freedom of the press and said that what he does not tolerate is "the mediocrity, the evil intention and the lie that dispel freedom of expression."
"The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not the evil and perverted politicians, but bad journalists who seek profit and extortion," he said.
In this sense, he congratulated the fact that Ecuador was no longer "dominated by such journalists, nor by the bankers or hegemonic and spooky-bourgeois countries", and predicted that in a re-election he would "decrease the revolution in order to continue the way in that right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur at least until its next elections, arguing that the organism "must remain hard and must not allow opportunism and none to be legally disguised" because it "devastated the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay."
The President of Ecuador also considers the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the judgment of the International Court of The Hague, which favoured the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime borders between the two countries, to be "absolutely justified."
At present, this judgment is not being implemented.
It is a problem between a South American and a Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the pursuit of a common path.
They must be dealt with comprehensively so that they can be overcome and looked forward.
He also relied on a good conclusion of disputes on the maritime borders between Peru and Chile before the Court of Justice and said that "it is right for Latin America to call on international bodies if both countries commit to accept the judgment, even if it is very harsh."
With regard to the possibility that he would stand as a candidate for the next presidential elections in Ecuador to achieve his third consecutive mandate, he stated that he "sees this possibility with much optimism and joy, although sometimes it is very difficult."
Correa assured that if he lost the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life.
Power never interested me personally, but under as unjust circumstances as in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement had the belief that I was the one who guaranteed this probable victory, so I must live up to this responsibility," he said.
If I were to win, it would be my last period as president, then I would withdraw from public life.
This also applies if we lose.
"That's decided," he explained.
Correa also referred to the treatment of the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I just talked to the Vice-President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, who told me that he had traveled there for a planned routine treatment, and that he would be expected to be able to travel back to Cuba after the election campaign.
"It does not mean a relapse in the state of health of President Chávez," he commented.
The Ecuadorian head of state today took part in the 6th summit of the Heads of State or Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) in Lima, which ended with the call for greater regional integration in order to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
The cause of death due to AIDS is a late detection today
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed the result of the investigation: HIV-positive.
"It was as if a bomb hit," he says about the moment when he received the diagnosis that the doctor tried "to weaken" without apparent success.
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to inform himself about it; and this with such a commitment that he was celebrating his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), in which he came after several fights in 1994.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was difficult to imagine at the beginning of the 1990s when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigmata.
At that time, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye, "because it led to a dead end."
At that time, AIDS was synonym for death.
Today it is possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life.
However, many people still come to the clinic who know nothing about their disease and in whom the virus has already caused damage and exhausted their immune system, and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, i.e. after the first reported cases, "the great success today means that the survival of a patient who receives treatment in good time and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," said the head of the HCG HIV unit, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, saying that this information was supported by a prestigious scientific publication in April of this year.
The specialist for infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008 scientists have concluded that AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of impairment of the immune system of individuals at the beginning of treatment, and that those who are not drug dependent have greater chances: up to 30 years with a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years with a count of 500 CD4.
Simply put, the above statements mean that those who receive HIV-positive diagnosis at the age of 25 can in this sense be "problemless 75 years old as long as they are under control", said this expert.
In order to properly classify this progress, it must be recalled that the life expectancy of Mexicans is now an average of 76 years.
Even if mortality has decreased significantly in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has decreased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNUSIDA's annual report), it is still true that 60 percent of the patients listed in the national database have died since AIDS appeared.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and by May of this year, there are already 187 deaths; however, it is assured that there has been universal access to antiretroviral medicines since 2005.
So why do people still die from it?
- In my opinion, the problem is not access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and so it is in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years we have had no problems with the care of the medications. The problem is that the people come in a far advanced state because they do not know their condition of infection, i.e. in very late stages of the disease.
He makes a striking statement: "Nine out of ten patients come to us if they already have a accompanying infection. To be able to influence global mortality, more early diagnosis is required, which is why all persons who need it must be offered massive detection tests."
The experts and officials of the Consejo Estate de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (State Committee on AIDS Avoidance in Jalisco) and also the patients like Fabrizio who had his test carried out at a private laboratory, and this for the only reason that it had made a friend of him who, despite his young age, was already in the AIDS phase and even had the Kaposi sarcoma (a cancer-like tumor) which is one of the usual complications.
Everything's different when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die and don't want to hear anything.
"If I have to die already, rather burst three times," they say in my case.
The change was to improvement, I eat well, I drive sports and take the medications.
Today, his parents only know he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like everyone else.
"I work, I do a lot, I have an active but responsible sex life, I take care of my health and the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO, in order to animate with his testimony those who are afraid today in the context of the worldwide AIDS day.
They should do the test if they belong to the risk group. The sooner they know whether they are HIV-positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live responsibly like all people.
His news is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
condoms behind the loading table
Between the health programs and the simple citizen there are large holes, explains Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, who has adopted the cause of HIV.
And the most important thing is prevention.
At the designated places "the distribution of condoms was actually increased; earlier they were delivered individually, now they give us packages with a hundred pieces, which is already good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom," he said.
Young people are at risk for new infections.
"What do you need them for?" is a widespread ridicule of social workers, guidance staff in schools, employees in pharmacies and in the health system who do not want to expose themselves to young people, the correspondent assured.
He proposed reorienting this inefficient distribution; the condoms should be located not only behind the counter, but in output equipment in public toilets of facilities frequently visited by young people.
It should not promote promiscuity.
They should not be paid the beer and motel, as the governor Emilio González answered to the question as to whether it would be distributed under his administration.
"Sexuality doesn't look like this; it's best to bring the condoms closer to those who already engage in sexual activity," he put it to the fore.
Key data of Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12.158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is nationally in the fourth place new and cumulative AIDS cases, and in the 13th place in relation to HIV.
92% of cases of infection are via sexual intercourse, 6% over the blood, and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV because there are 4 or 5 people for each registered case who do not know.
After the Court of Appeal of the United States has confirmed a judgment that does not recognise the restructuring of the Vitro Group's liabilities achieved through a trade bankruptcy in Mexico, a disastrous precedent will be created for each national undertaking with its branches in the neighbouring country that has payment.
So it could be said that the procedures for the survival of the companies that permit the Mexican laws do not apply in the country of the stars and stripes contrary to international agreements.
In practice, the recognition of the judgment by Judge Harlin Hale at the Bancarrotas Court for the northern district of Texas on June 15 leads the Mexican companies to be helplessly exposed to the seizure of their property beyond the Bravo River.
However, the decision opens the door to the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico to appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States for three inconsistencies.
While the judge of the case points out that creditors must be subject to bankruptcy law of the United States, the Court of Appeal of the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, first states that the main proceedings are the trade bankruptcy dealt with in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation is not known in cases of insolvency of companies with cross-border profiles.
In fact, for this purpose, the United Nations Model Law was created for the Unification of International Commercial Law, with the American Law Institute being used as a culprit.
Secondly, the judgment states that, without the votes of the companies, after recognition of the liabilities in the bankruptcy mass that Vitro’s branches had with their parent company, the necessary majority would not have been achieved for the restructuring of the liabilities.
However, this possibility is recognised by the Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case in which this scheme was approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agrimex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities among companies of the group were confirmed by the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles (Bundesinstituut für Handufscurse).
It is also true that after the vote of the branches the creditors of Vitro, the creditors who complained against Vitro in the courts of the United States, i.e. the vulture funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, had not reached a majority.
The vote would have been 45 percent against 37 percent.
This is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro is to blame for its difficult situation as of 2008 in the context of the major economic crisis in the United States, which struck the country.
For this reason, the González Sada family objected to the same appeals court so that the vote would be taken in plenary, that is, by all judges, because only three of them voted.
If this is not accepted, the Cerciorare opposition, which requires the review of the proceedings by a higher authority, shall be filed by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The serious part of this case is that the court left aside a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the Figura amicus curiae (Friend of the Court) describing Vitro's proceedings under the Trade Infringement Act and stating that it had strictly complied with the agreements signed by both countries in order to comply with Chapter 15 of the United States bankruptcy law.
It is also noted that the country has been subject to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules laid down in the cases of cross-border inability to pay, which guarantee the equality of creditors and creditors.
Two-banded carambole: a blow for vitro and for the country.
General balance sheet
After the announcements by the Mexican Air Transport Trade Unions against the former owner Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent administration, did not move forward for several months, the Asociación Sindical de Pilotos Aviadores (Communist Union of Pilots) finally made progress.
The appeal, led by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has now filed a criminal proceedings against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of being adversarial to justice.
The supervisory authority has then systematically refused to inform the main administration of the Republic of a transaction carried out by the entrepreneur in order to withdraw 198 million pesos from the trustee account F/589 of Bank IXE on the name of Mexicana de Aviación.
These funds were used to acquire shares of the Administratora Profesional de Hoteles (professional hotel management).
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Dragon Mart is surrounded
At a weekend meeting at a forum of the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of civil society decided to create a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
As you know, we are talking about a huge sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the country beyond the wall, supplemented by a living area for the employees of 150 companies.
In advance, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of the Manufacturing Industry) has reached to unite the governors in the southeast in order to resist the monumental establishment, which partially destroyed protected areas and is the mother of all threats to industry.
ACTA is dead
Because the government of the Senate failed to explain the conditions and circumstances under which the Mexican Ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement known under the English abbreviation ACTA, the matter has already been archived according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property.
As you know, these measures were taken, although the Senate had not considered the possibility because it considered them to be a violation of freedom of expression in social networks.
Homex long term
In the pursuit of paying long-term liabilities without affecting short-term liabilities, the construction company Homex brings more than 500 million pesos to the market.
The issue is the first of four equal issues that promise an interest payment every 28 days.
Founding of Competition
Created from NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet, leading information technology companies, a group of companies called Competival has been established, whose aim is the service market of the software clusters in Central and South America.
The corresponding investment is over 1.5 billion dollars.
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
Hector "Hetin" Reyes, the world boomer of the basketball, was associated with basket sports for more than 60 years and traveled the whole world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a great spiritual collection of the history of the basketball of the country as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Before being tied to the wheelchair by a stroke in 2008, Rexes was part of this sport for 6 years, whether as a player of lower classes, players of the first national league, authorised and head of the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or president of the Basketball Association.
"My life has been a lot of hats in basketball, even several at the same time, when I was President of the BSN, Chief Executive Officer of the National Team and President of the Association in the 1990s," Reyes recalled on a visit from Primera Hora to his home in Bayamón, where he has lived with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes doesn't exaggerate with this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated with photos and memories of his long career and testify to them.
Bayamón in the heart
The most emotional memories are those that recall his time at the Vaqueros from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, where he celebrated his 15th anniversary as co-business manager or managing director of the club.
"These were my best years, which I enjoyed the most, because I was allowed to be part of eight Vaqueros championships since 1967 as Managing Director, Co-Chairman or Trainer.
There were many fulfilling years, including the five consecutive championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I voted with a 1981 championship, the year of Jerome Mincy's debut at BSN.
From then on, "Cuco" took over Ortiz, who was a very good administrator," says Reyes.
I remember that Gene Bartow, who worked here as a coach and was employed at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said, "I have a very strong and 2 m big player.
Do you want him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow then recommended the free-throwing specialist Raymond Gausse, who became a citizen and was one of our best pitchers.
I remember when he said that if Mincy had made a championship for Bayamon possible, Gausse would take care of another one.
The championship of the Vaqueros with Gausse was awarded to him, but already out of a distance, because he was already in the top position of the association in 1988.
At that time he preferred to enjoy his executions and those of Mincy in the national team.
I remember the first time we won against the USA at the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico.
Then came the 1990 World Championship, where we finished fourth, which should have been bronze, if not this Canadian referee had been, who had us repeat the last move for the second time, Reyes said.
Was this group of the 1990 World Cup the best national team you've ever seen?
She is one of the best, as is the one who won the 2004 Olympics against the Dream Team.
My favorite, however, is the team at the 1991 Pan-American Games in Cuba, where we won gold and offered a fight to the US team, as they did when they won us at the Bronze World Cup.
Not only were Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and Piculín (Ortiz) present, but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be there in 1990 because of knee injury.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of personalities, but with which we won a gold medal and which gave us great pleasure was that of the 1995 pre-Olympic tournament in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a substitute for the locked players because of the events at the Pan-American Games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal against any prognosis.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
That was undoubtedly Piculín Ortiz.
His figures at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated on this level as Piculín.
And this without taking his career into account in the different leagues in which he played.
Who was the best coach in Puerto Rico?
That is a difficult question.
We had a number of good trainers like Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
I like the work of Leo Arill.
What do you think is the best you've achieved in the association?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, which included the BSN at the beginning of the 1990s up to 17 teams in one season.
What else are you doing?
There are things I would have introduced, such as the regionalization of the lower categories.
That the guys in Ponce, for example, play only in their territory and only meet teams from other corners of the island in the national playoffs.
Today the children make unnecessary trips and games.
At least I see the result of the required training and training courses for trainers, table officials and arbitrators.
I'm proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I like listening to music, watching videos of my time music in YouTube, enjoying my grandchildren and occasionally going to a basketball game.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always at my side.
Larry Hagman is dead
Larry Hagman was born on 21 September 1931 in Forth Worth (Texas) and became famous worldwide for his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R". in the television series "Dallas", where he played a unscrupulous, insidious and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, is dead.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who came back this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died on Friday afternoon due to cancer complications according to a family press release to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his beloved birthplace of Dallas, where he played the iconic role he liked most," said the family.
The family of Larry and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the celebrations of the harvest Thanksgiving.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original and follow-up series, was at Hagman when he died in the Dallas hospital, her journalist Jeffrey Lane said.
He made everyone happy who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived life to the full", explained Gray in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992, and he admitted to drinking a lot over the years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was detected in his liver, and he was transplanted.
In the years before "Dallas" Hagman became known on television as a nice guy from 1965 to 1970 with the Sitcom "Adorable Jeannie" of the television station NBC.
There he played the astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is put on his head when he meets an attractive "Jinn" (played by Barbara Eden), who will live with him at home.
He also performed two comedies, which were broadcast only for a short time, such as The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
Among his cinema works were well-rated roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful interpretation of the enchanting abominable J.R. who made Hagman a superstar.
The dramatic series of the CBS television series on the Ewing clan and other figures in its surroundings was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertising slogan "Who shot at J.R.?", which was expected to create expectation of an episode full of emotions where the figure of Hagmann was almost killed, led to an international speculation, and millions of dollars were bet in bets.
This made the series a record of spectators at that time.
When the answer became known in a chapter in November 1990, it was seen by an average of 41 million spectators who turned "Dallas" into the second most widely seen entertainment program since the end of "Mash" 1983, which had 50 million spectators.
It was Kristin who shot the brother-in-law of J.R. (interpreted by Mary Crosby).
J.R. had weakened her and threatened to present her as a prostitute if she did not leave the city, but others also had reasons to want to see him dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of Ewing as a corrupt, insatiable man with a charismatic smile: an insidious businessman and unfaithful husband who sought to instruct his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what to say on J.R.'s tombstone," said Hagman in 1988.
It should be called "Here rests the honourable citizen J.R. Ewing".
This is the only business he didn't win.
Victoria Principal, co-author of the original series, remembered Hagman on Friday as an "especial personality on and outside the screen".
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable to millions of devotees in the world and remains in our hearts, who have had the luck of knowing and loving him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success in the TV channel TNT.
The recording of five chapters for the second season was completed, and a sixth chapter was just turned, the transmitter informed.
From Warner or from TNT there was no immediate explanation as to how the loss of Hagmann would be treated in the series.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who played classical works like "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a youth when she got Larry during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the theaters in New York at the beginning of the 1950s, then served in the Air Forces in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met the young designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities live.
In 2001 he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I wrote nothing of which I believed it could harm or harm someone in any way," said the Associated Press at the time.
After the liver transplant, he worked for liver donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist anxious patients.
"I advise them, give them courage, I meet with them when their operations are ahead and afterwards," he explained in 1996.
I want to give them some comfort, such as "no fear, it's a bit uncomfortable the first time, but you'll be fine".
He also fought against smoking and participated in several campaigns.
Start of the course that studies the "End of the World"
Every week, students examine apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs and global warming.
Every semester, when the religious professor decided to hold a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible hook: the end of the Mayan calendar's "long back count" on December 21, many people believed it meant the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what to expect in the following two months: the destructive Hurricane Sandy, whom some have called "Deudarmaggedon", as well as a growing conflict involving Israel, the place of which the Christian theorists believe that the Apocalypse begins.
"I have not noticed that this will be the most apocalyptic semester ever," said Charmé this week to students at the University of Rutgers-Camden (New Jersey).
If someone analyzes what happened in the world today, as if we were thirty days away from it, this would be a really good period.
And he reminds us that the bad is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only professor who offers courses on the "end of the world" of this semester, which should actually be the last in history.
In Temple, the associate Professor Barry Vacker gives the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World."
Every week, students examine apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs and global warming.
"We analyse why these ideas spread over time," he said, as well as the way in which hypothetical scenarios are offered that lead to a certain human behavior.
For example, if nuclear material gets into the hands of terrorists, a war could break out.
This month the students analyzed films with apocalyptic content and examined how they could be compared to the real life.
"I have tried to inform the students of what is possible, likely, credible and impossible," said Vacker.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, the professor of Latin American history Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, a associate professor of art history and anthropology, have formed a team to offer a course with the simple term "The End of the World".
"We do not accept 2012 so that we always keep the option of holding the course new, in case the world does not go down," said Restall.
Despite the "existence", students must study, create projects and take part in final examinations.
In Penn State, the final examination is carried out on the eve of the Apocalypse, which is why the students have no other chance than "to continue working until night, where the world is supposed to end," said Restall.
The courses were very popular.
"In two hours there were no more places," said Restall about his course for students with a high average, which was filled with 35 students.
Weeks before the start of the semester, we received emails from students who asked if there were still places available.
Students, for their part, assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It's fascinating to see what people are doing to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Rutgers-Camden for religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sectal or religious mentality is actually just a question of consolation or its lack.
The 25-year-old student Will Wekesa explains that he has seen all the apocalyptic films.
"I never heard of a lesson where this is being taught," he said.
I enjoy it.
But none of the students surveyed - and less a professor - said to believe in the last date of December 21.
"Our first project dealt with the prophecy of the Mayas, and in a certain way we discredit them," said Julie Seilen, student last year in Temple, 21 years old and from West Chester.
Mayas never predicted the end of the world; it was just a key point in the calendar, said Restall.
He notes, however, that in Western society there is an apocalyptic fear that leads back several centuries when people responded to changes in their environment with the prediction of the end of the world.
The Internet has increased these speculations.
"People don't think so elsewhere," he says.
This is mainly the case in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who teaches in the Philippines this year, quickly answers the question of whether he would know a course there about the "end of the world".
"The Philippines do not participate at the end of the world," he wrote as an indication of an exception to a higher instance.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that over the years many days were spoken by the last court, and said that if nothing happened on December 21, "people immediately think of a new date" or philosophyd that December 21 was the beginning of a seven-year period after which the end of the world would come.
Students and professors take this date easily.
Several said that they wanted to go to celebrations about "the end of the world".
"Maybe I'll call some friends so we can laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student for communication.
