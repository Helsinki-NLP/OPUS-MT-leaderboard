The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of the goods...
I'm #PRS_ORG# wholesale and so it's not a problem for me.
Just need a number or instruction what I should add to the package so that it can be traced by you as a return.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs 179€.
To be honest, I think this is very annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and order again for the better price or is there another possibility of crediting?
I also think, in principle, that children should not be expected to play a parent role for their little siblings.
However, I think it is also good for big siblings to take care of the little ones in measure.
Let's take a look, let's help, bring the bottle, etc.
So they learn responsibility, help in the family and are involved.
As long as they can still be enough of a child, I don't see any problem.
If your K1 is working alone for a short time and it's okay for him, that's good.
You can best judge for yourself if that suits your children.
It is not that he should wrap K2 and accompany it for hours at a time when he is asleep.
It's probably questionable.
Perhaps that's why the psychologist's statement comes.
Because if something actually happened like a fire, burglary, earthquakes, alien invasion, etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk you're going to take is of course your discretion ;)
Please help me find the title of a book again!
I remember reading a crime / thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the whole act, but the title partout doesn't want to come to my mind anymore maybe someone knows here...
The story was about fear and how to treat it.
At the beginning of the story, an animal nurse commits suicide by overstretching himself with food and going to his predatory cats.
The case is taken over by a Commissioner who, after a brief investigation, receives his therapist from the one hospital where he treats anxiety patients.
The Commissioner has a little niece who also has a fear (of fire) and lands with this therapist.
There is more suicide and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is sent anonymously before each suicide to go to the place of suicide and document and place the photos on the internet.
In any case, it turns out that this therapist operates some kind of underground therapy group where the patient is planted a chip that suppresses a anxiety centre in the brain and ultimately puts the patients in the most extreme way.
(a woman jumps out of the window another goes to death with intention)
This fear is referred to in the book as "the fight".
In the end there is a big showdown in the clinic that had to do with a fire.
This is the gross act I am quite sure that the book was written in the original by a French author.
If this action is known to someone or even someone can tell me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh, ever, I don't have the password for the wlan available.
Must contact my husband first.
But that may take some time.
What steps do I have to take after that?
Is it also possible to get the price difference returned ?
Child, 4 years old, Splitter under the thumbnail
Child, four years old, has over the entire length wood splinters under the thumbnail (outside).
Have tried to pull him with a tweezer.
Very hard to grasp.
Didn't work out and hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No more chance.
Tomorrow we'll go to the doctor.

Because of Omikron: Johnson wants to advance boost vaccination
Always new omikron cases provide politics and science in the UK.
By New Year, therefore, all qualified adults in England are to receive a vaccination offer.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to advance even faster in the corona booster vaccinations in view of the rapid rise in omicron numbers than previously envisaged.
Every adult in England should already have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said in a pre-recorded video message to his fellow countrymen on Sunday evening.
So far, the target date was at the end of January.
The British Government will provide additional support to speed up vaccination campaigns in the parts of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
In view of the omicron variant, one faces an emergency, which is why vaccination protection needs to be strengthened urgently, said Johnson.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased by a third dose.
"Let's boost you now," said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 further omicron cases were recorded in the UK, increasing the total to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of 65 percent. dpa
Is the full amount refunded by the purchase price upon collection?
I'm in favour of everyone introducing themselves to pronouns.
I sent out an application.
Today the invitation came to a conversation by email.
I want to reply to the e-mail.
Unfortunately, the name is not a "Peter", but a somewhat more complicated name.
I've been Googleing him and, depending on where he/she has a cultural background, it's either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write the email now.
Can anyone please help me?
** I am a foreigner, and I do not want any official to step over my feet.
Conclusion: everyone should introduce himself with pronouns.
Got five books on it.
4 of them.
Only the one I bought today can't go
Obviously, the chair had an unclear lack of sales.
How can such a upholstery occur after 9 months?
Only tried on the #PRS_ORG#.
However, this has been working since approx.
14 days no more.
Therefore, I have always bought the latest books on the website and then read on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and wanted to buy 8.
However, there were no more.
Now they are available again and I want you to add 2 chairs to the order and charge me this.
[CW] The feeling if I can't help.
Content Warning: I'm going to write a little bit detailed about domestic violence here.
I just need to write something about the soul.
I (21) come more often into contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence for professional reasons.
A topic that really nights at me and unfortunately is far too common is that many victims can't be helped or we don't think we can help them.
It is quite clear to me that we cannot do everything and that it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than if I can do nothing in such situations.
I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in conversation under four eyes, with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing I can't reach everyone.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's a fear of revenge, fear of leaving the usual social environment, fear of taking the children out of it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, partly even very close to tears, all are worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't just have to take violence.
Often I wish I could help in any case... I know I can't.
But this never makes it easier.
Please, always remember, you are worth living without violence, that is so inconceivablely important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What's the series about "League of Legends"?
A lot of fantasy, many complicated names, a breathtaking presentation: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, has recently started on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the two seasons already announced?
Basketball-Bundesliga: Derby-Debakel der MHP Giant Ludwigsburg at the Merlins Crailsheim
At least youngster Johannes Patrick was abandoned.
Nothing again: For the second time in not even three months the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Prior to the game Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick had said with the retrospect of the cup defeat at the beginning of October at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: "We still have some anger in the belly".
But it did not lie down after the game - but again in view of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the basketball league.
More than the naked result disappointed the way of the appearance.
The three-quarters were just 13 percent, 4 hits (all by young John Patrick) and 31 attempts - still questions?
The answer was given by John Patrick: "We were simply not concentrated enough after the victory at Tenerife and have not implemented what we have trained".
To move the ball.
His opponent Sebastian Gleim responded: "To win a cool game against Ludwigsburg for the second time," said the happy coach.
"It felt like 10,000 people ago."
On Saturday, only 750 visitors were admitted to the Hohenlohe-Arena, but they were paid.
Not least because of BBL top scorers T.J. Shorts, who marked 22 points and guided the game of his team.
"The best player I've ever trained," Gleim praised.
While Patrick's team itself failed the performance carriers such as Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) on the whole line.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the giants prevent a total debacle and came up to eight points after they had already returned 39:59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon came to twelve points.
Fortunately, much time for contending is not left.
Already on Wednesday (19h) the giants receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, before then also in Ludwigsburg a maximum of 750 spectators.
We used to have a different address, but I changed it.
Yeah, I've been in there a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We have informed ourselves legally again and have therefore sent them back to us again.
We first got in touch half a year ago.
Always peeled out of the egg: Max Raabe is 59
He is able to inspire his audience with reinterpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
He is currently on the road with the program "Good day, good luck" - if he is allowed to appear.
Actually, Max Raabe wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But it's not going to happen.
The planned concert was moved to May 2022 - "on official instructions" in order to control the Corona virus.
Also other of his appearances planned during the Advent season must first fail, as it is on the website of the singer, who today becomes 59, and his musician (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January onwards, the artists want to make up for their dates already set in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe has already sung and liked to sing as a youth.
In Berlin he studied opera singing, in 1986 he founded the Palace Orchestra together with his fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established itself with its repertoire of hits and Chansons in the style of the comedian harmons.
He was awarded many prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached second place in the charts, just like his success album "For Women This Is Not a Problem" (2013).
He made it out of the niche into the mainstream.
Always dressed elegantly, the blonde hair firmly combed back and thought of labels, Max Raabe is no longer to be thought away from the current German-speaking music landscape.
With the program "Good day, good luck" he has been on tour since 2020. dpa

Federal Minister for Construction Klara Geywitz: No new apartment is created due to expropriation
The new Federal Minister for Construction Klara Geywitz (SPD) has opposed the expropriation of large housing companies, as it was called for in a popular decision in Berlin.
"With an expropriation, no new apartment is created, only the owner structure changes," said Geywitz in an interview with the "Daysspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants security that their rent will remain affordable in the coming years.
A colorful mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives or housing companies is, by the way, the best protection against monopoly formation.
In Berlin, the coalition from SPD, Greens and Left Party wants to set up an expert commission on how to deal with the outcome of the popular decision.
But if the situation does not relax, Geywitz did not exclude talks with the FDP in the traffic light coalition about further intensifications in rental law.
The coalition agreement provides for a rental price brake until 2029, a limitation of rental taxes in tense housing markets and the extension of the rent mirror.
I will talk to the Minister of Justice to implement this as soon as possible.
If the rental market does not relax, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," stressed the SPD politician.
Hello, I wanted to order something and I noticed after a few days that I forgot the last step in the payment.
Unfortunately, the product is no longer available.
Do they know when it will be in stock again?
Or will it ever come again?

Thank you for the quick clarification!
If the lamp is shipped in March, how long will the shipping take?
I've already cut my finger
That's an absolute fragility.
At least 100 dead by Tornados in Kentucky
With a devastating storm system, numerous Tornados have been pulled through the United States.
In Kentucky alone, more than 100 people could complain.
The pictures from there remind of a war zone.
During the night on Saturday several tornados have caused serious devastation in the United States and may have claimed up to a hundred deaths.
The storms leave behind a snow of about 320 kilometers of devastation, especially in the member state of Kentucky.
His governor Andy Besher said after a visit to the disaster area, wherever the tornado was, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just go.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It is difficult to imagine that this is possible at all.
He expects up to a hundred deaths in Kentucky alone, and the official figures rise hourly.
Hello, I just saw she sold out display case #NAME#.
That's very bad.
Is she still being produced?
Or was she taken out of the range?
Is there the possibility to order this display case in another country?
until when are you reporting?
If the delivery cannot take place in my apartment, I must cancel the order !
I understand this, but can I order the ceiling now and have it delivered to Germany, which is in the shopping cart?
I had returned an artike or given a return via the contact form and wanted to ask if it was coming or being processed, since I had not yet received a confirmation.
Companies pay vaccines and change advertising claims
While the Federal Government continues to reject the proposals for a vaccination premium, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and offer money premiums to their employees for vaccination.
They are therefore in line with the social partners ÖGB and the Chamber of Commerce, which today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
The reorganisation of advertising logs to vaccination calls - according to the German model - is also intended to increase the willingness to corona vaccinations.
He's been transferred to a company he's slandered about.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It's been a year.
He obviously didn't sew in his old place and looked for something else.
You can do that too.
And that he didn't like you back then: well, no matter what.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please accept the cancellation.
That will be legally relevant.

Aid for first own campaign
Boron to the grusse!
I am just leading the adventure for a group of 4 friends about the grab-pass and would like to lead my heroes seamlessly into a campaign specifically written for the players.
We're playing DSA 5.
The big bow is made, the bad guys and their motivations written, the individual files invented and now I am about to write the entry-level adventure and already stumble over my own feet at the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes are to bring a ferry with grain from Gratenfels to a small village near the Lake Thuran.
This is where the further action is to develop.
A few miles from the village, a group of Goblins is supposed to roam the heroes and lure them into an ambush.
I would like to give the players the opportunity to resolve the confrontation in different ways: convincing, acting, threatening, the danger at an early stage to recognize whatever happens to the players.
Group strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 with spears, 6 armed with bows and sabres
In the absence of notice, the Goblins lurk up the hero in a hollow path and flank the vehicle to the left and to the right each to three arches armed, while two stop the vehicle with spears.
If it comes to battle and the heroes are subjected, I have two solutions.
1. The heroes are all found unconscious and then healed by the son of the village school, a half-eleven.
The cart's gone, of course.
2. Should a defeat be inevitable, this half-eleven with two of his servants intervenes and comes to the aid of the hero in battle.
The cart's still there, everything's great.
How appropriate do you think Deus ex Machina of solution 2?
Is the Encounter too much as an entry into the adventure?
The Goblins group will play a crucial role later, so not only cannon feed.
EDIT: Wow, I didn't expect so many answers, especially not so many great suggestions and tips.
I'm sure I'll love many of your ideas and now I have more confidence in my narratives.
I built the lamp apart again.
And put together again.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
That's why I'd like to send her back anyway.
If you can then get the back notes, then I can pack the lamp and take it to #PRS_ORG#.

Will everything be picked up again or only the storage room part?
I'm annoyed by Sky Sport F1
Hello, dear F1 fans, over the season the quality on the German sky has decreased more and more, so I want to get a little air with this post.
First of all, the transfer was stopped in the middle of the F2 race today to start on time the F1 preliminary reporting.
Although due to the delayed start and the start accident the schedule was far behind the planning, one could still have shown the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision (!).
It seems, however, that for legal reasons F1 has priority and therefore everything else has to be restricted, so Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Still stupid, especially since Sky UK has transferred the race to the end.
Nevertheless, a small praise: the commentator Olivier Blacktyes has well accompanied the difficult situation around the serious accident.
Then there was regular ignorance in the F1 again with the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that under a red flag one could change the tires.
Although this situation existed in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both of them only came to the conclusion that steps may change the tires when there were corresponding radio statements to Hamilton on this topic.
At Sky UK as well as RTL both commentators immediately knew that there is this possibility for steps.
I believe that such elementary rules should be easily known when commenting on the F1 on a pay-TV channel.
It is also not the first enigmatic advice that is now possible or required by rules, both of which simply have constant uncertainties on the subject of rules.
In general, the tricky comment-style of Roos does not like, but admit that the taste is.
But I really like Heiko water from RTL better.
In addition, there are constant ambiguities that leave both simply unprofessional effects, such as ordering coffee from (even unsuspecting) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" by Ralf Schumacher.
Just the latter brings a lot of unrest into the commentary that he obviously does not take seriously.
Last but not least, the advertising just takes over at Sky, in the run-out, Sky is the only station that goes into the advertising, as you can listen to at F1TV because only the German soundtrack without comment has to come out right after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do.
Also, these two stations do less advertising in the trainings than Sky, and this as a free-TV channel.
Although one has to praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, this alone does not allow me to overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of Sky Sport F1's program is also very poor and full of repetitions.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-speaking station that transmits the F1.
Unironically, RTL makes a better job in the four races they can still transfer.
So at least the grandiose F1 season is much less fun than it would be possible with a reasonable transmitter.
I'd be interested in your opinion.
On this one: #PRS_ORG# pendulum lamp, brass and multi-colored glass x 1
Hello, I have an article that should be delivered last week and that is still not delivered.
I've contacted the chat twice and nothing so far.
The First Lady told me that it will be sent on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday that she will check and send an email and she never answered.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of them has already had a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole in the front part of the chair).
I'm asking for support.
Fan pumps are excellent to supply an additional aquarium with oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via air lifters.
This series is offered in 3 variants by us.
Check the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the services in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, you can operate entire plants with them.
If you own a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outputs are suitable for connecting multiple outlets.
The MK series has one, two or four outputs, but depending on the model fan pump also offers to set an accent in the aquarium, e.g. with an air curtain (see our shop) or with a décor that transforms the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasure chest, a shell or something like that.
The MK series has a special, soundproofed design and thus provides low operating noise.
The installation is very easy.
The fan pump is connected by means of an air hose 4/6 mm to an external currenter or the like...and it can start.
The fan pump should be equal or higher than the water level and be fitted outside.
If the fan pump sits deeper than the water level, you should put a return valve in between.
Simply cut the air hose and place the valve in between.
This would prevent once water runs backwards that the water runs out of the pool through the pump...
If the fan pump is installed outdoors, you should be covered and protected from moisture, as do other air pumps.
The pumps of the MK series are pure power packages that consume little energy
Even if we specify the processing time of 3 days here in ebay, the packages are packed daily and the packages are also collected here every day.
If everything goes well on the way, it's going very fast.
We only want to avoid a little bit so that no one is certain just because it once took a little longer.
It would be so, not everyone has understanding for all the employees who also work in the freight service...of course here doesn't stop a Corona.
Please don't evaluate the same bad, just because the delivery is delayed, this is exclusively due to the parcel services.
Of course, one likes to reproach about these services, even if we say at the moment that... they have it damn hard
This is also very different regionally.
Don't be angry, stay healthy and we all hope there's better times again.
how long does it take to order the yellow with and without armrest?
Can you order your legs in light?
Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and moderator to space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV moderator and four other passengers have made a short trip to space.
On Saturday they were transported by the rocket system "New Shepard" of Blue Origin by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
Launch and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the U.S. state of Texas.
Under radiant blue sky, Bezos most personally received the freshly cursed astronauts after their return.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue room suit when he opened the Luke to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members and Blue Origin's employees, the six passengers gradually climbed out and embraced the Amazon founders.
According to Blue Origin, they were on their way for ten minutes and 13 seconds, reaching a height of 107 kilometres.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the Nasa-Astronaut who flew into space in 1961, was named Blue Origin's rocket system (1923-1998), and the 50-year-old TV presenter Michael Strahan were honourary guests of the company who paid for their tickets to other four passengers: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
How much they paid for their ticket they didn't tell Blue Origin.
After the short flight, Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father's mission.
He had to work hard in his operations and do everything himself.
She just flew along, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan was also enthusiastic.
He would prefer to return to space again, said the moderator.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers
The "New Shepard" rocket system is largely automated.
The capsule separated from the rocket during the flight reached a height of about 100 kilometers above the earth, at times with weightlessness, before the reusable object was repressed from large parachutes.
The International Aviation Association and many other experts view 100 kilometres above the earth as a border to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third manned all-out of Blue Origin: at the first in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old US driver and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
On the second day of October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world-famous with his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", was also the former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries and the deputy boss of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of largely promoting business with space tourism without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard for the climate.

Someone who works in biochemistry or has studied biochemistry
I am currently studying biochemistry in the first semester and actually find the subject quite exciting and also in the laboratory are not bothering me (have already the inorganic chemistry internship behind me).
Of course, I have already been informed about career prospects before studying, but I also thought at the time I decided to study and become a doctoral student.
At the moment, however, I am in doubt, especially depressing me by the career prospects.
On the one hand (study check etc) one hears always super career opportunities and the profession is totally sought, on the other hand one hears again and again of unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid jobs.
That's why I'm really interested in:
1) What are you working for now?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/content?
3) What have you studied/What training have you done?
4) Would you all do this again?
Thank you for your answers!
I'm really unsure at the moment, and I'm thinking about canceling my studies in 2022 and making a training as a specialist in computer science.
If you have experiences, they also like to write :)
Extra stress before holidays & holiday weekends
This topic came up with me last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax.
That's why it's only now a post.
Not only before big holidays, such as the Christmas holidays, there is great stress in our company.
As it seems, there are those even before holidays plus bridging days.
It was like this: Last week Mary was Assumption, which is called "Ascent" by us in Switzerland.
On Friday, the majority of people and businesses make a bridge day, which is therefore semi-official.
So last week there was a long 4-day weekend in the house.
So what happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
Loud e-mails that had to get out before the way out, order here order, everything *unconditional* before the long weekend.
Because... yeah?
Because "next week then" sounds like so much time and that can't be?
Or because people want to afford all serious things in a shortened week as much as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but I was also very nervous.
What's this self-insulation about holidays?
What are the holidays for if we can't treat them properly?!
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all so self-employed.
My question is, are we just the Swiss?
Is that our reformed-evangelical kind?
Or do you know that in the north?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thüringian home - but has no gifts yet.
"The beautiful thing, even if there was no snow in Erfurt, then you just drive to Ilmenau in the Thüringer Wald," said actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will agree to the feast by bakeing and basking cookies with her son.
"I love that," said Catterfeld.
But until the contemplative days she has a lot to do: "For the first time I have no gifts yet, I have to start now".
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth flow of mice and plumbing.
NEKTON bio contains all vital vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 μg biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny plumage.
The majority of the plumage damage occurring in birds is exclusively due to nutritional defects.
Since the plumage is made of protein-containing substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein feeding of the bird is necessary for the formation of an impeccable feather dress.
For a functioning metabolism, daily food must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
Most of the animal losses that occur during the mouse are due to lack or imbalance of protein intake and/or inadequate supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavourable ratio of amino acids is explicitly taken into account and balanced in most plant feed.
No further vitamin preparation should be administered during the administration of NEKTON bio.
NEKTON bio is cold water soluble and can easily be administered via drinking water or soft food.
Thank you, I found it.
Unfortunately still not working
DDR-Handwerksmodel Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/DR, the locomotive was in use in Schleswig and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the conversion proposal of the model railwayr ME issue 11/1968, used with traces and faults see photos, function good, The E 95 series is a heavy freight train electric locomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), which has been designed for the traction of heavy coal-scale trains in the Siles network, possibly the kit also comes from the small-scale company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and we work well
The Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft had commissioned the AEG in 1924 to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that could transport on this route 2,200-tonne coal trains and 530-tonne passenger trains at 45 km/h.
The maximum speed was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926 the DRG determined the delivery as 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with Tetzlager drive AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, the Siemens-Schuckertwerke with the electric part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which received operating numbers E 95 01–06.
All survived the Second World War and subsequently found themselves in the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives arrived in the Soviet Union as a repair property.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
In the Reichbahn improvements plant Dessau, the efficiency of all six locomotives was established.
[4] As a result of the progressive re-electrification of the Central German network, there was an increasing need for locomotives for heavy freight trains, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were completed in 1959, with the other machines serving as spare parts donors.
First, the E 04, E 44 and E 94 existing in larger quantities were preferred.
It was not until the E 94 saw no further increase in the number of reprocessing operations, that the E 95 came into the focus of the processing process.
[4]The locomotives were first stationed at the Leipzig-Tahren railway plant.
They came to the railway works Halle P in 1960.
They were mostly used in their own orbital plan in front of coal trains from the Geiseltal valley towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
The complex control of the locomotives proved to be difficult with increasing age.
So it was common for shooters to stick to switching operations.
Then the beekeeper on this locomotive with hammer and wooden claw had to solve the shooter again during the ride.
Damages to the motors often occurred and resulted in months of downtime in the locomotive.
[5] Since there were enough new building locomotives at the end of the 1960s and a significant expansion of the electrical plant was not planned at the time, the Reichsbahn was able to abandon old locomotives and most of the split-traps, so that the E 95 were put out of service.
In addition, the Deutsche Reichsbahn wanted to occupy electric locomotives only once, which, because of the above-mentioned difficulties with the machines and the visibility of the driver's position, would have caused a problem in the train operation.
[5] After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were dropped in mid-69, the last was followed by the E 95 01, which quit the service on 5 October 1970.
The proposed new name 255 001 was therefore never used.
All locomotives were broken down except for the E 95 02.
The E 95 02 was set up as a replacement for the future E 77 10 museum locomotive as a soft heating system at the Halle Central Station.
It took some time for those responsible at the Reichsbahn to be convinced that the E 95 was a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the first external reprocessing of the locomotive began with the aim of presenting it to a vehicle show in the RAW Dessau.
[5] She has since been a member of the Dresden Transport Museum as an inoperable museum locomotive.
In 1986, the locomotive was completed internally.
In the DB Museum Halle (Saale) the locomotive museum is supervised.
Since 1995, employees of the traditional Bw Halle P have been working on the operational reprocessing of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time for an exhibition in Museums-Bw Arnstadt with new inner and external painting, with the transformers being checked and five motors being operational.
-The locomotives were in use on the Schlesisches Bergbahn and the branching side tracks until 1945, where they proved themselves due to their reliable drive and the low maintenance effort.
In February 1945 the machines were relocated to Leipzig to the Central German network.
The main area of use was first of all Silesia.
Handcrafted model H0 in OVP, function good, optical rework on the locomotive necessary in its own work, dusted, with traces of play, cellar smell !!!, very rare manual model, very small edition - possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging may show labels and traces of storage.
Yes, the F-parts are
I got a bed from you.
However, there were problems with a part.
The middle beam is held by two feet..leighers are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What are we doing now?
I can't build the bed.
The beam is held by two feet, which are unfortunately produced faultily.
The bar does not fit into the intended mounting.
So I get new ones sent.
When will they be sent off?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
These are, according to the assembly instructions the right ones from the shape, they were just too narrow
But that doesn't matter.
Principally they fulfill their purpose
With me they are not flat
Could I get these sent?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem to you again?
House fire with two light injuries and high damage
Two people have been slightly injured in a fire in a residential house in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage has occurred in the six-digit euro area, as reported by the police on Sunday.
The fire had spread from a carport to the adjacent residence in Kinsau (Landkreis Landsberg am Lech).
Two residents were reportedly hospitalized on Sunday with slight smoke poisoning.
The exact cause of the fire was not known at first, but the police did not assume a deliberate fire.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has carried out further investigations.
She'll be there a lot later.
And I have to pay for shipping again.
To disarm fake news - Biontech-CEO publishes vaccine photo
On the social network "LinkedIn" Uğur Ahin published a photo of his first vaccination at the beginning of 2021
Biontech-chief Uğur Aahin had not yet publicly expressed himself on his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur published a photo showing his corona vaccination.
The illness of a friend had moved him to do so, so he reported.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz company Biontech, Uğur ʼahin, has published a photo that shows how he receives a vaccination against the Coronavirus.
In the social media, there was misinformation that I was supposedly not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I have received 3 doses of the biontech Pfizer vaccine," wrote on Friday in a post on the "LinkedIn" network.
"For several months friends have urged me to post a photo of me on which I am vaccinated to counteract these false rumors."
So far, he had rejected this because communication should not revolve around himself.
But a call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened when I learned that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He fights a severe Covid-19 disease and has been hanging on a respirator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, continued to write.
He didn't ask for the reasons.
"The most common cause, however, seems to be fear, which is often aroused by misinformation and mistrust."
Fear is hard to fight with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
On the Internet, an interview with the Deutsche Welle, in which Uğur Aahin says he was not vaccinated, circulates.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as the Deutsche Welle himself explained.
"I'm not permitted to get the vaccine myself by law at the moment," said Iahin at the time.
There has been a prioritisation in Germany in the vaccination of the vaccine.
In the meantime, prioritisation has long been lifted - and the Biontech chief has been given three vaccinations according to suitable information.
Fire in substation: tens of thousands of people without electricity
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia the light went out on Friday evening: no more electricity and in many cases no heating.
A fire had paralysed a substation.
After a fire with severe damage in a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg-Kreis in North Rhine-Westphalia had to get out without electricity for about 24 hours.
On Friday evening, the fire left the lights on 41,000 affected residents in several municipalities.
The supplier Westnetz reported that on Saturday many emergency power units were in operation until the large-scale disturbance could finally be completely fixed in the late evening.
Firefighters and helpers of THW provided support in the municipalities.
The authorities volunteered in schools and called for neighborhood assistance.
The caregiver thanked the affected for their patience and help for their efforts.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought considerable restrictions.
We also thank the affected municipalities, the circle, fire brigades and THW for their tireless use," said Florian Witt, Head of Primary Technology, in a communication on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will take a few days to complete, since the Westnet assembly could initially only re-establish some lines provisionally, he said.
A technical defect led to the fire according to company information.
Flow back to current
According to Westnet, the fire that broke out on Friday around 7.15 p.m. has greatly damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear system in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation.
Extensive cleaning and repair work is necessary there.
In parallel, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level had been established.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply stands again.
Since Saturday 6 pm, over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth had electricity again.
Another 20,000 inhabitants of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid had been gradually contacted from 21.30 a.m.
Since 11:15 p.m., the last electricity affected by the failure had been electricity.
Over 80 technicians from Westnetz and partner companies had been in use.
After the establishment of an emergency electricity supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon, the authorities had also called for neighborhood assistance.
"It is important now that citizens take care of older or single people in their neighbourhood and report to the local fire brigade houses when help is needed," said Landrat Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
In the setting up and operation of emergency electricity units, the main focus was on the inhabitants of Altenheimen.
Furthermore, according to authorities, temporary care places in schools have been set up for those people who have not been able to care for themselves or who need the power-dependent medical equipment need medical care.
Good day!
Unfortunately, the ceiling is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy them from you and pay them in euros?
This is the day cover #PRS_ORG# in blue green.
I hope you will also have a nice day and please stay healthy
But I can't mount the lower frame on the table top.
This is Custom #NAME#.
There are 3 details of this.
We wanted those with table top diameter of #NUMBER#
we got 155cm diameter.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I can't push them together and therefore shorten them.
Can you help me out there?
Otherwise, I'd have to send her back because otherwise she's not suitable for the purpose.
I would like a feedback
Yes, that's really easier!
Let's do it like that!
Do you send me the return certificate by email?
The repair is now complete.
This was what I had tried before the chat.
Before the purchase, however, I did not restart the E-#PRS_ORG#.
You want me to do this now?
I find such a low credit almost insolent.
We do not agree with that.
Nordic combination: Combinier Ribber wins
The German Nordic combinationrs Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid are sprinted at the World Cup in Otepää in Estonia.

Return of order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes, we both made new s and use version 4.5...
It may be that they have heard of problems more often than not
Got straight with my #PRS_ORG#, a book bought it seems to be on it too.
As soon as I want to open it, the message comes ups!
This document could not be opened.
File may be in error they report to customer service.
As far as I can see it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can they help me?
Chat connection is gone and now?
I have to work in between!
To make the color application even and clean, you should clean the components with some soap water from dust, fat and fingerprints, rinse them with clear water and dry them.
Before bringing the brush to the model for the first time with a new color, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the later no longer visible inside of the components or on a yoghurt cup.
The first line on the component
Draw the brush evenly next to the line.
Light overlap of the color layers later ensures a uniform surface area.
Avoid fast back and forth wipe with the brush.
This creates unrealistic areas.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the bright colors.
The dark could otherwise shine through later.
Metal tones and metallic colours end up with a separate brush.
Otherwise, it may come to unsightly metal shears when they mix with normal colors.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before growing them.
True to the original appearance, the models reach through the decals or decals.
From high-level signs on airplanes to ship names to garnishes and car models: The decals give the model the last cut.
Apply the decals in the right order as long as the components can still be reached well.
A flight cockpit can be applied or made easier before it is installed in the hull.
Even more important than the right tool, such as scissors, tweezers and toothpicks, are in time, patience and a quiet hand.
Cut each decal individually and make it ready for you.
Decals are also called water slide images, because you moisten their back with water briefly until the carrier paper gets dark through the wet.
Then put the picture only a small piece of the paper and put the piece on the corresponding spot on the model (which you have moistened before).
While holding the Decal on the model with a tool, pull the carrier paper aside.
Warning: Always check whether the picture is right before you push it completely off the paper, so that it does not stick to the finger, kneel or even tear.
Soak surplus water with a household cloth.
Attention not suitable for children under 3 years
I can only open a book briefly as soon as I look at something else then I no longer read the book and have to unsubscribe and log in and reload the book and look for the place to where I have read it.
I've been communicating with you on Saturday.
Do I get this by email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp arrived at me in 3 single packages
All right, thank you so much!
Then I'll buy somewhere else as soon as the money is back.
But do I get this back without any problems?
Child request treatment at PKV / What is a "insurance case"?
Hello together,
we were in child care for some time now when it comes to accounting with the PKV, it suddenly comes across.
The series according to:
We had requested the children's desire in advance at the PKV and got the promise of 3 attempts.
The tests were not restricted in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to successful pregnancy and birth and was charged with the PKV.
Some time later we tried to have a second child, and carried out 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not yet calculate them with the PKV.
We again applied for the PKV to take over the costs and again received 3 further attempts.
After some further attempts (we have carried out more trials than promised, logically the most expensive with the PKV) we submitted the invoices to the PKV and got the bad surprise: instead of 5 trials (2+3) the PKV only wants to refund 3 experiments.
The reason: With the pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 attempts of the first promise expire.
The second child's wish is a new insurance case.
However, according to the Terms of Service, "the insurance case begins with the treatment of healing, it ends when the need for treatment no longer exists."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who is right to refund the PKV (only 3 attempts) or we (there are 5 attempts to refund)?
* Would the PKV have had to point out in the commitments that at birth the further trials are under way?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
The infertility (as a result of closed egg ladders) is not healed by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here would give their opinion.
Thank you for your help!
Can you please send me the three variants by email and tell me how I best reach them again
All right.
We won't order anything with them anymore.
If they add the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (equivalent address), they have obviously lost good customer.
They're welcome to pass that on to their manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday, the colleague told me that the repayment was made and now tell me that I have to send the thing back first.
I'm sure I can't do anything to make the dresser get completely upset
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague wrote
It is clear and clear that the repayment was made and I still haven't received any repayment by #PRS_ORG#
They can tell their manager that they have now lost two regular customers.
My friend has also ordered various furniture for our apartment via his account.
We're not going to do that anymore.
No, the defect didn't occur until after a few months.
An office chair shall be able to withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they're not allowed to sell him as an office chair.
Regardless, the guarantee of 24 months shall apply.
No, it is not possible for me to obtain another type of packaging.
I'm going to be able to remove the cabinet and make it available to the transport company.
Good day, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products are advertised with additional stools, but unfortunately we cannot find them with you.
Can they help?
Theme of the Week: The Best Low Budget Films
What a low-budget film is exactly, there is no general definition with exact budget limits.
The Wikipedia has the following to say:
>A **low-budget movie** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
On the web you can find plenty of lists of low-budget films, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What's the matter with you?
And what might you not like at all?
I am a very good customer of you, already have 2 apartments fully furnished with your furniture.
Wanted to ask for the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has been extended once again, is it now also reliable?
Thank you very much.
With friendly greetings
There's no phone number, there's a chat where you have to wait 30min, there's no chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes at the waiting position...I'll give up soon, because it just doesn't work here.
Hello.
Half victory against Belarus associated with high costs for the EU
According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can proclaim a "half victory" in conflict with the Belarusian regime.
However, the costs were very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees on Belarus' border with Poland and Lithuania, said Bossong to the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
In the long run, the EU had not solved the confrontation, said the researcher of the Berlin Science and Politics Foundation (SWP).
This floating state - Belarus is not very small, but the EU feels like a winner - is probably going on for a while.
Bossong ruled that dealing with people at the border was not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights.
Apparently there is a "increasing normalisation of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole is not decisively opposed, it is at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development at the same time weakens cohesion in the Union.
"It does not seem to be able to prevail if a Member State tries to do its thing", as is currently the case with Poland, which does not even allow the EU border protection agency Frontex access to the border.
In addition, the EU is paying a further price for its policy at the border with Belarus, says Bossong: A principle agreement on asylum policy will be difficult, as the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Re-try of border crossing
According to Poland's border guards have now tried again to get across Belarus to the Polish territory.
55 migrants had been arrested at night on Sunday and brought back to the border, said a spokesman of the authority on Sunday.
The Polish officials had been stoned by the migrants in the incident not far from the village of Czeremsza.
According to the information, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be medically cared for by a military doctor.
A total of 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
On Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had already overcome the borderblocks.
In recent months, thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed or tried to cross the border between Belarus and the EU.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko as a powerholder in Minsk to have attracted them with the prospect of entry into the EU.
Poland and Lithuania reportedly closed down border sections.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines bringing migrants and refugees into the country.
EU Commissioners also traveled to people's countries of origin to stop departures.
The most effective element of the EU response was the pressure on airlines, said Bossong.
"The EU has thrown its market power into the balance sheet and demonstrated its determination to operate with hard bandages and extraterritorial sanctions."
Minsk must also take into account domestic costs.
Belarusn society would probably not be prepared to keep the security device in the way of thousands of people throughout the country regularly.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 finals
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen has committed two breaking rules during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 final of Abu Dhabi, Mercedes objected.
The silver arrows assume two lines of breaking in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to a alleged violation of Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the last Safety Car phase when he is supposed to have overtaken him.
A second opposition was filed against the rating at the end of the race.
According to the Mercedes view, the protocol was not followed in accordance with the rules.
In the final round of Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes, he was relegated to the first Formula One title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase in which the Dutch had overtaken driving cars in front of him.
I'll check.
I'll talk to the bank and report back to you.
Thank you for your support

I'm sorry, but just because he says he's not an anti-Semit means nothing.
That's like when an afdler says he has nothing against foreigners.
They won't be able to give it to them.
But Colleagues constantly reproduce any anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself then you should just leave it complete.
Yeah, well, then, you're not as serious as my colleague.
Whoever seriously questions evolution in principle is simply completely loose.
Because of me, a God has set the whole thing in motion.
But as soon as you're a creationist, you have to believe that the earth is 10,000 years old and science is just squeezing nonsense.
And that makes you a science enemy and not to take seriously as a colleague
In order to get an optimal field of vision, the magnifying glass should be sewn as close to the eye as possible.
The specially planatically achromatically designed lens system allows you to use the magnifying and color error-free glass up to the edge zone.
Lupens are often marked with magnifications.
However, these information only applies to exactly defined conditions which rarely comply with the conditions of use.
In order to make optimal use of your magnifying glass, please refer to the instructions in the table "Technical data" (see instructions for use in the packaging).
Light reflexes arise on the lens surfaces of all optical devices - also in the case of impact loops.
An anti-reflex covering significantly reduces these reflections.
If the optimal conditions of use - glass close to the eye - are observed, reflections on the lens surfaces are less perceptible.
For further information, see the accompanying instructions for use (in German and English).

Tans for sale in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz women choose the Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced so many curious situations during the sale of the fir.
Once a man even went home without his partner, because both could not agree.
Every year, he plants a good 2,000 pieces.
The 56-year-old has already experienced so many curious situations.
That always makes the pre-Christmas fun, he says.
What about the voucher?
Otherwise I'm gone as a customer?!
After all, I received a defective delivery and now paid the full price for it.
Then I will evaluate it accordingly!
We do not need to discuss the better court, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating spear.
And so both have their name.
In German, an equivalent might be something like the "dreher", which by far doesn't sound so delicious.
Problems with fiberglass + Devolo DLan/Magic
We've had a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I now have problems building a stable Wi-Fi network.
Previously, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and sent 50 Mbit without error, except for a few failures.
The new fiber optic connector sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and to the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox, these also arrive.
However, at the other DLan module, which transmits the wifi, no longer arrive the full 500, but the further I move away in the house with the module, the less arrived (i.e. a socket that is located 1, 2, 3, etc. spaces from the other module).
This leads to the Internet with the new fiber optic connection being even slower on the first floor than before (\~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which seems to be using a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but there were similar great losses here.
Could anyone explain to me why with fiberglass so much internet speed is "lost" over the power line?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely difficult to move in the house LAN cable.
I'm really desperate why I created an account here.
That is why I would be all the more pleased with an answer.
When it is time to change the giro account
Who would have thought that the girokons would have been quiet for now, is deceived.
While many banks have used autumn to confirm the fees of the past with all kinds of tricks from their customers, the fees for negative interest rates continue to fall.
Deutsche Bank, for example, was considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she's just halved the allowance and even quartered it for the day's money.
In a first step, the border was reduced only for customers of the Group's Postbank division - to 50,000 euros for Giro and Investment accounts and to 25 .000 euros for daily cash accounts.
In the meantime, however, these lower allowances apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a speaker confirmed on request.
Not only for new contracts, but also for "individual agreements with existing customers".
Commerzbank had already gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which is still valid, as well as at ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, which is popular with cost-conscious customers in particular, has reduced the free amounts in two stages, initially to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
After all, more than 100 banks, according to figures from the Internet portal Verivox, now have a free amount of 25,000 euros or less.
The Sparda-Bank Berlin has also arrived at 25,000 euros: however, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centres, which have been given first place before the Landgericht Berlin against this regulation.
It is already under discussion in the banks whether the institutions should possibly make provisions - in the event that the upper institutions also declare the negative interest rates in principle inadmissible and many millions of bank customers have to be repaid.
It was delivered the table top for 8 people instead of those for 6 people.

Jennifer Aniston employs a whole beauty army
She's officially at the top of Hollywood.
But their lives are like a mountain and valley ride.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was elected the most influential woman of the year by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter".
For them, who made Furore with the "Friends" association in 2021 and the continuation of their series "The Morning Show", this success is primarily the result of much discipline and work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers cares for their appearance.
After all, according to Aniston, they treat themselves to a chip a day (yes, read correctly: a single chip from the bag).
The fact that the hearts of the female and male fans still fly to her equally is actually a miracle.
Maybe because she's just bad luck - and she's still looking for great love.
And deleted the baby wish from the list.
Before that, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
That hurt her.
The people who asked that have no idea what's going on with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
Stays hoping that success and fame will also make you happy.
Unworthy end of a career: Räikkönen must give up
Kimi Räikkönen's farewell to Formula One was even quieter than thought.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off the gloves and swept the sweat off the forehead.
That's it.
After a driving error and a slight band contact, Räikkönen had to stop his Alfa Romeo at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after not even half of the race distance.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" finished his career in the motorsports king class.
His wife Minttu and the two children were also on their way to the United Arab Emirates.
Räikkönen's greatest success was the 2007 World Championship in Ferrari.
He made 21 Grand Prix wins, started 18 times from the Pole and came on stage 103 times. dpa
Friedrich brings 60th World Cup victory - Nolte wins in the two-man bob - Sport
The brand of Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the Bobpilot.
"I've done this once, I'd have to enter nine and a half victories per season, then I could make it until Cortina 2026," said the double-Olympiager of the BSC Oberbärenburg, who recorded two successes in two days at the Winterberg race.
First, on Saturday he repudiated Johannes Lochner's attack by five hundredths, in which he drove from rank three to one.
Then he changed something to the material setting and drove out a bigger advantage on Sunday at 0.30 seconds.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he was in front of the British Brad Hall.
The Austrian Benjamin Maier became third.
"We've gone more risky today and have been rewarded," said Friedrich, who also introduced his 22nd victory in series.
The Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner, who was driving for Stuttgart, came to place two earlier this time in fifth place.
Christoph Hafer of the BC Bad Feilnbach finished fourth in the first race at 8th place.
"If I knew what he was doing differently, I would do it that way," said Lochner.
Nolte with home victory - Panel for Jamanka
==References====External links==* Official website
After only fourth place in the Monobob on the previous day, she finished on Sunday in the German triple-successor Deborah Levi for the World Cup victory.
Two-year-old Olympic winner Mariama Jamanka from the BRC Thuringia came second with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to her Olympic qualification, she booked the first pedestal place in this winter.
The Wiesbadener Kim Kaliki ended up in third place with Leonie Fiebig.
For me, it was super cool, first pedestal place in the world cup, I'm super happy to have Mariama take me.
I'm very happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt, stressing: "It's not only pushing, but there's also a lot to do about it."
Jamanka got a little angry about the not quite faultless rides, but said, "It's going in the right direction."
I already had the blanket in my shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What do you want me to do?
I just didn't get it and therefore I can't redeem why I finally asked for it.
I had very different problems last year and never had time for them.
And now it was said that he had passed away, which made me very angry.
Look in the chat it was about the Azare seat.
I would like to return it and then order it again, as it is just reduced :)
Why is shipping only started on March 16th?
There was nothing of such a long delivery time on your website
No, only when I type on it comes an extra field with the message
Was taken from your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today
I also sent you pictures of the wrong delivered would.
But we still want the shelf module, just a new undamaged
And don't cancel all the order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello love great girls and girls and women,
I have a lot of things I just want to write, and maybe the one or the other is...
I am 24, I have kPTBS, full-time student and dog mama - except that my dog doesn't scream or goes to kindergarten he's actually 1 to 1 my child.
My friend (since 6J together) is sick, has taken a 2nd degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I have emotional needs too and because I want to see and feel him, we have kissed a lot and it was nice.
I helped him to shower (because hand is in the association wg burning).
In addition, he is cooled and we see less (1-2x week) at the moment, which makes me very much to create with my needs for affection and love.
My dog child just got a stomachache, I cooked for him, and now he's in his cuddle and has relaxed a little after I was there with the heat lamp and caressing for him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she's just gone for a month.
Now there is also homework on us, which of course we divide.
But cooking itself is just a lot of work for me...
My PTBS disease is just very well tuned, I am well treated and I get it.
Not well, but I can make it and I'm almost symptomatic.
My university is demanding a lot (for me), tomorrow at 15h I have a written test for which I haven't done anything yet and tomorrow anatomy hour for which I should at least prepare a bit.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes next is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no room left.
So my week goes like this: only until the day after tomorrow, then is the weekend.
But after that the whole thing goes on?
Only until the birthday.
Only until the start of the holiday.
Just until the weekend.
Just until...
And so it continues forever.
I think I'm just so stressed that I need these mental clues because otherwise I'll pack that ned.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but otherwise I can't...
Are you all right?
Honestly, I'm infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
Really infinitely grateful, I can't put that into words.
Don't know if I would have survived my kptbs.
I think this also has a lot to do with the mental load of women, and that's why I thought I'd surely find a couple of sufferings here...
I certainly wish you another relaxing evening, the week is almost over!
I got my order today unfortunately the whole other color plus surface is scratched and table leg has imprint.
At the first delivery, the color was exactly as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we change the table now I get another color or how?
The email for cancellation was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
Besides, twice.
But she was not confirmed.
Sometimes something completely different: I found in school at that time that many religious teachers do not believe in God and for them it is just another subject like math or geography.
For me, this was always a bit strange, perhaps because I was raised Christian and I always believed in something like that.
How do you feel about that?
You may also be able to tell about work and or study colleagues with different attitudes.
In principle, I understand the difference between private and professional and it makes sense to separate.
There is also a curriculum, etc.
But just find it strange to have a physics teacher who does not believe in the theory of relativity.
What makes you want to teach religion if you don't believe it?
Keeping culture or something?
Hope you don't have a question too private.
Can't it be changed or not?Please write English I also understand well
It's been a long time, then I'd give up.
All right, thank you.
I'll expect a feedback at the latest at the beginning of next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Searching for a film Please help
Hello, dear people,
I'm looking for a film from my childhood (bin 24).
I think it's been a film for young people.
In the film there are two time axes (or parallel worlds).
For one thing, modernity (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the kingdom of the dead) (not quite sure).
Since I cannot describe it in any way in the real world there is a young woman.
And in the kingdom of the dead a young soldier (unification similar to that of the soldiers from the curse of the Caribbean).
For some reason the paths cross and an action arises.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this kingdom to live for himself I mean.
The transition is also the tomb of the soldier.
In the end, I believe that both soldiers are fighting each other.
If that tells you something, I'm grateful for every answer.
Our little one just slept on the belly from week 1.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
Such a child holds out much more than you think.
Make sure everything's right around it, not cuddled animals, going in and watching more often, but not a minute's surveillance.
That's what makes you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Ahso and ours didn't have a sleeping bag, but always had a blanket.
Watch your child when it sleeps.
Is it turning your head aside?
Can it rise from the belly?
Or is it with the face forward directly in the mattress?
You can figure out if everything's all right.
We all grew up, too, and when my husband came to the world, it was going to be time to put the kids on the belly to sleep.
In addition, we are already "trimming" with you and have already bought a lot of products
But then why do you offer me only 20EUR?
Hello, I wrote with a colleague of yours yesterday and no feedback so far.
It's about my wardrobe that arrived yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit into the cabinet.
I ask you to contact me as soon as possible.
The cabinet cannot be used at the moment.
To say it quite clearly.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I myself know, not everything can be kept.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV.
Just so it's just that the politics of this station is now under all the pressure.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then go on a big beggar tour at the same time.
It was said that you are an "independent" Internet channel.
Quotat Arno: You want to be "no running litfa column".
What are you now?
A 0815 advertising station trying to bring his BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we still have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
Of course they apply to everyone except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they can continue to insult the people.
A Krogmann who is completely lacking in empathy and at the expense of the action with the exploded rented rooms tries to make ashes.
How are you going to find all this good?
Great if you like it, I think it's awful.
I'm asking for a return call, as my delivered wooden table has been broken.
Body break through damaged delivery of the #PRS_ORG#.
Whether as a comforter in abdominal pain or simply for cuddling – My little friend of warmth is versatile.
Cherry core pillows are a traditional home agent for soothing heat applications, as cherry cores can absorb heat very well and dispensate again.
The removable inner cushion can easily be heated in the microwave or oven.
The soft cover makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe, even if they don't even get well.
The cherry core cushion with cover is suitable for the following applications only:
Before heating the pillow check for non-typical smell, stick or fire spots and immediately dispose of them if there is a problem.
Please remove the inner cushion from the cover before warming!
Heat in the microwave at a maximum of 300 watts for a maximum of 2 minutes (please note from the microwave manufacturer!)
Directly after heating, spread the heat evenly in the pillow by shaking!
Then place the inner cushion in the cover.
The first warmings may result in a slight moisture formation on the surface, but this disappears in repeated applications.
Be sure to follow the specified heating instructions, as longer times or higher energy performance can lead to damage (flammation and combustion risk!).
Before heating the pillow in the microwave, check that heating of grain products is allowed in the manufacturer's instructions for use.
After the heated inner cushion is put back in the cover, please check the temperature of the pillow for suitability for babies (max. 43 °C) at your armbow!
Do not use the pillow in acute and chronic, inflammatory or fever-like diseases, circulatory problems, fresh hematomas, hemorrhage and open wounds, as well as in people with reduced pain.
In the case of existing skin, heart, veins, diabetes or tumour diseases and pregnancy, please contact a doctor before use.
Should seams have been opened and loose cores emerge, dispose of the product and loose cores immediately and inaccessible to children.
If the product is used in babies under 1 year, the temperature of the child should be monitored regularly during the application to avoid overheating!
All serious incidents related to the product shall be reported to the manufacturer and the competent authority of the country in which the user is established.
The cover is removable and washable in the machine at 30 °C.
Please note the care symbols on the product!

Is the battery broken?
Yesterday evening my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer loaded by my power supply.
I bought this again about 5 months ago, so should still work.
I thought power supply alone was enough to operate.
Misdisplayed, the battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts despite the connected power supply.
Then I expanded the battery, but here too nothing works.
Do you have any ideas?
A new battery is ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in network operation?
Is there something else broken?
Thank you for your help!
I want the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book that?
I'm interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But don't know how high the seat is...
Often on tour and still a lot of equipment?
With the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design no problem!
20 litres of capacity also swallow larger photo equipment without problems, which can be safely stored with the upholstered FlexFold parts.
And whatever else you need on everyday items, thanks to practical access in the individually configurable interior, remains well organized and separate from the photo equipment.
With the "Update" of the Everyday Line on version 2 (V2), the series presents itself in a new look.
The chic, minimalist design has it literally in itself - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack and yet allow it to access photo equipment in seconds.
This works with two options: Once conventionally over the lid valve, which can be closed with the MagLatch locking system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection, which has already proven itself with the Messenger Bags.
Thereby there is a metal clasp hook in the clasp with matching anchor beams on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has designed different "fillers": there are 4 anchor bars, stable, in which the hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is fully loaded, you just take the top beam, it's rather empty, a deeper one.
Clamps and hooks are also magnetic.
Thus, the backpack can also be reliably closed without snapping the hook.
The second possibility also distinguishes the Everyday Backpack fundamentally from other photo backpacks: in addition to the lid cover, there is a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of traditional backpacks with access from above - you don't have to go through the content anymore!
At the same time, this clever detail increases the daily suitability of the backpack enormously: if you bring not only your photo equipment, but also everyday items or luggage.
In Everyday backpack, you can individually configure the interior (see below) and thus easily store both of them separately - and access them independently through the two side openings.
So you can also pull the backpack from the right side in front of the body, for example to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while the everyday things stay safe in the left backpack and do not get in between.
Comfortable, uncomplicated adjustable straps help.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is also made entirely of 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the content remains dry even if it should go to Scotland in autumn.
Unfortunately, I'm waiting for her support in vain.

Hello, my orderr is #NUMBER#. When will the item be delivered?
Order and payment was on 12.1.21.
A completely different lamp was delivered to me than I ordered
Please call me.
If you extend the voucher to me, I will give you a larger order, but after all, I kept the damaged piece of furniture and did not return it.
And that the last year was different than thought I could not imagine and just couldn't solve it in time and clarify it.
But I have the damage as a customer and I do not accept it.
Rotinger brake discs are designed for the requirements of the dynamic driver, who knows how to appreciate reliability and safety when braking even in difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are made of cast and then mechanically processed (drilled and cut).
All tinted discs are produced in short series according to individual technical characteristics, which are specific to certain discs and patterns.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special production program is created, which depends on the properties of the original assembly using the balance of the disc.
The tuned discs thus produced ensure high comfort and brake efficiency.
In addition, created openings increase the effectiveness of cooling the disc, while cutting improve cleaning of the brake discs and brake block.
Aesthetic properties of our tinted discs underline the character of each car by their attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city in which an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered shining chunks in the water at the southern fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news spread quickly and triggered the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the country's fastest and flourishing cities.
Areas were set up, tents were pitched, and Saloons and hotels were built almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many it was said: "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or Bankrupt)!
In this game, you're a pioneer looking for wealth in the West and trying to make a name for yourself.
You'll be looking for gold, recruiting workers, driving horses together, and building companies.
You will also be given the opportunity to explore the surrounding streams and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to beat up your pioneer colleagues so you don't have to go out with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many ways to win.
You choose your actions simultaneously, you have to budget with your resources and create a tableau that "works more and more for you" (so-called "Engine Building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, to receive additional actions or to apply rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge plates, you can develop your individual game style with the help of fine adjustments.
Coloma plays for a period of three years from 1848 (the year in which the gold was discovered in Coloma) over 1849 (the year of California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year in which California gained official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will secretly and at the same time select a location on the game plan where they can perform actions.
After that, their selection is exposed and they place their pioneers at the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it gets a lock!
This disables half of the location - which reduces the possible actions there.
Then players take alternate action, such as winning resources, moving cars, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening shops and positioning guns.
Once all actions have been completed, the pioneers return.
The prizer turns to a new location at the beginning of each round and thus changes the available actions.
This goes on until the prizer has moved five times, so every location has once hidden and the year ends.
There is a shooting in which the players have to defend Coloma from a robbery of angry bandits.
If the players have contributed enough guns and the bandits are numerically superior, they receive rewards.
But if they fail, they will receive lower rewards or end in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shooting, then the final score takes place.
The player with the most winning points wins!

The ARD documentation appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I looked at it right away.
>The child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is happy to attend Talkshows and gives lectures across Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008), he triggered a heated debate on education.
Former patient: now serious accusations are being made against him.
Please be careful, the film is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people think and act differently.
Our parents and other responsible people must never, never, ever, go over the child's power.
Our goal must always be to give the child free space for his development and to make the framework for the child as large as it is useful and possible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shaking.
Holechek: Countries advise on the elimination of the test obligation for triple vaccines
At its next meeting, the health ministers of the countries want to decide on a nationwide removal of the test obligation for triple vaccines.
"We countries need to be clear quickly whether and from when vaccinations can take place three times," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), Chairman of the Health Ministerial Conference, the "Photo on Sunday".
The removal of 2G plus for triple vaccinations is "not only medically meaningful, but also provides an additional impant incentive," said Holechek.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised "that he will make a proposal to the Health Minister conference on this as early as next Tuesday".
So I want to send the lamp back.
How do I best to do that?

What could this be about?
What you describe as *Awareness*, that is, sensory perceptions under general anesthesia.
These occur at a frequency of about 1 to 1000.
It is most common to hear noises/voices, to see images more rarely and most rarely to perceive pain.
Relevant to this topic: Kaiser cuts are operations associated with an increased rate of awareness, as one avoids a very deep anesthesia for the protection of the child until the aberration.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during anaesthesia.
Certain anaesthesia procedures such as total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Dear all, this comment by me describes trueness correctly, but had** u/Nitemarex **by definition none.
I misread her comment.
But the chair is broken.
Unfortunately, the 20€ don't help us either.
These are legal warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be to take back the defective chair.
This is in addition to the legal obligation also standard in the field of eCommerce.
Please check whether they at least take back the defective chair.
Then we sell the second chair privately.
We're losing a lot of money.
I already sent you an e-mail that you didn't answer.
Again the question.
The order and invoice state that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The freight forwarder is company #NAME#.
I just called there.
They told me that they only deliver on the doorstep - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I have to cancel the order because I don't know any person who can carry the heavy furniture on the first floor.
I'm not being called?
I had formulated a question
Theatre historian Günther Rühle 97-year-old died
He has profiled himself as a theatre critic and as an intenter.
Later he wrote a monumental theatre story.
On Friday, Günther Rühle died at the age of 97.
There is the new book on the table, freshly printed: "An old man is getting older".
The shocking diarium of a slow farewell to the world led by the theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle until April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading comes the message that the author died.
The last sentence in the book is: "I've already witnessed my thank-you here."
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common are European pallets, standardized wood pallets, which are used mainly in the European area as cargo carriers.
You will be certified by the European Palettes Association EPOL
According to statistics from Austria, more than ten million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was about 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported to Austria each year is not collected
New York First Brings MLS Championship
New York City FC won the title in the Major League Soccer for the first time.
After 1:1 in the regular season against host Portland Timbers, the team from the Eastern Conference decided to shoot the final with 4:2.
In the final of the Eastern Conference, New York had won against Philadelphia Union, the team of the German Kai Wagner.
Rouding Tips & Tricks
I had gotten a lot of great tips for the perfect gulasch here a week ago.
That was Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery!
So thank you again :)
Now I have come to taste and want to cook roude for the first time at New Year's Eve.
I'll set up a beef fund tomorrow.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I do not have a oven, but only a large pot.
How's it going now?
What about the books or how do I get them back to my #PRS_ORG#?
My English isn't so good anymore, but I get it
IES is about to refund €#NUMBER#
I was already informed by email on 18.01. that the refund was made.
But to this day, the money has not been received from me.
Would you please check it out?
Where there are still Christmas breads in the room Lübeck
For many people, goose or duck is one of the Christmas days like the fir tree and the gifts.
You haven't gotten a poultry yet?
Now time is running out.
We'll tell you where you'll get another Christmas bread in the Lübeck room.
The "Drive" of a tube end stage contributes significantly to the heat and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controller, you can set the desired level and, on the other hand, the amount of your sounds.
In addition, the amplifiers of the VT+ series offer a unique POWER LEVEL controller that allows you to reduce the sound level without changing anything on the "gain" and the distortion.
Further above, it was already suggested that with the POWER LEVEL controller you can even make a power reserve when it goes unscathed.
POWER LEVEL controllers make use of the full potential of the VT+ series in every situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal that is attached here is processed with a box simulation, so that even when you use a headphone or direct recording, you get an outstanding "acoustic" sound impression.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX socket so you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuner.
If you also donate a VFS5 walker, you can also easily access the sounds by foot, turn on/off the effect blocks and "step" the pace of the compatible effects.
This is essential for live use.
With its new power packs, VOX will take a further step into the future!
But had it seen with others like this.
Is there any way you could send the lamp back?
Because she hangs too low for over a dining table?
So I'd like to send her back.
Can you help me with that?
What about the dresser?
Do we receive an update to the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, have they ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs
If I can't, I'd be satisfied with a discount or voucher.
I may find a customer for the furniture.
Only over 1,000 euros for goods I don't need are then a little bit.
I have just received my delivery and would have liked to know if screws were planned as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) to the intended hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time has not paid off.
Is there a premium customer status with you?
Iran sees progress in negotiations on nuclear agreements
Progress has been made in the negotiations on revitalising the international nuclear agreement, according to Iranian information.
"Both sides are about to agree on the topics to be on the agenda," said Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri on Sunday of the news agency Irna.
This is a "positive and important development", because at first there was no agreement on the topics to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks on revitalising the agreement were continued after almost one week's interruption.
Negotiators from Iran, Germany, Great Britain, China, France and Russia participate in the negotiations.
A US delegation is also on site in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia is now overtaken by the Free State of Saxony with the highest corona incidence
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence in Germany.
As the only federal state, the value is above the 1000 mark.
The only federal state in Thuringia was near the Corona incidence on Sunday above the 1000 mark.
The Robert Koch Institute reported the seven-day value with 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had always had the highest incidence throughout Germany, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had fallen slightly, but had also been above the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections were reported with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 other deaths related to infection within one day.
200 patients with Covid-19 were treated intensively on Sunday in hospitals.
There may be delays in reporting on weekends.
Furthermore, the health offices have been overloaded for weeks and hardly come after the recording of new cases.
I understand.
Since delivery only takes place in early March, it may be possible until then.
I have to print it out and stick to the package and hand it over at the mail, that was, right?
here I don't have to click/sign/fill anything more?
That's exactly what I want to avoid. That's why I'm writing to you.
I would like to take over the return at my own expense.
8 euro return fee is a frenzy in my opinion.
It is time for changes
###MBundestag are welcome to me, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary room in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
- Where's the mail here?
If you look at the activity in the past months of the MBundestag you can see one thing: it is not extant.
We came into a winter star and extended the summer hole to a few months.
#Where's the problem?
Yeah, what was it about?
For the most part, this should simply be related to dissatisfaction, how some things have happened here and how we are generally presented.
In the last few days, the impression has increased that many here really still have Bock on the MBundestag.
#What we need to change
At this point the community around the MBundestag is asked which wants to keep it alive.
The start came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in the last few days and found one, simply said, sharding piles.
After writing back and forth, several people from the community have found themselves who want to rebuild the project.
However, I would also like to expressly call on everyone to participate, only in this way can this project continue to exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a discord server in which we can exchange and work out concrete things.
You can join the server via this link.
Objectives:
* How will the MBundestag work in the future?
* Which existing orders must be changed / modified / removed?
* How should we appear outside in the future?
* How should new members be recruited?
* How do we create a fair electoral system?
I'm pretty sure I've forgotten a lot, but that's not bad, and we've got the discord in the end.
If you have pleasure and time, come to the discord, work with us and let us democratically decide on the future.
I ordered a lampscreen with you to be delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/klobig for it and is not suitable for my taste.
I've already ordered another suspension with you.
I put it together and then noticed it when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope this will be returned and I have a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have one more question: the day cover #PRS_ORG#, are there those also in oversize, so in 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee that the faulty cabinet will be picked up in time.
And I'm asking you to let that happen now.
I do not have a suitable packaging, but I will remove the cabinet as far as possible for the collection - they must clarify with #PRS_ORG# how this can work then.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me at any time to arrange a pick-up date.
Is there an instruction for mounting?
How long would I have time to get these or decide to return them?
How do you answer the question why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I like.
She herself used to live vegetarian for a while, but at the moment she probably eats meat very rarely.
I myself was a vegetarian a few years ago.
On the question of whether I have always wanted to be vegan, and vegetarianism has been a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought.
And that I thought for a long time that as a vegetarian I would support the animal welfare, but at some point I reflected and understood that I finally supported animal torment.
That's why I decided to become vegan.
At that moment, I had the impression that there was displeasure on her side, and then she defended vegetarianism and told her where her flesh came from and how to reduce animal suffering as a vegetarian.
Now I wonder if my answer to "plump" was?
How do you answer the question?
Have the feeling that one is quickly put into a corner as a vegan and conflicts arise without putting it on it.
It greets a harmony-loving vegan (;
This is clearly not an exception according to § 312d BGB.
Do not release your #PRS_ORG# from the legal requirements for a distance.
I am on the assigned date on which #PRS_ORG# picks up my return not on site.
Since I can't be on site because of a funeral, unfortunately this can't be changed either.
Can I be assigned an alternative pick-up date?
From 01.02.#NUMBER# I can always be found again.
Lahnsteiner Wehr equipped for water rescue: 45.000 Euro grant from the country
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Interior Minister Roger Lebentz in the Lahnstein City Hall presented a grant notice of 45,000 euros for the new warehousing vehicle water rescue of the volunteer fire brigade Lahnstein to Mayor Peter Labonte.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, amounted to 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in safety.
I am pleased that the Land Rheinland-Pfalz supports us in this," says Lahnstein's mayor Peter Labonte.
The vehicle is used by the diver season Lahnstein, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Over and under water, they perform tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, increasing operations are expected permanently: the boom of the hotel shipping on Rhine and Mosel and the further increasing use of the lahn as a leisure flow contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% and then started the problems.
I can't open the book.
However, following their recommendations, they synchronized, removed, and the app didn't work.
I'm a little frustrated because the whole action has taken me a lot of time and I'm hoping for help now.
Okay, that's it.
I would like to order 3 items from the #PRS_ORG# collection for June.
Can I enter an appointment in the order process?

For the first time for you to stand up here for the whole thing, I have also spent almost a decade in public service in a similar activity, we were also armed bearers in the executive, I don't want to go further!
I always find the question of right and left very simplified.
In principle, however, it should be said that, of course, the government servant comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum rather than from the revolutionary left, that should actually be clear to everyone.
Of course, even in a special uniform and arms bearer, people should also be magically attracted to the right of conservative people, that of course, these people can hardly deal with the living reality, because, of course, you have, besides the average white, now many Germans with migration background, women and homosexuals (and with that I do not mean the excessive feminine clichés, because these are in the executive rather less to nothing but quite normal men and women to whom you do not notice) and also to these people can and must rely on me, because in doubt they will protect your life or use it for you.
But even if it sounds strange for the first time in my experience, these marginal groups also represent a conservative attitude, they are proud of Germany and feel more less caught up by excessive left-wing politics, even if this policy is supposed to work for them or have to make it right for them, they simply want to be treated quite normally.
Back to the right, because of course police and armed forces are also a cross-section of society one will also find extreme rights there, but they may openly express their opinion there or even openly forge any state-hazarding plans is completely exaggerated and also annoys me.
Of course, police and soldiers who were often employed abroad often start to standardize because of negative experiences and even say things that are controversial to politically incorrect.
It also happens that right-wing fellows will surely meet and have a lively exchange of views.
Nevertheless, this is well-fought in my opinion and is also countered by political education and education.
Germany is so interconnected internationally and I think that it is also good that we cannot afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks at all!
Yeah, what I don't understand, I also ordered the other basket on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, it wasn't sold out.
I ordered already in November.
it was confirmed to me so in your confirmation of the order
It's still about my order, which is no longer available.
I chatted with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, you could still deliver the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# Euro in Black to Germany or this basket is also available somewhere in Germany.
I always find you as a partner company.
But at the top of the edge of the wood there are two deep pieces filled with some yellow pieces.
and on the mirror itself is a small scratch
Kinder by child?
Hello, me (w32) has been busy for a long time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work, (I am independent, very little free time), but for my life I have been getting it more bad than right to keep my household clean and clean.
There are always phases in which everything remains, and then and then it takes me and I clean up and clean up.
But it's never really like 'that anyone could come to visit spontaneously'.
My husband isn't (unfortunately) better either, it bothers me somewhere but most of the time, household just loses against work and unrest.
The kitchen is cleaned most regularly as we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you managed to get any better with child?
We don't have anything to do with it, and I've been working on this question for a long time.
Because for me I have no incentive, it just doesn't bother me as long as no visit comes and for example always fresh clothes are there and the kitchen is usable.
Do you have a bigger incentive with a child or do you remain sloppy?
Look forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, and high-quality, and anatomically preformed cut, offers maximum comfort, a perfect fit and thus enables almost unlimited freedom of movement.

Career in social work - as someone with a self-insecure personality disorder?
I have been training in the field of software development and have been learning for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I realize more and more that this profession is not the right one for me, which is why I have been thinking for a long time about starting again and studying social work.
The problem: I have a self-insecure (or fearfully avoided) personality disorder (EPPPS).
That means roughly that I have no self-esteem and therefore I'm shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a subject level, but it is very difficult for me to have easy conversations and I have been told more often that I am having an immeasurable effect (which I believe has already got better).
Can I be such a social worker?
I do not want to work as a street worker or in the open youth meeting, but rather in, for example, the addiction counseling or family assistance.
I do not know, however, whether the concrete workday is really the way I imagine it, and it is difficult to find something on the Internet.
The EPPS already leads to problems in my job (for me, emotionally) because it pulls me down every time there is something to object to my code ("even more simple things are being chewed up again") and it is hard for me to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know for myself how this is going"/"I think it's my stupid questions from work"/"he really has to think me is less mediated" etc.).
I'm probably going to have the problems in every profession, but I wanted to mention it on the spot.
But did you get the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation either.
I'm waiting for an appointment for collection
What do you mean, give it back, please?
If I have downloaded a book to the #PRS_ORG#, the message will not authorise your #PRS_ORG#
Are there any problems?
I was in the chat with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I got a delivery confirmation for my closet.
The protein (protein) absorbed with the feed divides the bird into the individual protein building materials (amino acids) in its stomach-intestinal tract and builds from these in turn its own proteins, which it also needs for plumbing.
The plumage formation in the nestling and the plumage formation in the mushering bird are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high strain for the animal's overall organism.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio should not be administered during breeding, as it may otherwise cause disturbances in the hatching process.
Following this curative administration of NEKTON-Bio, the daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral preparation) should be resumed.

1 g NEKTON bio on 250 ml water or 100 g soft feed.
It is only recommended to prepare as much drinking water/weapons as the bird consumes every day and to change water/feed daily.
An erased spoon (contained) corresponds to 1 g NEKTON bio.
In case of severe plumage damage, the double or triple dose of NEKTON-bio can be given at the beginning until the approach of plumage reformation is visible.
Thereafter, the normal dose is reached until the plumage reform is fully completed.
Storage: NEKTON bio should be stored dry without sun exposure, between 15° and 25°C.
Please apologize, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair be broken after 9 months ?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
This is really very bad service.
Hello, I sent an e-mail on Monday to tell you that my order has arrived damaged and that pictures have been attached.
Did you receive this e-mail?
Statement by a municipal employee in contradiction to the statutes
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree is to be fallen on our property.
So filed a case request to the community.
An employee writes to me that the fall of fruit trees and thus also of walnut is not part of the statutes.
In the statutes, however, the walnut is explicitly indicated as a tree to be protected.
Can I now rely on the employee's statement or not?
On the one hand, I have to be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statutes are clear.
Thank you for your answers.
We understand that.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I did not receive a message
Well, then I still have a sofo without use.
Could you offer me a discount or a voucher?
What was more expensive?
Yes, I think so, only the question is whether I can pay in euros and have the ceiling delivered to Germany
Can you check that?
Report: Major traffic accident in self-employed persons
Recently, a major traffic accident occurred at St 2179 between Selb-Nord and Plößberg.
As the press alarm of the police reports at the moment (14:03 a.m.), a car has come into the counter-trafficking traffic when overtaking.
There's been an injury.
I understand.
All right, then thank you so much again that it was so easy!
Council and ideas on further professional life
Happy Christmas to you for the first time!
Unfortunately, my Christmas is moderately good, because my dear head is just shattering everything you can think of.
Before I get here now .. in short: I need advice and best of people who somehow know my situation - so of you.
I'm just doing the Ref as a cross-starter.
Originally I studied something else and worked there in an area (to stay at least a little anonymous, I call here nothing more accurate).
But the whole thing was too boring for me, and I looked at alternatives that could make me more fun.
At some point, I landed at the Magisterium and was sure that it was - even though the conditions are much more inflexible than in my previous profession, but I didn't care.
I have now arrived at the third "I google other job offers".
And it's only half a year around.
At the times before that, I have always decided to continue and at least finish the Ref, after which I can still turn.
But just now I'm absolutely done.
I had so little free time the last month that I was completely lulled out.
Now are vacations, but there's still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the Ref I always thought I was stress resistant, but there was also my weekend and my party evening.
That's where I was free.
And the stress at work didn't matter in the moments.
Now the family party is too much stress to me.
And then there are these rigid structures that also bother me.
Basically, it is fun and from the outside, the Ref also works well with regard to feedback and so on.
But I'm completely sluggish and I wonder how much stress my body endures before it completely closes - if it doesn't just do that.
I wonder if I would like to have this for the rest of my working life - especially if I read some of your contributions here - or if I should not go back to the old area, since where I was valued I could take my free time when I needed it, and the work was kind of boring, but was paid for it appropriately and worked out together in a team what worked out and not as an individual fighter like this is the case for most of the time.
But then I wonder if in a year I did not get back to the same place as now and was dissatisfied.
You know, it's all kind of weird, but maybe you have out-of-office advice or ideas, how I get out of this situation, which I'm completely finished and start crying at the smallest thought of it.
I'm not going to make decisions so emotionally right now, which probably doesn't lead to anything good.
But maybe your views will help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for me for the first time.
Thank you for reading and apologise for the whining undertone of me.
I hope my situation has become at least a little clear.
Since its introduction in 2001, VOX's Valvetronix series has been constantly developing, leading, among other things, to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly imitates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps, we introduce a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely up-to-date on sound.
Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of the components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers await with an authenticity, which is absolutely impressive.
These amps also naturally contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because they simply get the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuit, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system from which the natural resonances only burst.
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and the effects sound as you have always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology presented in 2001.
Of course, she has been refined several times since then in order to satisfy also newly added sound requirements, which once again led to a performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series in 2010 - with more dynamics as well as numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed in such a way that all guitarists will find a maximum sound variety here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a bold sound, a nuanced playback of game dynamics and stringing as well as a prompt speech.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that the end stage in particular determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The Valve Reactor circuit, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, of any VT+ amplifier perfectly reflects the behavior, subtle nuances and sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic loses at Clippers
The Orlando Magic defeat series in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it is not enough to win the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points by Franz Wagner and seven counters of his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104:106 at the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually flattering and foldable velcro parts, it is entirely aligned to the needs of your photo equipment and is therefore suitable for any kind of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-format mirror reflex cameras.
What ultimately fits into the backpack depends of course on the size of the camera and the lenses.
A possible assembly would be a DSLR camera with a lens mounted, two to three alternating lenses and a flash on it.
Larger DSL cameras such as the various models of the Sony-a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 leave room for further lenses.
In addition, you can store a lot of accessories.
And anyone who has a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-Series) can use the backpack for their equipment and for photo-native things.
Drone pilots also make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, because the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcano eruption in La Palma: probably the longest of history
In the nearly three months since the outbreak, the lava flows on the Canary Islands have caused great damage.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the known history of the Canary Islands since Sunday.
So far, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585 was considered the longest on the Atlantic Island off the west coast of Africa with 84 days.
There are no reliable data on earlier outbreaks.
The activity of the still nameless volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in recent days, but volcanoologists have not dared to predict when it could end.
Indicators indicate a slowing down.
The best news is that they are stable," said Mariano Hernández Zapata, President of the Island Council, the state TV station RTVE.
Mio-height damage
In the nearly three months since the outbreak, the more than 1000 degrees hot lava has destroyed nearly 2,900 residential houses and other buildings, as RTVE reported.
Nearly 1200 hectares were covered by a meter thick lava layer.
This corresponds to almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7000 residents had to be evacuated, the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Before the coast, there were two new land soles with a size of about 50 hectares.
In particular, the most important banana cultivation for the island, of which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly, was affected and which was in the crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, further areas were severely damaged, wrote the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the gifts
Christmas is on the doorstep, and especially the children will hardly be able to expect the heavenly feast.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have been connected with the spiritual atmosphere and the humiliating tension something seductive in themselves.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still hold our increasingly divided society together.
It is therefore all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of gift, which, according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss, was a peaceful "social contract of natural peoples", can escape the rigid routine and be filled with life again in the context of this tradition.
How Nikolaus became the Christchild
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants through whom the Christmas days were closely linked to the gift.
Prior to that, gifts were presented in one way or another on the day of Nicholas.
The background of this still popular practice is that as bishop of Myra, Saint Nicholas secretly threw three women into her window in one night to save them another life in sin.
From this unconventional kind of gift, the custom of filling the boots with gifts, especially for the children, has emerged.
Protestants found themselves in this practice because they reject mediators between God and men as "adoration of holiness".
For these reasons, they hold back against the institution.
Martin Luther made the Christian child out of Nikolaus and thus founded a new line of tradition.
The focus of the gift shifted to the Christmas Eve.
However, since most Protestants no longer see such detailed questions as these as these, it is only minor that the custom of St. Nicholas is still an integral part of the pre-Christmas period, similar to the use of Martinssingen and Martin's moving.
Today you will find in boots in front of the door and under the Christmas tree from socks to coveted luxury watches everything the heart desires.
Variety of Traditions in Christian Countries
Sources show a tradition of gift since the 13th century on the day of St. Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of gift shifted to Christmas Eve.
However, in all Christian - shaped countries, the question of who now brings the gifts to the children is dominated by a cheerful mascot.
In Germany it depends on the region, whether the Christkind appears on the Holy Evening or the Santa Claus, who is in principle a kind of Nikolaus, to whom some peculiarities have been assigned over time.
This includes, for example, his white beard, which has little in common with the rather strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh, which is pulled by reindeers and the preference of the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, St. Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain, the Saints Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana, who is supposed to have directed them to the child Jesus.
In Scandinavia, fabled beings sometimes bring gifts, while in Russia, fathers of Frost brought some fame.
Here it is not reindeer, but three horses that pull their sled as Troika.
In the Czech Republic, the mother country of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, the Christian child is responsible for handing over the gifts.

Police shoot alleged bank robbers near the Royal Palace
Near the Kensington Palace in London, an armed man was shot by the police on Saturday.
The police told us that callers had reported a man who was supposed to have gone to a bank with a gun and a bookmaker's business.
The man fled, according to the authorities, in a vehicle that could be stopped a little later by officials.
Shots had fallen and the man had been hit.
He was declared dead at the crime scene.
The police didn't start from a terrorist background.
Several embassies are located in the Kensington Palace area.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and the three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.

Pill problem
Hello, dear women's people,
I hope I do everything right here, after a year of reddit is actually my first post.
To my problem: I was forced to take the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had such incredibly bad pain during the period and fucked PMS before the period.
Now I would like to leave that again, because I have to take enough drugs due to chronic illness that I can't choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
At my last about two years break I had got from 0 to 100 explosive pimples and these everywhere.
So much superficial, but I'm pretty much burdened and I didn't feel well.
In the two years break, the whole thing has never really normalized.
Maybe anyone has any tips to avoid this time.
Perfume-free and without gedons my cosmetics are already, but maybe there's something that someone can recommend to me.
Unfortunately, women's doctor didn't take me so seriously and skin doctor's appointment is still coming.
Thank you to everyone who has read the novel!
Yes, the sweet skin is such a thing.
Had pre-bupertary bad neurodermitis, then a time rest, then large-scale garlic braids and the acne theme.
I have also tried anything possible in the course of chr. disease and have remained dependent on sugar, milk and meat-poors, because otherwise nothing has worked so well.
It can also be good that hormoneell is simply the worm in it, but if you like me everywhere construction site you don't want to go looking for something else that's going wrong.
I already had everything of her colleague semina o. a.

In the name of the people: lay people take judgments
In the courtroom, they sit in everyday clothing on the judge's bench.
But much depends on their judgment, even if they don't wear robes: Schöfen with professional judges determine whether and how long someone goes behind bars.
Two of them report in conversation with the "public" from their time at the Bad Kreuznacher Landgericht: Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two out of a total of 125 lay judges at the Landgericht on John F. Kennedy Street.

110 kV earth cable is being newly built in 2022
The permit for the installation of the new high voltage cable at Tann is legally valid.
The planning decision of the government of Lower Bavaria opens the way for the construction to begin in 2022.
This was announced by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven-kilometre-long earth cable will connect the Tann substation in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable is connected near the village of Edermanning near Reut to a mast of the transmission line.

No, it's all the books, so the question at #PRS_ORG#, since it's probably a general problem.
Ref: Planning lessons (EC)
Hello, ladies and gentlemen,
I've been in Ref since summer, teaching is fun, but I still have big problems time-efficiently planning my teaching in geography.
Unfortunately, my school is not well equipped at all, so in principle I can only use the board, the schoolbook and an OHP as a medium.
In addition, I can only copy b/w free of charge (which is annoying for Erdkunde).
I just need a very long time at the moment to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently making the subject of geofactors, and I am actually standing by every hour.
In principle, the methods always repeat themselves, but on the other hand, I don't want to invest too much time for simple lessons (I also need them for UBs, etc.).
When planning, I always go from the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then consider how I can build it (mostly I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school does not have).
We have the book Terra and with most of the tasks in the book I am rather dissatisfied.
Therefore also the worksheets.
Maybe a geography teacher can tell me how to work time-efficiently with the book.
I'd be really happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
I've actually decided to take a new one at #PRS_ORG#, but I'd like to take the return as soon as possible.
Trade is afraid because of the 2G scheme for Christmas business.
In most stores, only those who have been vaccinated or cured can remain.
Trade considers this unnecessary and complains of sales losses.
He also has a possible solution.
The 2G regulations spoil the important Christmas business from the point of view of the German Trade Association (HDE).
Businesses with items of non-dayly need have to complain of sales losses, criticized HDE’s chief executive Stefan Genth.
According to a recent HDE survey of 1100 dealers, more than 70 percent of companies looked negatively at the rest of the year.
Many would have already written off the Christmas business.
"What should actually be the positive highlight of the year is now often a hole without soil," said Genth.
Therefore, dealers with 2G access restrictions lost almost a third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week.
It works well only in food retail and online.
The association demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
Purchasing with mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the chief executive.
"2G while shopping does not bring us any further in the fight against the pandemic," he stressed.
The current regulations deterred customers and required high human resources.
The volume regime had to be admitted throughout the country, he demanded.
After that, each customer only had to be checked once for 2G (vaccinated or healed) and would have access to all transactions with the received volume on that day.
In addition, sampling controls should be sufficient in the retail sector - as in public transport in the case of the 3G rule (vaccinated, healed or tested).
The real estate company Deutsche Euroshop, specializing in shopping centers, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were last without 2G at just over 75 percent of the pre-Corona level, the turnover at about 90 percent.
These figures will certainly fall in the middle of the so important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner of the "Economic Week".
Due to the high personnel and administrative effort, the Centres are being tried to find and obtain solutions.
This includes the so-called volume solution, in which "for example, visitors can provide at a central location in the center once their 2G proof and then - equipped with a bracelet similar to a club hotel - enter all shops undisturbed". dpa
I recently ordered and delivered the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and on the frame is also an error that has been tried with a yellow filler to be screened.
That looks ugly.
I would like to give the mirror back and I have already packed it back into the package and glued it up.
How do I have to proceed for the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high color reproduction.
A modern microprocessor with exceptional possibilities ensures that the color temperature and brightness of the lamp are adjusted.
In addition to the adjustment of brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually adjust and store the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller, it is simple and intuitive to use.
The lamp produces a very luminous flux with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The beam angle of 120 degrees, with which you can illuminate large areas at relatively small distance is excellent.
By the way, also in reporter situations in small spaces or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work on both the film set and the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller enables remote control of the lamp in TV studios or when the lamp is mounted at difficult-to-access locations.
On the back of the lamp is the control panel, it consists of buttons and a luminous display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore, there is the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included)
User memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To perform the settings of the individual settings on the storage spaces, simply press one of the memory keys and complete.
The memory controller saves the current state of the lamp when turned off, so that when new switch on, the familiar situation will stand again - Very practical in studio work when, for example, the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Working with battery one of the greatest strengths of DL3120 functionality results from the possibility of operating with cheap NP-F batteries.
These are often already owned by photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can rely on already existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set whether the batteries have enough power - it is a battery tester with built-in - for each of the two battery compartments a value in the two display displays (the left battery top display, the right on the bottom display).
In addition, it is of course possible to supply the headlamp continuously with electricity via the supplied power supply.
The structure of the headlamp is very simple.
You have a 16mm sleeve for fastening as a connection, so you can connect directly to your phototative.
The inclination must be reliably adjusted by means of fasteners on both sides.
It has been observed that the mechanical components are also extremely high quality and are therefore also designed for durability and tough use.
In addition, a joint is included.
Great is this included in the delivery also a bag.
This allows you to safely transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you might want to buy without any problems.
Too bad I got these and she's too small :(
"Party we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after torturous comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last two series of winless Hessen were apparently on the way to the next Bundesliga plea.
But then the SGE turned on and within a good hour shot the frustration over a full season start from the soul and beat furios with 5:2. "It's crazy what the boys have done today," said Trainer Oliver Glasner at DAZN and said a "pauschal lob, to everyone who was with him."
At the beginning, it looked like a new damper for the now 9th place still behind their expectations.
Patrik Schick had led the Leverkuseners with 2:0.
What happened then impressed also the SGE trainer.
"How the players came back and showed a fantastic performance," Glasner continued.
I'm crazyly happy with the performance we've shown and, of course, with the result.
The morale of his teammates was also emphasized by the defender Christopher Lenz, who for the first time had been able to stand on the square since the fourth day of the game and his overcome muscle injury.
"I think our mentality is incredibly great," said the 27-year-old, looking forward to the result, especially for the spectators.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
However, Glasner wants to keep the focus on the future tasks, but also sees itself well positioned in terms of the human situation.
It is exceptional that we all have players fit in December that all players are physically in a top constitution.
It is top work in our medical department, but also the players live highly professionally.
Now we want to "go on step by step and remain modest" and "go through the tasks at this level" until the turn of the year.
The next one is already on Wednesday in the course of the English week an out-of-game with Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30 hrs, Sky) is on the program.
I get the mail that my package comes back to you due to a mistake on my part.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and let it redirect, no chance.
Can it be sent to me again or do I have to wait until the money is returned and give up the order again?
Unfortunately, I would say that I will not order again because it has already taken a very long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Dampers for handball women in front of quarter-finals against Spain
Germany's handball women sneak after the humiliation against Denmark with hanging heads and empty eyes from the parquet.
At 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers, the DHB selection made a tough defeat at the end of the World Cup's main round and now has to come against host Spain in the quarter finale.
"We were far too scared and had too much respect for the opponent," said Federal Trainer Henk Groener.
We must act differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8:2 points as second behind the Danish (10:0).
It's a shame we couldn't take the flow.
That was a bad game for all of us to delete," said Captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for the entry into the semi-final, a significant increase must be made against the 2019 World Cup second on Tuesday in order to keep the delicate dream of the first medal alive since 2007.
The best German thrower in the duel with the three-time Olympic winner Denmark was backroom player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We were just not there - neither in the attack, nor in the defense," admitted backroom player Xenia Smits, demanding: "We have to look forward quickly now".
From the front to the rear not on the height
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team with the appetizer was not up to date.
Mistakes and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a fast 0:4-resistance after seven minutes.
Only Torfrau Dinah Eckerle was immediately at operating temperature and with some parades prevented worse.
The first goal was achieved by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a quick counter-step.
However, the hoped-for initial inflammation was not.
The German women could hardly sit in the scene against the aggressive coverage of the Danish women - and if so, they mostly failed at the strong Althea Reinhardt in the gate of the Scandinavian women.
So the game was running at 3:10 minutes after 20 minutes, especially since the backroom player Mia Zschocke saw red a little later because of a hard boulder on her opponent.
In the quarter finale, however, it is allowed to participate again.
Only in the final phase of the first half-time did the DHB selection come up a little better and reach at least five goals until the break.
The already only silent hope for a catch-up after the change had already passed seven minutes at 9:19.
Again, the Grüner-Schützlings sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-placed opponent, who is one of the medal candidates at the final round.
As a result, the German team could no longer get up to an increase in performance and went off the parquet as a clear loser.

Is that what they're doing?
The title presupposes that I work as a vaccinationist in mobile vaccination teams, where (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is immunised in nursing homes.
Since they are soon finished to a large extent, they continue in some vaccination centres for me.
I like to answer questions without a time limit on the organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, provided they are not related to a personal one (e.g. "I take medicine X, this is tolerated with vaccination..").
In my area of responsibility, the education for vaccination, the indication position (person is entitled to vaccination according to corona vaccination and no reasons against it), the medical documentation and, if necessary, the emergency care for allergic reactions (me never happened).
The vaccination itself is delegable to qualified staff, e.g. medical professionals.
In vaccination teams, however, we often do not have one, but "only" (for God's sake, no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for vaccine preparation, but they cannot (may?), so that I also carry out most vaccinations myself there.
Heavy "Huidler" question: Amberger knows the solution
What is a "Huidler"?
With this dialect, sent in by an amberger, the BR TV show "We in Bavaria" has provided intense thought.
But unlike many previous days, the term in the series "Host mi?" remained unsuspected this time by the callers.
No, it wasn't a "man who's nervous."
And no one who has to go fast.
That, heard the people from the TV presenter, was totally wrong.
On which the man from Amberg reported the solution and thus probably also caused astonishment in many upper Palatinates.
"The skinner," the spectators learned, "is a rag with which someone wipes out the oven."
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, surveyed by Bavarian television for years as an expert, confirmed this.
With the note that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, somehow derived from the rather well-known mouth-word "Holding".
What closed an educational gap - probably also with some who have long lived in the Amberg area.
I can't buy books in two weeks.
The following error message always comes after the confirmation: opens - oneting went wrong - try again later.
I have rebooted the #PRS_ORG# gel#PRS_ORG#n, connected to the PC, synchronized and repaired.
Nothing helped.
Tire choice at the race bike- really so safe?
This morning I woke up full of action, because I wanted to train at least a little in the next week to prepare my bike tour.
Said, did, and I drove my racing bike, which I bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40km were also really nice - but then what happened in every city centre (this time: Thanks Krefeld!) lurks.
Glass splinters on the track.
Zack, booze and my rear tires didn't want to go through the rest of the route at all.
Since I had no real opportunity to get a replacement coat and a replacement hose due to the day of the week, I had to turn around with half the bad mood and take the first train home.
Then it wasn't that bad, but maybe it's better if I do this with the change of tire before I cycle again.
But now I am faced with a question and hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long track over several days ahead of me, I would get this problem a lot more unpleasant.
Now it was really not bad, because the old tires from the previous owner (very nice old man, the day I came to pick up the bike to 2 p.m. 120km!) and who had already called it a suboptimal because he played with them for many years.
But if I think I have to make another change of tire when driving after 80-90kms, I think I'm really bad :D
Now I got into the conversation with an older man at the platform, who asked me wonder why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tires; they are supposed to be inflatable.
Now, of course, the whole sounds very tempting.
But are these really so unbreakable?
I have little desire to spend 40€/tire now, just to be disappointed.
I also wonder: I currently have 25x622 on my racing bike.
Although there are also (seen?) at the Marathon Plus tyres, the majority is already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you generally advise me on a race bike with other tires?
The swallow side seems to recommend my absolute! Laying knowledge rather the Durano DD?
Thank you in advance for your help and greetings!
Car tossing against tree: Driver fatally injured
On the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten, the 53-year-old was beaten against a middle island with his car for unexplained reasons and then hit the counter-carriage, as the police told us.
There came a frontal collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The 53-year-old's car was then tossed against a tree and the man was clamped in the car.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old passenger were seriously injured in the accident and taken to hospitals.
yes we have deleted all the books completely authorized and loaded new books

After the release of our new High End wide-band B 100- 6 OHM, it was only a question of time until our SOLO series would be re-introduced again.
SOLO 15 is called the new Sprössling and visually reminds of the big models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, this construction proposal includes a suitable designed foot directly with it to lift the speaker to the correct hearing position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the conditions at home.
The principle of the SOLO 15 is very good for people in whom the maximum volume plays a rather subordinate role, but which is to be achieved with an exceptionally high level.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not able to generate almost unfiltered such a large sound pressure level.
This does not mean, however, that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, it grows up considerably and acts extremely impressively and accurately for its size.
Tonal was tuned the SOLO 15 with a slight high-tone rise.
This is common for wide-bands to optimize the overly high frequencies.
The SOLO 15 is perfectly focused on the hearing area with very clear and fine sound.
Slightly rotated outwards, the high-tone range can be reduced and the sound image made warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source, the placement of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is sharp and amazingly precise.
The reference suspects extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM provide an enemy dynamics that seeks its same.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our kits it is recommended to start thinking about the final look of the speaker in order to plan corresponding changes in the construction.
For example, if you want to veneer the housings, the reduction of the speaker must be adjusted accordingly, as the veneer applies material again.
After all the plates have been cut (e.g. in the DIY market), you should first drill an 8 mm hole into the base plate at the appropriate point to be able to carry out the cable without any problems.
With the help of an upper milling machine, the speaker opening follows in the front, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be used later on.
Backside this opening should be equipped with a 45° phase to make the opening area of the speaker chassis as large as possible inside.
The four screw points of the B 100 - 6 OHM are interrupted in the phase as shown in the picture "Detail Phase".
Then you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
Now the back wall, the lid, the front and the floor are glued to them.
The three stiffenings should also be used and bonded.
The stiffenings themselves can vary in the material thickness if necessary, if one wants to rely on, for example, finished straps from the DIY instead of producing them from 16 mm MDF.
The next step will be followed by the second side.
Then follow all the plates of the foot, i.e. the two sides, as well as the front.
With a suitable hole circular saw or a forester drill, the openings of the bass reflex tube, as well as the connection terminal on the back wall are facilitated.
You then use a circular milling machine to round all the edges of the actual box.
The top of the foot plate can also be rounded off.
The foot plate is then glued firmly with the foot of the housing and additionally screwed with long wooden screws.
It follows the marking and pre-drilling (2.5 mm drill) of the screw points of the speaker chassis and the connection terminal.
After the housing has been cleaned by wood dust (suck off / blow out), the cable begins to move.
The 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back wall is the easiest way to do this.
The entire und unshorted cable is pushed through the 8 mm hole into the foot to the terminal opening and lets it stand out there about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the housing one leads the cable to the speaker opening and lets it hang out easily there as well.
The frequency softness is prepared and used below.
The construction plan of the frequency wave, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be taken from the following document: Assembly instructions Soft solo 15.
If the frequency soft is installed and the connection terminal is screwed, the 8 mm cable opening inside the box is sealed, which is not yet fully closed.
Through the 35 mm BASSREFLEX opening and with some skill, you can drop hot glue on the opening and so close.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp you can check the seal accordingly.
Now the damping follows according to the description.
The B 100 - 6 OHM is then connected and bolted with the corresponding screws.
The polarity plays an important role here, so that the plus cable (marked cable) has to be soldered at the plus pole of the speaker (greater contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is shortened and inserted to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the pipe).
For damping, a mat of the damping material is cut into two parts and loosely distributed in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept free.
Can I drop an order now and have it delivered at the beginning of June?
> Hello at all,
> finally we can announce that we will be holding the OSCAST again this year!
> Unfortunately, for known reasons it is not possible to get more than four people into the studio, which has meant a higher planning effort and explains the short-term nature of the announcement.
ABER: There will be at least three people by switch, so that we will follow the Oscars in 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delay or other problems.
But hey, it's still pandemic – yet we will give everything to accompany the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
> It will start around 0:30.
Have drinks cold before, plan good food and prepare for a long but very interesting night.
