Tom could not believe what was going on.
Excuse me!
The children sleep.
We suggest that all contact with the rebels be cut off.
Tom seems very relieved.
I'm glad it makes you happy.
The baby smiled at me.
I can’t think of his name now.
Do you have a car?
I eat sausages.
Don't believe anything about Tom telling you.
Tom has an excellent memory.
Trier is the oldest city in Germany.
Let me introduce you to my mother.
I’m not sure I want to see it.
My father is busy.
Sami's in a completely different country.
Why would you want to do something like that?
The cat likes to sleep.
I was worried about him.
I have a problem with my car.
I don't want to see it.
We are not going to do that.
Weight decreases.
I don't care about them.
With the correct use, some toxins are beneficial.
I know little about the recent situation.
I'd like to ask a question.
Why is Tom early?
When was the last time you kissed your wife?
Tom completely forgot about us.
The shopping center is not going anywhere.
Tom is very hurt.
I understand now.
Vuvuzelas is stupid!
Are you talking Volapük?
I enjoy working in a store.
You must stay.
He knows how to sing in Japanese.
I have always associated hard work with success in life.
Our headquarters is in Osaka.
Do I write in Japanese?
Forget about him.
Look what I found.
Tom trusts you.
Everything's going to be fine.
I'm going to brush my teeth.
You can decorate the stain with a cherry or pineapple.
When are you going to do that?
She will try again.
Was the soup tasty?
What does he do?
Tom didn’t have the chance you and I had.
Many birthday cards will soon arrive.

On Saturday my father is open.
What he said made us angry.
Not only does he speak French but he also speaks Spanish.
I don't think anyone has noticed what you've done.
That's a nice pair of legs.
One, three, and five are uneven numbers.
Did they sign?
He needs water.
Birds drink water.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Tom never cooks.
How many pens do you have?
Mustafa Kemal Ataturk declared the Turkish Republic in 1922.
His silence surprised me.
It’s just not worth the effort.
We arrived a little late.
No one will care.
Here, I found it. He lives in Wannlake.
Are you sure you want me to help you with your homework?
The package weighs more than one pound.
I know how you felt about him.
It will be our secret.
This pencil is white.
Sometimes he watches TV.
Drink!
Do not miss the occasion.
It's a little cool.
He's better than me.
Tom showed me his new guitar.
It is easy to view humans as unique, including living organisms.
The sick person had the best possible care.
You're working too much.
We slept in the same room.
I'm not going to buy anything.
Tom would not be bothered about jockeying.
"I never thought of it," said the old man. "What shall we do?"
Forget about them.
Tom did not take place to kill.
Mary is Tom’s wife.
Where are the other girls?
Newspaper reporters were not allowed inside.
I like cold pizza.
He didn't wear a coat.
He condemned racial discrimination as an will.
I drink water.
The food did not taste so badly.
She is two years older than you are.
I never said that.
I'm not blaming you.
She married him.
If I were you, I would start immediately.
She has blonde hair.
Does Tom know about Mary?
I'll be here when you get back.
When does Tom eat breakfast?
You have wine.
I forgot about him cleanly.
The horse is in the woods.
More coffee, please.
Who is that woman?
I'll accept your offer.
Do you understand what he says?
My wife is a vegetarian.
Where does Tom eat breakfast?
We carried out that plan.
You should have attended the meeting.
Can you read my letter and correct the errors, if there is.
My conscience bothers me.
Many homes were washed away with the flood.
Why Do I Have to Care About Them?
Does your friend like tea?
I had to rent a car.
What should I do about her?
If a sick man folds a thousand paper cranes, her wish will come true.
Tom forgot about them cleanly.
Don't be late for the train.
If you find something you're good with and you enjoy, it's a wonderful thing.
You wouldn't believe me.
Tom is not going to help us tomorrow.
I was sorry to hear about her.
Whatever you do, do not drop the new phone.
Why don't you help me catch fish worms?
It's not a joke.
Tom is not going to make any deliveries today.
The eye is the soul’s mirror.
The best - written boy wins the prize.
Tom will not stay with us next weekend.
I work with this company.
Tom cannot swim.
You drink water.
She loves him.
Tom did not go.
Do you have a cell phone?
Do you know the boy who cries?
Tom will help you.
You don't need a boyfriend.
Birds sing.
If the idiots were to compete, you would come second, because you are too dull to come first.
I wouldn’t be surprised if Tom hadn’t come.
I don’t want to remember.
Quickly!
They are in the library.
Tom better not.
She's very beautiful.
I don’t want to meet her.
I don’t know where we’ll end up.
Tom got up early.
It's life.
I couldn't stop Tom.
He did not feel sorry for me.
What is your favorite winter sport?
The girl in the blue coat is my daughter.
Our teacher started singing a song well.
We won’t be able to eat everything.
But you well know that these negative consequences would result.
He will never believe me again.
Tom put his judge on flashlight.
The two villages were separated by a river.
We decided not to fire them.
Can I get a coffee for the road?
I met your girl.
Tom ate too much.
Do you know anything about them?
Where's the PowerPoint offer you promised me?
I drink tea.
I was sorry to hear about him.
I'll let you go back to work.
I am not going to be bullied in it to do so.
All we can imagine is real, but what really is real is the real question.
I'm staying in Norway now.
Tom must not die.
I won't be able to help you.
Nobody tells me what to do them.
The smallest continent is Australia.
Can you write an English letter?
My name is Tom.
It's a commemoration from Hokkaido.
I told you before, didn't I?
Do not throw the dog with a stone.
This man screams at me!
From now on, be more cautious.
Please speed up.
Where's the PowerPoint presentation you promised me?
I don't want to lie.
The United States will one day for the first time choose a woman as president, and there will be joy over the long anticipated occasion.
You've just ruined my life!
We'll call you when your table is ready.
Good morning.
This is my computer.
There are fifty members in this club.
I've received letters from a person I've never met before.
My father’s name is Fritz.
Do you speak French?
I'm in a play.
Do not believe everything people tell you.
I don't speak French well enough!
I'm not going to be able to visit for a while.
I don't want to be late.
There was a cat on the table.
It was a moist, grey summer day at the end of June.
Why would I lie?
Come in.
I'm going back to my office.
I don't speak Japanese.
I am also unemployed.
Can I overcome later?
Tom was very tolerant.
I have to go.
Tom will not care.
Sami fixed it last week.
What should we do about him?
The food is right.
I put my socks on in a jap trap.
Tom kept trying.
Tom won't dare.
My horse is black.
If it's false, she's a liar.
I was worried about them.
My friend wrote me a letter to find out how I was.
I would like to mail this package to Canada.
Why should Tom do this?
Don't you add sugar?
I am not easily startled.
She is now doing her homework.
What shirt will you wear to school today?
Berlin is the capital of Germany.
The walls were a light brown painted.
You're afraid of him.
Tom won't see me.
Perhaps I should be less suspicious.
How many letters do the alphabet contain?
He is a man of faith.
Tom will not die.
I don't want to see you.
His Prejudice Jazz
When did you last vote?
She can answer your question.
May I have a look at your card?
I wish you were close to me.
We think the reason for his success was hard work.
I saw you yesterday.
I don't see anything.
Tom committed suicide by jumping off a bridge.
Dreams always come out the other way.
Ping pong is also called table tennis.
I’m sure I’m not going to be of much help.
The sky is blue, the sea is blue, the sky and the sea are blue.
Robert was so busy that he had to refuse an invitation to play golf.
Tom won’t wait that long.
He is my brother.
All human beings are born free, with equal dignity and rights, having reason and conscience, and should act toward one another in the spirit of brotherhood.
They worry about her.
Television costs more than the sunglasses.
You are the most beautiful girl in the world.
I've been used to it by now.
Can you make me a copy?
What is he doing here?
I finish my homework.
Is it hot there?
My house has two bedrooms.
Where is your luggage?
Who has called these corpses to dance?
Can you turn off the lights?
He reads the newspaper every morning.
She continued to work.
He is young.
Tom was busy at that time.
Who had this ugly house built?
He can’t speak much English.
I was just wondering if you could find a place to stay.
I don't want to change.
I always wondered what that smell was.
Tom will not give up.

Let's stick to the point.
The news spread quickly.
Do you have a match?
Chinese food made the greatest impression in China.
Please hurry!
The dog jumped over the fence, into the garden.
May I take a day's leave?
The warm bath relaxed my muscles.
Read this book.
Does he write letters in English?
We have a large garden.
Don’t waste your money buying things you don’t need.
Congratulations!
Tom told me to do so.
She had a house by the sea.
Have you ever been to Paris?
That's the last straw.
We know each other quite well.
Thank you so much!
She looked beautiful.
We're all going.
Open your mouth!
It depends on the weather.
Not only does he speak French but he also speaks Spanish.
I went back to my seat.
Close the door behind you if you leave the room.
There's always something to do.
I'm going to be on the next bus.
Money cannot buy happiness.
Who said that?
Your name is first on the list.
Is that necessary?
Can you wait so long?
Were you busy yesterday?
Sami hates to talk about money.
My sister is beautiful.
With the sun set, they left their work.
Who knows where Tom was born?
She runs.
The factory produces toys.
Did she hurt that kitten?
He was a good king.
They said that they had always done so.
We're looking for each other.
I'm just looking.
Sadly, Tom will not be able to come.
Tom said that he thought Mary was still living with her parents.
I'll have to come back to you.
Tom will stay for three days.
I would not be surprised.
It is raining.
In the past, the boys had been taught to defend themselves while they were very young.
Tom would never have done that.
There's a bird here.
Wait, don't shoot!
I wouldn't blame Tom.
That was his decision.
I didn’t really want to win.
I am no longer afraid.
I hoped we could become friends.
Tom trembles.
Grandfather made his own furniture.
He does not like to travel by plane.
We really have nothing to lose.
Sami stays with a friend.
He asked my mother.
Does that make sense?
I don't want you to change.
Even Tom lied.
His music is well - known.
It's all yours.
He belongs to the Catholic faith.
I don’t want to go home.
I don't want to see you.
Tom was disturbed by the direction of his thoughts.
I'm not going to change my choice no matter what you say.
That is quite normal.
I love your son.
Tom will not appear at all.
I should have imagined myself.
Let's practice.
It was difficult for him to hide his pride, which he felt after his success.
I want to know who broke this window.
Tom said that he had not kissed Mary.
That bell is ringing.
I'm not going out of this cell.
I have no time for you.
They said that they had always done so.
My boss was satisfied with what I had done.
I'm a friend of Robert's.
I want to be her friend.
Do not move.
I heard about him.
Peter loves Jane.
I remember hearing about her.
Tom wants to spend time with me.
I will be very careful.
Yesterday this time was on the cinema.
Are you a girl or a boy?
Mike has two girls.
Let's wait until he comes.
Tom dyed his hair dark brown.
That's what you get!
Is Tom going to die?
A dog ran after the cat.
I kissed Tom too.
Why don't you join us for dinner tonight?
It's a horse.
Tom was taken to prison.
It's not a joke.
You promised you would come.
I would be crazy to expect such a thing.
Santa Claus lives in the Arctic.
I was born and closed in Tokyo.
I had a cold.
Let's turn the television off.
Sadly, I would not be very good at company.
You won't be able to help us.
You are the love of my life.
I thought you'd retire.
Tom drinks more than anyone I know.
I like leeks.
He's not always at home on Sundays.
My sons are soldiers.
I don't want to hurt you.
Tom is looking for an easy way to lose weight.
Tom had to go.
I didn't sleep anywhere tonight.
I want to leave Tom.
The song is easy to learn.
Where did you learn it?
You're stupid.
I completely forgot about them.
She chose to succumb under pressure from her parents.
I have to help my mother.
He lives in a village near Osaka.
You're not a dog.
What would you have done if you were in my place?
I'll be right behind you.
Tom went back to his car and got a flashlight.
I think I might be out of a job.
I told Tom I'd be right now.
My son still believes in Santa Claus.
I hate driving.
Sami needs to wait a bit.
Are they friends?
Tom knows everything about them.
It is dangerous to enter that area on your own.
Sami did not notice that.
Are you wearing gloves?
Can I shake your hand?
You don't know my father, do you?
I'm back now with refreshments.
That's why I'm here.
He's my neighbor.
Tom thought it was unfair.
The hotel overlooks the lake.
Tom’s hands were cold.
She is capable of reading.
He seems to know the secret.
Do you have a cell phone?
Mr. Mitchel guessed that I would pay the rest of the money before the end of the week.
She murdered herself.
You're not a doctor.
I know how you felt about us.
She's younger than he is.
I put it back where it belongs.
I'll take a book.
Tom left his phone in the car.
I wouldn’t be so sure.
I keep dreaming about her.
Tom did not wear socks.
Tom will say no.
I'm a fireman.
There are islands in the sea.
Where is it now?
We are not yet very hungry.
There is probably an easy solution to your problem.
I completely forgot about her.
We have to start doing that.
It is expensive to live in Japan.
I know how you feel about her.
I drank two cups of coffee.
I forgot about her cleanly.
Tom thought it was unfair.
I don't want to get married.
I care about him.
Tom may die.
If you get up, he will be studying.
I have a sad skin.
We are his sons.
Birds are beautiful.
The fighting lasted for a week.
When did you last laugh?
Tom's not going to give a talk today.
Why did you join the army?
I wouldn't blame you.
Flowers and trees need clean air and fresh water.
You're too late.
What we know about health has taught us through the study of diseases.
Tom is sitting at window reading a book.
We are not going to be here after 2:30.
I like to eat meat.
I thought we could make it by 2:30.
He was jealous of my success.
Does Tom know how to dance?
Did you call him?
He kicks me!
She reads the newspaper every morning.
The bakery is slowly the slaughterhouse.
Please, forgive me.
"Thank you." "You are welcome."
The food did not taste so badly.
I eat rice.
Excuse me, may I open a window?
This wall is higher than that one.
It is raining.
Tom will be late.
I dare you to bridge that area.
I only bought a new pair of shoes.
We want it back.
The game starts tomorrow.
They can conquer their fear.
This cannot be a real diamond.
Tom moved away.
Was Tom there?
My father recently returned to Japan.
This is my friend.
I know how you feel about him.
Please share my umbrella.
Tom will win you.
Can you open this door?
Her story brings back memories of my parents.
Tom is no longer going to get help through Mary.
I am saving so that I can go to Australia.
I know everything about her.
I'm falling in love with you.
Tom and Mary are very busy.
No matter what he says, do not trust him.
You should have visited Kyoto.
I got up when it was still dark.
Find out everything you can about her.
I came to talk to you.
I wonder what happened to Paul.
If God had not existed, we should have thought about him.
Can you help me with this?
We met in 2008. A year later, we got married.
She's not here.
He asked my mother.
Late in autumn, when the weather was rough, windy and wet, and the cold could enter the thickest garment, especially at sea, a poor boat with only two men sailed into the sea.
At night all cats are gray.
Quiet!
This is my home now.
A bird's flying.
He arrived 30 minutes late.
He reaches out to an English-Japanese dictionary on the desk.
Whatever a man sows, he will also reap.
I wish you had said it before.
I love my mother.
Tom will not object.
I'm much bigger than you are.
Tom looked closer.
I'm your father.
You will pay for it.
I have a place to keep looking.
Tom had a lot on his plate.
Do you choose red or white wine?
This is the next!
I want to see your boss.
He was very tired.
How do you feel about them now?
We forgot her cleanly.
Japan is full of beautiful cities: Kyoto and Nara, for example.
I'll make it back for dinner.
I never thought it would be so easy.
Whose books are these?
Welcome to Australia.
He found his parents.
You can eat what you want.
It's really nice!
The river that flows through Paris is called the Seine.
I'm glad you finally came back.
