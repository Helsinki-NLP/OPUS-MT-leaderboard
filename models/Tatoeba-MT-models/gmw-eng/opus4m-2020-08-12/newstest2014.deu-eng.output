Gutach: Even more safety for pedestrians
They are not 100 meters from each other: on Tuesday, the new B 33-walk ramp at the village parking lot has been put into operation in Gutach - in the sight of the older town hallampel.
Two installations so close together: intention or shield stroke?
This question was clearly answered yesterday by Gutach's mayor.
"The town hall ampel was installed then because it secures the school path," Eckert explained yesterday.
The Kluser traffic lights secure both cyclists and bus passengers and the Bergle residents.
The plant officially put into operation yesterday was important for the crossing area Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße.
We have the museum, two churches, spa park, the bus stop, a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area ›Grub‹.
"With the high traffic and pedestrian traffic, another traffic light had to come to their safety," says Eckert.
This is also confirmed by Peter Arnold of the Landratsamt Offenburg.
"According to current measurements on the B 33, about 12,000 vehicles go through the municipality of Gutach every day, of which about ten percent are heavy-duty traffic," says Arnold.
Therefore, the construction of another traffic light is more than necessary: "Security is just going on here," says Arnold.
A total of four traffic shows were carried out, a roundabout was also planned, however, because of the narrowness in the crossing area Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße rejected again.
According to Arnold, everything was previously tested at the location selection of the traffic lights: "With an extra for us with particularly long wooden trunks loaded transporter, we have proven whether these vehicles can drive out of the Sulzbachweg to the B 33 without bending the traffic lights".
The approximately 15 000 euros high traffic light system itself is the "modernest thing on the market at present", said Arnold.
The system is equipped with coloured LEDs that shine so strongly that the lights from the drivers can be seen well, for example, even in the low sun.
And it is also economical: the older lighting systems consume about 100 watts, the new just eight watts.
There are three lighting systems per direction.
Arnold explained the technology of the new plant: this is equipped with two radar sensors.
If the pedestrian pushes the traffic light button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic position.
If the road is free, green for the pedestrian, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor tests whether the green phase for the pedestrian can be terminated.
"If a group or disabled people walk across the road, the green phase will be extended, so everyone will be safe on the road," said Arnold.
Of course, the car driver has to think as a partner here and observe the roadway.
This was not the case yesterday: Hardly showed the traffic light for pedestrians green, a top-class vehicle sprang through - with bright red.
For more than 30 years, Josef Winkler has been writing about the needs of his childhood and youth.
The Carinthian poet has often described the disasters of his Catholic village childhood - speechlessness, the tendency to violent violence and dull sexuality, the narrowness and joylessness.
The Büchner award winner is known above all as prose author, and theatre texts are rare in his work.
Collage from Prosatexten Gerhard Fresacher creates a collage of prosetexts for his performance "Weather lights on the tip of the tongue", which can now be seen in the garage X at Petersplatz.
For example, the theatre maker combines elements from the autobiographical novel "Der Leibeigene" (1987) with proseminiatures from "Leichnam, his family beguiling" (2003).
On the largely empty stage - important proposite: a broken sofa, on which is clearly copied and masturbated - the eight-member ensemble hangs through the text material.
Director Fresacher seems to have little confidence in the text.
The 70-minute performance overthinks the template with a wealth of directing ideas, known from the repertoire of postdramatic forms.
The actresses in particular come up with some questionable stage implementations.
They are touched hard, immersed in the head under water, with their evening smokes in the wall.
Impelled in cellophane or bodice, they strike dangerously high sticks through the staging, either monologize loud or lie completely silent on the stage floor.
However, the text hardly communicates in this strenuous way.
The best moments are the evening when it is sung - the bandwidth ranges from deep purple to folk songs.
Only towards the end does the overturned performance come a little to rest, and Winkler's absurdly absurd humor flashes up.
A black box in the car?
U.S. road planners are looking for a money source to repair the decaying highway system, and believe to have found the solution in a small black box that can be placed in the dashboard of each car.
The devices that record each kilometre and report the information to the authorities are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the planning offices of the states to revise the obsolete system for financing US roads.
The normally rather boring area of road planning has suddenly sparked an intense debate with colorful alliances.
Liberties have allied themselves with environmental groups and are in favour of the government using the small boxes to record the kilometres driven – and possibly where they were driven – and then using the information for the calculation of tax modes.
The Tea Party is horrified.
The American Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns.
However, while one cannot agree on a course of action in Congress, several states are no longer waiting.
They are currently examining how they can switch over the next ten years to a system in which drivers pay per mile.
Thousands of drivers have already tested the drivers, some of whom are equipped with GPS monitoring.
This is really a must for our country.
"It's nothing that we'll only be able to use," said Hasan Ikhrata, Managing Director of Southern California Assn. of Governments, who plans to record the miles driven by all California drivers in the state from 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology for this is here.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is financed by taxes, is paying the U.S. Americans to the column.
But in America there is not as much dancing as before.
Cars consume less gasoline.
The state oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 Eurocents per litre) has not increased for 20 years.
At high fuel prices, politicians do not dare to raise the tax even by one cent.
"The petrol tax is simply not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, an expert on transport legislation at the University of Minnesota.
Its state has recently equipped 500 cars with pens to test a miles-based payment system.
"This is the most meaningful alternative in the long term," he said.
Officecrats call it miles-based user fees.
It is not surprising that the idea is popular with urban liberals, for the tax can be used, for example, to influence driving behaviour in such a way as to reduce congestion and harmful emissions.
California planners rely on the system to develop strategies to achieve the ambitious, legally established goals of the state on climate change.
But Republican Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also stated that he sees it as the most common long-term alternative.
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also encouraged by the idea of having drivers paid for the route.
"This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole," says Adrian Moore, Vice-President of Reason's Guidelines.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. transport ministers who, in a 2011 report, asked Congress to move towards miles-based billing.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year, covering 10,000 cars.
However, the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the advance and responded to the concerns of representatives from rural areas representing people who often have to travel many miles on their way to work or to the city in everyday life.
Nevertheless, several states and large cities are moving in this direction on their own.
The most dedicated is Oregon, who currently employs 5,000 drivers for the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon pay the miles instead of the mineral oil tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is also considering such a thing.
Illinois tests it with trucks to a limited extent.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transport ministries of 17 states on the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently investigating how the change could be introduced.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the equipment, drivers were skeptical of thinking that the government could track any of its movements.
"Thinking about Big Brother and such things were a big problem," explains Alauddin Khan, Head of Strategy and Results Management at the Nevada Ministry of Transport.
People didn't want it.
When the test came, Nevada's ACLU warned on its website: "It would be relatively easy to turn the recorders into adult surveillance devices."
There is no need to establish a huge, bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of a number of states that now look for affordable technology that allows the state to capture the kilometres driven, but not exactly when and where.
So, according to Khan, the public would also be calmed down.
The hunt for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California.
The company originally did not take up the task of helping states to tax motorists.
Rather, it was their aim to take a foothold in an emerging market for car insurance, where drivers are to pay on the basis of the miles driven.
But the devices they have tested are also interesting for road planners, because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information that is regularly uploaded by modem.
"People are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded," said Ryan Morrison, Managing Director of True Mileage.
In some of these public pilot programs, major mistakes have been made.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this.
In Oregon, planners experiment with giving car drivers a range of choices.
You can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they do not choose a device at all and instead pay a flat-rate fee on the basis of the miles driven on average by all the inhabitants of the state.
Others hope to be able to sell the concept of a suspicious public by equipping the devices with more functions than with fewer ones.
In New York City, traffic officials want to develop a tax system that also allows parking fees to be paid, insurance to be paid only for miles driven, and speed data to be collected from other vehicles in real time, which allows drivers to avoid traffic jams.
"Automobiles would be motivated by the added value of the benefits the system offers for participation", says a city planning document.
However, some traffic planners wonder if the whole talk about paying per mile is not just a huge distraction.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay area, officials declared that the Congress Kongress simply solves the problem of bankrupt Highway Trust Fund by increasing fuel taxes.
An additional one-off fee or an annual charge could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little petrol, so that they also pay a fair share.
"There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is sufficient," explains Randy Rentschler, Head of Legislation and Public Affairs of the Commission.
When we do, hundreds of millions of drivers worry about their privacy and many other things.
Königsfeld: Small team beats themselves wicker
The volunteer fire brigade handled her autumn main sample despite lack of staff with bravour.
Only eleven men participated in the exercise.
In his adoption of the practice, Commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the Feder estate on Burgberger Straße.
There is said to have been a short circuit during sawing.
Two people were injured by the fire and smoking development, but one of them was able to send an emergency call.
After the first review of the situation by Hans Kammerer, two Wehr respirators were prepared to enter the building.
After a short period of time, the first person was able to find and guide him into the open.
The second person had to be worn.
This was not so easy, as there was also a narrow staircase to overcome.
The building, a workshop with integrated stable for two horses, was not easy to secure.
It stored a lot of wood and also straw balls in it.
There were also electrical machines for woodworking.
The first attack was made via the tank in the vehicle.
Another line took place via an overfloor hydrant about 100 meters away.
Now three deletion attacks could be made.
A hollow beam tube was also used in the building.
In the exercise, Hans Kammerer also wanted to show what is to be achieved with less available staff.
In case of urgency, support is provided via the Königsfeld daily deployment group.
The commander was satisfied with the course of the exercise.
Networking of universities and companies important
On his visit to the district of Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald, President Guido Wolf also informed himself in Titisee-Neustadt of where the workers of tomorrow came from.
At the Hochschwarzwald funding centre, he worked with the executives of the vocational schools and the Kreisgymnasium and the parents' councillors on this important issue.
"Education is an important location factor," underlined Claudia Stehle, director of the Hans-Thomas School, who presented the connected school project Bildungszentrum Hochschwarzwald.
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for training.
Since 2011 there has been a successful cooperation between the funding centre, the district school and the vocational school centre in the forest city.
He also praised the family friendliness in the district.
"It is important not only to have a look at the family phase, but also because of the demographic change the phase for the care of family members," said Wolf.
He also argued that more and more employees were caring for the care and care of their families.
"Without the support of employers, the resulting burden on employees can lead to an end to the employment relationship," said Wolf.
But no one could afford to lose qualified workers, he continued.
Another particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies.
"For those who have already come to know the benefits of the region during their studies often retain the regional economy with their acquired knowledge and skills, which contributes to the strengthening of the region," said the president of the state.
Only if sufficient training places were offered could the skilled workers' needs be met.
In his opinion, the location advantage of the district is its beneficial location in the southwest of Germany, in the immediate vicinity of France and Switzerland.
On his train journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg, he also experienced the efforts already made to expand public transport.
"Stay persistent and make public transport better," he explained to the local politicians present.
Experienced with music an entertaining afternoon
For 15 years now, the Kaul family has invited the Dietinger Seniors to a coffee, cake and then a vesper.
In the past, the older fellow citizens were hosted in the rest.
Meanwhile, this afternoon takes place in the nursing home St. Josef.
The home dwellers were looking forward to the delicious cakes and cakes.
Later there was sausage salad.
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich entertained common melodies.
The more than 100-year-old natural stone wall as the front line of the old schoolyard to the Kirchstraße is to be added to the renovation plan of the city of Brönlingen.
In the days before the Kilbig, a small corner wall was built during the first works of the renovation of the front school yard, to stabilize and static release of the over a hundred-year-old natural stone wall with balustrade.
Alexander Misok of the Bräunlinger Stadtbauamt said that the next step is to include the Landesdenkmalamt in the plans and to develop a reorganisation concept for the old wall.
A cost calculation will then be carried out by experts, who will then be placed on the table by the municipal council for the decision and definition of further action.
A decision on this is expected to be taken in the coming year.
After the renovation, paving and tree planting of the old school courtyard within the two side wings of the school built in 1912, as a follow-up measure, the limited wall in need of renovation must be renovated from the ground up and put on new substructure.
The historic, one hundred-year-old demarcation wall of the old schoolyard to the Kirchstraße, is mainly due to water and frost damage, since there is no drainage, needing renovation and has a archendum to the front.
Deep cracks in individual stones show weather damage, but the wall is not currently at risk of collapse.
A stable wall is a prerequisite for a schoolyard used by students, which has been done by the current fortification work.
Originally, the school yard renovation was planned even in the years 2008/2009, but high unplanned expenditures brought a shift.
An important word in the historical school wall renovation, which has even been used for filming, will be the Landesdenkmalamt.
If specifications come from this side, the city of Bräunlingen hopes for grants from the monuments.
The students of the Bräunlinger primary school, who are now being taught again in a well-renovated old school building with a new hall, can soon use the old school yard.
Özdemir wants to receive jazz training in Stuttgart
Cem Özdemir, Federal President of the Greens, has now joined in the ongoing discussions on the future of the music universities in Baden-Württemberg.
"I think it's wrong to give up the holistic training at the Stuttgart University of Music," Özdemir said the "Stuttgarter Nachrichten".
Jazz and classics belong together at the jazz location Stuttgart.
In this way, Özdemir, who is considered a favorite in Stuttgart for a direct mandate at the Bundestag election on 22 September, opposes the Green-Red State Government.
On the basis of an expert study, this requires a reorganisation of the five music universities in Baden-Württemberg.
The jazz and pop program will then be transferred from the Stuttgart University of Music to the Mannheim University of Music.
US border: "Super tunnel" to drug smuggling discovered
At the border between Mexico and the USA, investigators have discovered and shut down a "super tunnel" to drug trafficking.
According to the US customs authorities, the more than 500-metre-long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, railways and an ventilation system.
Three suspects were then arrested, eight tons of marijuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine seized.
According to the information, the tunnel had not yet been used.
"These cartels are stupid when they think they could dig themselves under the radar," said the U.S. District Attorney General Laura Duffy at a press conference in front of a warehouse in San Diego, where this had been discovered an end of the tunnel.
To the drug gangs, Duffy assured: "If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them, we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money."
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a permanent fight against the drug cartels.
Since 2006, more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime.
Designed by experts
Because of the complex equipment of the tunnel, the investigators assume that it was constructed by architects and engineers and that the construction took about a year.
The track system was so equipped that electric cars could be used there.
On the Mexican side there is access in a building 80 meters from the border.
According to the authorities, a ladder leads 20 meters into the depth to the actual tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross section of 1.20 meters and a width of 90 centimetres.
It would also have been appropriate to promote illegal immigration towards the USA.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine fund.
The third, a Mexican, was captured because of the confiscated marijuana.
All three threaten to be the highest penalty of lifelong liberation, as officials said.
Since 2006, eight such tunnels have been discovered, it continued at the press conference in San Diego.
But it is the first time that cocaine has been found in such a tunnel construction.
Cocaine is usually smuggled into smaller quantities rather than tunnels.
This shows the "continuation" of the drug gangs whose traditional routes had now been cut off, said Bill Sherman of the DEA drug investigation in San Diego.
They would do anything to get to the United States.
No details were disclosed to the arrested, at least one Mexican, it was said.
You have to count on imprisonment for up to ten years.
2014 will be Geisinger Festjahr
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250.
Return of the first documentary mention is getting closer and closer.
When the year ends in more than eight weeks, the anniversary year is due.
Geisingen and Kirchen-Hausen were mentioned together for the first time in a document.
A document was made in churches, in which both places are mentioned.
On March 15 there will be an official start to the anniversary year, and since Geisingen currently has no hall, this opening event will take place in the place where 1250 years ago both were first mentioned, in Kirchen-Hauser.
As part of the anniversary, several events are planned in Geisingen, as well as in Kirchen-Hausen.
Kirchen-Hausen will be the 1250 in July on a weekend of celebration from 18 to 20 July.
Celebrate again.
On Friday with a ceremony, on Saturday and Sunday with a festival around the Kirchtalhalle.
On this weekend there is also the Kirchen-Hauser Kirchenfest.
City Music Director Rudolf Barth has written an order composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary, which is performed on three dates.
On 21 June together with the solstice celebration of the Schwarzwaldverein, on 12 July in the arena with fireworks and on 13 December as the first concert of urban music in the new Festhalle.
This will be completed and inaugurated in the anniversary year, the official date is the last September weekend, on 27 and 28 September.
On the occasion of the Geisinger city anniversary a new chronicle is also released.
"But it should become a chronicle not only of Geisingen itself, but a printed work about the Geising of today, which consists of Geisingen, Kirchen-Hausen, Leipferdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen," says Mayor Walter Hengstler.
And today's Geisingen celebrates 2014 birthday, and in 1974 today's space was completed with the integrations.
The new chronicle will then be presented at the new Festhalle in Geisingen on November 21 or 22.
But 2014 is also a year with many anniversaries.
The Narration Zunft Strohglonki begins on February 8 with a custom evening on the occasion of its 60th anniversary, the Harmony Gutmadingen will be 90 years and will have the festive banquet on March 29th and then celebrate the District Music Festival from May 1st to 4th.
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen is 40 years old, the Geisinger School has been at the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on 10 May, the Musikverein Polyhymnia Leipferdingen is 150 years old and celebrates this during the fountain festival from 4th to 7th July.
The city of Geisingen was first mentioned in a gift certificate owned by the monastery of St. Gallen in 764.
The document was made in churches (houses) that was then court place.
Both municipalities are thus mentioned in the same document.
Reason 2014 to celebrate this 1250-year-old accordingly, in addition the municipal reform is also 40 years behind.
Council takes track installations into view
Should the railway crossing "At the deer" be extensively rebuilt to increase road safety?
Yes, the councils have decided.
For this, Schiltach has to take in EUR 220 000.
The Deutsche Bahn plans to improve the Kinzigtal railway line next year.
In particular, the safety of railway crossings is to be increased - regularly there are collisions of trains with other vehicles across the country.
If the municipalities agree to the conversion measures, they will have to take part in the costs by a third, while the rest share the railway and the federal government.
Schiltach's city architect Roland Grießhaber explained to the municipal council the special features of the "Am Hirschen" crossing.
There, the city plans to build an ebb at the height of the tunnel mouth west of the railway tracks.
There, even larger vehicles, such as those transporting long wood, could stand in front of traffic without having to block the tracks.
Greßhaber therefore proposed to construct a necessary support wall in such a way that the city could expand the subsequent road in due course to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.
This was controversially discussed in the municipal council, as some councils doubted the need for a spread of roads: Thomas Kipp, with his statement, put the sentiments of critics to the point: "Do we have to take so much money into our hands because of so few vehicles?"
Mayor Thomas Haas contradicted: The "Hirschen" railway crossing was regularly used for longwood transports.
Even wood from the "Kuhbach" area is partly transported over this route, because the vehicles up to 20 metres long could not use the route at the Häberlesbrücke because they could not turn there into the main road.
In addition, the route serves as a redirection for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is blocked, Haas argued.
Since it is clear that the Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels should be rebuilt and renovated, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the "Hirschen" railway crossing could also have an important significance for a longer period of time.
The councils agreed to have the cost investigated as to what would be the intended spread of the road.
Despite this, the remodelling of the railway crossing was largely agreed with the provision that the necessary supporting wall was built in such a way that the city could extend the subsequent road towards "Bahnhofstraße" for traffic to approximately 5,5 meters.
On the other hand, the conversion of the railway crossing in the tannery Trautwein could lead to a very different problem, which concerns the access to the rapidly rising "Grolltzhäuser Weg".
The administration had examined the railway conversion plans from the engineering office of Breinlinger, as it had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhaus Weg was then possible.
The investigation concluded that it should not be excluded that road inclinations could lead to longer vehicles sitting on.
The city, in turn, bears the responsibility for this as a road construction carrier.
The conversion could therefore result in liability disputes.
Since both the wood dissipation and the bending functioned in the current state of expansion, one should not agree to the conversion of the railway crossing, Haas argued.
At this point, too, the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle on the transition is significantly lower than at the other crossings, because there is a directly adjacent centre of the stop to which there is a good visual connection.
Even trains from the main station would have to be slowed down at this point so that no collision would threaten.
For the most part, the conversion of this railway crossing was approved, as the city of Schiltach would have to "swift out" the problem with up-seat vehicles, according to the councils, since the railway could withdraw from the responsibility after completion of the construction work.
The body considers the conversions to the railway crossings "Vor Heubach" and "Vor Kuhbach" unproblematic, for which crossing agreements have already been made with the railway.
Esa decides on large space missions: Missions for billions
Remote planets, gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects they want to start in the coming years.
30 proposals were available, five are still in the race.
Far worlds.
More than 1000 planets with other stars have already found astronomers.
Whether there are at least lives on some of them, nobody knows.
The selection is difficult: Do you want to search for gravity waves?
Or would you rather explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or are searching for earth-like planets, perhaps discovering extraterrestrial life with them?
These questions are particularly raised by those responsible for the European space agency Esa.
For their "Cosmic Vision" programme, they are looking for ideas for two major space projects to make a decisive contribution to research.
The budget for such "L-missions" is about one billion euros each.
The start is expected to be 2028 and 2034.
At the beginning of September, the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 ideas were debated, five of them have now come to a close election.
Many bodies examine the proposals, check with the researchers.
A final decision will be taken by the Scientific Programme Committee in the next few days.
A total of four major questions have been selected by the Esa, to which the missions of the "Cosmic Vision" programme initiated in 2007 will find answers.
What are the conditions for the formation of planets and life?
The exact processes of the formation of stars from large clouds of gas - and thus the formation of planets that surround these stars - are still in the proverbial darkness.
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star has planets, under what circumstances can life arise there?
In order to address this question, the "Cheops" space telescope will be launched in 2017, with which 500 already known planetary systems will be examined in more detail in our closer vicinity.
But the possibilities are limited, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments, astronomers could picture earth-like planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres and thus search for "biomarkers": gases that are considered an indication of biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
This question is also intended to explain in the end what conditions there are for the creation of life.
An important role is the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field as well as the particle radiation from it with the planetary system.
In our solar system, these processes can be examined exemplaryly.
With the "Solar Orbiter", the Esa has already approved a mission of the M-Class (there the budget is about half a billion euros) for this issue.
The probe is scheduled to start in 2017 and observe the surface and activity of the sun.
Jupiter and his moons are also of great interest to the researchers.
They want to find out what role the giant planet has played in the development of the solar system.
For this, the Esa provides the first of the three L missions of the "Cosmic Vision" program.
The Juice probe (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) is expected to begin its journey in 2022.
Eight years later it reaches Jupiter and is intended to explore the atmosphere of the planet as well as the icy moons of Europe, Kallisto and Ganymede.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The space offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and to examine whether the natural laws known to us there are still valid.
Perhaps there are also deviations that could lead the physicists to a new theory under which all known natural laws can be united.
How did the universe come into existence and what does it consist of?
13.7 billion years ago, our cosmos was created by the big bang.
In addition to the common matter of which stars, planets and living beings are like us, there are dark matter whose gravity holds galaxies and galaxies together, and dark energy, which accelerates the expansion of the universe.
So far, the researchers do not know what physical laws were valid in the first fractions of the big bang, nor what dark matter and dark energy consist of.
With "Euclid", the Esa has already approved an M mission here, whose launch is scheduled for 2020.
With a special telescope, the probe is intended to investigate the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time throughout the sky and thus allow conclusions on the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could do the race
Of the 30 proposals, only two will remain at the end of the competition.
According to many experts, "E-Lisa" has the best chance of obtaining approval as an L-Mission, a demanding concept for the detection of gravity waves.
These include physicists' changes in the structure of space time, which Albert Einstein predicted almost 100 years ago.
They have not been proven to this day.
Elisha could do this, the scientists hope behind the project.
The mission provides for a two or three probe detector, which is stationed in space.
In contrast to Earth's plants, it could also prove gravitational waves that were created at the Big Bang, thus providing new insights into the formation of the cosmos.
Four further proposals compete for the second L mission: a large X-ray telescope called "Athena", which is intended to explore black holes, "Icy Planets", another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism", a mission to measure cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder" to detect and investigate earth-like planets.
Among other things, proposals for sample-return transport from Mars, for the exploration of moon, Venus and asteroids as well as for solar physics have already been excavated.
Snowden is ready to "cooperate" with Germany in terms of US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the whistleblower of the U.S. intelligence service, has declared that he is willing to travel to Berlin and declare before the German Bundestag if the American National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not give any answers about their activities.
German Member Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where he received asylum to discuss the statement with him in Germany.
In a letter from Snowden, which was presented to the media in Berlin on Friday by Ströbele, he writes: "Even if the result of my efforts has been proven to be positive, my government continues to treat a dissenting opinion as a breach of fidelity and tries to criminalise political expression with a threat of punishment, in which no defense is possible."
Telling the truth is not a crime.
In the letter Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community can convince the American government to drop the charges against him.
The U.S. Department of Justice's charges include espionage and theft of state property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich said to time online: "If Mr Snowden is willing to speak with German representatives, we will find ways to do this."
Relations between the USA and Germany are under pressure from the claims that the NSA had heard Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone.
Thomas Oppermann, the Member of Parliament who heads the Parliamentary Committee responsible for intelligence, said that the opportunity should be taken to listen to Snowden as a witness if this is possible, 'without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the United States'.
Ströbele, a Green MP, published an image of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia.
Ströbele explained that according to the lawyer of former NSA employee Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Snowden says in Germany, he needs a assurance that he is "safe" there, says the Member.
Snowden explains in his letter that he was exposed to a “serious and ongoing” campaign of persecution that had expelled him from his home country.
He was, however, touched by the global reaction to 'my act of political opinion'.
Citizens around the world as well as high-level politicians – including in the United States – have identified revelations through an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a merit to the general public.
In his letter, Snowden makes an offer of cooperation to the German authorities 'when the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been solved'.
Frontier Airlines collects fees for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to demand up to 100 US dollars from passengers who want to store hand luggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to 100 US dollars for one piece of hand luggage and 2 dollars for coffee or lemonade, even though the announcement on Wednesday reads that passengers should keep the entire box.
The new fee applies to hand luggage in the luggage compartment above the seat, small bags under the seat remain free of charge.
Frontier explained that if the fee was paid in advance, 25 US dollars would be charged, and 100 US dollars would be paid to travellers who paid only on the platform.
Frontier spokesperson Kate O'Malley said that the cost of 100 US dollars is aimed at moving travellers to take care of the payment in advance.
"We don't want to calculate this sum," she said.
In 2008, airlines began to charge fees for the first and second baggage.
Passengers who tried to circumvent them have therefore stuffed as much as possible into the hand luggage, which means that the luggage compartments above the seat are often overcrowded.
Fees are a way to move passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said the new fee isn't really about making money.
It is about the most loyal customers of Frontier, who would have made it clear that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find space in the compartment above the seat.
Passengers who buy your tickets on the airline's website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger may be allowed to carry a piece of luggage free of charge on the Frontier platform, but the next person will have to pay 100 dollars for a comparable piece of luggage.
O'Malley stated that the Frontier website and the check-in procedures would be changed, so passengers would be informed of the fee before they arrived at the platform.
Frontier's new hand luggage fee does not enter into force until summer, an exact date is not yet available.
Passengers often scoff at luggage surcharges and other charges, but airlines like to resort to them.
They argue that the transport of luggage should cost money and passengers pay this service if they wish it.
Many on Wall Street consider the new luggage charges to be a sign that airlines will take enough money to cover the cost of flight travel after years of loss.
Most leave the finger on hand luggage fees.
Spirit Airlines Inc. demanded three years ago as the first charge for hand luggage and later Allegiant Air, also a low-cost flyer.
The only other airline with such a fee was the Hungarian Wizz Air, said Airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitored the additional fees.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that the hand luggage fee Spirit brings in 50 million US dollars annually.
Sorensen, who used to hold a leadership position at Midwest Airlines, recently flew with Spirit and was curious about what would be expected of him on the platform if passengers faced the company's unusual hand luggage fee.
"The boarding process was one of the smoothest things I've experienced in my career in aviation," he said.
I expected to see teeth gnashing and hand-held discussions on the platform.
"The plane was full," he said, "and the boarding ran like lubrication."
Frontier also follows spirit at the 2 dollars required for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.
The company stated that passengers who bought lemonade or juice should keep the whole can and fill coffee free of charge.
Water is still free.
In 2008, US Airways had briefly tried to demand money for soft drinks, but seven months later, it reversed after passengers complained and no other large company had followed.
Frontiers step to raise charges for the hand luggage if passengers do not buy directly from the airline, is the latest initiative with which customers should be directed to their own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies such as Orbitz 10 to 25 US dollars per ticket sold.
This provides an incentive for all companies to move passengers to buy them directly instead of via an online travel agency.
Frontier, however, has gone far enough in this area.
In September, the company started to grant only half as many frequent flyer miles when booking via an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, the miles were reduced once again to 25 percent of the flight route.
A flight booked with a third-party provider with Frontier over 1000 miles is therefore only 250 miles away from customers.
Passengers can also reserve seats only when buying directly on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its headquarters in Denver, but the business is shrinking and the company is losing money.
The proceeds decreased by 9 percent and the air capacity decreased almost 13 percent in the first quarter, as reported in the financial report published on Wednesday by the parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic has tried to get hold of Frontier's finances as part of the sale of the company.
Proverbs Come From the Bible
Approximately 40 women visited the last women's breakfast this year in the evangelical church of Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the parish hall were "proverbs from the Bible" and "devotions from the Middle Ages".
After breakfast, Zita Köhler, the chairman of the church council, answered the Bible proverbs in a talk.
"Proverbs contain way of life, regulations or warnings," she explained.
They compared several proverbs with the corresponding Bible passages and explained the meaning.
She called proverbs like: Wooden eye be alert, as sheds fall from the eyes, cast an eye on someone whose Lord is asleep, wash his hands in innocence.
Several times the speaker also gave her listeners advice on what proverb it was.
The church councillor, Christel Dehner, accepted the words from the Middle Ages: All good things are three, blue-make, a little decomposed.
She explained the meaning and origin of the words she called "bridges into the past".
In the end, a Tombola was released.
The prizes were covered on a table and were humorously described before they were handed over to the winners.
Among the visitors to the breakfast round was Mayor Roman Waizenegger.
Learning instead of unemployed: Pilot project for unskilled people in tourism
A pilot project for the tourism industry is starting on the Mecklenburg Lake Plate.
Under the leadership of the Federal Labour Agency, 49 women and men who are already working as unskilled in the industry are to be qualified as professionals in hotels and restaurants over three winters.
"New to this is that six-month courses end with degrees," said Carmen Wiechert from the work agency Neubrandenburg.
The benefits are varied: the participants would not be unemployed, the companies would be trained professionals who were increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants, and the agency would not have to finance unemployment.
The Chamber of Industry and Commerce in Neubrandenburg as well as the German Hotel and Gastättenverband (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern are also involved in the project.
NSA states that an "internal mistake" and not hackers are to blame on the crash of the website
The treasured National Security Agency stated on late Friday that a mistake had paralysed its public website for a few hours and not hackers, as was claimed online.
"NSA.gov was not accessible for a few hours tonight, as an internal error occurred during a planned update," the espionage agency explained in an e-mail message.
The problem will be solved that evening.
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed Denial of Service Attack (DDoS) was not true.
In the early evening hours, online server trackers noticed that the NSA fee was not accessible for at least six hours, and this is still not possible for some users.
Previously, a spokesperson of the NSA had told ABC News that the sensitive internal network of the Authority was "not in any way" compromised.
Secret information is not in danger, says the speaker.
At least one group of hacktivists claimed to have paralysed the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In such attacks, the target website is flooded with page views until the servers are overburdened and the website collapses.
Cybertactics is relatively simple and the attacks are not used to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former super-secret NSA, whose nickname was once No Search Agency (No such authority), is now found in the bright light of the public and looks at the revelations made known in recent months about its extensive surveillance program in Germany and abroad with sharp criticism – a result of the secret NSA data stolen and published by disillusioned former NSA staff member Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy about intelligence fired initial speculations about the incident today as the result of a targeted cyper operation.
The number of people without a job fell slightly in October around 22 to 1.307.
Although the quota was 3.1 percent better than last year and also better than in September, "but we would have hoped for more," says Monika Felder-bauer, Deputy Director of the Employment Agency in Sonthofen.
Many companies have so far responded to attitudes.
According to Felder-Bauer, one reason for this is: "We hardly have skilled workers in crafts, healthcare and care for the elderly".
Since September, seasonal jobs for staff in the hotel and restaurant industry have been renewed.
The winter season starts in mid-December.

Loss of profit on Bombardier after decrease in delivery figures and orders
On Thursday, Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15 % decrease in net profit after being under pressure due to falling orders and extraditions on aircraft in the third quarter as well as contract problems in the railway sector.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not publish any flight test data for his brand new CSeries aircraft and did not provide any new information on whether the aircraft will go into commercial use in accordance with the ambitious schedule next September.
The pilot flight of the test aircraft followed only three further take-offs a month and a half ago, which makes it seem questionable whether the test phase is running as planned.
The results remained behind the forecasts and led to a price fall of more than eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, Analyst at National Bank Financial, reduced its evaluation of 'outperform' to 'sector performance' on Thursday in order to ensure that the stock has a limited price potential in the next one to two quarters.
"Although weaker delivery figures for aircraft were widely expected, we are clearly disappointed by the trend in margins in the transport sector," said Doerksen in a customer letter.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries if the test program for the aircraft progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more sceptical of the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries will be able to catapult the company into the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was introduced to the public in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delays.
However, up to now binding orders for the CSeries are moderate with 177, as potential buyers want to wait for the results of the flight tests and see if the company's claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost-saving potential of the new jet transport aircraft are correct.
Currently there are a total of 403 orders and commitments of 15 customers and companies.
Executive Board Chairman Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will achieve its target of 300 binding orders at the beginning of commercial use of the jet.
On Thursday, the management also assured analysts and media that the programme was on schedule.
"The test plane was no longer on the ground than expected," Beaudoin said at a telephone conference, adding that soil testing and software updates had been started during the life of the aircraft.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We have decided to take a first flight and then attach a revision period, whatever we have done.
This happens throughout the entire flight programme.
The second out of five test aircraft is expected to start in the next few weeks, the remaining shortly after, it was said from the company side.
Nevertheless, analysts remain skeptical whether the first customer can operate a CSeries aircraft 12 months after the virgin flight.
Bombardier stated that it would check the planning for commissioning (EIS) and update it in the coming months.
"The slow advance of the flight test – even if they obviously correspond to Bombardier's internal planning – strengthens our view that commissioning is moving towards the first quarter of 2015," said Doerksen.
In the third quarter at the end of September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to 147 million dollars and 8 cents per share of 172 million dollars and 9 cents per share in the previous year.
The adjusted profit per share is unchanged at 9 cents.
Sales fell slightly and fell from 4.2 billion dollars to 4.1 billion dollars.
Analysts expected a profit of 10 cents per share and sales of $4.56 billion, said Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer states that it delivered 45 aircraft this quarter, a drop of 57 last year.
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
The order stock in the aerospace sector was 32.9 billion dollars on September 30, and was therefore unchanged compared to December 31.
"In the field of aerospace, the results were within the scope of our specifications, but the low order intake and market conditions as a whole were disappointing," said Beaudoin.
Sales in the aerospace sector fell by 13 percent to two billion dollars.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer, announced that sales in this sector increased by almost 11 percent to 2.1 billion dollars.
The order stock in the transport sector was 32.6 billion dollars on September 30, and was therefore slightly increased compared to December 31.
The profit margin in the area of transport was affected by resolution problems in some major contracts.
According to management, there will be new requirements for the fourth quarter.
In the afternoon trade on Thursday, the Bombardier share fell by 8.5 percent and was at 4.83 Canadian dollars, after it was also announced that the Google CFO Patrick Picette would switch to the Board of Directors.
Brazilian Embraer SA, the third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and bombardier tightest rival in the world, reported a 10% decline in quarterly profits on Thursday.
USA: Shots at Los Angeles Airport
An unknown person fired shots at LAX airport on Friday morning (local time).
While the airport management informed Twitter that the shooter was in custody, the "Los Angeles Times" reported that the man was dead.
A security guard, too, had been killed.
Media also reported several injuries.
U.S. President Barack Obama was constantly informed of the situation, said White House spokesman Jay Carney.
The incident occurred in Terminal 3. Eyewitnesses indicated that they had seen a gun shooter in one of the departure halls, as several media reported.
A traveler told the station CNN that many people had sought protection in panic.
Travelers would have screamed and cried to children.
Among the waiting, panic broke out, many of them hiding behind chairs out of fear.
He heard two shots, says a traveler of the Los Angeles Times.
An employee of the TSA security authority suffered a gunshot injury at the foot.
The scene had been "like in a film".
After that, he had been taken to a security area himself, the man reported.
The shots are supposed to have fallen close to a security control area.
Airport building evacuated
On television pictures it was shown how many ambulances and police cars appeared in front of a terminal.
Hundreds of people were put out of the building.
Users on Twitter published photos of a special application command and a gun lying on the ground.
As the airport management announced via Twitter, the incident began at 9.30 a.m. (local time).
The access roads were blocked, which, according to CNN, resulted in a long return.
Until landings, air traffic had been temporarily stopped, it was said.
However, several pilots were observed on CNN at takeoff.
Terminal 3 is mainly operated by smaller US airlines.
Los Angeles Airport is a major airport in the United States.
Cocaine-dependent lawyer who warned drug boss against police investigation must be sent to prison
Basharat Ditta, 42, passed on information to Underworld Size Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid his secret drug addiction could come to light
He was sentenced to three years in prison by Liverpool Crown Court
A well-known criminal defender who warned a drug baron about a big police investigation because he was afraid his secret drug addiction could be detected was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, supplied underworld size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about his drug-trafficking activities after being compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
The criminalist lawyer named Bash was arrested in his home in 2011 after the police monitored Scarborough, whom he had represented in an earlier drug trial.
Officials observed how Scarborough (32) delivered three bags of cocaine at the house of the lawyer in Blackburn, Yorkshire, while he was with colleagues at a meal of the Bar.
The investigations showed that Ditta regularly consumed Class A drugs after traces of cocaine had been found in his hair, wallet, and credit cards during tests.
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he tried to obtain illegal information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were then monitored by the police in the context of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trade in Yorkshire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 others, they were later arrested after the police had secured a number of home searches of heroin and cocaine worth 1.5 million pounds and 200,000 pounds of cash.
Ditta, 42, gave information to the criminals because he feared that his drug dependence could become public.
Today, Ditta, who works for the law firm Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was found guilty and convicted of a three-week trial at Liverpool Crown Court in two counts for disability of justice.
He admitted to cocaine possession during an earlier survey.
The lawyer was transferred after the police found out during their investigations against Scarborough that he had been in regular contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw him go to Ditta's house and put the drugs there with a purity of 60 percent in a black golf glove under the lawyer's garbage bin.
Shortly after he delivered the drugs, Scarborough regularly phoned with Ditta, who was at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home, got the drugs, and then nine messages were exchanged between the two.
In court it was known that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of cocaine after tests had discovered Class A drugs in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but refused to take cocaine and said that he had spoken to the alleged dealer because he was his client, and claimed that her discussion was under the 'privileged secret'.
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were guaranteed and a hair sample was taken.
During the police interrogation, he stated that he was operating an office at both his private address and the workplace, and clients would call him at home for legal matters.
In court it was known that he had called on important stakeholders in drug trafficking, some of whom he had previously represented, after significant arrests and had informed the investigators of what they knew about them.
Attorney Anne Whyte said: "A criminal lawyer should know better than anyone else that you don't break the law."
Ditta is charged with abuse of his position as a criminal defender, for he has too much with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not simply that of a drug dealer, but of a drug dealer who provides his lawyer with drugs.
Some of his communications were no doubt legitimate, for he was the lawyer of these persons.
But this went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.
He had as much effect as possible on police investigations so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities.
Mr Ditta thus dismissed his profession.
He was too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta rejected every misconduct and claimed: "If I were a corrupt lawyer, what I am not, and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough, I would not wait 15 hours, but do it immediately."
However, after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead said of the police in all the countries of the country: "Mr. Ditta has taken the step from a criminal to a criminal at the moment he began to acquire drugs from organized criminals."
His cocaine dependence led to a hopeless compromise and made him receptive to the motives of leading members of organized crime who instructed him to collect valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure public confidence and confidence.
Ditta has lost this confidence and is trying to hide behind the facade of his profession.
The Serious and Organized Crime Unit of Allies led the investigations against Ditta, which also led to a conviction in three cases because of the possession of cocaine and judicial disability, which underscored our determination to bring criminals to justice.
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after declaring himself guilty of conspiracy as a heroin, cocaine and cannabis trade.
Thirty-five other persons involved in drug trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years for drug crimes.
On his website Ditta published an area of questions and answers about himself in which he stated that his dream job was to represent clients in the death cell in America as a lawyer, that his ultimate guest at dinner was Muhammad Ali and his opportunity inequality was the motivation for his work.
revolutionary work of church music
At the end of the celebrations on the occasion of his 160th anniversary, the Songkranz Dunningen will outline two services with the "German Fair" by Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the musical "Rock my Life", which the spectators enjoyed in spring of this year, the Liederkranz will enrich two services with the performance of the Deutsche Messe by Franz Schubert at the end of the anniversary year.
On Saturday, October 26, this extraordinary Mass will be heard at the St. Martinuskirche in Dunningen from 19th during the evening Mass and on Sunday, October 27th, from 10.15 a.m. at the St. Johannes Baptist Church in Lacendorf.
The so-called German Mass with the original title "Songs for the Celebration of the Holy Sacrifice of Mass", D 872, is a spiritual musical work by composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was almost considered revolutionary at the time of its creation.
The Mass is presented as part of the divine services, as the client Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind.
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied by the brass group of the music association Merry Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi on the organ.
Haslach: Skepticism blurs confidence
With the elections to the 2015 parish council, for example, the Seelsorgeunite Haslach (SE) will change fundamentals.
There is then only one common parish council for all six parish councils.
At a joint meeting on Saturday the committees from Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbachenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach were preparing for the changes.
For there is nothing to change the fundamental decisions of the diocese and it is for the parish councils to implement it as satisfactorily as possible.
In the course of the day, it became particularly clear: the skepticism toward the new is hesitant but at the same time a confidence.
From the ideas and expectations of the 2015 innovations to concrete proposals about the future composition and size of the parish council, the highly constructive discussions of the six bodies with the main officials of the pastoral care team ranged.
On the basis of a presentation, regional dean Georg Schmitt explained the new guidelines for pastoral care units in the Archdiocese of Freiburg.
After that, the SE Haslach as a parish of the Church will form a body of public law which will enter into the rights and obligations of the so far six individual church communities.
There will only be a joint parish council and a council of foundations in which the pastor Kraft is represented.
At least two elected members shall be represented from each parish, and six local parishioners shall be formed.
Their task will be to promote church life in the place in the future.
The question of the finances of the individual parish community then showed considerable need for discussion.
The innovations provide that accumulated assets will be preserved in the parish for purpose.
The liabilities, on the other hand, are transferred to the community as a whole.
Especially with regard to the large planned investments, whose commitment then meets all the parishs, there were great concerns.
"Even in the past, only projects that could be managed by the individual parishs alone were invested," relativized Haslach's parish councillor Bruno Prinzbach.
Practical experience with a joint panel for five parishions described Barbar Ritter, the chairman of the panel in the Sutterwald-Neuried pastoral care unit.
They had made themselves a task in 2006 to "get one, stay five" and had to find that this was not so easy.
The committees of the Haslacher Seelorgeunity then decided to answer the questions about the future composition and size of the common parish council as well as the practical work of the community teams.
The drafts will be made concrete at further meetings and decided at a further joint meeting of all six bodies next spring.
In the end, parish councillor Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the pastoral care unit, which was approved by a clear majority.
In Poulendorf the electricity is becoming more expensive
The citizens of Pullendorf must adapt to higher electricity costs.
As the managing director of the Stadtwerke, Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed against SÜDKURIER, a family of four members of the Pullendorf family costs 70 to 90 euros per year.
The main reason for the forthcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called EEC levy from 5,277 to 6,3 cents per kilowatt hour.
This fee is re-established each year in October by the four operators of the large electricity grids.
These figure the extra costs they receive from the energy transition, which they can charge by a surcharge over the electricity price.
The Stadtwerke Pullendorf form the last link in this chain.
In its forecasts, the Supervisory Board of the energy company even assumed a higher levy, as reported by Jörg-Arne Bias.
Now the concrete payments would have to be calculated before the City Works could inform their customers of the exact price increase next week.
"We're starting from an increase of 1 cent plus x," said Bias, with the number more close to the 2 cents.
Lights on permanent red: pay attention to waiting time
Sometimes a traffic light just doesn't turn green.
The contact loop in the street does not react, or the light sign is defective.
What should you do - drive red?
If a affected person has waited long enough for a red light and the crossing is free, he can continue, explains Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "Motorrad".
However, the waiting period must be "adequate", which can be interpreted differently from one case to another.
Becker advises to endure at least five minutes before starting from a traffic light malfunction.
Those who continue the journey despite red light must, however, be aware that they bear the full blame for an accident caused by it.
Those who tolerate themselves for less than five minutes may not wait long enough, warns Becker and refers to a decision of the Supreme Court of Hamm.
In the negotiated case, a driver had ignored the traffic light after about three minutes of permanent red and had to be responsible for a negligent red light violation.
The traffic light was not faulty, but jumped on green a little later.
A ban on driving was spared because of the particular situation - but the fine was not.
Council of the Community is pleased with its solid budget
Every time the municipal council meetings are about the household, Mayor Ralph Gerster laughs well.
The Gemeindesäckl in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and the administration has no longer known debts since 2005.
The 2012 financial year can also be recorded as a full success in this respect.
This became clear in the presentation of the 2012 annual accounts.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget at around EUR 7.6 million was over EUR 1 million higher than planned.
The surplus of the administrative budget is also around EUR 1.8 million above the approach.
The surplus is mainly due to higher commercial tax revenue and the municipal share of income tax.
The asset budget was again clearly above the planned values.
Instead of the planned 1.5 million euros, it was 2.5 million euros last year.
"This is essentially due to the higher intake from the administrative budget," says Rothmund.
As less investment has been made in the financial year 2012 than planned, the allocation of reserves has also been higher.
Overall, the general reserve could be increased by around 2.1 million euros to a total of 4.9 million euros.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for the good work.
"You don't just shake such a work out of your sleeve," said Gerster with a view to the annual accounts.
He and the municipal councils were clearly pleased with the good figures.
It may sound paradoxical, but these very good figures could soon be expensive for citizens.
Due to the good financial situation, the municipality in the past was able to waive high lifting rates.
However, according to Gerster, subsidies had often been reduced by the country.
These subsidies from various compensating sticks are subject to conditions.
Among other things, the cities and municipalities applying for grants must have certain lifting rates.
"We have to look at the issue of lifting sets, as in the coming years there will be investments for which we would like grants," Gerster announced in this connection.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter in the choir for 60 years
At the age of 60, Hubert Wermter's story at the male singing club Cäcilia is almost twice as long as that of the Herbsfest, in which he was solemnly honored.
Hubert Wermter stood on stage as usual in the colors of his men's singing club.
Even after 60 years he still enjoys singing with the choir that has been won more than loved.
Wermter was also active in the association, including 28 years as a member of the Committee.
He received several awards for his commitment and his club loyalty: Jörg Kohr, Pastoral Representative on behalf of the Cäcilienverband Rottenburg-Stuttgart, presented him with a certificate of association and a letter of honour signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst - as the choir is also a church choir.
His colleagues presented him with the certificate of the German Choir Association and a engraved tin plate.
In addition to the honour, the 31st autumn festival was in the usual course: with the MGV Betra, the Songkranz Salzstetten, the Singer department Baisingen and the local Musikverein, the Vollmaringer had invited a colorful mix of different choirs and singing styles that entertained the approximately 400 visitors.
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with atmospheric songs like "Im Weinparadies" and "Lustig, her Brothers".
Their honorary singer Hubert Wermter prepared a small stand for their honor - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Bundeslied".
The men's singing club Betra also sang classical choir songs such as "Jäggewerfen" by Julius Wengert, "Weit, Far Away" by Hubert Goisern and the folk song "When You Walk Through the Valley".
With his mixed choir and his group of women - the "immulschor" - the song crane Salzstetten provided the female ratio of the festival.
The mixed choir abducted with the Neapolitan folklore "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" of Antos Gus in foreign countries, while the "Impulschor" also resorted to foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" were part of their program.
The singer's department of the Baisinger Sportverein came back again with "What is the Schwob?" by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Pappert's "Bierlied" in the home region, where the Vollmaringer Musikverein offered the crowning musical finale.
For the children there was a small side program - "Oma Hanne" a.k.a. Hannelore Stollsteimer performed a Kasperltheater and read a few stories that the children had a good time at noon.
Children’s Dreams Come True
The kindergartens and day care centers in the Zollernalbkreis get mail these days.
The Black Forest messenger, in cooperation with Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb, wants to support the facilities in the realization of their construction and beautification needs.
Does the kindergarten need a new sandbox?
Participation in the action can include all kindergartens, day-care centres and children's cribs from the entire Customs Association.
If you have a construction or beautification request for your facility, you can apply for this in the Black Forest messenger.
Be creative with your children and surprise the jury of the action kindergarten construction site.
A jury consisting of representatives of Schwarzwälder Bote, Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb selects three wishes from all submissions.
What are the conditions for participation?
The desire should be realized with construction materials worth a maximum of 2000 euros and on a (action) day.
In addition, the winner himself has to provide many diligent construction assistants.
What about the day of action and the helpers?
Bauhaus provides the material with the support of the Sparkasse Zollernalb.
It will be delivered to the kindergarten on the agreed day and will then be processed directly by the helpers.
Helpers can be parents, grandparents, friends, clubs and, of course, the educators and children themselves.
Kenyan press is outraged by controversial media law
'We are in a frightening situation and we may ask ourselves, 'What is the view of Parliament that we should simply abolish judicial independence tomorrow', was to be read in the newspaper, which considers the draft law to be unconstitutional.
"The law is draconian and very punishable and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, Managing Director of Capital Group, including CapitalFM, one of Kenya's most respected independent radio stations and news sites.
He said that the new media tribunal "will always be biased, because it is an extended arm of the government", and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the President listens to us and we appeal to him to reject this draft law and send it back to Parliament," he said.
According to the newspaper The Star, the government takes the new law 'the media effectively into a stranglehold', whereas the standard, democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya had suffered 'a severe blow' and called the draft 'draconian'.
The adoption of the law is one of a number of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the wake of armed Islamists attacks on the Westgate shopping centre in September.
The Kenyan media attracted the anger of the authorities because they published shots of security cameras on which it could be seen how the units sent to the crime scene allegedly robbed the luxurious shopping mall.
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded with the enlistment of two journalists and a leading media representative to interrogate, even if the invitation was withdrawn after a call from the media.
According to the new law, media houses can be subject to a penalty of up to 20 million Kenyan schillings and individual journalists with up to one million as well as the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation.
The Tribunal also has the right to seize the property of the persons concerned if a penalty is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, 'even a single penalty can push most radio stations into bankruptcy'.
In addition, the newspaper believes that these measures could have a devastating effect on the description of Kenya's 'living blogosphere'.
If they silenced the media, politicians could do whatever they want.
"No one will ever experience it," wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist with the nation who describes Kenyan media as a decisive control factor in public life.
"If you leave politicians themselves, they lead the country into bankruptcy and back to the time of hunters and collectors," he commented.
The Kenyan legislators in the past have already caused public trouble.
In May, they voted to reverse the reductions ordered by the National Remuneration Commission and reintroduced their fine salaries of about 532,000 Schilling tax-free per month – they are among the world's highest.
Bad-Dürrheim: A dream comes true for the FC
In spite of the cold weather and the rain, the official opening ceremony for the artificial grass sports field was not affected by the importance for the city and the football club.
Everyone would have liked a more pleasant celebration last Saturday, but Peter did not want to play.
So all those who came without a umbrella or could not hold such a one for any reason.
This happened to the musicians who framed the ceremony, as did some speakers.
Wess was therefore also the chairman of the FC Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke of the fulfillment of a dream.
His thanks went to Mayor Walter Kluţ, who had been very active in the implementation of the project, the municipal council, the companies involved and the association members who contributed.
Here, especially Lothar Hero, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The armed pensioners laid 400 square meters of paving stones for the new ways.
This remarkable voluntary commitment was also appreciated by the parliamentarian Karl Rombach.
Further greetings were given to the urban sports committee Hubert Baier, the district chairman of the Southern Baden Football Association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr from the planning office, who announced a donation for the youth department of the club.
Mayor Kluē reminded us that in spring and autumn, recurring weather-related influences were so attached to the original lawn square that it could not be played.
Already 15 years ago, there were the first considerations to solve the problem when it was thought of building a third place at the grounds of the football club or at the Realschule am Salinensee.
Both were rejected again.
Six years ago, thoughts came up to create an artificial grass sports field, which was generally considered the ultimate solution.
Specific plans were taken up two years ago when the FC took over the Schabelstube in Erbacht, promised a cost contribution of EUR 100 000 for the construction of the site and approved the country funding of EUR 104 000.
The municipal council decided in October 2012 to take over the remaining 356 000 euros to the total cost of 560 000 euros, Kluţ summarized.
The beginning of the construction of the 68-meter artificial grass square took place on 4 June.
During the more than three months of construction, 3,000 cubic metres of earth were removed, half of which were used for the construction of a Dirt bike line.
Union and SPD continued their coalition negotiations on internal and judicial issues.
To this end, the responsible working group met in Berlin in the morning.
Among other things, we are talking about direct democracy, advocating parliamentarians and the federal police.
In the morning, the Migration and Integration Working Group also wanted to continue its deliberations.
Among other things, the issue should be dual citizenship, in which both sides have opposite ideas.
The SPD wants to end the pressure for migrant children born in Germany to opt for one - the Union rejects a double passport.
On the issue of transport, which is not on the agenda on Friday, the SPD supported its no to a car toll requested by the CSU.
A vignette is a "flat rate for multi-driving and therefore ecologically counterproductive," said the SPD negotiator for transport, Florian Pronold, in a letter to his group.
There was a threat of evasive traffic on land roads, which were already accident priorities.
The introduction of a toll for all cars would also only be a first step from the point of view of Pronold.
"There is a danger that the compensation for Germans will be removed at a later date," he said.
Dieter Thomas Kuhn in Stuttgart: The singing hairshaft on the open-air stage
Stuttgart - "When will it be summer again?" was not really the question on Friday evening on the open-air stage Killesberg.
It was truly a tropical night in Stuttgart.
So the best conditions for Schlagerstar Dieter Thomas Kuhn and his band.

Motorists in case of accident seriously injured
In an accident on Thursday evening, a 37-year-old passenger car driver from Aachen was seriously injured.
According to the police, a 41-year-old from Müsch was on her way to Grefrath with her car on the Kempen outer ring at about 9:15 p.m.
When she wanted to turn left onto St. Töniser Street, she overlooked the 37-year-old's adversarial car.
The lorry collided.
The Aachener suffered severe injuries and had to be taken to the hospital for treatment.
Constance: blocking after accident at the Schänzlekreisel
The accident had occurred, according to police, when a 51-year-old driver of a Swiss seat Ibiza drove out of town on the left lane of the two-lane Reichenaustraße on Thursday evening, around 8 pm.
Shortly before the roundabout at Schänzle, he noticed that he was on the left-hand track towards Stromeyersdorfstraße and turned to the right-hand lane.
In this case, there was a collision with the BMW of a 23-year-old constant.
Also damaged was the VW Passat of a 19-year-old behind the BMW.
A total of about 15,000 damage, the police reported.
The road had to be locked during the accident, it continued.
Vienna Airport cancels passenger calls
Mr. Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
In the future, there will be no more throughlings like these at the Vienna-Schwechat airport.
A large part of the speaker transmissions fall away - the noise level is to be reduced so clearly.
Creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the goal of this innovation.
As airport spokesperson Peter Kleemann announced to Radio Wien, Vienna Airport is following an international trend with the cessation of announcements concerning individuals.
For example, airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai are already giving up the noisy calls.
Due to the disappearance of these signals - on average around 200 personal calls by the speakers on one day - it is planned to go quieter at the airport in the future.
"It has also been shown in the experience that these individual transmissions have been relatively little perceived, but at the same time all other information about changed flight journeys or departure times are going down here a bit," Kleemann said in conversation with the radio station.
Highlander-Games at the Kaltenhof
In addition to the tractors, there is a second competition at the farm autumn festival at the Kaltenhof from 6th to 8th September.
On Saturday, September 7, the Highlander Games will start at 1.30 p.m.
Although they have a Scottish tradition, they are in the cold yard Swabian.
Teams and individual fighters measure themselves in the disciplines of throwing tree trunks, throwing horseshoes and wearing water buckets.
The tree trunk is four and a half meters long and has a weight of 25 to 30 kilograms.
"It doesn't go far," explains organizer Peter Saile.
The tribe has to be thrown vertically, once overturned, and then straight to the lie down.
This is assessed with most points.
The target accuracy depends on hooping.
From eight meters away, a peg is thrown.
Skill and strength must be demonstrated by the participants in the water bucket wearer over 50 meters.
Time and water in a bottich are measured at the end.
Two of each "Clan" or team are then allowed to participate in the individual competition.
The winners of the team and individual competition receive prizes.
Trained can be started from 10 a.m.
A suitable dress is desired, for example, the competitors can compete in the Schottenrock.
But also Swabian costume is allowed.
For the "outfit" the jury gives a few more bonus points.
You can log in until one hour before the start of the competition.
With the Scottish-Swabian Highlander-Games and the tractor-pulling, which starts half an hour earlier, a lot of action has been announced on Saturday's festive grounds.
In the evening, the brass music friends will be at their expense.
At 7 p.m., the biraböhmic wind music from Schömberg designs the big entertainment evening.
The chapel plays fast polkas and marches.
However, their repertoire also includes emotional waltzes and a rich big-band sound.
With it will be Heinz Koch, known as the singing host and black sausage baron from Weilen among the rinnen.
In Dornhan he has already appeared at the Christmas market and at the fools' certificate.
On Sunday, the Musikverein Leinstetten will be entertaining the Frühschoppen, starting at 2 p.m., the Böffingen chapel will be a guest, and the "Oldies" will end the festival.
The Stoplacker party with DJ Ralf is already on Friday.
On Saturdays and Sundays, further programme items will include the old-timer and tug meetings, exhibitions by companies on the topic of agriculture and forestry.
Other attractions on Sunday are the corn labyrinth, the craftsman market and the sheep shearing.
Especially for children there is a petting zoo, straw hill castle, tractor riding (under instruction) and tractor surfing.
Organizers are the Förderverein Mürzälthalle, the Ski Club and the tractor friends "Zündkäpsele".
Overview of milk and egg alternatives
Vegan nutrition requires plant alternatives to eggs, milk and dairy products.
Purified tofu with plant cream, for example, is a quark set.
The Vegetarian Federation also calls it the World Vegan Day on 1 November.
On the occasion of the World Vegan Day on 1 November, the Vegetarian Federation of Germany proposes a number of vegan alternatives:
Pure plant margarine is a good alternative to butter, yogurt let soy yogurt replace.
Instead of milk, soy, oat, almond or rice milk could be used.
Precipitable plant cream replaces conventional whipped cream.
There are also plant alternatives to eggs.
Half a crushed, mature banana, for example, can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
Also 50 grams of apple or a tablespoon of ground linseed plus three tablespoons of water are suitable.
Loners become dough instead of egg for example with a mixture of a teaspoon baking powder, a tablespoon of food strength and three tablespoons of mineral water.
But even 50 grams of soy yogurt or silk tofu can fulfill this purpose.
According to the Vebu, some 800,000 people are currently feeding vegans in Germany, i.e. plant-based.
Insomnia in New York
On the way to their host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the students of the Black Forest Gymnasium met the American city of New York.
After eight hours of flight, the Brooklyn Bridge reached the heart of Manhattan on foot.
There was already a fascinating view of the world-famous skyline, which is a special attraction in the evening light.
Due to the time shift the students were almost 24 hours on their legs, but true to the motto "The city does not sleep" the day at Times Square was decided.
Despite shutdown, the second day the Statue of Liberty could be reached with a ferry and climbed on foot.
After that, the financial centre around Wall Street became the memorial of 11 September.
On the third day, the students were able to gain an overview of the fascinatingly large city from the 373 meters high viewing platform of the Empire State Building.
After that, it went through the hectic drive of the New York streets through the Rockefeller Center to Central Park, which provided an ideal opportunity for a short stay in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students have now arrived in their host families and experience the day-to-day school at Weymouth High School.
A Hubertus fair will be celebrated on the name of Saint Hubertus in the parish church of St. Mary on Hülsbergstraße.
St. Hubertus was the sage after a rather ruthless hunter, who was converted by a vision and later appointed Bishop of Liège.
The hunting hornblower group of hunters Westphalia under the direction of Brigitte Kluth is playing on parforce horns (natural horns in the mood Es) after old, originally French melodies.
The blowers wear riding clothes because they mainly accompany riders, horses and dog moose on tugs.
The festive fair will take place on Sunday, 3 November, at 11.30 a.m.
The newly designed storage shines with a new cafe.
One that invites you to stay and come back.
One that wants to make the name a program.
According to Lexikon, a psychological phenomenon is called Déjà Vu, which is expressed in the feeling of having experienced or seen a new situation.
In the event of a visit to the café of the same name at the top in the district town of Kleve in the sight of the University of Rhein-Waal, it does not have to stay with the pure Déjà Vu feeling.
Finally, the café with the beautiful name has exactly that goal: to make an actual stay not only mental, but also to experience it again and again.
Because it's fun and it's just beautiful.
A look at the inner life at Opschlag 8 gives the viewer a good feeling right away.
The state-of-the-art but not cool café atmosphere looks like a place to feel good.
Here, the team with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner spoils the guest at the top with a variety of coffee or cocktail variants.
There are delicious cakes or individually filled fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, have already made a name for themselves before the opening of the charming café on the top as a gastronomy: in Kranenburg they led the "Art Lounge".
From the move to Kleve to the top, the sympathetic café lovers are hoping for more audiences.
Not least through the university.
"Where we don't have a specific target group," emphasizes Daniel Büttner.
Rather, the two young students here want to address as well as seniors and all age classes in between.
Speaking of café lovers.
The sympathetic couple of owners stands behind the coffee pleasure.
Enjoy the fragrant hot brew in various variations themselves.
Expressofan
Daniel Büttner is the Expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt the cappuccino drinker.
"For this, a baguette - this is my thing," she reveals to the NRZ.
There were two events in the bright café.
Better say one.
Because the harbor festival took place outside - the Café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it.
But there was also the ringing evening.
"Beautiful, successful and funny," the two 33-year-olds found.
But not everyone's business.
Perhaps that's why Daniel Büttner is not an extraordinary fan of event evenings: "You can't do it all right now."
And with an event I always address only those who are also interested in the special event.
That's why events will be the exception with us.
"We would like to disturb the normal operation as little as possible."
To say: Déjà Vu also stands for reliability.
With regard to the quality of the products offered here, as well as to the team and the beautiful environment at the storage in Kleve.
The road that is becoming more and more a gastronomy mile.
To the delight of many Klever, the guests from near and far and the students who discover the gas streams and thus also the Café Déjà Vu for themselves.

A day of thank you at the MGV in Dinker
It was the 165th Stiftungfestival to which the MGV "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" had invited this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives, were happy to come.
In the club room of the restaurant "Witteborg" in Dinker everyone enjoyed the harmonious with each other very much in the sign of the music.
Traditionally, the Stiftungfestival is always the appropriate feast to perform honors.
This time, the special award "Singers of the Year" was pleased with the writer Rolf Wagener.
"You not only wrote a lot for us, but also made a lot of rounds for us, for which we thank you very much," said the chairman of the choir Erich Schlotmann.
The awards for participation in the appearances and choir samples by means of activity plots went to the choir director Dieter Schulze with 44 participations this year, followed by the honorary chairman Horst Pier-Ribbert, the chairman himself, and the last year's "Singer of the Year" Friedrich Winkler with 42 participations each.
==References====External links==
A special thank you was addressed by the Board of Directors to the team of Ange Pier-Ribbert, who once again had enchanted a menu of the extra class and to Gerda Pier-Ribbert for the table decoration.
The MGV "Friedrich-Wilhelm" meets for his regular choir samples at 7.45 p.m. on Tuesday.
"We are welcome at all times to hear new singing joys," says Schlotmann.
UN announces new targets to combat poverty
The United Nations is now beginning to develop a number of new objectives to replace the Millennium Development Goals for the fight against poverty, which were announced twelve years ago.
In the run-up to the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began in Rio de Janeiro in the evening, Australian diplomats played a key role in the advance for "Sustainable Development Goals" to replace the 2015 Millennium Goals.
They were included in the final draft document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, at the summit.
The UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the summit in the evening that the time had come for 'thinking beyond national interests'.
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to start a process to agree on universal, sustainable development goals," he said.
“These goals will build on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the post-2015 Framework for Development.
I will not hesitate to implement this mandate given to me by the Member States in order to achieve our vision of the sustainable development goals building on the success of the Millennium Goals."
Even if the SG Achim/Baden has been without a win for four days, the handball superligists continue to have a good mood.
Trainer Tomasz Malmon leaves no doubt about that.
Everyone is still fully motivated in the matter.
Nevertheless, I hope that we will finally win again.
"For I don't know what such a victory tastes like," Malmon expects a success experience from his team at the VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even though the third league reserve from Fredenbeck has not yet torn out any trees, Malmon takes the pointing finger in advance warning.
I've trained many players in the A-youth myself.
That's why they're going to be particularly motivated against their ex-coach.
"In addition, it is important to wait and see if there is any reinforcement from the first," explains the SG-Coach.
In order to finally return to the track of success, the Malmon team must definitely increase in comparison to the past appearances.
Above all in the cover work and during the switching game, it was huge.
The exploitation of opportunities must definitely be improved.
That's why I hope my players finally got their heads off during the short break.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing in the face of conflicts between influential personalities
Thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputos under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder of the state and first President Mozambique to support peace calls at a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace again, we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, Managing Director of an investment company.
For fear of the future of the country, she has exchanged her business clothes for a T-shirt entitled 'We demand security' in Portuguese and on Thursday she joins the crowd on the capital's place of independence.
For two weeks there have been daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, one of the worst fights since the peace agreement over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, initially supported by white Rhodes and later the apartheid government of South Africa in an effort to destabilize the independent government of the country.
After the 1992 Peace Treaty, she became an opposition party.
Analysts think it is unlikely that the country will fall back into an adult conflict, but recent events have troubled foreign investors and locals.
A lot is at stake for the rapidly growing economy, as the discovery of huge gas deposits off the coast and coal camps in the northwest could bring in over $50 billion of investments from companies like Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the USA in the coming years.
The ruling Frelimo party, since 1975 the dominant force, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims that the government provoked the recent clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional castle of Renamos, on 17 October.
The attacks on the former rebels escalated, when government troops attacked Renamo base points and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, said Renamos spokesperson to the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to address concerns about instability.
To AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama considered himself a "lost person" who "will use all his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government".
Both Frelimo and Renamo emphasize that they want to avoid war.
But the concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted with the words, Renamo gives up the 1992 peace agreement.
He explained to the FT that it meant that Frelimo no longer respected the agreement.
"Our vision is to start negotiations again seriously," Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the parties have contributed little to solving the tensions fired by a number of clashes this year.
"We have here two adult men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who hit their heads," says Joseph Hanlon, lecturer at Open University and Mozambique expert.
None of them is good at negotiating and no one is willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who is pressing for election reforms, has already declared that she will boycott the municipal elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as the attempt of a troubling movement to obtain concessions and financial advantages from the government.
Renamos election success has been shrinking since 1992, while a newer party, the Movimento Democrático de Mozambique (MDM), founded by a former Renamo member, is likely to improve in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – whose resignation is due when his second term of office ends next year – wants to destroy the country's democracy.
"He doesn't want a multi-party democracy, he doesn't want a transparent election, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to give up the presidential office," says Mazanga.
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has, but it has made unresting attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important North-South connection.
Most battles took place in the province of Sofala, which is located a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but in which is located Beira, the port, the mining companies like Rio Tinto and Vale to export coal.
In June, Rio interrupted the use of the railway for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the line.
Mazanga replied with caution to the question of whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that things in Mozambique are not good," said Mazanga.
Instability has increased government frustration, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many people have already been worried about corruption, slow progress in development and a recent wave of kidnapping.
"People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and that he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems," he explains.
Omar Sultane, a demonstrator, said that people just wanted stability.
"No one is interested in Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and easy-to-use roads again," he said.
Children should be taught myths and legends as models of life, says one author.
The stories of Thor showed that "brutal power has no chance against clever tricks", and the artus legend demonstrates how important it is to have a dream.
However, many of the myths are "by far too wild, too offensive, and in some cases too dirty to be taught in schools", which is why Crossley-Holland called for a "careful selection" of old-fashioned works.
“I think it’s wonderful that myths and folklore are already part of education in America,” he said.
I've proposed this as a plan for twenty years.
He added that in authors and teachers who were 'excessively didactic', children would be 'completely shut off' because in entertaining stories the messages would be 'understated'.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and is author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, said: "You can pursue certain intentions, but you should keep them in the background as far as possible."
Perhaps the greatest difference between an adult author who writes for adults and an author who writes for children is the need to convey hope.
Not everything needs to be simplified or lead to the happy end, but there is an immanent sense of good and evil.
This must be sublime, revealed by history and not explained.
That's the old story of showing instead of telling.
Hansjakob moves again in Freihof
100 years ago, Heinrich Hansjakob had his age rest in Haslach, and on Sunday, his last years came to life in the "Freishof".
The many spectators were thrilled by the very short-lived play of the scene.
From the arrival to the award of honorary citizenship to his death, scriptwriter and Hansjakob actor Alois Kratzcyk had designed an entertaining piece, which received much praise under the direction of Cornelia Volk.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as a speaker through the ten different scenes, explained connections and bridged leaps of time from the youth to the imminent retirement.
On October 22, 1913, Hansjakob came home to his children's heaven, to his courtyard.
And then the scene game began, in which Alois Krafczyk once again shined in his parade role as the great son of the city.
He made his way to Erich Becherer from Mühlenbache with the twins and "Schwarzwälder Füchsen" (Schwarzwälder Füchsen).
Not only was he received with much applause by the audience, but his sister Philippine also welcomed him.
Billy Sum-Hermann understood it incredibly well to put herself in the sister's role and gave her tremendous life in facials and gestures.
Between the individual playing scenes, the Mühlenbachenbach Farmer's Chapel played appropriately selected pieces of music and thus completed the performance.
At the award of honorary citizenship, Haslach's mayor Heinz Winkler gave the honour, who, in the presence of the then official owner of Hättich, made his expectation along with a part of the city council.
The three-King Singers who led Hansjakob to the exclamation made her wait: "Ah, beautiful, young people's memories of my own three-king age will come back to life."
With their song "O Jeslein" they enjoyed the audience in the open yard as well as the stork day children with their loud "Out, Out".
At the time, Hansjakob expressed his criticism of the official church as much as his concerns about the outgrowths in agriculture, the consequences of industrialization or the effects of war.
In the homeland, behind his tomb chapel on the fire at Hofstetten, he found his resting place.
"A restless mind had finally found its peace and had gone home forever," it was said at the end of the play.
Many applause and many praises were given by the audience for the performance.
Basketball: The Hope of the Neckar Giant Grows
The chances for the league stay of the sporty downhill Ludwigsburger Bundesliga basketball players have increased.
Because if there is a wild card procedure, then for the Neckar Giants there is now a competitor less.
The Hamburg Towers Basketball Project does not apply for a possible backyard.
"We will not participate in the Wildcard procedure," said former national player Pascal Roller, who has been drawing up the concept for a professional club in Hanseatic City since 2012.
A first breathing was still not to be heard from Ludwigsburg.
"We did not deal with the Wildcard procedure until it was established that Düsseldorf was not licensed," said Neckar-Riesen-Boss Alexander Reil of our newspaper.
By 23 May, Aufsteiger Düsseldorf Baskets can still submit documents to the arbitration court and prove its economic Bundesliga capability.
To date, however, the license has been refused to the Rhine countries twice.
The arbitration court is the last instance.
Haigerloch: Supper Church at the Focus
As a contribution of the city to the 150th anniversary of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch, the city's cultural and tourism office is dedicated to the last of its public themes this year on Sunday, 27 October, the Evening Meal Church.
After the visit of the Atomkeller Museum, the Haigerloch time is to be considered after 1850 when Haigerloch came under Prussian rule.
The crowning end point is a visit to the Evening Meal Church.
There, the leaders get the story of the building of the church told and gain insights into the development of the evangelical community in a Catholic area.
Last but not least, the view of the evening meal created by Friedrich Schüz with the support of Walter Kröll and Georg Halbritter also falls in the church.
It is an original reproduction of the famous Milan model of Leonardo da Vinci.
Meeting point for the other half-hour guided tour is at 3 pm at the Atomkeller-Museum.
Maps are available at the cash register of the Atomic Cellar Museum.
For questions and information, the tourist office of the city of Haigerloch is available.
Snowden could also say in Russia
The former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in the U.S. Spähfaar in his Russian asylum.
Representatives of the Federal State Prosecutor's Office could either ask in writing questions or meet the 30-year-old in Russia personally.
This was reported by the Interfax agency, calling on non-recognised stakeholders who were familiar with the situation.
Such a question could be resolved in the interstate, it said.
An exit of Snowden from Russia is practically excluded.
"In this case, he loses his refugee status," the agency quoted her source.
Because Germany is an ally of the USA, Snowden threatens to extradition there, it went on to say
Long breath makes itself paid
Six men's teams fought for the title at the club's tennis tournament.
In the end, the endurance of the team Maier/Bronner decided the last match.
The tennis department of the Sportfreunde Rohrdorf had received a dream weather for the tournament of local clubs and friends.
The fun at the tennis game was in the foreground of the tournament.
There were five games per team on the plan, each playing against each.
It was played in double mode with a long set of up to nine points or a maximum of 45 minutes duration.
Anja Schlichter heads the tournament
The tournament led by Anja Schlichter was supported by Carmen Müller and Inga Kronemeyer.
After the first three games and a lunch break with pasta, the tournament went into the decisive phase.
The favourites Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner were equal to Michael Klippel and Sadmin Osmicic (both teams of the SG Rohrweiler), so that the last two matches had to make the decision.
During the award ceremony Carmen Müller was finally able to pass the hiking cup to Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner, who had the longest breath on the finish line.
The second place was the double Michael Klippel/Sadmin Osmic.
The bronze staircase reached Rainer and Bernd Maier of the team Asphaltriecher.
At late afternoon sun and coffee and cake the successful finish of the tournament took place.
On the last weekend of August, the Schwarzwälder Freilichtmuseum Vogtsbauernhof in Gutach near Hornberg is once again firmly in children's hands.
Traditionally, the museum welcomes visitors on Saturdays and Sundays, 24 and 25 August, as part of the summer holiday program, to a colorful children's and family festival with numerous co-mach events and events.
"Size and small can learn various old crafts on both days," says the press release.
Whether making soap, turning candles, felting or making ropes, the right thing for any age is there.
The children are assisted by regional craftsmen from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.
The museum workshop also works.
In the construction of cuckoo pipes, water wheels or circles, young guests can demonstrate their craftsmanship.
A lot of fun also promises the many old games, such as wheel car racing or stilt running.
Speed and coordination are in demand here.
For all small detectives, the open-air museum offers a mystery tour of the museum on Saturdays and Sundays, at 12 a.m. and 2 p.m.
On a tour of the terrain, children have to guess which stories correspond to the truth or are still lying.
In addition, visitors have the special opportunity to get to know the open-air museum during a carriage ride with Black Forest foxes.
Not only horses, but also many other animals, such as sheep, goats, cows and chickens, can be found and marveled at on the grounds.
In addition, all children can look forward to the Clown Otsch on Sunday, who is driving his Schabernack with the museum guests from 11 a.m.
In the meantime, it's nice and fairytale with Hermann Büttner.
The narrator takes the little guests to the wonderful world of fairy tales at 11, 13 and 3 o'clock.
In addition, the children's dance group from Gutach will perform traditional dances at 11.30 a.m.
Furthermore, on both days of the event from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., numerous craftsmen such as the broom, the nearer, the spider, the weaver and the baker can be seen over the shoulder in their traditional work.
Until the end of the summer holidays in Baden-Württemberg, visitors to the open-air museum expect a varied holiday programme.
In a small town in New Zealand, Burt Muro is considered a lovable Kauz, because he has done his motorcycle, built in 1920, to participate in a race in America.
In spite of a heart failure, Burt is not to be dissuaded from his dream.
With his savings, a few donations and a mortgage on his old workshop sheds, he transfers to Los Angeles by ship.
After the film there is coffee, tea and cake.
Schrilles beeping disturbs residents
Rhenus Midgard also invested heavily in land.
They distribute the coal coming from the ships to the neck.
The company has several irons in the fire at its location.
In addition to the coal import, Rhenus Midgard relies among other things on wind turbine logistics.
Black shimmers the coal on the storage area in front of the dike.
Two huge blue semi-trailers and rechargers distribute or load the coal here as needed.
With every movement of the envelopes a shrill warning sounds over the terrain.
"The signals serve security and are required by law," says Matthias Schrell, Managing Director of the Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
Unfortunately, in the event of unfavorable wind, this can be heard far - and so there have already been some complaints from people from the north of the city.
He takes the actions very seriously and has therefore contacted those concerned, says the 40-year-old.
In close consultation with the authorities, it is now possible to keep the warning signals quieter with technical measures.
In the future, it will continue to be able to engage in open dialogue with its neighbours.
Matthias Schrell has a lot to do at the site.
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony Bridge Rhenus Midgard continues to rely on coal imports for power plants and is one of the largest in Europe in this sector.
Thanks to its 18.5-metre-deeped bed tub shape terminal, Capesize-Bulkcarriers can be processed here for a long time.
"This year, we want to crack the 3-million-tonne brand in the envelope," says Schrell.
In addition to the Eon power plant on site, the import coal goes to domestic power plants.
If the GDF Suez power plant continues to operate, a good 5 million tonnes of coal imports per year would be realistic.
The three ship dischargers on the bridge as well as the second conveyor could create up to 10 million.
Bavaria Basketballer optimistic despite first defeat
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague could not reduce the enormous optimism of the basketball players of FC Bayern München.
"No one can forbid us to believe in winning against the best team in Europe in the past two years," said Bavaria-Coach Svetislav Pesic after the unfortunate 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday night at the title defender Olympiakos Piraeus.
We sent the message: Basketball exists in Munich too!
In their first third appearance in the European king class, the Munichers sold very well for a long time, but were simply not clear enough in the crucial phases.
The guests initially managed to convert a 15-point residue into a guided tour 13 minutes before the end, before Piraeus gave the game another turn.
"We fought back against the double Euroleague champion, but then again made frivolous mistakes," said Bavaria-Profi Yassin Idbihi.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful pitchers of the Munichs who had won clear victories in the first two games against the Italian production champion Montepaschi Siena and the Polish title winner Zielona Góra.
Ben Greenman: Ten Years New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It could be said that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: almost a hundred years ago, the variety artist Frank Fay, who worked as a Conférencier at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, started telling the crowd of jokes in the form of a conversation.
Over the years, Fay's innovation has been expanded, as was the last time at the New York Comedy Festival.
Launched and directed by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the stand-up institute Carolines, the festival celebrates its 10th anniversary this year with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres.
"Most of these headliners started with Carolines and then became more and more successful until they were too well known at some point to perform in a club," said Hirsch.
We have designed this festival so that we can continue to work with them.
This year's event features Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as stand-up for Heroes, an annual music and comedy benefit event for army veterans at Madison Square Garden, where Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby will be featured.
The world of comedy has also grown with the festival.
A number of the comedians who are participating in the festival this year have become known through rather unconventional channels, such as television shows on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll became familiar with a sitcom on cable television (the ironic-slip fantasy football series "The League" on FXX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the line-up for "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation", although she is best known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic theme focused on race themes W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the festival's biggest visitor magnets is an interview: David Steinberg talks to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but has become a respected television and film director and an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007 he moderated a television show entitled "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" with TV Land.
The meeting takes place in the town hall in the middle of Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry's entire work," said Steinberg.
He told me when he's here, sometimes he goes through the alley between two buildings and thinks: Hey, if I lose all my money, I might live here.
Iran Satisfied With Process of Nuclear Negotiations
Iran shows itself satisfied with the negotiation process one week before the next nuclear meeting with the five UN-Vetomachten and Germany.
"After years, we now have an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Authority to resolve the differences of the last years," wrote Foreign Minister Mohammed Jawad Sarif on his Facebook page.
It would still be a long way to go, but the nuclear chief negotiator is satisfied with the negotiation process and is also optimistic that both sides will come to a solution at the end.
Drama in Uruguay: Boys kill game combards with Machete
Two children have committed the murder of an 11-year-old in Uruguay.
The two 14 - and - 12 - year - old boys had invited their victims to go with them on bird hunting.
Armed with machetes and knives, they watched the 11-year-old on Tuesday and threw the body into a well, the newspaper "El País" reported on Thursday.
Afterwards they would have played football in front of their homes in a workers' district.
The body was found the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometers north of the exclusive beach town of Punta del Este.
As an alibi, a five - year - old half-sister of the disciple they had taken with her was supposed to say that she had been sexually attacked by the boy.
But when the girl described the Tathergang before the police without mentioning an attack against her, the two boys admitted the intentional killing of the 11-year-old.
As a reason, the elder mentioned, among other things, a rival in the football game.
He was sent to a psychiatric youth centre for the time being.
Penitent must go to prison.
Because of exploitable trafficking in human beings, incarceration, threat, insult and dangerous physical injury, the Landgericht Konstanz sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years in prison.
The former Bundeswehr soldier, who worked as a doorkeeper after two operations in Afghanistan, made a confession as part of a process agreement.
Thus, in five cases he met women via Internet or telephone contacts, which he sent to the line after a few weeks against their will.
He used resistance to break with violence and threats.
He retained the income of women who had acquired him for some years.
By confiscating mobile phones and SIM cards, he undercut women's contacts with the outside world.
Together with a colleague who taught the women, he brought them to various brothels in the southwest.
There he had some of them monitored to control their revenue.
In court, the defendant first claimed that he suffered a severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan died alongside him in an explosion.
After a psychiatric expert expressed great doubts about the psychological restriction and thus reduced debt, the 33-year-old made a comprehensive confession.
The court didn't have to hear any more of the injured women.
According to one Kripo official, at least four further cases of exploitable trafficking could be identified after a first display by telephone monitoring measures.
The talks heard had been marked by high aggression.
Later on, the injured would have confirmed their martyrdom.
Another witness, with one of the women all over the body discovering blue spots, had not made a statement to this day.
It deals with "a completely broken personality", which views violence and exploitation in this meteor as normal.
The defendant regretted his behavior yesterday.
"He has disbanded himself from these circles and wants to live a normal life after imprisonment," he said.
Oil price goes down to 96 USD per barrel
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday, after concerns about a high supply overshadowed a report that the energy-hungry manufacturing sector of China is growing.
The reference crude oil for deliveries in December fell in the late morning in Europe in electronic commerce at the New York Mercantile Exchange by 14 cents to $96.24 per barrel.
The contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a price decline of 5.8 percent in October.
The large supply of crude oil has burdened prices over the past few weeks.
The US Department of Energy stated on Wednesday that the US offer had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over the course of five weeks, the offer had increased by 25 million barrels.
On Friday, however, there were indications of stronger demand through two reports of increased activity in Chinese manufacturing.
This indicates a continued recovery in the economy of China, with growth rising to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after the lowest level in the previous quarter for two decades.
Crude oil from the Brent variety, a reference value for international crude oil, which is also used by US refineries, fell at ICE Exchange in London by 26 cents to 108.58 USD per barrel.
Court blocks decision on NYPD's Stop-and-Frisk Directive
On Thursday, a federal court of appeal in the United States blocked the order of a judge who had requested changes to the stop-and-frosk program ("Students and Browse") of the New York Police Department, and dismissed the judge from the case.
The second U.S. Supreme Court stated that the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin would be suspended until an appeal of the city had been decided.
The judge had ruled in August that the city was in violation of the constitution with the way in which the programme for the detention and questioning of persons was implemented.
The city appealed against its assessment and the ordered remedies, including the decision to set up a monitoring body to assist the police in amending their directive and the relevant training programme.
The appeal court heard on Tuesday the arguments for the required suspension.
The appeal report stated that the judge had to be released from the case because she had violated the code of conduct for US judges by establishing that a judge should avoid the appearance of partiality; this was partly justified by a number of media interviews and public reasons in which she had publicly responded to the criticism of the court.
The judge had judged that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people, because they targeted illegitimately black and Latin American men with the Stop-and-Frisk program.
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of substantial changes, including reforms in directives, training and service supervision, and set up a pilot programme with cameras carried on the body in quarters where most of the controls were carried out.
In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of storing names and addresses of persons released after police control.
An oral hearing on the City's appeal is scheduled after 14 March 2014.
The Stop-and-Frisk tactics were criticized by a number of civil rights defenders.
Controls of this kind have been in various forms for decades, but the number of checks recorded during the term of office of the non-partisan mayor Michael Bloomberg increased to an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011, most of them black and Latin American men.
In 2004, four men belonging to all minorities filed a complaint, which developed into a collective complaint.
Supporters of changes to the NYPD Stop-and-Frisk programme say that the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and effective police force and influence the way other police presidents use the regulation.
Opponents believe that the changes would dampen the morale of the police, but not the crime; even money would be wasted and the broader problem of a police force would not be solved, which after the disappearance of thousands of jobs in the last decade is under pressure.
The judge pointed out that she did not end the stop-and-fresh practice, which was constitutional, but only reform the way the NYPD implements the controls.
The happiness of the dreaming camels
Happiness is an oasis that can only achieve dreaming camels
With this Bedouin wisdom, the first chairman Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the association "Helfende Hande".
On Saturday afternoon the tenth birthday of the club was celebrated, which can already have considerable successes.
The first chairman, Mr. Henne, reported in detail on the work of the association.
He himself was in Mauritania for the first time in 2004 at the Cheijk-Zajed Hospital in Nouakchott.
As a result, a further cooperation developed, and the gynaecologist Henne performed numerous operations on several trips on the spot.
During the speeches, pictures of the deployments were shown on a large screen so that the guests of the anniversary event could take a picture of the mentioned actions.
The association's desert vehicle was also shown.
It is a former German border protection vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former OB of Nagold, had proposed to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and is now planning to work with the association in advisory function, according to Henne.
In 2008, Zimmerei Schleeh from Baiersbronn created the hospital in Socogim, a misery quarter on the outskirts of the capital in the record time of just under a week.
Henne also mentioned a new Mother-Child Hospital in Nouakchott
Especially interesting in times when the birth clinic is to be rationalized in Nagold.
You learn a lot in Africa as a physician, hen, for example, deceleration against burn-out.
Due to the political unrest in the country, it was not possible to make as many trips as planned, but many physicians came to Germany for this purpose to visit in various areas.
In addition, containers are regularly sent to Africa with materials, such as medical equipment, medications, bandages, hospital beds and glasses in March of this year.
Co-initiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself provided a lot of local coloring by telling of Mercedes vehicles converted to the mobile goat's stable from Mauritania and describing the experiences of the local musicians, who traditionally supported the association, during their Mauritanian journey.
As his personal motivations, he called his work in the field of auditing as a young Member.
When he realized how much money was lost on the move, he decided to help the Africans control a budget by the people.
Fuchtel also stressed that global economy also demands global human love.
It should not be forgotten that Africa is closer than some think.
From Gran Canaria it is not far to Africa.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a tip
The former news of the Word editor Andy Coulson reportedly used "telephone hacking, surveillance and confrontation" in an attempt to confirm a wrong hint about an affair of the then Interior Minister Charles Clarke.
In May 2005, prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the Court of Justice in the Old Bailey that Clarke had a false rumor that he had a relationship with his "attractive special adviser" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper commissioned the private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlby's voice emails, and persecuted them, but Coulson also called them and left news, as the court heard.
"In the public prosecutor's opinion, Coulson, who is now editor of NotW, is no one who stands in front of people's homes and hopes to catch up on a fresh act, but one who likes to face a story to see their reaction," said Edis.
He said NotW uses three methods to investigatively research stories: phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The publisher is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously he knows about the second, the surveillance, otherwise it can't be.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He disagrees, but we say, "And if he knew about it."
Rumors about an affair Clarkes were first taken up by NotW's feature editor when a source sexually interested in Pawlby was said: "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles."
A band with voicemails from her phone of at least three occasions was ensured in August 2006 in Mulcaire's apartment.
The investigators also found entries on the detective's computer where Pawlby and her sister were stored as "projects".
During the time the research ran, the grandparents of Pawlby received anonymous calls asking them for information about them, Edis explained.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup supervised Pawlby's movements.
On 18 June 2005, Coulson left her a voice mail with the following content: "I have a story that we want to release tomorrow, about which I would like to talk to Charles."
Edis explained that Coulson's activities in this story followed the same pattern as other important personalities, such as former Interior Minister David Blonkett.
On Thursday, the jury members heard that Coulson Blunkett had faced a married woman because of an affair when he himself was lying with the fellow defendant Rebekah Brooks, who had been married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks argue to have conspired with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted the phone hacking.
In protest against the planned rich tax, the French football will actually pass the first strike since 1972.
A conciliation meeting ends without results.
In the conflict over the rich tax, the government and the professional football team in France have maneuvered into a dead end after a failed conciliation meeting.
President François Hollande received the association and association representatives at the Élysée Palace in Paris on Thursday and also heard their complaints.
However, he refused to spare the football from the planned 75 percent tax on income of more than one million euros a year, which all companies of the country are to pay for two years from 2014.
The opposite side also remained hard.
The strike announced for the end of November will now also be carried out, the chief association of the professional clubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel, announced.
The days of play in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 between 29 November and 2 December are therefore not available.
Gehingen: No absolute protection possible
"We want to involve the inhabitants in planning early," said Mayor Jens Häussler, opening the citizens' information event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
Around 80 participants had come to the municipal hall to explain the planned measures, ask questions, express concerns and introduce ideas.
Häussler made it clear: "The final decisions are made by the members of the municipal council".
The floods, which Gechingen met unprepared on May 15, 2009, had been a penetrating event that raised the question of protective measures for the future, says Häussler.
A river area investigation was commissioned with the neighbouring community of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
"The protection of as many plots as possible is the goal," says Häussler.
According to the German Weather Service, the planning of protection is based on statistically expected floods every 100 years.
Climate change is taken into account by a 15 % surcharge.
In specialist circles this is referred to as "HQ 100aClimate".
The water masses, which had caused considerable damage in Geching in 2009, were equivalent to a 1000-year-old flood.
"There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement," says Häussler.
In order to achieve the protection of HQ 100aClimate, around four million euros must be invested in Gechingen, with the municipality expecting state subsidies of around 70 percent.
However, Häßler pointed out that there was only support if an overall approach was implemented.
To this end, the community is dependent on the participation of citizens.
An elaborate planning and approval procedure must be completed.
In the best case, the implementation could be started in 2016.
Among other things, the protection concept already presented in the municipal council last week (we reported) provides for local measures in the inflow of the river Irm from the Stammheimer Tal.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, the participants took advantage of the opportunity to raise their concerns.
Among other things, it was questioned why dams and reservoirs were no longer planned to protect the place.
Gregor Kühn, specialist planner of the commissioned engineering office Wald and Corbe from Hillheim, who presented the concept, stressed that it needed the interaction of all the measures presented to achieve the desired goal in total.
In addition, the most economical solution was to be found, says Joachim Wald von Wald and Corbe.
Unhappiness has been experienced by those in the old town who, even in the case of normal thunderstorms, have repeatedly suffered from an overload of the canal network.
The problem is known to the administration and initial measures have already been taken.
However, Häßler pointed out that the directives for sewer systems are different from those for flood protection and should not be mixed.
The municipality is obliged to interpret the canal network in such a way that two to three years of rain events can be handled.
To dimension the wastewater channels larger would devour millions.
Heavily injured after collision
In the early Friday afternoon, two drivers were seriously injured at the State Road 44 near Revensdorf in a frontal collision.
The police immediately blocked the road completely, but at first there was little to say about the accident.
However, there are several witness statements that should be evaluated.
It is clear that the 19-year-old guide of a VW Golf drove towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf met her with his Hyundai.
Both vehicles collided, the woman being so badly clamped that the fire brigade took about half an hour to free her from the wreck of the vehicle.
The actual cause of the accident remained unexplained at first.
Both accidents came to nearby hospitals.
The route remained fully closed for about two hours.
He could be called the Dostoyevsky of the USA.
Philip K. Dick was a godseeker, a metaphysicist, his novels and stories also have something serial.
Amazingly the kinship in the outside: the stinging eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And just as Fjodor M. Dostoyevski and his massive oeuvre can be understood as the founder and apologist of the Russian soul, Philip K. Dick is read as an American prophet who is quite valid in his own country.
Some titles have been published in the Heyne publishing house, the Haffmans cassette with the 118 stories distributes two thousand ones.
Dick explains America - the realm of breathtaking technical progress, paired with paranoia, security and belief to be chosen.
Dick had God's experiences, his late books read like a mixture of the revelation of John and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy, had drugs added to his brain.
He got it, early on, that the computers are divinities.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what distinguishes a man from a machine, the Creator from his creature.
That's the "Blade Runner" problem.
Killing.
A master of science fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories inspired film directors like Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is now particularly significant.
The "minority report" dates back to 1956, it flows the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribunal.
Here the principle of "pre-crime" is developed, "pre-crime", i.e. what is now more or less official doctrine of the White House.
In Dick's world, which resembles ours terrifying, mutants look to the future - and the police are attacking.
"We capture individuals who have not violated any law," says the head of the authority.
"We'll catch them before they can commit a crime of violence."
And: "In our society there are no serious criminals, for that we have a criminal camp full of Pe sudo criminals." They read streams of time.
They assume that evil is happening, and prevent the criminal thought from actually being implemented.
Dick's story acts like the blueprint for the anti-terror laws and the listening noise of the NSA.
Anticipation of the attack: Obama's drone philosophy and practice also works.
But Dick's story is not over yet.
The chief of police complains that there is no longer a division of violence, the military controls everyday life - and what is left of the state.
Then the monitor itself is monitored and transferred to a future crime.
The system is running.
It's perfect, but it's lying.
It invents its own conditions.
Not only do mistakes and sacrifices buy, but they build upon them.
The system creates the danger it fights.
Reading Philip K. Dick means getting closer to the truth again and again.
Spähaffaar um Merkel in Russia
The former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in the U.S.-sprayer about Chancellor Angela Merkel in his Russian asylum.
Representatives of the German Federal Procuratorate could either ask in writing questions or meet the 30-year-old in Russia personally, the Interfax agency reported.
Previously, Green-Bundestag member Hans-Christian Ströbele had met yesterday as the first German politician Snowden in Moscow to talk to him about the affair.
NSA revelations strengthen company paranoia due to state surveillance
On a mild day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew deep across the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt am Main, Germany's capital of finance.
At the direction of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection and Counter-Terrorism (BVT), the German Home Secret Service, he should photograph the roof of the U.S. Outpost, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
According to German media, the BVT wanted to demonstrate the presence of surveillance antennas and the action led to an exchange of words between the US and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Clapper, U.S. Director of National Intelligence, once again insisted in September that the U.S. did not use the possibilities of foreign espionage to "steal the business secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or profits."
However, since Edward Snowden, the former Whistleblower employee, began publishing his full-horn on US surveillance secrets, European governments and corporate leaders are no longer sure if they can take the lead.
Reports, according to which the American National Security Agency spyed out the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and acquired data from American cloud providers including Google and Yahoo, have brought the company paranoia to a new peak because of state supervision.
The barrel to overflow brought the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone was bent, possibly for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be seen, then certainly business leaders are potential targets.
Snowden has made the intensive cooperation between US secret services and companies transparent.
I think it is possible that these data will be used for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up," explains Oliver Grün, President of BITMi, representing small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe that the US now poses an almost as great a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published by the consultant EY in July.
However, there was no evidence in Snowden's documents that the US has passed on the business secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacked certain IT and Internet possibilities and should reduce its dependence on the USA.
The companies are skeptical about this.
In the Bundestag it was proposed that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
"That's not how it works," says Hasso Plattner, Chairman of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If you wanted a strong European IT industry, you should not have let it die out 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal to cars to agriculture.
Everything except the IT industry.
Nevertheless, reach and technical refinement of US espionage agencies discovered by the Snowden revelations have shocked companies that had previously seen the greatest espionage risk in China.
Cloud Computing is a major change because European managers are now more aware that data stored in the US are subject to the case law and are therefore potentially at risk.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trading institution, about ten percent of the non-US-based members rejected the revelations about US-American data mining activities with Prism to use an American provider.
Jim Snabe, Deputy Managing Director of SAP, says: "We see a new question from customers who didn't exist a year ago – it says: Where are my data stored and can you guarantee that they stay physically in this jurisdiction?"
Many German corporate managers believe that the recent reports simply confirm what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and therefore need to be guarded at all costs.
That economic espionage takes place is not surprising.
It's always been like that.
"It has been a topic for many years and has not changed fundamentally due to the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, chairman of the chemical company BASF.
The Americans are spying on us at commercial and industrial level, just as we are doing, because it is in the national interest to defend our companies.
Business management usually does not boast of the countermeasures taken, because this brings benefits to attackers.
In large companies, employees have long been told that taking a free USB stick at a trade fair or the unattended reclining of a laptop in the hotel room is not advisable.
Ulrich Hackenberk, member of the Board of Management at car manufacturers Audi, says that it has been a standard practice for years to collect mobile phones before a board meeting so that they cannot be used as hearing aids.
The German BVT advises executives to use simple prepaid phones when travelling abroad, because smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid phones are thrown away afterwards.
However, there is a concern that small and medium-sized enterprises will remain vulnerable to hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in the niche.
"Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets from unauthorized access", warns the BAT in a report.
The US warns its own companies against economic espionage by other countries.
According to Washington Post, in February France, Russia and Israel behind China, two of the countries used to purchase economic data from hacking were classified in the US National Intelligence Estimates.
A member of the Executive Board of a German Blue Chip company agreed when it comes to economic espionage, then "the French are the worst".
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French indoor secret service DCRL, was quoted this month in an interview with the following words: "The intelligence services know very well that all countries, even if they work together in the fight against terror, spy out their allies."
Hechingen: Messe gives an answer to wedding questions
"Marriage is the most important journey of discovery that man can make," said the philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
Tips, as at least the wedding party succeeds, now gave a special fair in the domain in Hechingen.
Representatives were important providers around a wedding.
A trend: The retro look has taken hold again.
That starts with wedding clothes.
White is must, best covered or in cream.
At the front, the often smelled clothes are closed with embroidery, often with a veil, on the other hand, they go down their backs and often end up in a tug.
However, as Stefanie Koch emphasizes from the fashion house Kleidemüller, the spirits separate.
In men the suit dominates with vest and plastron, but also cream or brown combinations can be chosen.
It is important to select the local, it has been explained.
Jewelless side rooms are not ideal, the ambience should be special.
Here the domain drew attention to its own offer in the remise.
If you want to get ahead with the carriage, Uwe Link has an offer for him.
"Cutting is also popular for young cellins," he says.
Romanticism is also required for invitation cards, flower arrangements and also for wedding pictures.
More and more the "After-Wedding-Photo" is coming in fashion - i.e. photo series in special places, preferably waterfalls, a few days after the festival, but in wedding clothes, explained Elisabeth Keidel.
Many more details of a successful wedding were presented on Sunday in the domain.
Flower arrangement, rings, wedding table, cakes and also a sorcerer, such as Marko Ripperger, who can entertain guests stylishly.
Not to mention the right cosmetics and nail care.
Everything for an unforgettable celebration.
Dog Friends Successful
For the time being, the athletes of the dog friends Bitz were successful on a Rally-Obedience tournament.
Achim Scherrenbacher started in Candel with two dogs; with his bitch Sandy he scored 94 points in the beginner class and secured fifth place, and with the 15-month-old Marley he put it at 87 points in 12th place.
With her Woody in Class 1, Susi Höpp presented himself with the critical views of the performance judge.
Parents of a teenager from Georgia who died in a tragic accident believe in murder
The teen's parents, whose body was found in a rolled ringer mat in the gymnasium of his high school, are convinced that their son was murdered, said the family's lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in the U.S. state of Georgia was found on 11 January in an upright mat standing behind the gallery in the school gym.
The officers of the Sheriff of Lowndes County concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, which the family of the 17-year-old doubted however.
"They are convinced that their son was murdered," said Benjamin Crimp, Kenneth's lawyer and Jacquelyn Johnson, to FoxNews.com.
You never believed he died as the sheriff had concluded.
"They believe that it is unnecessary for any logic to violate the laws of physics as well as common sense," says Crimp.
Rather, they are convinced that the truth is covered up to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
"Your son went to school to learn and came back in the body bag," he comments.
On Thursday, U.S. state attorney Michael Moore said there would be a formal investigation into Johnson's death, as a number of important questions were still unexplained.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death due to a crime?
Moore explained this at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts in whatever direction they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I believe that there is a sufficient basis for formal investigation," he said.
Moore explained to reporters that the initial autopsy indicated that Johnson had died from the consequences of "position-related suffocation".
A second autopsy, however, had another cause of death, said Moore.
"There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if there was sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he would order the FBI to carry out the investigations.
A representative of the County Sheriff's authority was not ready to comment immediately on our request on Thursday.
A court in the south of Georgia ordered on Wednesday that the authorities release all surveillance videos that have been reviewed by the authorities.
The teenager's parents said they hoped that the video records contained indications of how he died.
CDC release Allergy Guidelines for Schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a series of guidelines for dealing with food allergies from children in schools.
These are the first such directives issued by the U.S. Government, as the number of school-based children with food allergies is increasing.
One of 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy.
According to CDC, the spread of food allergies among children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines contain information for schools to raise awareness of food allergies in the teacher body and staff and how to deal with children who show allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have epinephrine in stock – the EpiPen auto-injection is most commonly used – in order to be able to cope with potentially fatal hypersensitivity reactions.
The lawmakers in the federal states have recently changed the rules so that schools can keep Epinephrin in stock more easily.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms called children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, 'It feels as if something is pressing on my tongue', 'My tongue feels as if a hair is on it' or 'My tongue is shriveling'.
Parents of intersexual children can choose "gender indebtedness"
Germany is the first European nation in which a third sex is recognized for children born with unclear genitals.
Newborns are no longer assigned rigid male or female.
Under the new law, parents no longer have to declare sex for such children, but they can indicate 'undetermined' or 'undetermined' on the birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to take the pressure of parents so that they do not have to make hasty decisions regarding operations for sex allocation in newborns and to combat discrimination against intersexual people.
According to BBC years later, an intersexual person said, "I am neither man nor woman."
I remain mutilated and mutilated with the flickwork created by doctors.
It is estimated that one of 2,000 children is not born every year either as a boy or as a girl.
They are among the intersexuals, a group covered by the diagnosis "sexual differentiation disorder" (DSD), a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, germ glands (ovaries or testicles) or unusually developed genitals.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersexual.
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the US recommend using the best available information on gender allocation if a determination is not possible, and not waiting for the psychological and physical development of the child before choosing, if at all, an operation.
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who has specialized in the problem of gender identification, said that the new German law "sounds after a good thing".
Intersexual children are an ethical dilemma.
"Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgical surgery, but most children do not," he said.
You could do a sex assignment without surgery and then wait for the identity to develop.
The scientific data on how a child develops his sexual identity at all are not very accurate.
No one knows why it happens.
It's like the secret why people are homosexual.
A 2011 report to the European Commission states that intersexual people are to be distinguished from transsexual or transgender persons, because their status is not related to gender but is due to their biological constitution, which is neither male nor female, but typically both at the same time or not clearly defined as one of them.
These characteristics were reflected in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature, priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination that intersexual and transgender people face in their working lives, as well as the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice crime.
Boys not consistent with the gender image now have a special camp.
In Australia and Nepal, it is now possible for adults to indicate on official documents male, female or "third sex".
In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as the world's first "sexless" person after a court had granted the life-long maintenance of a "undetermined" sexual status.
In addition to M and W, German ID cards will have a third assignment, X for intersexual, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news release on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French members of the strict Catholic country signed a petition to remove the "gender theory" from schoolbooks.
The American Catholic Online website has also opposed German law, on the grounds that "if the world is torn into a new state where the sex is a decision, but not sexual activity, then we are twisting two more pillars of civilization."
The mother of a newborn from Maryland told Baby Zone that she found it better to assign babies to a gender at birth.
"Parent life is already stressful enough without further restrictions, especially if you don't know the sex of your own child," the parent website said.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children who were born with both male and female sexes were referred to as Hermaphrodites, according to the attractive Greek God who had both sexes.
Ten years ago, medicine considered the sex to be something that could be eliminated and then rebuilt.
In the meantime, however, the ethical foundations of an operation are doubted, after it is now known how complex the gender identity is, and that doctors can also lie wrong, because they do not know how the child feels when growing up with the gender assigned by them.
“In the middle of the 20th century, this was called a ‘psychiatric emergency’,” said Drescher.
When such a child was born, it was called, not the psychiatrist, but the surgeon.
The prevailing theory of the treatment of children with unclear genitals goes back to Dr. John Money from Johns Hopkins University, who believed that the gender is transformable.
He coined the term "sexual identity" and argued social and environmental advances – as parents raise a child – interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and influenced whether a person considered himself male or female.
But in a case known as "John/Joan" from 1966, his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been separated from the child at a pummeled circumcision to castrate the child completely and also remove his testicles and then raise him as a girl.
"Money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation, but it was not," Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15, he moved back to the male sex and married a woman.
But when he was 38, he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
But in the 1990s, with the entry of the Internet, survivors of these sex operations came to the public, which are 'not happy with the result'.
For example, with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana, who was born with XY-male chromosomes, but ambiguous genitals.
The doctors were not clear about whether he had a great clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a "satisfying life" as a man.
So his external organ and testicles were surgically removed shortly after the birth of 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, he received female hormones.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he told ABCNews.com
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he should be given a vaginal plastic.
But since he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he demanded his medical records.
What he found out was shocking.
I was sterilized at my birth – and nobody ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD through which his body could not produce enough testosterone to develop the genitals.
After learning the truth, he moved back to the male identity, received testosterone injections, and had his breast removed.
The operation has made him barren.
Today, he fights for others in an organization called Interface Project to see intersexual people perceived as normal.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, Managing Director of the California-based Advocates for Informed Choice Legal Group, ensures that German law can "encourage stamping and stigmatizing".
“Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and assign a ‘not defined’ to the child,” she said.
We're afraid that will favour intervention.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait.
But we still do not know how the law will affect, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said their organization supports the Australian law, because "adults can be recognized as a third sex".
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal gender," she said.
The German law is about the assignment at birth.
This is not a fight to force little children to do so at that time.
When they grow up, they can decide for themselves on their bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baraitz, a breast radiologist from Pittsburg, who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says the German law "admissible" both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Sharitz, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgen resistance.
Because of the recipe order defect of the target cells for testosterone, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Today Katie is 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as an assistant in the psychiatry of children.
Although infertile, she hopes to have a child through adoption or a surrogate.
"The law gives parents space, so they don't have to make overburdened decisions," said Sharitz.
It gives them time to do different tests and to clarify things and gives them time before they write "male" or "female".
In this way, everything is fine – you raise the child and you love it.
You have a wonderful baby and you enjoy the happiness of your parents.
And you don't have to rush into an operation that can't be reversed anymore.
"This includes the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that parents are drifting around because they feel they would not do the right thing," she explained.
In the end, the child decides on the sex that suits him better – and that's wonderful.
This will enable children to make the decision themselves.
Unknown injured girl shot from car
The unknown injured a 12-year-old in Saxony-Anhalt in a car shot.
The perpetrators had probably fired an air pressure weapon at a group of children on Thursday night in Genthin.
That's what the police told us in Burg.
The girl was slightly injured on the left Wade.
Rescues brought the girl to the hospital.
The shot came from a small car that had passed by a group of six children and had suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The perpetrators also shot at a bus stop.
A disc broke.
Then they drove away.
The criminal police were determined on Friday.
Until now, police inspection Kempten can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
The officials were called only twice to egg-throwing children, who threw them against house facades.
Since the homeowners recognized this in good time and removed the egg remains equally, no material damage may have occurred either.
Furthermore, some Sylvesterböller were also lit in the city area, but no material damage has occurred here either.
A local in the Bischof-Freundorfer-Weg reported that his car was wrapped with clopapier and his bicycle screens were avoided.
However, until the arrival of the police, the man found his bicycle screens in the immediate vicinity, which was why the police did not have to continue working.
Living With Future Perspective
Actually, Waltraud Ries lives dreamily.
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with a lot of greenery, an old tree, nice neighbors and not too much traffic.
In the city it is only a few minutes by public transport.
"I hope you don't fear spiders?" asked Waltraud Ries and pointed to a fat spider on the door frame.
I've been looking for a new apartment for my husband and me for some time.
But you know how difficult this is in Stuttgart.
The reason, however, is not spider philosophy, but the concern of being able to cope with the many steps of stairs to the house and in the apartment no longer at all, she explains.
In addition, since a meniscus operation, the half-fifties have had to learn on their own body what it means to move from floor to floor with a handicap.
Recently, a book of her has been published on the subject 'Happy Living in Age - What living form is the best for me?'.
'Our apartment is the best example of what is not going on in old age', she begins to tell.
When she moved with her husband more than 20 years ago into the maisonette apartment, it was just a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green.
Today at the middle of fifty, Waltraud Ries thinks differently about it.
But she also knows that she is one of the few people who deal with the subject of 'living in old age' at all.
Most push it out as long as it goes.
She says she's always getting old, just the others.
Only when the pressure of suffering is really great do you think.
'Then it can be too late, too,' says Ries.
In her book, the interior architect presents 17 living models for self-determined living in old age.
'But what form of housing you choose is always an individual decision', she explains.
D i e solution is not available for age.
Even those who are able to afford the age rest in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that they can also get sick.
And: 'Without good knowledge of the national language, you can also work together in the Dolce Vita,' says the specialist book author.
Among their models are classic care models, alternative living forms or the often quoted pensioner WG.
In old age everyone has their ticks and Macken
'For me, such a housing community would be nothing,' she says with an eye wink.
Not like in a student toilet with a shared bathroom and a kitchen.
'In old age, you just need your retreat rooms', says Ries.
Nevertheless, the author does not want to rule out the fact that a senior living community can work.
But this must be different from the classical student WG.
And sometimes you just want your rest,' she believes.
With this opinion, at least in the state capital, it is not alone.
'Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own home as long as they can',' is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of the civil service life at the age of the state capital.
Your department advises people on the subject of 'getting older'.
That is why older people would often also be able to buy inconsistencies and restrictions, just to stay in their usual environment, which is also the experience of the Stiftung Warentest.
Today, there are many ways to make the house or apartment accessible.
Ries recommends that all those who are concerned with the age-appropriate conversion of their home or apartment first inform themselves thoroughly and not commission the first-best craftsman.
Today there is also a specialist for the age-appropriate conversion.
Even in the rental apartment, one or the other can be realized, and if it is only the toilet seat increase, the interior architect explains.
But not always can the existing apartment be remodelled age-friendly and thus barrier-free, even if it is still so beautiful.
This experience had to be made by Waltraud Ries.
It is possible to install a staircase within the apartment, but the path paved with stairs to the door of the apartment would be the far greater obstacle.
She will continue to search until she has found the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before her move, she's more gray than in front of the spider at her apartment door.
USA wants to continue criminal prosecution of Snowden
The US has not changed its attitude to former US intelligence employee Edward Snowden.
He will continue to be accused of having passed on unauthorized secret information.
Therefore, he had to file criminal proceedings in the US, said Jennifer Psaki, U.S. Secretary of State, in Washington.
Nor would the recent statements of Snowden change that.
The German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele had previously appealed to the US, after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow, not to threaten him with punishment.
Psaki stressed that Ströbele's statements were those of a parliamentarian and not of a German member of the government.
Secret Service Cover Edward Snowden is basically ready to talk to German authorities.
First, however, he wants to know what his situation is.
This was made clear by the former NSA employee sought by the US in an unaddressed letter published by the Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded to the Federal Government, the German Parliament and the Federal Government.
After a translation by Ströbele, the letter has the following wording:
To the persons responsible
I was asked to write to you about your investigation into mass surveillance.
My name was Edward Joseph Snowden and was previously employed as a technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA).
In the course of my work in these institutions, I became a witness to systematic violations of the law of my government, which led me to act on a moral basis.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I was exposed to a serious and persistent hectic rush that forced me to leave my family and home.
I currently live in exile and enjoy temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation under international law.
I am encouraged by the response to my political actions, both in the US and elsewhere.
Citizens all over the world and also high officials - including the United States - have judged the revelations to be a system of comprehensive surveillance, which no one is accountable for, as a service to the public.
These espionage revelations drew many proposals for new laws and directives aimed at the previously hidden misuse of public trust.
The benefit to society from these findings is becoming increasingly clear, while the risks acquired have been significantly reduced.
Although the outcome of my efforts has proved to be positive, my government continues to treat Dissens as a breach of fidelity and strives to criminalize and accuse political opinion.
Nevertheless, telling the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the Government of the United States, with the support of the international community, will abandon this destructive attitude.
I hope that, when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved, I will be able to participate in the responsible disclosure of the facts relating to statements made in the media, in particular with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports, in an appropriate and legal manner.
I look forward to a conversation with you in your country as soon as the situation has been clarified and thank you for your efforts to protect the international law that protects us all.

Kindergarten has found a private buyer
"The building is in good hands," says Winterlingen's mayor Michael Maier.
The former kindergarten in the garden street sold the municipality to a private person.
In its recent meeting, the municipal council agreed to the sale in the non-public part.
The building changed its owner to an "appropriate" price.
"The municipality is satisfied," says Maier.
The budget was set at EUR 100 000.
It is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the former kindergarten.
The mayor is right that Winterlingen has handed over the responsibility for the building to someone else before the winter and therefore no longer has to stand up for the entertainment of the house, such as heating, looking at the garden and clearing the walkway.
"This effort is gone now," says Maier.
Space concert at high summer temperatures
The Musikverein Hammer Hammereisenbach gives a place concert on the terrace of the Gasthaus Hammer.
When conductor Bianca Willmann lifts the clock at 7.30 p.m., the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
About 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of the Hammrich musicians.
The chairman Manuela Honeck presents the pieces of music.
In this context, Honeck thanked all those who had helped to cope successfully with the first musical shock.
Report: Obama campaign considered replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton
The closest consultants of President Barack Obama secretly thought about replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 election campaign, says the New York Times.
The revelation is the most remarkable surprise of the long-awaited work by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann on the 2012 election campaign, "Double Down: Game Change 2012".
The Times has a copy of the book that is about to be published and reported on Thursday evening that the president's top advisers had carried out "wide group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011" to find out if Obama's dwindling hope of re-election would be better if he dropped bids.
According to Jonathan Martin, National Policy correspondent of the Times, the book thoroughly traces the history of efforts by leading employees of the campaign and the White House, including the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure the impact it has on the survey values to exchange former Foreign Minister Clinton against the Vice-President.
The potential change was a strictly guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president's closest advisers, including Daley, former campaign manager Obama, Jim Messina, and former white house executive adviser David Axelrod and David Plouffe, knew about the change.
'Double Down' claims that Daley had been at the forefront of the efforts to exchange prayers despite their 'close, personal relationship' before deciding on such a move after the data showed that Clinton's candidacy would not significantly improve Obama's chances.
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government had actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
"I said a whole series of things to consider, and that was one of them," Daley told the magazine.
It must be remembered that the president had terrible survey values at the time, so we thought, "For God's sake, what do we do?"
While Daley referred the investigations to as "begnant care", Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that during the re-election campaign significant effort had been made to find out if such a move paid off in terms of the polls.
"In campaigns, not so much money is spent on surveys and focus groups if you don't think seriously about something," said Martin on AC360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was thinking about an exchange.
Martin told CNN that he had asked Daley if his then boss had known about the potential change.
Although Daley said that he did not believe that the president was "conscious of the possible change," the former Chief of Staff admitted that it was "potential" that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that "Double Down" did not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether the political explorations had reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama had not known anything about the investigation of whether to drop Biden in the elections.
"Possible," replied Martin.
What happens to my e-mail on the way?
E-mail is actually called an electronic letter.
Did the design of the Internet service implement the secret of letters in a similar way to conventional mail?
In the design of the early Internet services, the focus was on making communication possible.
Therefore, the basic technical protocols have not been used to create a stable basis for a sound exchange of letters.
Therefore, a conventional e-mail corresponds to an open postcard rather than a sealed letter.
If user "Anna" sends an email to "Benni", are the two computers directly connected?
The email program or the browser of Anna sends the mail to the mail server of its service provider in the first step.
For example, if she has a Gmail account, it would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider that Benni uses.
On the route, the mail can run over a number of other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call his provider for the content.
Are conventional e-mails read on their way through the web?
Most emails are read several times on the way by software robots.
The provider of the sender usually checks whether the mail carries a malicious program as an appendix.
A virus check is also carried out on the receiver systems.
In addition, the providers will check whether it is an annoying and unwanted spam mail that is immediately deleted or at least sorted into a spam folder.
Do the robots have another job?
For systems such as GMail, the robot also determines the information Google needs to place context advertising.
If Anna and Benni communicate via Gmail about their upcoming holiday trip, Google can display appropriate links to holiday offers.
Do unknown people also read the emails?
The probability that unauthorized persons will read an email is extremely low.
But theoretically, this is possible.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail.
The law enforcement authorities and secret services also have legal opportunities to intercept or take note of e-mails.
In addition, there are possible illegal out-of-the-box actions.
Is it possible to protect emails against reading?
With an encryption according to the OpenPGP standard, an e-mail can be effectively encrypted against reading.
With a high technical effort it is also possible to mask the metadata of an email communication, so that it is not even possible to recognize who has communicated with whom.
How important are Yahoo and Google on the email market in Germany?
According to a survey by Convios Consulting from August 2013, Yahoo and Google only play a subordinate role in the main private mailboxes.
While the shares of Yahoo mail had last fallen, GMail could grow significantly from Google.
Mother tightened in the forest and pension cashed
When his mother died, a man from Wolfsburg forged a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest and continued to collect their pension and care money.
A 67-year-old Wolfsburger buried his dead mother after police investigation in the forest in order to continue to obtain pension and care money.
First he covered up the death of 89-year-olds, then he had broken the money down for more than a year and a half.
Now the 67-year-old has to answer for fraud, as a speaker said on Friday.
So the man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was suspected as early as May: at that time, it was not necessary for the mother in need of care to have any medication.
The pensioner told the investigator that his mother had traveled to Spain.
Because this seemed strange to the officials, they continued to determine.
It turned out that the two had lived in a shared apartment for more than 15 years and he had last cared for it.
The 67-year-old finally admitted his mother's death.
According to police, no evidence of a capital crime was found.
Desire for ice cream shining in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first ice cream in the dark – with the help of throats.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of marine animals and created a shining leak from them.
The idea came to him after he had read a research on torture and had been able to convince Chinese scientists to produce the luminous protein artificially.
The ice cream reacts when consumed with the tongue, which increases the pH in the protein and causes lighting.
Chris explains that the ice cream reacts to the heat in the mouth and shines – so the more you lick, the brighter it gets.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company "Lick Me I'm Delicious", says: "The product is incredible, but still in a very early production phase, and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds."
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH value.
When the mouth warms the protein, the pH and the ice rises.
We have tested it in recent months and it seemed ideal to us to bring it to the market at Halloween because it has this wonderful lighting effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever produced, because it's four times more expensive than gold.
Every bullet costs me about 140 pounds.
But it tastes delicious for that.
Charlie's experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual flavors, including beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his latest creation should become even more ambitious.
He says: "I would like to develop an invisible ice cream."
This is in itself impossible because of the refraction of light caused by the ice crystals, which consist of ice cream; but I guess we find a way to create it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a torment artificially produced by Chinese scientists
The TSV Morsum is still without any point in the handball league after six days of playing.
For the team of Ingo Ehlers tomorrow, it will be the Derby against the TSV Daverden, who celebrated his first victory last weekend.
With this game the season starts new for us.
"I hope we finally have our head free," Ehlers looks optimistic.
Finally, with the exception of the permanently injured Hendrik Blohme, he has at his disposal his complete cadre.
Daverden, too, relies on speed play.
That is why we need to keep our error rate low.
In the first place, however, it is important to increase in coverage, which has left anything but a safe impression.
Daverden's coach Thomas Panitz is much more relaxed after the first season victory against Nordhorn.
The game was of course a house number.
But that's why we're far from the favorite, because everything can always happen in Derby.
However, Panitz now wants to relocate to Morsum to start a series.
Missing is Jan-Malte Jodat.
The A-Jugendliche Joost Windsßuss, who is active in the A-Jugend-Bundesligist HC Bremen, celebrates his season debut.
If you're not hot in a game like this, stay at home.
Halloween 2013: In figures
When I was little, Halloween had something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, stay up late and dress up for the neighborhood.
Today I've become a Halloween muffel.
In the last two years, I have not declared myself willing to distribute sweets from my home, and I guess I will not do it this year.
But according to statistics, I'm a black sheep with regard to Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be precise – celebrate Halloween this year and spend a total of 6.9 billion US dollars on sweets, costumes and decorations, according to the American Association of Retailers (NRF).
One thing I look forward to every Halloween is the trend values.
The costumes will account for about 1.2 billion of the 6.9 billion US dollars spent, says the NRF.
This year, invigorating inanimate objects are the last scream.
Women no longer have to cover themselves in sexy clothes, they can now also embody seductive food such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the Daft-Punk spacemen will create it this year in Instagram feeds.
According to Google, the most sought-after costumes are zombies, batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there's nothing wrong with tradition.
We dressed our dogs last year and were not alone to my amazement.
In fact, Americans spend 330 million dollars this year on costumes of their pets, says the NRF.
That's a lot of hot dogs.
As far as sweets are concerned, we're not grumpy.
Americans will spend 1.9 billion dollars this year, says The Nielsen Company.
That's about 270 million pounds of chocolate bars, locusts, candies, and rubber fairies.
So good news for the 41 million people who go through the neighborhood with the saying "sweet or sour".
In fact, we will buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – if we don't mind – eat.
The only thing we don't want to consume is the sweet candy corn, but 15 million kilograms of it is sold around Halloween, says the National Association of Sweets manufacturers.
That's about nine billion corn grains.
It's a mystery I haven't been able to solve.
Nothing more belongs to Halloween than houses in which it spits.
They have great names like "Terror Behind the Walls" (which, by the way, is in a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognized ghosts in the United States that generate 500 million dollars of proceeds, says America Haunts, and this includes the wonderful photos on which one is just pinging into the pants and then putting the friends on Facebook, where one does not get rid of them again, and then the guy on whom one stands leaves a comment such as "fine facial expression".
But let's finally get to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the big pumpkin when we were children, and the carving of a pumpkin lantern is like the adorning of the Christmas tree – something we have made from small.
Fortunately, the “baby in the pumpkin” trend only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so that most of us grew up cutting the pumpkin and not sitting in it.
This year, Americans will spend about 106 million dollars on pumpkins, says the US Census Bureau.
The pumpkin lantern, which slowly rots in the front garden, probably comes from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms of pumpkins were harvested this year.
If you want to score correctly, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and carve something nice out of their 921 kilos of pumpkin.
Apartment fire in Helmrechts: rescue personnel store coaled body
The fire brigade had to get out in Helmrecht on the late Thursday night.
A three-family house in the district of Hof catches fire during the night.
The rescues store a coaled body out of the house.
In a fire in Helmrechts, rescue workers found a coaled body in a three-family house.
Whether it's about a resident is still unclear, as one of the police spokespersons in Bayreuth said.
On the late Thursday evening it had burned on the ground floor of the house.
When the fire brigade arrived, the flames were already beating out of a window.
The forces went into the apartment and found the body in a room.
This and another room burned out completely.
The entire ground floor was damaged.
All other residents had not been at home during the fire, the police spokesperson continued.
The building was no longer habitable.
At first, the exact cause of the fire was not clear.
Germany's largest Landeskirche has launched an offensive to advertise for the pastor's profession.
Background is a possible parishioner shortage: the Evangelical Lutheran Landeskirche Hannover expects the number of its approximately 1,800 pastors to halve by 2030 according to the present situation.
For young people today, the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the course of work and day.
With Burfien, the Landeskirche has for the first time commissioned a pastor in a full position to inspire young people to study theology.
At present, fewer and fewer young people choose to study theology after graduation.
Burfien takes this back to the process of disunity: "God's voice is quiet, the world is loud".
The profession was characterised by great freedom and diversity.
I am the master of my schedule and can set my priorities where it is important to me.
Pastors could be very close to people as a pastoral caregiver.
They deserved as much as teachers and could live well on it.
Certainly more money will be paid in the free economy, but theologians would have a safe employer for that.
This comes to the young people of today, who are not just about a career, but about a meaningful work.
According to the Landeskirche, which comprises three quarters of Lower Saxony, about 60 pastors currently retire each year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a theology study begin their vicariate.
In thinly populated peripheral areas such as the resin, the Emsland or the Wendland, it could become difficult to occupy jobs in the future.
Burfien wants to organise study days for young people and also invites celebrities who have studied theology.
The study of theology offers a wide range of training.
You can even become the President of the Federal Republic of Germany.
Land Rover Rally Series announced
In the interior there are racing seats and six-point belts as well as an accompaniment system.
The options range from reinforced brakes, a service package with support for bowler-works mechanics and logistic support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport, explains: "The Rally customers who come to Bowler have changed."
They are not all experienced racers, but people who are looking for tension and adventure as well as for an achievable way to world-class events.
We are pleased to be able to open this way in partnership with Land Rover and MSA and believe that the format opens up new opportunities to experience the various Rally disciplines in the UK and abroad and to prepare newcomers for Rally Raid's strata and reality.
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge car – this will be an entertaining championship.
In addition, there is a training and testing day at the Defender Challenge in February as well as the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Fire brigade called for the rescue of a dog 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rocky edge in a quarries
Cockerspaniel dog Ruby had run away after a smaller traffic accident
Three days later she was discovered by a walker in the quarry in her sick location
Firefighters sailed off a rock face and rescued the dog from safe death
The fire brigade managed to secure a dog that was stuck on a 15 - meter - high lead in a rock face.
The nine-month-old Cockerspaniel dog Ruby had run away after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before she was rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his friend Becky Hall, 20 of whom the dog belongs, came to the quarry Flappit in Denholme, West Yorkshire to receive Ruby again and to thank the firemen of West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately searched for her missing bitch and had published calls for help on social networks when she had escaped to the quarries after the small traffic accident.
Around 14:15 a.m. on Wednesday, a walker who performed his dog saw the stranded Ruby on the 15-metre-high heel in the quarry.
The technical rescue team of the Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the site and sailed off to rescue Rubys, which was then transported up in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, a technical rescue team specialist, said: “She was in a dangerous situation.
It was located in the middle of the rock face – 15 meters from the top and the ground.
She did not move any muscle during her rescue – she was like stiff-frozen.
But now she's fine.
She then ate a couple of dogcakes.
That was a pretty unusual move.
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, specialist in the technical rescue team, said: "Ruby had a huge happiness."
It was possible that she was very badly injured or worse.
Ruby was sent to the veterinarian, but he found nothing except exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "Watching the rescue was frightening."
I couldn't believe she was really up there.
It was wonderful to keep her back in the arms.
The veterinarian explained that if exhaustion had become too large and it had collapsed, it would probably have crashed.
The firemen have done great things.
It was really courageous what they did.
We are just so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson from Keighley added: "We were afraid she would fall down, but she stayed up."
The firemen were great.
I can't believe where she was.
Mick Jagger says he never did Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week, the pop star said that she had worked as a background singer on Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" from 2004.
Perry said she had dinner with the old rocker and that "he dredged me when I was 18.
She added: "That's been a long time and he was very nice to me."
In a statement, a representative of Jaggers, 70, said on Thursday that he "categorically denied that he had ever tried to approach Katy Perry".
The representative added: 'Maybe she confused him with someone else.'
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance on the Rolling-Stones tour this year.
Her new album "Prism" ended up in second place this week.
George Kerevan: European Disengagement Gives the Schotts the Election
A new day, a new horror story for independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This provides the keyword for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a border secured with barbed wire along the Hadrian wall.
In fact, the Strathclyde template pointed out the potential economic benefits that would result in greater freedom of travel in the rest of Europe, but this did not play a role in the headlines, as expected.
Nor has anyone mentioned that the EU Member States often adopt their strict rules if it is more favourable for them.
Since Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area, the continued non-compliance with Brussels would only be a small concession in return for what you really want from the Scottish.
So, actually, no story.
And one that has already come in the years that it already resembles a fossil: the first time I heard the "independence means passport checks" duck at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient history.
Why should an independent Scotland be expected to dance after the European pipe?
Why trade the London Joch for Brussels, especially now?
These are the real European news: the great post-war plan for the unification of Europe has come to an end.
With the euro crisis, the project Europe officially died.
All over the EU, parties who are hostile to the EU or want to throw the euro overboard as a Community currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Party Alternative for Germany – founded only this year – was able to reach nearly five million votes in the Bundestag election in September and thus effectively drive out the Free Democrats (the equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic resistance to the plan to create a federalist Europe.
However, the current economic crisis turns out to be a turning point.
Because of the strict austerity policy imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in connection with the forced jacket in which the national economy is required by holding the single currency, many people believe that the Europe project has gone too far.
The crisis of the euro has little to do with the fact that national governments cause excessive budget deficits – that was only the case in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has fixed its members on exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters – and this is what German politicians would like to leave.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the local currency, Southern Europe will find itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage over Germany.
The only possibility is to reduce wages and public spending – inspired by Berlin.
The current budget and monetary problems are a deeper European productivity problem.
As a result of the 'green' energy directives prescribed by Brussels – a code for the subsidisation of French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – the European industry pays double for electricity and fourfold for gas compared with the United States.
This is a paralyzing cost disadvantage, as we could already see in Grangemouth.
The European petrochemical industry is not protected from being pushed into the corner by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, there is a revolt, especially in France, the former cheerleader of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a vehicle with which one could keep Germany in check and lift Paris to eye level with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a doorway to political legitimacy and Europe has imposed its own economic policy, which has to fight the affected French economy.
The result: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, EU enemy front National has just won a decisive post-election and thus referred the ruling socialists to third place.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of voters – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a split in the right spectrum would automatically mean benefits for the left.
What does Le Pen do with their newly gained popularity among the white French of the working class?
It would like to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU, anti-Community currency block in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties cut well in these elections – and this is very possible – then for the first time such a block could dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point to which I wish to go: in the not too long future, the growing resentment against the EU and the single currency will come together to abolish the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will become something like the 'Europe of the (sovereign) nations', which General de Gaulle preferred.
Germany and some of its satellite economies may hold on to the euro, but France and Southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect the UK to distance itself from this project in the hope of flattering with the US.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific area suggests that Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where's Scotland with all this?
We can decide to be a region of (in the last consequence) small England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including telling Berlin and Brussels what they can do.
I suspect that Scotland could do very well in a looser European union, provided we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other similar countries is easier in a non-federational Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider equalizing Norway and maintaining our economic independence.
Remarkably, the SNP government in Scotland is the most successful political movement against austerity policy in Europe and has won a spectacular majority in 2011 because of the rejection of the proposed (and implemented) cuts that the Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition had to bear.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to choose independence now, just to get a policy of savings from Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Growing faster
Afro-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white peers, as studies show.
Physical changes do not directly mean puberty
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe epidemic obesity is a trigger of early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is less pronounced in boys
The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in child health and family topics.
Should a mother be concerned when her daughter grows breasts and shame at the age of seven or eight?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and were a new norm.
“I spend a lot of time calming parents – this is usually not a sign that puberty is coming quickly,” Kaplowitz explained.
Obviously displays of development, such as growing breasts, shame and armpit hair as well as body odor, show up in girls earlier.
Nevertheless, there was only a slight shift in the age of the menarche (the occurrence of the first control bleeding) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, with a little less than 12.75 in 1970.
"When the development of the breasts begins, it will take at least two to three years for the Menarche," said Kaplowitz, also author of the book "Early puberty for girls: the essential guide for dealing with this common problem".
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty progresses.
It is controversial what actually constitutes the beginning of puberty, but it is true that breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth boost of eight years ago.
In most cases, the process slows down or stagnates – something that a pediatrician can closely monitor.
If progress is made faster, tests may be indicated by an endicronologist so that serious problems such as tumors or cysts can be excluded.
There are treatment methods for delaying early menstruation and defence of another episode: premature aging of the bones, which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and thus small growth in adults.
The recommendations for medication or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the rate of development, growth rate and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is reluctant about medications, but he acknowledges: "The suppression of puberty can soften behavioral problems and the feelings of girls, unlike their peers."
The other big problem is understandable: parents just don't want their very young daughters to have the period.
"They worry about the risk of pregnancy or how they handle the hygienic side," said Kaplowitz.
"It was a shock," recalls a woman whose daughter had had her days with ten.
Even if there were first signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was emotionally unprepared.
She came home scared and excited because she was the first in her circle of friends.
There are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no clear evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media would be causal.
Boys come to puberty similar to girls.
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported the conduct of a 2001 study on girls aged six to nine who establish a link between body fat and entry into puberty.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, African American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white peers.
There are different explanations for this.
Globally, early puberty seems to be influenced by all kinds of things, from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another mystery: Although young people have grown face and shame earlier, the trend towards a full-fledged previous puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference underlined the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is spread even among babies and toddlers.
"We must be careful how we identify the real beginning of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a paediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to be advised by their pediatrician about how to talk to their child.
"This can mean having to hold a conversation earlier than expected," said Kaplowitz.
If you stay calm, the child usually reacts well.
Girls who flourish early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it occurs earlier than thought.
Jumbo manufacturers argue in the face of large orders about seat width
Between leading aircraft manufacturers, there has been a dispute over the width of seats in the tourist class in long-haul flights, indicating the tone for a bitter collision on the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute revolves around the seat width offered to passengers on long flights in the tourist class – not always those most interested in airlines, but this designated space is the key to the efficiency claims on the latest Airbus SAS and Boeing Co. aircraft.
Airbus demanded an industry standard this week, which requires a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in the tourist class, but the American archrival Boeing says that the airlines should decide.
The challenge comes at a time when aircraft builders compete to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long-haul aircraft, and expect record orders at the event from November 17 to 21.
How the rear part of the aircraft is designed – in particular if there are rows of nine or ten seats – is crucial for the stated economic results that the new "Mini-Jumbo" design is intended to deliver.
Boeing claims that its modernized "777X" accommodates 406 people in tourist class seats, which are over 17 inches wide and thus allow ten per row.
Airbus explains the competing version of the A350 transported 350 people in 18 inches wide seats in the tourist class, with nine per row.
Aeroplane giants often distribute hits about technical details by advertising in the specialist press.
Now Airbus is appealing to the public in front of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X with over 100 orders is expected to make the race.
Recently, the company presented an ad that could be the beginning of a new ad war and gave a picture of the three people sitting in a restaurant, and the title: "Will you accept this?"
"Boeing proposes long-haul flights in seats that are closer than regional turbo props," says Airbus Sales Manager John Lehy.
In the face of changed eating habits, people get thicker, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when Boeing 747 defined the modern long-distance journey, and the end of the century, the male average American weight increased by 10 percent between 40 and 49 years, according to the US Ministry of Health data.
The male average American waist size in the 21st century is 100.8 cm, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus says his rival adheres to a 1950s seat concept when the average body size of the newly baptized Jet Set was narrower.
According to Airbus, investigations have been carried out showing that an additional inch (2.54 cm) per seat increases sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing contests Airbus's figures on seat sizes and says that it is not at the manufacturer's discretion to decide how airlines plan the balance between air fare and facility.
The company also explains that according to studies the experience in the aircraft depends on more than the seat width.
"It really is up to airlines to have flexibility so that they can do what they think they need to be successful," explains the flight cabin expert Kent Craver of Boeing.
They don't want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers it is about more elbow-free, but for manufacturers it will increasingly be a subject that can affect sales.
Behind the challenge is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least $700 billion at list prices in the coming decades, which could have a lasting impact on the export balance of the US or Europe.
As Reuters first reported in July, the seat layout is the driving force behind the debate about the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest two-engine long-distance designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 77-300ER.
The statements of Boeing on the results depend partly on the comparison of the 777X with its ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increased cost per unit is still lower than for currently used machines with ten seats per row.
“Boeing therefore squeezes more seats in his plane to make it more competitive for our products,” says Kevin Keniston, Head of Passenger Comfort at the European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts, full cabins with ten seats per row at existing 777s suggest that many passengers opted for the closer arrangement, which could be associated with lower flight prices.
“ Eighteen inches of seating width would be great for passengers, but the reality is: from an economic point of view, the Airbus offer is controlled by the threat by the 777,” says Mary Kirby, expert on cabin facility, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats, but rather a catalog of suppliers from which airlines can select.
The world-traveling jet vendors even carry band sizes to track the establishment in competition.
Even if they offer the comfort, all manufacturers also offer jets with highly compact design for low-cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with ten-seat rows, but has not sold one yet, according to its own statement.
Until recently, Airbus has stressed the importance of more adaptability of the cabins and offered wide seats on the corridors for some jets.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that the call for a new industry standard would probably blow up, but could distract from the wave of 777X sales.
New anti-Nicotine vaccine could make smoking fun of the garage
Scientists have developed an anti-Nicotine vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
Before tests on humans, more tests are needed, which may take a few more years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results were good.
"We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to stop and tried out all the methods available on the market, but had to experience that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches," says Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified in such a way that it contains the genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a constant stream of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before reaching the brain, which prevents a smoker from experiencing nicotine high.
In trials, vaccinated mice administered with nicotine maintained their normal level of activity.
However, mice without vaccination would have taken a "out of time", the researchers explained, a sign that the nicotine had reached her brain.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The vaccinations had to be given to maintain antibody levels so often that they were expensive and impractical.
However, the cost of the new vaccine is probably significantly lower, as it transforms liver cells into antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine could be administered to people if he was quite sure children were to be given before they were tempted to try a cigarette, thus preventing nicotine addiction.
But more likely, smokers would use him to stop.
"They then know that when they start smoking again, they no longer feel like it because of the nicotine vaccine, and this helps them to stop the habit," he explains.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but at the same time warned that further research was necessary.
Tripodi contests being influenced by Obeid
Against the former minister of the laboratory Joe Tripodi from New South Wales, an investigation by state corruption control is initiated.
The former NSW Minister disputed that the rules governing the lease of the naval property had been amended at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden holdings in three land in a state-controlled country.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC Independent Commission against Corruption) extended its investigations on whether Obeid has influenced several state ministers to extend lease contracts at Circular Quay, where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a café, without calling for tenders after their expiry in August 2005.
Now it is determined because of the accusation that Tripodi had known Obedi's hidden interest in the land after Tripodi's former Deputy Chief of Staff Lynne Ashpole had said accordingly on Thursday.
In years of discussions that began in 2005, the government had urged public tendering for the lease contracts.
The leasers were against it and also wanted to last longer.
In 2009 the lease contracts for the companies at the Circular Quay, which brought the Obeids 2.5 million dollars a year, were extended without public tendering.
Tripodi, who was Minister of Port from February 2006 to November 2009, had originally spoken out for public tendering.
However, he argued to have made the changes at Obeid's request, which, as Tripodi confirmed, had urged a reorganisation of the government's leases.
One of the ICAC's telegraphs showed talks from August to September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior officer who had been transferred to the port ministry after working under Obeid in the fisheries department.
"Was the topic discussed in these telephone calls the preparation of commercial leases?" asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
'No', Tripodi replied.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it definitely wasn't.
Definitely not between me and Mr Obeid.
Israeli fighters attack target in Syria, according to official sources
Israeli fighters had attacked a target in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday night, a senior government employee confirmed to Fox News.
The official did not explain what the goal was, but said that it had been at least one.
According to Associated Press, the target was Russian SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel has already carried out air strikes on rocket deliveries in Syria.
Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subjected to 'reality test'
In the context of extended measures, the Government is considering a 'reality test' for foreign workers with 457 visas.
Should the test be introduced, it would be used by means of a criterion to prevent the 457 being used to occupy unqualified jobs or as a back door to move family and friends to Australia.
Today, a government discussion proposal was published after the former members of the laboratory party, Maxine McKew, had condemned the government's comments on foreign workers because they could be regarded as insult by the neighbours of Australia.
“The statements, such as ‘foreigners are supposed to stand in the back’ and ‘Australian first’ are a very unpleasant setback in times when trade unions demanded a protected labour market,” she said to the Australia India Institute today.
Historically speaking, this meant that white workers should be protected – and if some people in the region used an echo of this historical artifact, that would not surprise me.
The proposal for a discussion outlines twelve measures once envisaged by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigrant Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday for discussions on human smuggling, has implemented five of the recommended changes, the others are still being considered.
If the criterion of authenticity is adopted, a person applying for a visa could be checked as to whether the application is genuine in cases where the applicant is related to the holder or to a relevant person of the supporting undertaking.
Companies could also be obliged to account for the number of 457 visa holders after in the past companies that initially wanted to support only a small number of workers have finally recruited hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylumist probably died of a heart attack after arriving on Christmas Island with a refugee boat this week.
The disturbed nine-year-old son of the man who had come to Australia with him has been cared for by an adult cousin since his father's death on Wednesday, who was also on the boat.
Australian authorities brought the man to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
A study was announced by the British government to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
The work of HS2 Ltd suggests that high-speed connections between Scotland and the north of England should already be realized at the beginning of Phase 1 in 2026.
Minister for Transport Baroness Kramer said that the project 'will bring Britain closer together'.
The Scottish transport minister Keith Brown said he was very pleased to work with the British government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands.
After phase 2, there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government corrected the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between London and northern England from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The UK Government, which is in conversation with Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to look for further route capacity and travel time improvements for North England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a travel period of three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is a truly national route network that brings Britain and its cities closer together."
We're moving forward with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits.
Without it, we are facing a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it is also about the connection between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is improved thanks to HS2.
Scottish State Secretary Alistair Carmichael commented: "Today's announcement is a good news for Scotland."
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown Carmichael called for 'unmistakable' commitment to Scottish involvement in the HS2 network.
Brown said: "The high-speed rail link has the potential of enormous economic advantages for Scotland, but at the same time the economic power of Scotland is also an argument for fast rail connections across the UK."
That is why we are pleased to work as a partner of the British Government and to examine the options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland, which creates benefits for all and complements the Glasgow-Edinburgh link already planned by the Scottish Government.
I am looking forward to examining the study report with the British ministers next year and to taking the next steps together.
Rules on electronic devices in aircraft remain in force for the time being in Australia
Australian passengers must continue to shut down tablets and smartphones at takeoff and landing, despite efforts in the US to relax the regulations for such devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows US airlines to change their specifications so that passengers can read, watch or play E-books on their devices during critical flight phases, provided that they are in "flight mode".
During most of the flight, passengers are already allowed to do so, but many people find it annoying that they should not read their e-books at takeoff and landing.
Australian companies, however, do not follow any immediate plans to amend their rules.
CASA also stated that the announcement would be considered, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of flight in Australia still apply.
"CASA does not currently have any specific rules on the use of electronic equipment in the aircraft" has been announced.
The subject is subject to provisions which require airlines to maintain safety at any time and passengers to comply with safety instructions given by cabin crew.
Virgin has already talked to CASA about extending its Wi-Fi entertainment system to flights and explains that one is open to change, but these should be initiated by the legislator.
"We would welcome a review of the approval of electronic devices by CASA, because we are convinced that this would improve customer experience after we now offer (wireless entertainment) during the flight," said one speaker.
Qantas stated that the current rules will remain until further notice.
"Our current guidelines provide that electronic equipment should not be used at take-off and landing, and we do not currently have plans to change that," said the company.
The FAA rules apply to US airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations from which passengers can benefit, and we will certainly consider the FAA decision and the reasons behind it.
The decision has a different impact on US companies depending on the age of the fleet.
They must prove that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference through mobile devices and modify manuals, training materials, hand luggage programs and customer instruction.
"After confirming the tolerance of its fleet, an airline can allow passengers to use portable, lighter electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at any height," the FAA announced.
In rare cases in poor sight, the crew will instruct passengers to switch off the equipment during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier equipment be safely stored under the seat or in the compartments above the seats at take-off and landing.
In front of the revierderby against Schalke, fellow BVB trailers with light rockets had provided ugly scenes in the Veltins arena.
Borussia Dortmund then announced harsh consequences.
The ultras responded with a silence before the football league against the VfB Stuttgart on Friday.
It was an unusual, almost spicy acoustic, which offered the viewer until shortly before the appeal of the Bundesliga game between the German vice-master Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in the signal Iduna Park.
To be heard were mostly the guest fans with their songs.
On the other hand, the southern grandstand, where the most faithful of the faithful - and loudest - BVB fans stand, initially presented itself exceptionally quietly: no songs, no battle calls.
The Podest of Capo, which otherwise co-ordinates the joint lighting, remained unoccupied.
And at the front of the gallery, a large flag with an inscription "section stadium ban" blew alone.
Only as a goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller as always as the first BVB player entered the place, burned up short-term cheer.
When his team colleagues followed, there was loud singing and wailing scarves - but far from everywhere.
In the central blocks 12 and 13 of the South Tribune nothing moved.
Also, that stadium speaker Norbert Dickel once again listed the positive experiences of the last days - Derby victory, victory over Arsenal, contract extension of coach Jürgen Klopp - did not cause a celebration.
Only five minutes before the peat the Capo climbed his pedestal - and the up until then almost with hands tangible tension emerged in a loud cry, when Dickel, as usual, asked the mood on the ranks in the stadium.
Last but not least, as always, the southern stand was on the line - and finally, here was the loudest place in the stadium as usual.
And at the latest, when the loud call "Derbysieger Arises Up" came with the appetizer from the south stand, everything was as always.
The silence before was probably a reaction to the events of the past days.
Directly in front of Revierderby at FC Schalke 04, some of the fellow BVB trailers had fired light rockets into the viewer's edge and into the square - and almost hit goalkeepers Roman Weidenfeller.
The game was delayed due to the chaotic scenes.
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had subsequently received the top of Dortmund's Ultras in his office - and if you think Watzke's words, this was a rather uncomfortable appointment for the fan representatives.
"There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra-movement," announced the BVB-Boss on Thursday evening on a panel discussion in Frankfurt.
At once Watzke stopped the Ultras a choreography for the home game against the VfB Stuttgart.
"I forbade that," he explained.
We cannot give up the zero tolerance policy on pyrotechnics.
In addition, the Ultras have been shown various ways of punishing - until Tuesday they now have time to choose one.
Otherwise, Watzke said, the BVB would set a penalty by the end of the next week.
"That's going to be incisive," Watzke assured.
One may be excited about how the reactions on the southern gallery will then fail.
Houses of pledge are booming in Singapore, as the crisis has arrived in the middle class
In a pledge house in the Bendemeer shopping center in Singapore, Janani Amirtzinga trades a golden bracelet, a ring and a pair of earrings to pay the school fees of their daughters.
"My husband and I have just bought a house, my whole money is in it," Amirtzinga says.
Although she earned 3,000 Singapore dollars (approx. 1.730 euros) each month as an administrative employee and her husband also worked, the monthly family income is not sufficient, she explains.
Indeed, demand in parts of South-East Asia – where household debt increases – is so high that ValueMax, where it has made its exchange, became the third deposit house listed on the Singapore stock exchange this week.
The pledge of jewelry is not only a quick way to get money – 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirtzinga – but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Typically, pledge houses in Singapore demand an effective annual interest rate of 17 per cent, which is just over 15.4 per cent required by United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping center.
However, pledge houses offer the advantage that there is no need to review creditworthiness or proof of income, which is why loans are faster than possible from banks.
For this reason, millions of people in the region turn to pledge houses after families feel the pressure due to increasing living costs as well as increasing household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to a loose financial policy in the developed economies, families with lower and medium incomes are looking for houses to compensate for the difference in the booming economy.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor's growing household debt, mainly through rising mortgages, was a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore, according to the Agency, have the highest fiscal debt in Asia in relation to gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 percent of GDP, an increase of 60 percent in 2008.
Economical concerns are also due to the high consumer debt in Thailand, which has come out of a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed a continuing weakness in exports and a fall in consumer demand.
“In the end, this means that, given the rising costs, people in the middle to lower segment (the income scale) will try to supplement their income wherever possible,” says Song Seng Wun, economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historical peaks in gold prices over the last two years have added to the trend towards the pledge of personal items, as people take advantage of the opportunity to turn the family's jewelry into cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the pledged items are gold in the 200 pledge houses of the city state.
The people say: "The gold price looks good, let's pledge grandmother's gold chain and get back next month."
The largest Thai pledger, EasyMoney, has experienced a 20 percent customer growth in its stores in recent months.
The growth in the pledge business is so strong that ValueMax, the branch operator in Bendemeer and 15 others in Singapore, wants to expand not only to neighbor Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, Managing Director of ValueMax.
The company financed this with 60 percent of the 66 million Singapore dollars, which it took this week with the IPO in Singapore.
While some lenders had entered the crossfire due to high interest rates, Yeah explains that pledge houses not only pay cheaper interest than other lenders, but also did not directly raise debt.
"Customers borrow items they already own and the smoothing of personal valuables does not increase household education," she explains.
The pledge lending business is increasingly accepted in society as short-term, safe financing.
Not all people who use pledge loans are in financial difficulties either.
Rich people from Singapore also come to the stores of ValueMax to pledge gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Customers from every social shift come to us.
"These include wealthy persons who borrow something short-term for a business or an investment, or small companies that have to bridge bottlenecks in the cash flow," says Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
NSA sucks data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
The intelligence discoverer Edward Snowden has a fundamental interest in helping Germany to find out about the ever more dangerous NSA-spatness.
In his surprising meeting with Snowden in Russia, Hans-Christian Ströbele, a member of the Grünen-Bundestag, described the conditions under which the ex-secret staff would testify at a German prosecutor's office or in front of an investigation committee.
Snowden pointed to his complicated legal situation, Ströbele said to the ARD magazine "Panorama".
Rescue package over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian healthcare
The Australian government insists on the harsh conditions associated with the rescue package of over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian healthcare to ensure that the government of the state cannot waste the money.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take 'immediate measures' to avert a crisis caused by an ageing population of the island state, a higher rate of chronic diseases and system restrictions.
Financing for a period of four years was decided after government consultations with independent Tasmanian representative Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has tied up an emergency rescue package that, in our view, addresses the unique challenges facing the state," Plibersek said today.
The 325 million dollar package includes 31 million dollars of emergency aid for election services.
A further 2600 operations, including orthopaedic procedures and treatments due to grey star, are intended to eliminate residues.
In addition, there is money for day clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better after-care after stationary stays, specialist training, mental health services and the introduction of a system for the electronic recording of health data in local hospitals.
"These investments are in line with the ideas of the clinic staff who have told me that they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system," said Tanya Plibersek.
The Minister insisted on a strict reporting and accountability of the Tasmanian government.
The state had to maintain the current level of financing in order to receive money from the Commonwealth and report monthly on where the additional funds were spent.
A three-member Commission will be set up to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie said today, the 325 million dollars would be of little use if "they were not accompanied by genuine reforms that bring the public Tasmanian health system on a more sustainable course."
Nevertheless, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he first expressed to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
"I am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to removing the state's public health system from the list of concerns," said Wilkie.
According to the government of the state, these elections will largely offset the recent cuts.
But the health spokesman of the opposition at federal level, Peter Dutton, believes that today's announcement is just a 'pavement'.
"We are therefore in a position today because the Labor Government has deducted $430 million from the health system," he said to ABC TV.
It can't be that a state government takes nearly half a billion dollars out of the system and puts the Commonwealth 300 million in and then pretends to be good news.
Dutton asked Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the rescue package would be issued for additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux's adaptation of the novel by Denis Diderot convinces with exceptional production equipment and contemporary details, however, it is also more severe than necessary.
The action played in France in the 1760s tells the gripping story of Suzanne, a young nobleman sent to the monastery by her family.
When she rebels, she is confronted with the extreme cruelty of an extremely sadistic superior and becomes the object of erotic fascination with another.
The film never slips into lust or sensational lust – and in it lies its problem.
The solemn seriousness with which the film is told also makes him a tormentive penitentiary for the audience.
Syria has destroyed its ability to produce chemical weapons, according to a monitoring group
Syria has destroyed important chemical weapons and poison gas ammunition facilities, the Global Chemical Weapons Monitoring Group declared on Thursday, while in the north of the country there have been serious collisions near one of the sites where probably toxic substances are stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed three years ago since the start of the civil war.
The announcement of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came one day before the date on
1 November, the organization Damascus, based in The Hague, set up to destroy or make 'operable' all chemical weapons manufacturing facilities, including all machinery for mixing chemicals to poison gas and filling ammunition.
The completion of this process, which is basically the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at destroying all chemical chemistry in Syria by mid-2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Damascus, however, has yet to begin to destroy the existing weapons and stocks.
It is believed that there are about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons in the country, including mustard gas and the nerve gas Sarin.
The announcement came at a time when, on Thursday, fighting took place in the city of Safira, experts say there was a chemical weapons production facility, as reported by the UK-based Syrian human rights observation agency.
On Thursday, the activist group, who is persecuting the number of dead over a network of activists in Syria, declared that 120,296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 are civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the side of the government, 29.954 of them belonged to the army of President Bashar Assad that 18,678 were government-friendly fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias.
Also among the dead are 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
On 25 July, the UN estimated the number of deaths in this conflict since March 2011 to 100,000.
This number has not been updated yet.
The conflict has forced about two million people to flee the country.
Assad's troops have been fighting against the rebels in Safira for weeks, many of which have connections to al-Qaida groups.
The Observatory said there had been losses on both sides on Thursday, but did not mention any details.
The struggles underscore the danger that chemical weapons inspectors are exposed to, because their mission to free Syria from its toxic arsenal of weapons is a race against the time in the midst of a raged civil war.
According to OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, the team "is now convinced that all the important production and mixing/filling facilities mentioned by Syria have been seen and experienced their destruction."
This is why no further inspection activities are currently planned.
At the beginning of the week, the inspectors had declared that they had completed the first round of inspections and had visited 21 out of 23 of the sites indicated by Damascus.
Because of safety concerns, the inspectors said that the visit of two institutions was not possible.
On Thursday, OPWC stated that the two sites had been "resigned ... and the existing objects of the chemical weapons programme had been moved to other sites inspected."
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons to be approved by the OPWC Executive Committee next month.
"I put the hat against the bravery and courage you have shown all in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organization," said Ahmed Uzumcu, Director-General of the Monitoring Organisation, in a comment published by OPCW.
For three years now, the chiefly Sunni Muslim rebels have been fighting against Assad's government and its security forces, many members of the Alawites, a division of Shiite Islam.
With regard to further developments, the head of the observation group, Rami Abdurrahman said that there had been a strong explosion in an air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia on Wednesday.
The cause of the explosion was unknown, he explained.
Angry about Judgment for Bomb Army of Bali
Survivors and relatives of 202 people killed during the 2002 bombing in Bali were annoyed at the judgment for the last of the instigators who were put to trial, since Umar Patek was supposed to be shot by law.
Patek, who had been on the run for almost ten years as one of the most sought-after people of Southeast Asia, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in building explosives for the bomb attack.
He could be released after 15 years with suspension.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder because of the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, where 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many more were injured.
A debt was also made in a number of terrorist-related charges, including a wave of explosive attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The Public Prosecutor's Office had demanded a life sentence, even if it could have applied for the death penalty for the man who, because of his reputation as a master bomb maker, is also known as a "Demolition Man".
The decision aroused painful memories of June Corteen, a mother from Perth who lost her 39-year-old twin daughter Jane and Jenny in the devastation of Patek and his conspirators nearly ten years ago.
Fighting tears, she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really mean he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
"You should put him in front of a shooting command," Corteen said to AAP.
I have to live every day with the fact that I won't get any more grandchildren and I'll never see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was leveled to the ground when, on October 12, 2002, a huge bomb exploded in a small truck parked in front of the nightclub shortly after 23 o'clock.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar, where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide killer had a rucksack filled with explosives exploded.
He fell into the coma for a month and "died" three times after the attack, while hanging on a life support system.
Hughes said Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the Jemaah Islamiah terrorist cell – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the massacre and were executed four years ago.
Really, this guy should get the death penalty before everyone else.
To leave him alive – no, there is no reason to let him live.
Getting 20 years after he's killed 202 people and hurt many hundreds isn't much.
Patek is the last of the Bali Bombers to stand in court.
He escaped nearly a decade of arrest, but was finally taken up in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where US forces killed the former al-Qaida boss Osama bin Laden almost four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent said that intelligence reports had provided the indication that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden to rebuild the connection between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaida.
"He didn't stand up," said Corteen.
Until recently, he has not repented of how much suffering he has caused to other people.
The sentence took place before the 10th anniversary of the attack this year, which is celebrated with commemorative celebrations in Bali and Australia.
"There will be many tears this year," said Corteen.
Patek can still appeal against his judgment.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices in aircraft (but do not have mobile calls)
From departure to landing, passengers can now listen to their electronic devices for reading, working, playing, listening to music and using the reputation of movies, but not by phone, according to the new guidelines published by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the USA on Thursday.
However, passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
How quickly they would be implemented depends on the respective airline, said FAA employee Michael Huerta at a press conference.
Air carriers shall prove to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the flight staff training manuals and the equipment storage rules in accordance with the new rules.
The FAA stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue.
"Depending on the state of the plan, we could very soon approve the extended use of electronic devices," the FAA announced in a statement.
Passengers currently have to shut down smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.
They may not start until the plane reaches a height of three kilometres and the captain gives green light.
When entering the landing flight, passengers must shut them down again and not start them again until the plane has landed.
According to the new directives, airlines whose aircraft are secured against electronic disturbances could allow their passengers to use the equipment even at take-off, landing and rolling-field, the FAA explained.
Most new aircraft and other aircraft converted for Wi-Fi use at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the professional association of professional flight attendants, welcomed the changes.
"If the new regulation is implemented safely – and we work closely with the airline in this regard – both sides will benefit from it," said Glading.
To be honest, we are sorry to have to feel like caretakers on this issue.
Nevertheless, Internet connection for surfing, sharing emails, text messages, or downloading data under three kilometers remained prohibited, the Authority explained.
Passengers are invited to move smartphones, tablets and other devices into flight mode.
So still no "Words With Friends", the Scrabble-like online game that the actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he had to leave a public jet of American Airlines effectively because he refused to shut down the device while the plane was parked on the platform.
And heavier devices, such as laptops, must continue to be stowed, as there is a risk of injury here if they fly through the cabin.
Mobile phone calls during the flight continue to be prohibited.
The regulatory competence for telephone calls lies with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not the FAA.
FAA may abolish ban on certain electronic devices at take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker said from the National Transport Safety Board, safety expert for national transport issues on CBS news, mobile phones would still be considered as a risk.
"Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they could cause potential disturbances in navigational devices, but because we know from the FCC that transmission from the air can also disrupt transmission masts," says Rosenker.
A industry advisory committee, launched by the FAA to investigate this issue, recommended last month that the government permit a wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years the pressure on FAA has increased to ease restrictions on use.
Critics such as the democratic Senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri consider that there are no valid security grounds for the ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of the equipment has become omnipresent.
In some studies, there is talk of the fact that up to a third of passengers forget to shut down or ignore the equipment.
The FAA began to restrict the use of electronic devices by air passengers in 1966, after reports of disturbances in navigation and communication equipment by passengers-run VHF radios, which were the latest technology trend at the time.
New aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than earlier generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by FAA that they have nothing to do with electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering passengers Wi-Fi for several years when the altitude is reached.
The flyers adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more insensitive to interference.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the greater use of electronic devices in accordance with the new guidelines, said Huerta.
Today's electronic devices generally emit much less radio radiation than earlier generations.
For example, e-reader only emits minimal radiation when you turn around.
However, when downloading or sending data, the transmission values are stronger.
One of the advocates of easing the restrictions on the use of devices by passengers is Amazon.com.
In 2011 company employees invited a passenger aircraft full of Kindle E-Reader and made a test flight to identify problems, but could not detect any.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings as to the risk of using equipment.
Douglas Kidd of the Passenger Association National Association of Airline Passengers said he felt that the interference from the equipment was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other committee members said that there were only isolated reports of pilots who spoke for a malfunction of aircraft systems through the devices, and most of them were very old.
The FAA recommended, however, that pilots should be allowed to arrange the removal of the equipment by passengers in the event of instrument landing under bad visual conditions.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as a reasonable adjustment for travellers who would today be fully equipped with technology.
“We are pleased that FAA recognises that a pleasant passenger experience is not in conflict with safety,” said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Bird rescued from North Sea Bohr Island again released by air rescue service
A bird flying along the coast, exhausted on a North Sea drilling island, was released into the wild again.
The Water Ralle was flown last month with a helicopter to Aberdeen, where it was piled up by the Scottish animal protection organization SPCA in its rescue center in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, Head of the Centre, said: "This water ray was probably a winter migratory bird from northern Europe, which was stopped by the strong winds over the North Sea."
Apparently, the exhausted bird sought refuge on the drilling island.
He added: "He could no longer fly on, so we were contacted with the request for help."
When she was released, the water ralle was fit and healthy again.
Is Europe's elite ready to do business with the UK?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy to a table and defining what those in the UK want to change their relations with the EU.
To this end, we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey among British economic leaders and asked them what they think about Great Britain, the economy and the EU.
YouGov surveyed over 1,000 managers from the economy, representing, for example, British enterprise sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We have found out that the vast majority of companies are now exporting outside Europe and focusing on countries that are modernising and growing, while the EU states are stagnating.
They want new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil to be favoured from the government instead of stopping the long and strenuous process of reforming the obscure EU institutions.
Asked for their opinion on certain issues governed by law – from antitrust law to product legislation – the majority of economic leaders believe that the control of these key competences should be recovered to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the internal market, as companies said that the costs of Brussels rules would now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe's trading zone – even 40 percent of large companies agreed with what is traditionally the most Europe-friendly.
Finally, and this probably says most, our survey of economic leaders showed that a clear majority of Britain wants a course towards change in the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade not on politics.
This knowledge, which is found among companies of all sizes and leading groups, shows that the economy is pressing for a "senseful change" that brings the issue of action back to the UK.
There is much to be said – a change in the agreement and better conditions for the UK would lead to a change of opinion in favour of the EU's stay in a referendum at 16 percent.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this survey shows that the British economy is behind its plan for renegotiating the British conditions for EU membership.
It also shows that companies expect a renegotiation of power relations back to the UK.
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary after the eurozone is now moving towards a closer economic and fiscal union.
Priority must be given to jobs and growth in the UK, as the result of our survey shows, which for businesses means a stronger focus on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulations.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom describes pipeline in Bulgaria as the beginning of a new gas era
The start of the construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria is the start of one of the largest European energy projects, said the Gazprom Board.
"Today's event is a milestone: the construction work on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun," said Gazprom's CEO Alexei Miller, in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element in the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream aims to increase the diversity of Russia's export routes across Europe.
A contract dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine, where most of the Russian gas is stored for Europe, increases the risk of conventional routes, as can be heard from the official side.
Miller said that the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries have been eliminated forever.
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream at reduced tariffs when the entire project goes into operation in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction work is to begin in other neighbouring countries on the planned route at the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic metres of natural gas.
For national and international investors, no way leads past the real estate location of Germany.
The economic frameworks are correct, and the financing options are excellent.
This has been the tenor of the 9th real estate day of the stock exchange newspaper.
The German real estate markets benefit from the economic strength and the good economic conditions in the country in Europe.
Christian Ulbrich, CEO of Europe, Middle East and Africa of Jones Lang LaSalle, pointed this out on the 9th real estate day of the stock exchange newspaper.
According to Ulbrich, as German commercial real estate was seeking, the view of the transaction volume shows.
In the first three quarters of this year, it increased by 31% compared to the previous year.
In the UK, the increase was only 6%, in France it was 19%.
"Real estate investments offer attractive interest rates," said Ulbrich.
The yield gap between real estate and federal bonds is at a historically high level.

Hearing before the Royal Commission: Two YMCA employees charged with charges against Jonathan Lord for sexual offences
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) had been charged with sexual offences related to children before being accused of child career Jonathan Lord from Caringbah in 2011, as the Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse of Children was told.
However, in the opening statement before the Commission, the YMCA had stated that it had never had to do with an incident of sexual child abuse in the organization.
Managing Director Phillip Hare was asked about a case in which a YMCA employee had been charged with child pornography crimes and another in which a sports teacher at the YMCA Caringbah Hall was sentenced to him for the abuse of trusted children in 1991.
Hare said Gail Furness, one of the Commission's assistant lawyers, that he knew of the first case but did not know the second.
He acknowledged that the YMCA's opening statement to the Commission had also been inaccurate in the claim that 'there had been external inspections of the YMCA in which the YMCA was recognised as at the forefront of child safety'.
Instead, evidence before the Commission shows that YMCA has been informed that it has received the second lowest assessment of four potentials in a quality audit carried out by the Department of Education and Communities (Ministry of Education) in August of the year.
Hare, who started at the YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that the management had failed "from me downward" in the recruitment of Lord and did not ensure that employees had been aware of their obligations to report violations of the Child Safety Guidelines.
Lord had been sentenced to the YMCA at the beginning of the year for sexual offenses against twelve boys during his two years of activity.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
Hers argued, however, that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented employees from reporting Lord's violations of the safety of children.
The staff said that they had observed violations, among other things, that Lord was alone with children, privately cared for her as a babysitter, sat her on his lap, told one that he loved it, and let children play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose superior was Lord and who had asked for a child protection training because she was concerned about his conduct, said that the child service manager Jacqui Barnat, who was the superior Lords in the YMCA Caringbah, was "very intimidating and most of the time very unapproachable".
The managing director stated that he would not accept statements from employees that they would not have dared to report to their superiors.
Instead, he said, rather, their friendship with Lord had affected their judgment, which is why they had not reported him.
Hare stated that he had informed the Management Board of YMCA NSW that the lesson the organization had to draw from the "Jonathan Lord incident" was "not to report" by employees, and the Board had agreed to it.
Hare said that the decision to urge employees to sign secrecy obligations shortly after the charges occurred had been made by the managing director of the YMCA Children's Services, Liam Whitley.
He said that this should prevent the contamination of the evidence, but what had been 'excessive' and misinterpreted.
The YMCA NSW was not a child-safe organization during the period when Jonathan Lord was employed there between 2009 and 2011, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, expert on sexual child abuse, explained to the Commission.
He explained that there were 'serious problems' in the recruitment, review, inclusion, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing was postponed until 20 December.
Tony Blair said he would take the opportunity to return as British Prime Minister, but acknowledges that a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview tonight on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his retirement from office, the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic issues.
Since his resignation in June 2007, after a decade as head of state, Blair has largely avoided expressing his views on British politics, and has mostly limited his comments to foreign policy and his role as ambassador of the quartet of the Peacekeepers in the Middle East.
On the question of whether he would like to return to the Prime Minister's office, Blair was quoted by the Evening Standard from London with the words: "Yes, sure, but it is unlikely that this will happen, so..."
When the horse show experts found themselves in groups in Cardiff to curry the horse of the year, they were aware that a tough competition was coming.
But no one was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The Knirps, who is not even in the kindergarten and has only taken his first steps a few months ago, and his Shetland-Pony Toffee wandered loosely through the three laps and won the first prize – leaving 30 adult opponents behind.
The inseparable couple, both equally large, were praised for their performance, behaviour and style in the annual competition organised by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
At his appearance in competition with men and women with elegant melons, he had put his plate cap on a cheeky angle and led the two-year-old toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural abilities in dealing with the pony, which lies far beyond his age.
And Toffee got top marks for his appearance and personality.
Fenton had received Toffee as a gift for his third birthday last March and has been practicing with the Shetland pony every day since then.
His mother, Donna, 30, said: "Fenton and Toffee are a great team."
They had to compete against the entire field of participants and left the place with gold cup and rosette.
It was only the second time he had participated in a competition with Toffee, and we were all thrilled when he won.
Perfect strangers in the arena thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showing horses for over ten years.
Howells said: "The whole audience was as electrified and everyone fired and clattered him."
He ran on sand the entire length of the arena and although he looked so tiny, he did fantastic work.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens he cares for.
As he started, it won't take long until he's on the "horse of the year" show – and I'm sure he'll cut off well.
A spokesman for the annual horse show said: "Fenton is only three, but he knows how to deal with his pony."
Together they are a great team.
The jurors evaluated Fenton and Toffee according to how well they had beat themselves and presented themselves in the screening ring.
They pay attention to good cooperation between Pony and Führer – and there were Fenton and Toffee the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton's sweet clothes contributed to their part, which was really perfect for the occasion.
Chinese newspaper is to be "reformed" after call
A Chinese newspaper, which had demanded the release of a reporter who had been charged with diffamation, was to be reformed on the front page, said a press regulator.
The Guangzhou-based New Express had printed a rare public call for the release of the journalist Chen Yongzhou.
However, Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to falsify reports about a state company.
Now the New Express is being subjected to a 'comprehensive rectification', said the regulatory authority.
The "Rectification Order" was issued by the Office for Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television in Guangdong.
Preliminary investigations revealed that the New Express, which belongs to the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several inapplicable reports on the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
'The editorial management of the New Express was unordered', the regulatory authority announced in a statement.
She said that it had been decided to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou and to withdraw his reporter's license.
In addition, "Yangcheng Evening News Group has been instructed to complete the New Express rectification and recommended to identify the relevant managers at the New Express and to review immediately the management team of the New Express."
Chen had written several articles for the New Express, in which he reported alleged financial irregularities in a manufacturer of construction machinery called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and behind his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false reports against payment.
"In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion as well as the entire news industry and its ability to gain public confidence," he said to the state news channel CCTV.
I did it primarily because I was out on money and fame.
I've come to realize that I've done wrong.
Following Chen's apologies, the New Express published an excuse on the front page and explained that it had failed to review the reports correctly.
Several well-known suspects have recently made confessions on television.
Experts say that confessions are still routinely forced, despite a change in the law at the beginning of the year in which the authorities were forbidden to force someone to accuse themselves.
Drug tunnels with own railway between the USA and Mexico discovered
One of the most refined tunnels for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico, fully equipped with lighting, ventilation and electric railway operation, has now been discovered.
The US authorities described the 120-by-90-centimetre tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages they had ever found.
The tunnel, which runs in the zigzag pattern over a length of just under six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
In the area there are countless inconceivable warehouses, which makes it easier to hide drug-laden trucks.
The tunnel had been closed before drugs could be transported unrecognized, the authorities explained.
According to the Court’s records, eight and a half tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were ensured during the discovery of the tunnel.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers were charged with the possession and intended sale of marijuana and cocaine.
They are threatened with prison sentences between ten and a lifetime.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth large passage that has been discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in Central Mexico in October, which presents the drug cartels with the challenge of quickly bringing their product to the consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a nearly 640-metre-long passage with rails that went from a kitchen in a residential house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love themselves
Actor Orlando Bloom and Model Miranda Kerr want to go separate ways in the future.
In an interview, however, Bloom said that he and Kerr still love themselves.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of the two-year-old Flynn.
Actor Orlando Bloom has spoken for separation from his wife, top model Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with U.S. journalist Katie Couric, who should be broadcast on Friday (local time), Bloom said, "life sometimes doesn't go exactly as we plan or hope."
Kerr and himself still loved themselves, stressed the 36-year-old.
"We will support each other and love each other as parents of Flynn."
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010, and their son Flynn was born in 2011.
According to Lexika, veganism is subject to vegetarianism, but it is quite different from that.
While vegetarians allow themselves to eat cream cakes, ice cream or a strong edamer, these muzzles are not on the menu of a vegan.
Milk, cheese, egg, in addition to the renunciation of meat and fish, the vegan leaves off from all consumption of animal products - honey is also denied.
What remains may one wonder, but on closer consideration the vegan world of nutrition is characterized by a remarkable ingenuity.
"Bread spreads are very popular," explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the local reform house, which offers a variety of special products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the shop in the Domgasse.
For 13 years, the native of the New Zealand vegan lives, and in Lampertheim, he (almost) finds everything he needs to live. "In 1997 I changed my diet and became a vegetarian".
At the turn of the century, the next step was taken, and I became Veganer.
"The conviction came not only because of the diet, but because of the choice of shoes," says Proctor, who prefers artificial leather to normal leather.
He realized that it is also in other everyday concerns without animal products.
First of all, vegan is an ethics.
"I don't want animals to die for me," Proctor says the vegans' maximum, which extends to the entire consumption behaviour.
Instead of grieving burgers, rumblings or rubber bears, the Vegan quickly discovered completely new products, the enthusiasm increased.
"It's a double bonus," says Proctor today, "in fact, vegan doesn't represent a renunciation, it's not an ascetic, it's an enrichment."The assumption that with the change of diet you reduce the selection of food options, Proctor rather leads back to the power of habit.
And precisely these conditions also failed some of the attempts still so well meant.
"The addiction factor is a very crucial factor that makes many give up quickly, similar to smoking," Proctor compares.
And turn to: " Certain tastes are not to be tied to the animal".
Often it is the spices or the type of preparation that makes the taste.
"But you can also generate the same effect in other ways," explains the Vegan.
For example, Proctor brings eggplants, mushrooms and also some vegan sausages to a barbecue festival.
It pays attention to a balanced, varied diet, in which it should taste quite defiantly.
Of course, you want something between your teeth, that's legitimate.
"It should taste, but that is not only to reduce animal food," says Proctor.
Health damage to eating disorders, another widespread assumption, he did not suffer.
For me, the changeover had a positive aspect.
I do not take any foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin content.
There are high-performance athletes who feed exclusively on vegan.
"My blood values are good, I'm often checked," Proctor reveals.
Especially against the lack of vitamin B12, many Vegansimus critics warn.
"As animals are fed with feed instead of grassing on the pasture, it is questionable whether the vitamin B12 proportion is high in the meat that you buy in the cold store," says Proctor.
There is also the possibility for vegans to take the coenzyme in the form of tablets.
"My B12 values are fine," he explains.
Proctor should not go far for food procurement.
Finally, there are basic foods everywhere and every supermarket now has soy milk and other products.
Everything I need, I'll find it on site.
Only occasionally I buy something special.
"Many people overlook that only the finished products are expensive, but so is the practice of "ordinary" finished products.
In any event, the preparation of vegan dishes is far cheaper and less time-consuming than is generally assumed.
"In the kitchen there is much to discover, with a few small tricks you can achieve good, if not partially better results," says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, slightly more baking powder and carbonic acid instead of egg, with his vegan cheese cake, Proctor could also surprise his parents-in-law.
Family celebrations give the Vegan a new flavor.
It's dynamic when you cook together, it's a new priority.
"The situations that can arise are as different as the people themselves," says Proctor.
Of course, skepticism has already been brought to him.
Don't you like my food?
"Should I feel bad now because I drink milk?" - On such questions you have to act as a vegan with a fingertip feeling.
"I do not reject the people, I am part of this society," Proctor does not want an enclave date.
And more precisely, the everyday world does not seem as vegan as suspected - and the vegan does not seem as restricted in everyday life as generally assumed.
Fast food is also allowed.
Pommes are everywhere!
"Many donor shops offer falafel, or just a vegetarian Yufka," says Proctor.
In a pizzeria he alternates on pasta dishes, or just ordered a pizza without cheese, all a question of habit.
The restaurants are so slow about it.
"When I started feeding vegan 13 years ago, everything was much more difficult," the New Zealander can find a development: "You have to talk to the people, make them aware of it."
"When sufficient demand comes, they may be inclined to supplement the menu," he hopes.
Vegane restaurants develop, such as the building in Mannheim or the café Vogelfrei.
Proctor wants other restaurants to have at least one vegan dish on the menu.
Basically vegan dishes are there for everyone.
Everyone can eat them, so they are just the opposite of exclusive.
"The meat dishes are exclusive, in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others," Proctor notes.
"If you want to avoid food scandals, Veganism is a sure way to make most of it impossible from the outset," says Proctor.
However, the purchase of vegan products could be a bit difficult at the beginning.
Especially when one learns to understand that animal additives can also be included in peanuts as colorers, one quickly seems to leave courage with the observance of ethics in so many obstacles and traps.
Not only that is why Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen have written a book: "Veganissimo - Animal Ingredients and their Alternatives" explains the many ingredients that are buried in food but also detergents.
"You gradually develop a scanner look and know what signs and logos you have to pay attention to "It is sometimes better to take small steps than to stop or stumble," Proctor knows.
Veganism, it is an important moral finger-point that hits consciousness.
Perhaps he is not quite able to get rid of his habits, but at least he can teach consumers to critically question his habits.
The stock market operator Nasdaq OMX keeps its customers in breath.
Trade at Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon German time.
In a communication, the operator was responsible for technical problems.
The other eleven US option markets, including two of Nasdaq OMX, continued their business unhindered.
The recent incident continues a whole series of smaller and larger pans at the stock market operator.
It was not until Tuesday that the indices of the Nasdaq had not been calculated for an hour due to errors in data transport.
In August of this year, there had been two pans in one week alone.
First, the US investment bank Goldman Sachs had sent massively faulty purchase orders to the option markets due to technical problems.
As a result, the stock market operators needed almost a whole day to see through and delete the orders.
Two days later, half of the total stock trade in the United States fell asleep in a computer pan on the Nasdaq stock exchange for several hours.
In addition, the Facebook stock exchange last year had provided attention.
The Nasdaq systems had not grown the flood of purchase and sale orders, later determined the SEC stock exchange supervision and thundered the company to record a fine of 10 million dollars.
Constance: Radler drives around 63-year-olds
The accident was reported by the police when a 26-year-old man on Thursday evening, around 22 o'clock, was on the left walk from the station to the marketplace with a women's bicycle.
When suddenly a 63 - year - old man from a local took the walkway, the cyclist could no longer brake in time, according to the police.
In the following collision, the pedestrian was pushed against the wall of the house, went to the ground in the further course and drew a 15-centimetre long square wound on the head.
A rescue team took the injured to the clinic for medical treatment.
British Police Sends Assange a Delivery Notice
The British police today issued a delivery notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard stated that the 40-year-old Australian had been given a "invitation to present himself" which required him to appear in a police station and added that if he did not comply, the arrest threatened him.
Assange threatens to be extradited to Sweden for the charges in a sexual offence after having exhausted its possibilities under British law, since the Supreme Court has rejected its opposition to extradition at the beginning of the month.
Fearing that Stockholm would deliver it to the United States, he had sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on 19 June and asked the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard said: "A 40-year-old man has given an invitation to stand at a police station at a time chosen by us."
He continues to violate the conditions of his release on bail.
The embassy did not comment on the delivery of the police call.
Assange fears that he will be delivered from Sweden to the United States and charged there for possible espionage accusations after he has published over 250,000 diplomatic news on the WikiLeaks website.
Driver with 210 km/h and hot drink between legs receives 1.000 £ penalty
A car driver was fined £1,000 for driving up to 210 km/h and a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped on 27 May with his Mercedes Benz at the A120 at Braintree.
After the police stopped him, they discovered the beverage cup between his legs.
In front of the Colchester District Court, Howie confessed guilty without having taken the necessary care and attention.
He received seven points and a six-month ban on driving.
Howie was also sentenced to a cost of £90 and a premium of £100.
Tax on foreign property owners against London's speculation bubble
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally calculated the CGT measure, but is still waiting for the final decision of Chancellor George Osborne, who in the 2012 budget had a stamp tax of 7 % on apartments costing over two million pounds and annual fees for buyers holding apartments as a company and not as individuals.
Already, the revenue from the stamp tax on residential property in the Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea districts, which in 2012/13 amounted to 708 million pounds, has totaled the proceeds for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North East, Northwest, Yorkshire and the Humber region.
Cook said: "After the increases in the stamp tax on high-priced housing and the introduction of the related legislation against circumvention, it is difficult to claim that high-quality real estate is too low, regardless of the effects of the obsolete municipal tax system."
"But this step could make some foreign investors more reticent as to the purchase of real estate in London, or prevent owners from selling it," he added.
First-class properties – the top five to ten percent of the housing market by price – in the wealthy London South West Belt, which extends from Fulham to Wimbledon, have increased by 11.8% last year.
The prices in Central London showed a steady annual growth rate of 5.6%, but were overestimated by an emerging domestic market where the south-western part of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) experienced an upward trend, according to Savills.
Scientists were able to shed more light on the connection between the tailing of a dog and its mood.
Previous research had shown that happy dogs with their tail were moving more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while it was the left side in nervous dogs.
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive and react to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trent, said: "It is well known to people that the left and right brains react differently to stimuli that cause positive or negative emotions."
Here we have tried to see this with other species.
He also noted that in dogs the right half of the brain was responsible for the movement of the left side and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the feelings.
To learn more about how dogs react to the lateral tailing of their fellows, the researchers monitored the animals while these movies of other dogs looked at themselves.
They measured the heart rate of the quadruples and analyzed the behavior.
Probably we'll soon understand why the cock is moving in one direction, sometimes in the other direction.
Professor Vallortigara said: "We showed the dogs films with dogs – either a natural version or a silhouette to eliminate divergent other aspects, and we were able to control the movement of the tail more to the left or to the right."
When the animals saw how an otherwise expressive dog moved the tail to the right (seen from the perspective of the dogging dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But if the tail inclination was primarily left (again from the perspective of the dog that wetters), their heart rate rose and they looked restless.
According to Professor Vallortigara, the dogs do not deliberately communicate with each other through these movements.
Rather, he is convinced that the dogs have learned from experience what movements they should worry about and when not.
He said: "If you have different encounters with other dogs and the weddling is associated with the tail in one direction rather with friendly behavior and the right side rather produces a less friendly behavior, then you react on the basis of these experiences."
The researchers say that the findings could help dog owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand their animal's emotions.
John Bradshaw, an expert on dog behavior and guest scholarship at the University of Bristol's Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, explained that this was not the first study to investigate the importance of the left and right for dogs.
Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found out that dogs turn their head to the left when they look at an aggressive dog, and to the right when it comes to a satisfied dog.
In another research work at the University of Victoria in Canada, the following said: “Dogs are more likely to go to a robot dog when its ‘tail’ is swirling left and not right, instead of becoming restless – exactly the other way around than in the Italian study.”
According to his statement, the differences could therefore be caused by the fact that the dogs in the various studies did not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help, he explained.
"Although there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brain halves are used for different purposes, many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs are no exception," says Bradshaw.
However, since their behavior is simply recorded, it will probably not take long until we understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction, sometimes in the other.
Arctic Monkeys to postpone appearance in Glasgow because of Alex Turners’ disease
The Arctic Monkeys rock band has postponed a performance in Glasgow after their lead singer is inflamed with throat inflammation.
The band from Sheffield was supposed to play in the hydro on Friday.
However, because of the disease of lead singer Alex Turner, the concert has to be moved.
The band's announcement came after she had to postpone a performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys said: "After the decision to cancel the show at the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and on medical advice, Arctic Monkeys must also cancel the show in the Hydro in Glasgow on Friday, 1 November."
"At Alex Turner, a throat inflammation was diagnosed, which is why he cannot occur."
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham is now taking place on November 20, which was held in the Hydro in Glasgow on November 21.
All tickets are valid for these shows.
We apologize to all ticket holders for the inconveniences caused by this.
Please contact the customer service at the point of sale where you bought your ticket if you need further support.
Pope Francis appoints first cardinals in February
Pope Francis was first appointed Cardinals of the Catholic Church on February 22nd, as announced by the Vatican on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest clergy in the Catholic Church after the Pope, and they are also the ones who choose a Pope, so that Francis will be appointed as the first group of men who will eventually participate in the election of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal who has reached an age of 80 years can no longer participate in the Pope's election – this is true of a group of 120 "electorate cardinals".
In a statement in which the message was announced, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman of the Vatican, said that there would be a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony for the appointment of the new cardinals, also known as the Consistory.
"Pope Francis has decided to announce in advance his decision to convene the Consistory in February so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from all over the world can be planned," said Lombardi.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of elected cardinals was likely to fall by February.
He declared that a pope normally appoints as many cardinals as necessary, so that the number of cardinals entitled to vote will be 120 again, and as many cardinals as he wants.
The consistory next year is therefore significant because it is the first since the election of Francis in March this year, Valero says.
There is currently a certain overhang on the part of Europe and, in particular, Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
The cardinals will also be the first to be called, since the formation of the Council of the Cardinals founded by Francis, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world who have the task of finding ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope alone decided everything.
"Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," said Valero.
He explained that it was "good possible" for Francis to ask the cardinals for advice.
But so far we have not been in this position – that is all completely new.
Valero said that the bishops would typically be called cardinals from large towns, but Francis was “full of surprises – so we do not know who he appoints.”
GM calls back new pickup trucks in the USA to repair the seatrest
General Motors recalled almost 19,000 of its brand new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra Pickup trucks with year 2014 to solve a problem with manually adjustable seatrest, according to a communication from the US vehicle safety regulatory authority on Friday.
In some of the cars there may be a defect in the mechanism for resetting the front seat seat.
For this reason, they do not comply with the federal vehicle safety guidelines for head restraints.
"If the vehicle is driven from the rear, it is possible that the head restraint does not properly protect the inmates, so that there is an increased risk of injury," was read in the news on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website.
The recovered models were produced between 1 August and 10 September.
The delivery of GM trucks began in June and is the main model launch of the leading US car manufacturer since the insolvency-related restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the vehicle owners of the defect in the first half of October.
The NHTSA could not verify the notification letter because of the 16-day Government Shutdown, which had a negative impact on car sales in October.
The sale of the Silverado and Sierra trucks, which were newly developed for the 2014 model year, increased by 20 percent in the first ten months of the year, said GM on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra Pickup trucks.
The GM share on the New York Stock Exchange rose 1.4 percent to 37.47 US dollars on Friday afternoon.
Obstacle of an Obama elector
I have elected President Obama twice in the hope that change will be possible
He says Obama has made commendable efforts to prevent the blockade tactics of the Republicans.
The blockade policy does not excuse Obamacare's website problems, the drone attacks
Obama's memoirs about the 2008 election campaign were a sad reminder of what would have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am currently reading a very sad book.
It's a book that I believed would make me feel sick during the bleak second year of my medical study and give me hope again.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" (Mut to Win) and describes the memoirs Barack Obamas for the 2008 presidential election.
When I finish my patient writings in the evening and go to bed, the book leads me back to a time when politics inspired millions and a speech could take the breath.
The election was a landslide victory, and news spokespersons kept in mind the historical significance of this hour.
My classmates wept with joy, and my parents gathered all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on their way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
In 2008, when Obama moved into office, he had 82% approval.
And then I close the book.
Switching back to the present is a bad awakening, as if being torn out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed possibilities.
In the years since I first gave my vote, something has actually changed.
But it's just nothing I could have imagined.
I acknowledge the great and versatile things that Obama has achieved, from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for Health Insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the forced concealment of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I also believe that the political blockade tactics of the parties have overturned efforts to bring our nation forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closing of Guantanamo Bay, to name but a few.
But after I have defended the Obama government to colleagues and acquaintances countless times, I have reached the end of my attempts to explain.
I have reached a point of political despair.
Republican blockade politics cannot explain why it is allowed to hear foreign heads of state or the killing of innocent children by drones in overseas.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on the private life of Americans and why whistleblowers are punished to reveal state misconduct.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, was murdered without trial, nor why the public funding and spending limits were circumvented during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the results of a report which states that the White House's efforts to calm the media are the most aggressive ... since the Nixon government.
And recently, it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in the more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if it's what I should have expected.
Whether I should have understood at the age of 18 that government work could contradict its previous political campaigns.
Obviously, the office of Deputies is not a predictable course, as an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown Massacre shape the public discussion.
But if I look at the above examples, they seem to be largely elected by the government itself.
And that bothers me the most.
I chose Obama again in 2012, not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a confusing and unfavorable alternative; he seemed unable to determine his direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second term of office for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfill the hope we had heard of for so long.
But with the reduction of the approval values for Obama to less than 45% this week, the return to 2008 through this book has become even harder.
It awakens in me the longing for the many promises that have dissolved into the air.
This week I read a section in the book describing how Obama had to put a serious loss to Clinton in the elections in Pennsylvania.
In a meeting with the electorate after the decision, he told his staff that they had to get back on track and follow the purpose of their cause.
"I want us to find our magic again," he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It's five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree to you any more.
The views expressed in this comment are exclusively those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott had a conflict of interest in parental leave
Billionaire and Deputy Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest in his parental leave plans because his daughters are becoming pregnant and could therefore benefit from them.
The mining magnate, in a judicial dispute over the payment of $6 million in CO2 tax, made the claim when he wanted to ask questions from the table if he was in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which are important for deciding whether to delete or reduce CO2 and mining taxes.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and the daughters of Abbott would personally benefit from the laws.
"He is in a big conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because when one of his daughters becomes pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether she gets a vacation or not," said Palmer.
Two months after the election, the election commission Palmer officially declared the winner of the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax with 53 votes in advance after the re-counting.
Palmer called for a revision of the process of counting votes so that it could proceed faster.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the voting?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why should we not have a system in which we enter data entering a computer, choose immediately and then have the result at 6:30 in the evening?
Palmer also criticised the use of pencils in marking the voting notes.
Do you use them because you can erase the results if you don't like them?
To vote with pencils these days is incredible.
The Electoral Commission has examined the options for an electronic election and recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, stated that his policy included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new office "very seriously".
A public office is about the service to the public.
"We are not striving for any reward other than that of history, that we can serve in a critical time of this community," he said.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange dealers
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two dealers from its foreign exchange department, two people who are familiar with the situation; this is another indication that the worldwide official investigation on the alleged manipulations on the monetary market is rapidly taking place.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they are working with the authorities in the investigations in the world's largest financial market, on which 5.3 billion US dollars a day change the owner.
The two dealers would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the expanding investigation, which the scandal involves in the Libor interbank business.
The Bank, which did not comment on the suspensions, confirmed that it had received information requests from authorities this month.
"Our investigations on this subject continue and we cooperate fully with the FCA and other regulatory authorities," said the Bank two weeks ago.
Last month, close-up persons reported that the RBS had forwarded the records of e-mails and instant messages sent from and to a previous dealer to the UK supervisory authority, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This dealer, Richard Usher, had left the RBS in 2010 and is said to have been left by his current position as European leader of the Forex Spot trade at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of the European spot trading at Citi, was vacationed this week and Matt Gardiner, former leading currency dealer at Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week at Standard Chartered.
None of these dealers were accused of any misconduct.
Bankers at Barclays and the Citigroup were part of the Instant Message Group of Usher, who said that the situation was close by.
UBS announced this week that it had taken steps against some of its employees after the Swiss regulatory authority had declared Finma that it was investigating a suspected manipulation of the foreign exchange market with a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities worldwide – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Competition Authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently dealing with allegations that bankers are supposed to have agreed on transactions on the monetary market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also initiated internal investigations or received information requests from authorities, said familiar people with the situation.
Banks comb instant messages and emails from several years in search of cases of misconduct.
The news of these investigations has put the merchants in a field in alarm, which in recent years has been one of the most profitable of the trading units of investment banks, but this year was under pressure because low volatility in currencies limits the chances for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to play down the affair and have said that it is almost impossible to manipulate the extensive and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but leading traders are of the opinion that this is not necessarily true.
A leading trader noted that despite the enormous daily volume in foreign exchange trade, the fragmentation of liquidity between the different trading platforms and the increasing use of their own internal platforms by banks led to the fact that "one can influence the market with very low ticket prices".
The news came out on the same day that Credit Suisse announced that she had quit a dealer of her London Exchange Traded Funds office this week after he had caused a loss of just under six million dollars at the end of last year.
The Bank immediately informed the competent authorities and cooperated with them.
"We are sure that the dealer acted alone and that the matter is limited," said Credit Suisse.
Painted the construction fence on the Bechtle property
A group of citizens' initiative "Switzerland meadow" has adorned the building fence on the Bechtle property on the spa promenade in Bad Herrenalb.
In addition, she cleaned and widened her footpath, says a press release.
The planned cover of the disintegrating house in the rear part of the property was not allowed for security reasons, as the site is threatened to slip off.
Alfred Abel, who currently manages the property, had agreed to the beautification action with his colleague Reinhard Domke by the BI.
Before the action of the BI, a banner with the message "We are for it" had been attached.
However, the approximately 20 members of the citizens' initiative had little to do with their action.
Their motto on the big poster was "We are against ruins".
In this way, she wanted to point out the danger of even larger ruins on the Swiss meadow - the giant project should fail one day.
In conversation with many passers-by before the "construction site" it became clear that some citizens believe that the realization of the city's project will be much better, although few have the same questions to the dimension of the project presented as the BI.
But they are beginning to resign because the city is further delaying these answers, it is said by the BI.
The public statements of the mayor also have an effect, as it was to be heard.
In May, at the municipal council meeting, he said that he feared the outing for the thermal bath, if the population voted against the plans for a bath and wellness complex on the Swiss meadow.
Some appear to be just too scared, others feel that they are "plump extortion attempt" on the population, says the press release of the BI.
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all the helpers.
Rangnick-Schelte for Schiris: Mane no swallow king
As satisfied as Ralf Rangnick is with the current form of Bundesliga table leader Red Bull Salzburg, the sports director of the bulls was disappointed by the referees.
"There is currently a dangerous tendency for Mane and Alan to be pushed into the category of swallow kings," he protected the two offensive whirls on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg.
The latest occasion for rangnick's criticism was yellow for mane at 3:0 a.m. against Grödig last Sunday, when Senegalese became a alleged actor - which, of course, was none, as the TV pictures showed.
"A serious misjudgment," said Rangnick, who referred to arbitrator Harkam as "fullly overburdened."
Harkam would also have contributed "his part" to the escalation between Salzburg-Coach Roger Schmidt and Val Gardena-Trainer Adi Hütter after the game.
He defended his German countryman: "I would have behaved like Roger Schmidt in every single situation."
Schmidt himself wants to have no contact with his colleague after the scarf with Hütter.
I don't know why.
"For I am the one who was insulted," stressed the 46-year-old.
However, in view of the success process, rangnick agreed on a praise anthem.
"For that there are only two words: really good," he said.
There's not much to expose.
Especially the way the team plays is impressive.
It's supposed to go on this way.
Framework changes in winter transfer time would hardly exist.
There are no great reasons to change something.
"Besides a player comes up with the wish he wanted to leave the club," said Rannick.
Supreme Court confirmed Obama's Health Law
It is a great victory for the Obama government: The US Supreme Court today ruled that the closely linked health law is constitutional.
With five to four votes, the judges judged that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – it forces US citizens to take out health insurance or pay a penalty by 2014 – is constitutional within the framework of the State tax authority.
The Supreme Judge John Roberts took the side of the four more liberal members of the Chamber, while judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy decided against it.
The Court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2700-page law and also considered that the requirement of the Health Act, according to which states should either extend the access requirements for Medicaid or otherwise all state Medicaid funding would be deleted, was not unconstitutional restrictive.
The proceedings against the law had been tried by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law was decidedly rejected by all the leading Republican presidential candidates, including the final challenger Mitt Romney, in the 2012 pre-election campaign.
Norway: Norwegian place makes itself light with giant mirrors
With huge mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian village have brought light to their dark valley.
The Rjukan, located in the Vestfjord Valley from autumn to spring, usually sinks in the shade of the surrounding mountains.
With three gigantic reflectors at a height of 45 meters, a century dream came true on Wednesday.
"Finally!", mayor Steinar Bergsland was swarming at the opening ceremony in TV2.
Some of the valley's inhabitants settled up sun chairs, others put on sunglasses for safety.
So far, the sun was hungry in winter with a cable car to a nearby summit.
Ten years ago, the local artist Martin Andersen presented the proposal to direct the rays with mirrors into the valley.
However, this basic idea has been in place since 1913.
After several years of debate, the City Council finally adopted the 5 million crowns (about 615 000 euros) of expensive project.
A similar construction has been giving the Italian alpine resort of Veganella wintery sunshine for some years.
Post barely clears on Sundays
"Many citizens will not have noticed it yet, the red points for Sunday emptying are still on different letter boxes of the city and the districts, but if you read the small print on the yellow containers of Post AG, you will soon find that the emptying on Sundays and public holidays is no longer taking place," the FDP informs.
A request from the FDP confirmed this.
On Sundays and holidays only in front of the post building in Ernst-Ludwig-Straße 36 and in Jakob-Müller-Straße 1 in Hüttenfeld are emptied.
Whether or not Sundays will be emptied in Hofheim and Rosengarten will not be answered in the answer to the FDP's request.
The social and youth speaker of the FDP, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to hang out here.
Sunday emptying is an important postal service at Termepost.
"Despite the increase in the price of letters on January 2013, this undertaking is radically and unreasonably thinning."
Thomas Bittner, the Liberal Group and the Liberal and Democratic Party president, supports his group colleagues: "What annoys me is the fact that the emptying times are changed or deleted here secretly".
The post is miles away from the citizen.
"At least the letter boxes in the Neuschloss and Rosengarten districts have to be emptied again on Sundays," says Bittner and Rohhrenbeck unisono.
Also valid for the city, especially not mobile fellow citizens would have to be able to reach a mailbox with Sunday emptying on foot.
In the city parliament, Röhrenbeck asked if the city administration was planning to talk to the post office about this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post did not communicate with Lampertheim.
But there was also a Sunday emptying of his knowledge in Hofheim.
Your party has spoken out for privatisations.
"Then decisions are made elsewhere," said Maier.
Frankfurt parking fees should rise strongly
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become more expensive.
This morning, the city's magistrate advises on a presentation by transport director Stefan Majer (Green).
Therefore, the parking fees are to be increased by 50 percent.
However, it is not intended to increase the prices, but to shorten the time interval of parking clocks and parking ticket machines from 30 to 20 minutes.
In December, the city council will have to decide.
The retail committee of the IHK Frankfurt considers this "no good idea".
The parking option right before the business is "a not too underestimated advantage for smaller retailers".
The Verkehrsclub Deutschland believes that an increase after two decades is "too reasonable and actually overdue".
Public transport is also becoming more expensive.
Freudenstadt: Quick actions overlap hosts
With a narrow cadre, the gentlemen I of the TSV Freudenstadt had to compete in the Schiller-Schulturnhalle in Reutlingen against the TG Gönningen from the Swabian Alb.
The Älblers were on the other side of the web with an experienced team.
Soon, however, it became apparent that, even due to age, they could not fully cope with the rapid actions of the joyful cities.
With the hard and placed blows, the Gönningers were extremely heavy.
Repeatedly they missed the passes and attacks played by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz cleanly over the net center and were not at the place in the block defense.
Two high first set gains clearly expressed the superiority of the cities of joy in all matters.
In view of this oppressive and game-determining performance, the third sentence was then won a little lax and lethargic to the 3-0-end (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
On November 2nd, a much more powerful opponent will be standing on the field with the TV Baiersbronn, who was able to prevail clearly in Nagold.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-Class, the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt faced each other in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.
They delivered a hard-fought two-hour match.
Nervousness on both sides caused errors and points gifts, especially in ball acceptance; even in passports, precision was sometimes flawed and in some critical gaming scenes the overevil prevented the view of possible points wins.
However, in this well-balanced encounter, Marcus Blasutto's TSV team voted consistently for the great physical commitment and a happy commitment of both teams.
Care day at the small English hut
For the fifth day of care in the wake of the Natura 2000 project Obere Hotzenwald, a group of dedicated participants met at the small English hut in Ibach.
Due to suggestions from the population on this day in the area of the hut the view into the valley should be cut freely, said Mayor Helmut Kaiser.
Many hikers described this area as the glamour of the canyon, on which the landscape offers the ideal setting for magnificent views.
He thanked those present for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the day of care was a suitable instrument to strengthen the connection between man and nature.
He offers every citizen the opportunity to set accents in nature itself.
At the same time as the tourist aspect, ecological consideration could also be given.
This ecological aspect was explained by Friederike Tribukait from the Nature Conservation Department of the Presidentship of the government Freiburg following the greeting by Landrat Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the patronship and wished the action a good success.
According to Tribukait, the touristic goal of the view is to preserve the old all-mend pasture with its specific protected habitat types by opening up and connecting to the still existing pastures.
Certain species such as rare butterflies and grasshoppers cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areas.
You need these free connections to conservation.
Tribukait said they don't want to miss it at this point to break a lance for the planned biosphere area.
In this planning, the current measure is not only seamless.
A biosphere area also offers the opportunity for sustainable economic and ecological development on the basis of internationally recognized Unesco status and thus a continuous addition to the life project as well as the previous care days achieved for the future.
After these various statements, district manager Christoph Wehle and life project manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the assistants into groups.
The larger trees had already been beaten in advance, and if necessary, the forest tug would be ready for call.
A group of helpers should take care of the release of juniper bushes and the maintenance of a dry stone bar.
The goal was the free view at the vantage point.
Löffingen: Köpfler still the only candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the Baarstädtchen Löffingen with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a forward-looking school, children's, youth and senior citizens' policy, as well as their own urban works can be described as an attractive city, no second mayor has yet reported.
The 46-year-old banker Dieter Köpfler from Löffingen has been the only candidate for the succession of the mayor Norbert Brugger, who is no longer a candidate for age.
The application deadline expires on Monday, 11 November at 6 pm.
Google, Samsung, Huawei sued for Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of earlier Nortel patents, launched an avalanche of patent infringements against mobile phone manufacturers on Thursday, including Google, the company that was oversawed by Nortel during the insolvency auction.
Rockstar, the consortium that bought Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringements before the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused in seven cases of patent infringement.
The patents relate to technology that reconciles search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising, according to the complaint that thus hits the core of Google's search engine business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not directly accessible.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC manufacture mobile phones that work with Google’s Android operating system, which is in sharp competition with Apple’s and Microsoft’s mobile products.
In 2011, Google issued an initial bid of over 900 million dollars for the Nortel patents.
Google has increased its offer several times and recently offered 4.4 billion US dollars.
After being oversold by the Nortel patents of Rockstar, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for 12.5 billion US dollars, a business that was also partly motivated by Motorola's library in patents.
"Although Google's attempt to acquire the patent of action at the auction failed, Google has infringed the patents and continues to do so," says the appeal letter.
Rockstar claims a high compensation from Google, since it claims that Google's patent infringement is intentional, according to the charge.
Egypt oaths first freely elected president
Muhammad Mursi takes the oath, but his day of triumph should not mean the end of the political disputes in Egypt.
Islamist Muhammad Mursi promised a "new Egypt" when he was the first freely elected president of the country and thus succeeded Husni Mubarak, who had been expelled 16 months earlier.
With his introduction to the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi also became the first freely elected Islamic president of the Arab world and Egypt's fifth head of state since the fall of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He laid the oath before the 18 judges of the court, dressed in black robes, who have their seat on the Nile and is copied by an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are striving for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic," said Mursi at the solemn ceremony that was broadcast live on state television.
"Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability," said 60-year-old Mursi, an engineer trained in the USA and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that, since its inception 84 years ago, had mostly been clearly visited by the respective government as a banned organization.
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building when Mursi arrived in a small car convoy shortly after 11:00 a.m.
Only a few hundred followers had gathered in the court to cheer the new president, and unlike the presidual presidency of the Mubarak period, traffic was stopped only briefly so that the car convoy could cross the normally lively road that connects the city centre with the southern suburbs.
As an uncharismatic ‘replace wheel’ of the Brotherhood, his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech, in which he presented himself not only as a candidate for the Islamists, but all of those who wanted to achieve the goal of the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian Mubarak.
"Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," explained Mursi, dressed in a blue suit with red tie, to the judges in the wood-coated chamber in which he took the oath.
Later, Mursi went to the University of Cairo, where he was supposed to give his entry address.
He was officially greeted by an army chapel that played the national anthem he listened to in a very good position.
The military leader Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
On his arrival, he was welcomed by hundreds of people in the largest lecture hall of the university with a voice from "The army and the people are one hand".
The University of Cairo, founded in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, has developed into a castle of Islamic student groups in the 1970s.
On Friday, Mursi took a symbolic oath on the Tahir Square, the birthplace of the insurrection that led last year to the end of the authoritarian rule of Mubarak, and he vowed to seek back presidential powers that the military council had taken over from the head of state who had been driven out of office.
But by taking the official oath before the court and not as usual before Parliament, he is bowing to the will of the military, indicating that the power struggle will continue.
Mursi's speech on the Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Falkenberger discotheque provides two great evenings
The new season in the Falkenberger discotheque "Blue Velvet" has begun.
On this Friday evening it is called "Pump this party", on tomorrow Saturday evening it will continue with an Ü 25-party.
Fat beats and cool sounds are promised by the organizers on both days of course.
Workers crashed by head: severely injured
On Thursday, a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg fell by a ladder when he was replaced by a defective outside sensor and was seriously injured.
The man from Lamprechtshausen wanted to replace a faulty heating sensor on the outside facade of an inn.
When he climbed onto the ladder leaning on the roof, he slipped away and the man fell onto the concrete floor.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to the Salzburg State Hospital with the rescue helicopter Christopher 6.
Rapists in South Africa: Two Lifelong Prisons
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the perpetrator was sentenced to twice a lifetime on Friday.
This was reported by SABC.
The victim was later killed by the consequences of the serious injuries.
John Kana had already been found guilty at the beginning of the week of the crime.
The act had caused horror throughout the country.
The then 21-year-old had raped Anene Booysen in February in an industrial site in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
The doctors fought for the survival of the victim for 14 hours, but in vain.
The sight of the young people was so terrible that the nurses and sisters needed psychological assistance.
Kana had admitted to be in a bar with Booysen during the trial on the night of the night.
He also admitted to have beaten and raped her, but he disputed being responsible for the death of the girl.
The police first assumed several perpetrators, but released two suspects from prison because the evidence against them was not sufficient.
During the trial, the prosecutor also stressed that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
In South Africa, rape has been a part of everyday life: there are about 64 000 ads each year for sexual violence.
This is almost ten times as much as in Germany, but with 82 million people it has significantly more inhabitants than South Africa (50 million).
Police and women's associations in South Africa estimate the dark number in sexual violence but 10 to 25 times.
Jumbo visits the Black Forest ham
Jumbo in search of the "best ham in the world": For the TV broadcast "Galileo" the Pro7-Star Bonndorf visited.
The speaker makes it clear right at the beginning: the most important thing for the ham are the pigs, Turbomast is not a good condition.
Can ham that you get in every supermarket be a quality product?
Uli as head of the large ham factory in the Black Forest explains Jumbo's operation of the company "Adler" in Bonndorf.
"Germany's loveliest ham", as Jumbo announces the Black Forest ham.
Only with hair protection and Kittel does he enter the factory.
Jumbo also has to disinfect his hands before he can reach the micro.
Jumbo for strengthening in Waldshut in fast-imbit
"This is where huge quantities are worked," the TV makers, Black Forest ham as a mass product marvel.
16,000 Colognes a week speak for themselves.
Weight, fat content, color: Uli explains what the quality depends on.
Most pigs are slaughtered with six months.
Television with level?
Details such as the ph-value of the meat also play a role.
The darker the meat, the higher the ph-value.
"I'm excited when you measure Roberto Blanco, what happens then," says Jumbo cynically.
Here the level of private television is presented in pure culture.
But watching is worth it anyway.
The viewer sees that cutting the Colognes is still manual.
Because: Black Forest ham is traditionally found without bone on the shelf.
The secret of the ham is the spice mixture with the salt.
Smoke tower and smoke fire remind Jumbo visually of a "sub-boat".
The trick: fir branches provide the special taste of the Black Forest ham here in the smoke.
20 days in the smoke make the ham almost black.
"Now the disc disappears in the jumbo," he announces the test supply.
"It's really delicious," says the conclusion of the TV star.
This will allow all parties to live.
You thought travel agencies belonged to the past thanks to the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to resist the trend.
The company has increased its profit prospects for the whole year and expects record income from holidaymakers in Australia and Great Britain.
The company now expects adjusted annual earnings before taxes to range from 325 to 340 million dollars, compared with 305 to 315 million dollars in its previous forecast.
If the current target values are reached, this means growth of 12 to 17 percent compared to record profit of $290.4 million in the 2011/12 period.
As Managing Director Graham Turner announced, Flight Centre achieved eight percent profit in the first half of the year and recorded a strong start to the second half, especially in the Australian and British private business.
"Since the beginning of the year, our ten countries have been profitable, and some of them are on good track towards record income before interest and taxes," he said.
These include Australia and Great Britain, which are typically among our strongest providers of results.
In Australia the leisure industry recovered in the second half of the year, which offsets a slightly weaker market for business travel.
Similarly, it went well for the leisure business of Flight Centre in Great Britain, while here, too, business customers were spending less.
The US business recovered compared to the seasonally weaker first half of the year, so a profit is expected for the third consecutive year.
Flight Centre's shares rose by 3 cents yesterday to 38.20 dollars.
Schools are encouraged to focus on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In courses on English literature, students will have to treat at least one piece of Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry and contemporary British novels from 1914 on.
The test also includes "unseen texts" to stimulate wider reading.
The combined course of English literature and language is abolished.
From 2015 onwards, students will have to take an independent GCSE test for language, with strong incentives for choosing English literature as a separate qualification.
The Ministry of Education will publish the new curriculum for English and Mathematics tomorrow – the first subjects that have been radically remodelled.
Other core subjects will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the Audit Authority, will announce a reorganisation of the GCSE structures, including a new rating system and less price work.
In a speech in summer, Minister of Education Michael Gove said that there is a "wide consensus that we need to reform our audit system in order to restore public confidence", stressing that the GCSEs would become "more challenging, ambitious and strict".
Studies show that in English schools less time is spent on mathematics – 116 hours per year or three hours per year – than in most other countries.
On the other hand, Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours a year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours.
Although there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the timetable, from coalition circles it is said that the comprehensive math exam – combined with a stronger weighting of the subject in rankings – will probably encourage schools to take more hours.
The curriculum focuses more on 'problems from the right life', including financial mathematics.
Beautiful animals and delicious cakes lure
The most beautiful rabbits of different races and color strokes will present the circular performance show this weekend in the Bürgerhaus.
The reviews have already been made on Thursday
Once again, the local association W514 will host this large exhibition.
Breeders of the Soest County clubs show their best animals here as well as young Wickeder hobby keepers their rabbits.
On Thursday, six prize judges carried out the evaluation of the numerous rabbits and were able to mark outstanding animals.
The visitors to the show are well informed as the assessment of all animals is appropriate to the cages.
The official opening of the exhibition is held by Mayor Hermann Arndt at 2.30 p.m. on Saturday.
The rabbit show is open to all visitors on Saturday from 10 a.m. and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 3.30 p.m., which is followed by the award ceremony.
Guests are also invited to a finely priced Tombola and a deliciously equipped cafeteria.

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Round Table
The next Ecumenical Talk Forum on Monday, October 21, in the New Museum of the Castle is about the topic "To Hell with Hell - Theological reflections on today's handling of the last things".
Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenical Discussion Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Protestant Churches Salem, the Castle Salem and the Cultural Office of Lake Constance.
Johanna Rahner wants to look at the forum of the question, how people today scale the "last things" after death.
If people had known too much about it in the past centuries, and had put it on those images of heaven and hell, "that shape our ideas to this day," the contemporary prophetic doctrine is rather marked by a certain embarrassment or even speechlessness from the hopes.
"The greater hope has been properly driven out by religious criticism," says the speaker.
She has "supplyed us with so many question marks that the exclamation marks seem to have come to us."
Johanna Rahner continues: "But the crucial challenge remains the anger of death".
This involves the question of that longing, "which dreams that in the end everything may be good".
Johanna Rahner, born 1962 in Baden-Baden, studied Catholic Theology and Biology at the Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg from 1982 to 1989.
In 1997 she received her doctorate in Dr. theol., also in Freiburg.
Habilitation for Fundamental Theology and Ecumenical Theology followed in 2003 at the Westphalian Wilhelms University.
Since 2010, Johanna Rahner has held a Chair of Systematic Theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel.
Geislingen: More than 100 young Catholics from Kleine Heuberg confirm their creed at the ceremony
In two services, 101 15- and 16-year-olds of the Seelsorgeunite Am Kleinen Heuberg have been registered.
The morning service was accompanied by the Laudato-Si group, in the afternoon of the Youth Choir The Spirit.
With the reception of the Firm Sacrament, the young people said Yes to their baptism and asked the power of the Holy Spirit.
In recent months, under the direction of Diakon Reiner Dehner and with the help of numerous parishioners, the firmers had prepared for the great holiday.
In various projects, they got to know different tasks of Christian community life and shared the youth day in Untermachtal.
Illmenseee: Second mountain bike race enthusiastic participants
In beautiful weather 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to cope with the round course over the hills around the lake.
This is what Ulrich Knobel of the event's sports club Illmensee reports.
Among the participants were, especially on the short distance of over 15 kilometers and 300 metres of altitude, also numerous everyone who once wanted to practice their hobby in a competitive atmosphere.
Two junior riders of the top German class were also at the start in this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation good rankings at the German Championships.
These two were able to drop off from the field as expected.
As in the previous year, Felix Bader was able to save a small time advance to the goal and defended his title as the overall winner of the short distance.
Pascal Treubel was again placed in second place.
With the ladies it was Theresa Duelli from the team nightmare that made it to the top of the winner's staircase.
In second place and three Anne Adel from Illmensee and Leonie drivers from Owingen came.
An enjoyable development is the increasing number of drivers who live or work in the community.
Not only in terms of performance, the whole range of athletes was represented.
The age structure also ranged from ten years in the youngest to more than 70 years in the oldest starters.
In the main race this year even more absolute topathlets were at the start.
Four drivers were able to compete with the regional top drivers.
Among them is Philipp Pangerl, a mountain bike half-profi from the Black Tusk-Racing team.
Together with a teammate, Pangerl was already the world champion twice in the 12 hour race.
This year he became European champion in this special discipline.
With it also Roland Ballerstedt, who already mentions two German championship titles in the Duathlon.
After 45 kilometers and 900 metres of altitude, the finals of the winch came in front of the three-sea hall.
Pangerl was the first to rest over the finish line.
Only a second behind that, the Routinier Ballerstedt won second place in the overall ranking.
At the same time, Hermann and Warthmann came to the finish as third of the overall ranking.
Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest in the race.
Areane Blersch took second place from Binzwangen in front of Natascha Werner from Stuttgart.
Athletes and helpers were very satisfied with the smooth and well organized course of the event.
On the way through mud, rivers and jungles for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical assistance to remote villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend every weekend treating hundreds of patients
In the West African country there are not many doctors, just one for 5,000 people
Vote here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2013.
You can vote for him or any of the other heroes in the Top 10 to choose him as "CNN Hero of the Year".
The winner receives $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, George’s Bwelle looked at how his sick father repeatedly lost consciousness and traveled to hospitals that did not have the means to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in 1981 in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first he had only a broken arm, but then there was an inflammation that spread to his brain and caused a hematoma that should affect him for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," said Georges Bwelle.
We would have brought him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father in crowded hospitals and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer.
"It's not easy," says Bwelle.
You can leave the house at five o'clock in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, and you're not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has hardly changed since Bwelle's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
On the other hand, the ratio in the United States lies with a doctor for 413 people.
But even if there was a doctor for them, most Camerooners could not afford to visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and nearly three-quarters of the health expenditure in the country is private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," says Bwelle.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
His father and so many of his compatriots suffered in Bwelle the decision to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team performed 700 free operations last year.
He became a doctor himself and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME, which travels on weekends in rural areas and offers free medical care there.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people are forced into small buses and travel with the laced medical equipment on the roof over unstrengthened terrain to the villages that need help.
Everything doesn't always go smoothly.
More than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they will receive like heroes: a feast, singing and dancing, and the best accommodation the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a reason for celebrating and roaring – with its wide smile and its limitless energy – is happy to attend the happy celebration.
The next morning, the team will begin to investigate hundreds of patients.
"We treat 500 people per trip," says Bwelle.
They come from a radius of 60 kilometers around the village – and this on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive crutches, donated glasses or free birth certificates – a document that is required for school, but that many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations with local anaesthetic.
Operations usually take place in a school, town hall or apartment; after the procedure, patients get up and go to the recreation area to make room for the neighbor.
The lighting for the surgery and disinfection equipment is fed by the group's generator and so Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early morning hours on Sunday.
It's a strenuous pensum, but the village musicians usually help keep the team motivated.
"They're drumming all night so we can stay awake and continue our work," says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team will drive back to the city, tired but proud of the work done.
The group – a mixture of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – has performed 700 free operations last year and knows that with its work it brings a huge difference to the people it helps.
A man explained that the free operation of a break-up that he had received will now enable him to work again.
"That changes the future of my family," said the man.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital, Bwelle also works in private clinics in Yaoundé at night.
With this second job, he finances 60% of his non-profit activity, says Bwelle; the rest stem from private donations.
"I really don't know when he's sleeping," says Katie O'Malley, who is studying medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia in the second year and volunteering in Bwelles Group.
He is always in the hospital or trying to spend money on the organization so that he can go on these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O'Malley, who come from the USA and Europe and support Bwelle, this is a chance to gain practical experience that they would never get at home.
"We can be in surgery where we help to drain blood or hold the instruments for Dr. Bwelle," explains O'Malley.
This would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
Students usually pay for their journey to Cameroon and often bring donated medical supplies.
But if they are first in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes over the accommodation, transport and instructions.
"He is without a doubt a hero," says O'Malley.
He dedicates his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonian people knows no limits.
For Bwelle, constant work is not a burden.
Helping others to live a happier life, thus fulfilling a promise he has given to his Father, brings him great joy.
"I'm so happy to do this work," says Bwelle.
And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope he sees what I do.
I do it to make people laugh again and to relieve the pain.

Excellent the fight mastered
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's novel "The Old Man and the Sea", is cut to the body by Horst Janson.
Janson himself is an old rabbit in his metier, acting art.
The old man Santiago can't do anything about fishing.
So the two just complement each other great.
You almost mean you can see the wrinkles in the neck of the old man, whom the fisherman Manolo speaks of.
If Santiago's tired of life being bent on the chair, it's real with Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that Janson excels.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a courageous man who does not give up and ultimately wins the fight against the fish through his knowledge and also his will.
Janson is on stage on the stage in a wide range.
He manages to focus the attention of the audience on himself, so that his monologue is not boring for a moment.
His efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the spectators forget that the sea is made up of blue-lit water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man act in front of the fishing village.
In the course of the performance, he puts the active scene into the light: the hut of Santiago, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise Favor, which sings the feeling of life of Cuba with her songs and her wonderful voice.
The four musicians play Cuba's rhythm and are guests of the bar at the same time.
Tourism: descent to the Romans
A waste water channel from the Roman period is preserved below Cologne for about 120 meters.
Whoever visits Cologne doesn't come by the cathedral.
Around 157 meters, the two towers rise into the sky and make it the second highest church building in Europe.
But few visitors who admire the two filigree church towers realize that there is also a lot to discover under the cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is an expert on Cologne's underworld.
Meeting point for its guided tours is the service center of Cologne-Tourism right on the Cathedral.
The tour begins quite unspectacularly: "We start in the underground garage," says Schulze.
In the 1970s, the city fathers wanted a car-friendly city, so the remains of the old city walls remained only that which was not too large.
Therefore, most users of the car park are passing by the Roman remains today and just stop their car.
But if you look at it more closely, in the Parkdeck D2 you will find an archaeological site separated by metal lattices.
There are about five meters high ruins made of hand-held stones.
"There are remains of the Roman city walls built in the second half of the first century after Christ," says Schulze.
Before it goes back to the daylight, Schulze lets the participants on the upper park level take a look into a dark, 15 meters deep shaft.
This is the well of the old cathedral, which unfortunately is hardly perceived.
The next stop of the tour is the pretorium, and here the participants get back down to the depth.
Here we experience the seat of the once most powerful man north of the Alps, the Pretor of the CCAA.
What CCAA means is a visitor wants to know.
"The abbreviation stands for "Colonia Claudia Ara Agripinensium", which in good German means as much as "City of Roman Right and City of Agripinsians, founded under Emperor Claudius at the place of the altar for the emperor cult".
And the pretorium is the former palace of governors, the power center of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
From the exhibition hall leads a tunnel access to the Roman wastewater canal, which is preserved here at about 120 meters in length.
"You can quietly walk along the so-called Cloaca Maxima, if you like," says Schulze.
There's still a surprise on Schulze.
After he picks up the key at the cash desk, he leads the group to a 16 meter deep walkable shaft.
"We are now in the Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath," he explains.
The Jewish community built its bath deep into the ground to get to the groundwater that was essential for ritual washing.
To this day, different water levels can be read through changing levels of the Rhine in the lower end of the Mikwe, whose origins date back to the eighth century.
The Mikwe will be part of an archaeological zone on the town hall square for which construction work is to begin shortly.
However, a few more years will pass until completion.
leg almost cut off: reprint of rocker process
A bloody attack in the rocker environment will be rolled up after more than four years.
A trial for attempted death, dangerous body injury and damage to two 30-year-olds has begun before the Landgericht Frankfurt (Oder).
It is accompanied by strict safety measures.
The defendants kept silent.
They are said to have been active in the rocker scene and have been part of the bandidos at the time.
In June 2009, the Public Prosecutor's Office, along with unknown complicities in Finowfurt, accused them of having inserted and beaten three men in a car.
All the victims were seriously injured, a man almost lost his leg.
The victims are said to have belonged to the competing group of Hells Angels.
One is said to have been a high-ranking member from Berlin.
Previously, it seems that a chase with several cars was pursued.
According to the indictment, it was about reserving and demonstrating power.
The two defendants had been acquitted in a first trial at the beginning of 2012.
A court spokesperson then said that it could not have been proved that the men were actually involved in the bloody feud.
The perpetrators had worn masks and had not been recognized.
The Federal Court annulled the judgment after revision of the Public Prosecutor's Office and dismissed it to the Landgericht for renegotiation.
One of the defendants is currently in open custody for another crime.
It was mainly about the reconstruction of the processes on the night of the day.
As a witness, the then investigating commissioner was invited.
In the center were mobile phone calls from the defendants and other people who had been listening to the police.
It's difficult that rockers in court almost always adhere to a law that they like - and don't say it.
This also applies to the victims.
In the first trial, only one of the victims had unpacked.
Prosecutor Stefan Golfier of the Frankfurt Public Prosecutor's Office (Oder) said, on demand, that there have been new traces since the last trial.
11 further days of negotiation are set for the process.
The throwaway society does not think
The night was long, the music was loud and the mood was good, but at some point it goes home.
Only: In the bellies of the people on the passenger and back seat the hunger is noticeable.
Sure, some cocktail or sect may be responsible for that!
What's closer than chilling to the next drive-in to treat yourself to a little thing?
I admit, I'd be happy to join you if it goes to the fast-food-hole late at night or early in the morning.
A few pommes, a coke, a burger - and then nothing like going home and into bed!
But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco-goers make themselves felt.
Because what must one lack that one throws his fast food bags out of the car window with constant regularity?!
Especially on weekends there are discarded paper bags on road margins and on parking spaces.
"Why?" I wonder.
Are people too deaf to take the bags home respectfully to the next trash bin?
It's not just that the paperware is ruining the landscape.
Bags have already covered up transport facilities such as guideboards and thus caused accidents.
But not thinking about something like that, she probably doesn't even know what this word actually means.
When you travel more often in the evening, only quite with several people in the car, you know what a back seat can look like after celebrated nights: clothes, bottles and other garbage tower.
There would be more or less of a bag - in contrast to the road where no one wants to trample on the food remains of others.
I already see the day when the cities and communities will be fooled - and the fast food chains will have to demand a pledge for their bags.
Obama's Retirement in Health Policy
After severe criticism, President Obama yesterday made a retreater in his often repeated, clear promise: "If you like your health insurance, you can keep it."
After hundreds of thousands had received a notice from their insurer, the Republicans accused the president in recent days of deceiving the American public.
Yesterday Obama relativized his original promise.
"The vast majority of citizens who have a functioning health insurance can keep them," he said at a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports on terminations, Obama urged Americans who had received such communications to look around on the free market for a new insurance.
Most citizens could thus receive better, more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or cheaper than forecast.
"They're coming for a better offer," he said.
The government called it a little surprising that the five percent of the population who have made insurance themselves had to look after another tariff, as their contract did not comply with the new standards under the Affordable Care Act.
"I would like to say straight away to these Americans: you deserve better," said Sebelius at a hearing before the House of Representatives' Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Act, stated that the launch of the online platform has been "miserable" since October.
"I am just as frustrated and angry as everyone else," she said.
I'm determined to regain your trust.
This statement by an avowed Sebelius to a consultant sitting behind her at yesterday's hearing in the House of Representatives was taken up after a dispute with Republican MP Billy Long from Missouri, which was about whether she should be obliged to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius repeatedly urged the question of why the Affordable Care Act's "architect" had not voluntarily renounced a state-funded insurance scheme in order to conclude a tariff for itself at HealthCare.gov, which she now wants to sell millions of Americans.
Government in Jerusalem does not confirm attack on Syrian air force base
On Thursday, an American government official who wanted to remain anonymous said to the American news station CNN that Israeli fighters had attacked an aircraft base in the Syrian Latakia a day earlier.
The aim was "missiles and related equipment", which the Israeli government feared were destined for Lebanese Hezbollah, according to CNN.
Syrian and Lebanese media as well as the Arab station Al-Arabiya had previously reported that the base in the port city of Latakia had been shot from Wednesday to Thursday, and the Israelis were held responsible for it.
The Israeli TV channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in Latakia on which Russian S-125-Newa missiles and a battery of SA-3 rockets were on display, which, according to Channel 2, have a range of 35 kilometres and can transport warheads up to 70 kilograms.
Uncertain The government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, the news agency Reuters quotes an also anonymous Israeli government official, saying that he believes that Israel has carried out the attack, but is not sure.
A spokesman for the Israeli Ministry of Defence said, "We do not comment on these reports."
The journalist Ron Ben-Yishai stressed in Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime had tried to deliver ground-air missiles to Hezbollah earlier, partly successful.
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons meant the crossing of a "red line" that would follow a military response.
John Kerry, in an unprecedented confession, states that the US espionage was "too far too far"
John Kerry, with an unexpected confession, suggested that the US's anti-responsive attitude towards its surveillance programmes should be avoided by saying that the espionage was 'inadequately too far' in certain cases.
The Foreign Minister also admitted that together with Barack Obama, he was responsible for switching to "autopilot" when the explosion revelations of Whistleblower Edward Snowden about NSA's espionage activities became public.
Through the leaked information, the U.S. government has become a diplomatic storm of indignation on the part of its allies.
In a speech transmitted via video link at the Open Government Conference in London, Kerry said: "The President and I, along with others in the government, have learned of some things that have happened almost by autopilot, simply because the ability to do what goes back to the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War and, of course, to 11 September."
He was the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that US espionage had crossed a border, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said: 'In some cases this has gone too far too far.'
The President is determined to create clarity and therefore conducts a thorough investigation so that no one needs to feel that abuse is taking place here.
I assure you that the rights of innocent people in this process will not be affected.
Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a power of good and that many lives had been saved by its monitoring operations.
He added: “We are dealing with a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves into the air.”
There is a radical extremism in the world that is choking to kill people, to blow into the air, and to attack governments.
So what if you were able to capture and stop that before it happens?
We have actually prevented plane crashes, attacks on buildings and the murder of people because we have experienced such plans in advance.
Meanwhile, US legislators will travel to Europe to spread concerns about alleged American espionage and convince Europeans of the need to continue to cooperate with the US in anti-terrorism efforts, as the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs stated on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said that he had talked to representatives of the European Parliament and other people this week and was concerned about their threats of not participating in anti-terrorism organisations due to the frustration over supervision by the National Security Agency.
"It is very important for the national security interests of the United States that Europeans remain on board with regard to our joint efforts against terrorism," states Murphy, who is a democrat in the Senate for the first time and is chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on External Relations and European Affairs, in an interview in Washington.
Moreover, I am going to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their anger over NSA programmes.
Media reports, according to which NSA has recorded millions of telephone data in Europe, have burdened relations with some U.S. allies, although the Head of the Secret Service this week stated that the reports were inaccurate and based on a misunderstanding of metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States.
Other revelations quoted from documents passed by Snowden, according to which the NSA monitored the cell phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide.
The head of the national intelligence services, James Clapper, defended the espionage among allies as necessary and stated that this was common on both sides.
In all this tumult, Murphy said that his authority was preparing the tour of Congress to take place this year, and hoped that the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other participating Members will be published in the coming days.
He said the exact route was still being worked out.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the journey was to improve relations, he also said that there would be some "serious words".
He said that European governments should be honest with their people about the type of espionage programmes they have been using for years.
"Although we can change our monitoring programmes and thus better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also deal with the fact that we are not the only ones who are spying," says Murphy.
In the meantime, John Kerry is on a weekend trip to the Middle East and Poland to deal with the grudge about the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran as well as US surveillance activities.
A persistent injury to the jumping joint threatens to prevent the use of Nicolai Müller in the Bundesliga-outwards of the FSV Mainz 05 at FC Augsburg.
Mainz focuses on the use of Nicolai Müller.
Tomorrow he'll try to train with the team.
So far, he could only do this individually.
"We will decide on his commitment in the short term," said Trainer Thomas Tuchel.
The 40-year-old hopes to have his best goalkeepers with six hits.
The Mainzers must already renounce the injured service providers Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.
Australian Appeals Against Prison Penalty in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney who was sentenced to 15 days in Phuket for falsely claiming to have been raped by a taxi driver has filed appeal against the sentence and has been released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on June 15 to have made a false statement after stating to the Thai police that a local taxi driver raped her in the morning hours of Sunday, June 10, while two other men held her.
Later, however, the recordings of a video camera showed that she had safely arrived at her hotel after she had been separated from her Australian friend.
The Phuket police interrogated Bamford for two days until she confessed to have invented the story.
Until the trial, she was in police custody on the ground.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a low-security penitentiary at the Phukets edge, rather than in an adult prison.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Rubgy League, who turned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra with the request for help for his daughter.
To the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney, Tunks said that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about his daughter's well-being and wanted her back in Australia.
"We are of course very concerned, but we hope that she will be back home as soon as possible," said Tunks.
Bamford has appealed against the judgment and is on his own against a deposit of 50,000 baht.
In Australian reports it was to be read that in the meantime she is on vacation in the resort of Krabi in southern Thailand.
It was heard from the court that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and was warned that the appeal could also lead to a higher penalty of up to two years in an adult prison.
However, it is also possible that, after the recent murder of the travel saleswoman Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may be trying to improve its beaten tourist image, and therefore it is acquitting.
