The main task of the kings was to construct a tomb that was thought to be as timeless as the stars would appear above the sand of the time when everything else was sinking. The planning of the afterlife was more important than life itself, which was only the way there. Wars led them to commemorate it with glory on the walls of this tomb, in whose stone the scenes were chiseled. Certainly much was beautified, and in the later time even battles were presented that had not taken place.
