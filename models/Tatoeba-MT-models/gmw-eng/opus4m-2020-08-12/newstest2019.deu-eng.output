Nevertheless, the nine "beautiful Munich" candidates deliver with People Photographer Tuan during shooting and defy wind, cast and rain like real professionals.
The romantic shooting is in the video:
DFB CEO Grindel sees no basis for Özil-Comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for a return from Meshut Özil to the national team.
"This is a question that depends, of course, on the fact that one comes into conversation once, that one also talks to him about why he has apparently liked something like that in his statement," said Grindel in the football podcast "phrasing mowers" of the "picture newspaper".
Despite the months-long debate about Özil's photos with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the resignation of the 92-fold national player Özil.
"I would have liked Mesut Özil to continue playing for Germany.
I also assumed that this would be the case up to a certain point," Grindel said.
De 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team in July, and he also argued that Grindel had not defended him against racist hostilities during the World Cup.
The DFB boss reiterated his criticism of Özil that he was not ready for a conversation with the German coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn't want to build any pressure, but he knew it from football so that when "one leaves a team or changes a club, one talks about it with his coach and I think it's a pity that this conversation hasn't happened so far".
Linz: Garden cottage in Schrebergartenstäfte
At 2:13 p.m., the Linz professional fire department was alerted to a fire in the Angerhofweg.
Because a high-voltage line leads directly over the Schrebergarten settlement, danger was in default.
The professional fire brigade went out and found the hut in full fire when it arrived.
The roof had to be practically removed to the complete extent and fire rubble cleared to the necessary extent.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut, he had a battery attached to the shop at noon.
That might be the cause of the fire.
In any case, the charger was, according to fire department, in the area of the greatest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire is still to be determined - as is the cause of the fire.
However, he may be considerable, for the owner had many collectors in his garden hut.
Angry mother resists: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on open road
What driven Lindsay Lohan only to this very strange action?
She apparently wanted to tear the children away from an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loeded") has himself streamed live, as she seems to want to tear away the children from a family in Moscow.
This reports the US portal "TMZ" and publishes a partial recording of the stream.
Here you can see "Happiness kissed" with Lindsay Lohan
The clip shows Lohan rising from a car and going to a possibly homeless family that she wants to make up as a refugee family from Syria.
When the family flees from the actress, Lohan follows the parents and their children.
It accuses the adults of trafficking in children.
For all this, she doesn't provide any evidence in the clip.
"The whole world is seeing this," Lohan is listening in the video as she continues to follow the family along the road.
Apparently, she tries to separate the children from her parents.
However, at some point it seems that the seemingly angry mother is enough.
It looks like she's turning around and Lohan is missing an ear-fiction.
Under tears, the actress then confesses how shocked she is - and she holds the cheek.
What moved Lohan to this action is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "Mascot" on the asteroid
The "Hayabusa2" probe started in December 2014 in Japan.
It should approach the asteroid Ryugu so much that it can absorb material from its surface and bring it to Earth.
The lander "Mascot" will stay on Ryugu.
Auslands-Ticker: Number of dead on Sulawesi rises to more than 400
After the severe earthquake of strength 7.5 and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 420 deaths are mentioned.
The number of victims could rise even further.
The rescue teams have not yet moved into the devastated areas and areas cut off from the outside world.
Elon Musk resigns as Tesla Chief of Supervisory Board
In the beginning there was a Tweet.
Tesla-Chief Elon Musk caused unrest at the stock markets in early August when he announced a withdrawal of the Eletro car manufacturer.
The U.S. Board of Directors sued him for fraud, but now both have agreed.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and the Tesla Chief withdraws from the Supervisory Board, but he may remain the Chairman of the Board.
Conference of British Conservatives
Sharp guard - the Tories Party Day
Birmingham becomes the stage of a power struggle.
At the party's meeting it will be about foreign policy, trade issues and development policy, but the four-day conference will be overestimated by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and the Brexit hardliners, on the front line ex-foreign minister Boris Johnson.
referendum for a new state name
Foreign Ministers (right) and Greece have already agreed
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing about these dopings for years.
Now they have agreed.
The state of Macedonia will be called Northern Macedonia in the future, and the population will vote on it this Sunday - whether it is all right?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populists Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" ("The Not") - meaning Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before the presidential election in Brazil, the mood is split in the country.
Thousands went to the streets in several cities to protest against the right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trump of Brazil" is available as an anti-system candidate and is therefore in the front line of the surveys.
His sharpest competitor is Fernando Haddad from the Left Workers' Party.
Audi: "Dieselgate" processing takes longer than planned
"The Diesel Task Force is still there," said Peter Mertens, Chief Development Officer of the Automobile Week.
In December 2017, the imprisoned and vacationed head of Audi Rupert Stadler announced that the task force would soon be dissolved.
"In the first quarter of 2018, all engine/gear combinations were expected to be tested," he said.
Mertens now said: "At the beginning of July, we reached an important stage in the process of the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analysis of our VTDI engines.
The task force was founded in September 2015 after the discovery of the diesel scandal at the Audi mother Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the car builder had made "enormous organizational changes" so that such a scandal never occurred again.
On Friday, the VW Supervisory Council postponed a decision on Stadler's future and wants to continue to discuss this Tuesday.
The investigative authorities accuse the Audi boss of having authorised the sale of diesel cars with false exhaust values after the announcement of the exhaust frauds.
He knew of the manipulations or deliberately ignored them.
Currently, sales manager Bram Schot heads the company as the head of the commission.
Due to the change to the new WLTP exhaust and consumption test standard, there were production failures at Audi, said Schot the "Heilbronner Voice".
In principle, he sees a falling demand for limousines such as the Audi models A6, A7 and A8, which are produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment itself is difficult," he said.
Schot relies on electromobility.
For the e-tron, the first Audi electric car, there are already 15,000 reservations.
Grindel seeks re-election - Lahm is supposed to be in the DFB presidency
Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel, despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair, plans to run again for the office as DFB President next year.
"I do my job and try to do it as well as I can," said Grindel as a guest in the ZDF's "Current Sports Studio" in the early Sunday morning.
You have to try again and again for a re-election, I will.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
In his own words, the head of the association found it "merciful" if, after the award for the football-EM 2024, he would not have "lust to participate in the future project".
Since April 2016, Grindel has been head of the association as successor to Wolfgang Niersbach, who has crashed over the summer fairy tale affair.
In autumn 2016 he was elected for a first full term of office of three years.
The next vote is scheduled for the DFB-Bundestag on 27 September 2019.
According to Grindel, the future CEO of the EM Philipp Lahm is to participate in the DFB Presidency.
"I would be pleased if my colleagues in the Bureau agreed that in this role he would also be consulted in the Bureau in the future and then of course warmly invited to make his experience available on sporting issues," Grindel said.
He did not want to participate in speculations as to whether he could become his successor as DFB chief.
As a consequence of the affair around the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that in the future a national player without a migration background should become an integration ambassador of the DFB.
Currently, this office is exercised by the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, the latter has family roots in Cameroon.
"If one without a migration background is clearly involved in society and football, and says, "the topic is important, we have to take care of it," that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our clubs on site where integration needs to work," said Grindel.
Correct weight loss with half-smart scale
I've had a new toy for four weeks.
A scale that not only measures my weight, but also the body fat.
It can also display muscle and bone mass.
The body mass index also calculates the thing, but it's more for the sausage.
He doesn't say anything about whether I replaced fat with muscles.
Basketball-Bundesliga: Clear follow-up for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - ALBA Berlin started with a clear victory in the new season of the Basketball-Bundesliga.
The Vice-Chairman easily won against Science City Jena with 112:55 (52:31) and offered over 40 minutes a convincing game.
New entry Rokas Giedraitis was top scorer of the dominating Berlin with 20 points.
The national player Johannes Thiemann (18 counters) from Ludwigsburg also showed an appealing performance in front of 9113 spectators during his compulsory game debut.
Ex-Master Brose Bamberg won with 84:80 (39:37) by coach Ainars Bagatskis at s.Oliver Würzburg.
Augustine Rubit was with 24 points the best pitcher among the guests.
Würzburg-Profi Gabriel Olaseni came on 14 counters.
The last year's playoff half-finist MHP Giant Ludwigsburg defeated the Fraport Skyliners from Frankfurt with 83:76 (41:34).
New national player Karim Jallow was with 24 points the most reliable shooter in the team of coach John Patrick.
The EWE Baskets Oldenburg started the new season with a clear success.
With the basketball lion Braunschweig there was a clear 100:64 (48:30) and the first two points.
The new playmaker Will Cummings overpowered the Oldenburgers with 25 counters.
The Braunschweiger, where NBA star Dennis Schröder has been majority owner since the beginning of the season, disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26:1 run of the basketball quickly provided clear conditions.
Erdoğan opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Frank-Walter Steinmeier on his three-day State visit.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan called on the German government to deliver live followers of the Gülen movement in Germany and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens - no matter where they live.
We will not allow sympathizers of the PKK or Gülen movement to shake our citizens and damage the German-Turkish friendship," he said.
For the opening of the Ditib mosque, the Cologne city centre had been partially blocked.
Several thousand police officers were in service - among them also snipers.
The Islam Association Ditib is critical because it is considered an extended arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": music against poverty: stars, bumpers and horror seconds
At a concert in the New York Central Park, musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B recruited for more commitment to the fight against poverty and disease.
" Engage wherever you can," said Mendes at the festival on Sunday before about 60,0000 spectators.
Thank you for coming here, that's a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with French and golden microphone.
I'm nervous, I sweat, but it's okay, because I'm here and I'm ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and aid organizations also showed up at the multi-hour spectacle on stage.
In the meantime, however, there was a shock second when many spectators thought the sound of a falling metal blockage was shot, scared, and tried to escape.
In short, panic arose, people were running confused.
Seven spectators had been slightly injured, said the organizer Hugh Evans.
The New York police and the musician Chris Martin then calmed people down from the stage.
"No one is trying to hurt anyone," said Martin.
You're all safe.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available free of charge on the Internet every year.
Anyone who wanted to catch up had to read and spread texts, photos and videos on the Internet about the global fight against poverty and disease.
For the numerous musicians and actors there were cheers and applauses for the Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
He, together with his democratic colleague Chris Coons, spoke out on stage for more equality between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake had spoken out in the U.S. Senate's judicial committee for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a judge at the Supreme Court and thus faced many women.
At least three women have filed abuse accusations up to the attempted rape against Kavanaugh, who rejects them.
Flake called for an FBI investigation of the allegations after two women who claimed to have experienced sexual assaults themselves faced him on their way to the committee meeting in an elevator.
"You can also get together with me at any time in an elevator," Flake now said at the concert in New York to the crowd.
Freedom of the press: Federal Government defends the outcast of the journalist
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert has defended the noise of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
In the Chancellor's Office, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had covered a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freedom for Journalists" and had entered the first row.
The T-shirt, had not been the problem, said Seibert the picture on Sunday.
It was about a disruption of the outcome of the press conference.
The journalist's action has created a strong unrest, which is unacceptable.
That's why he'd made personal protectors take the man out.
Seibert said it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellery.
This applies entirely regardless of whether it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
In Turkey, many journalists are in prison.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage activities or support or membership in prohibited parties or the Fethullah-Gülen movement.
The Turkish leadership is responsible for the failed coup attempt on July 15, 2016.
Some of the accused journalists are threatened with imprisonment for several decades.
Also foreign journalists are not sure about the Turkish authorities: it was not until the beginning of September that Austrian journalist Max Zirgast was arrested.
Had seen the cases of the imprisoned journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel.
They were released and were able to return to Germany, but there are still trials in Turkey against the two.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
His fans usually know him so fresh and good-looking: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look at it twice: Yes, that's really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Nacht" produced by the NDR is known for its damp-frozen conversations at the bar of the Hamburger Hafenkneipe "Schellfischposten".
Moderator Ina Müller, with her guests, finds a lot of beer, some wine or even high-percentage drinks to relax the mood and tongues.
Not a few Celebrities also take courage for the mandatory singing inlays.
On Friday another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time: The actor Florian David Fitz known from films like "Men's Hearts", "Terror - Your Judgment" or "Der geilste Tag".
The Municher didn't get the trip to the high north at all.
On Saturday he posted a selfie - his face is completely broken on it, the eyes only two small slots.
The bed-self shows a completely lulled Florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick, he only has a powerful hangover.
Addressed to his fans, he posted some - probably not entirely serious - findings that he has now gained: "Rule one: Never go to Inas Nacht.
Rule two: Never drink the black sauce.
And spray.
And the round egg liqueur, which Ina throws at half past three, also leaves away.
Alcohol consumption is truly written into the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans posted a few tips to combat after-sales.
They ranged from instant broths, fish rolls, or - probably the most effective - headache tablets.
Others simply enjoyed the sight of the normally attractive cinema star.
As Ina Müller has survived the nocturnal uprising, so far it is not known.
But since it has moderated TV fun at the counter since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to have been significantly more tested...
On a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has to fight with vandalism and unrat
The entry into the 36-kilometre-long railway path in the Rotkapchenland in Treysa presents itself difficult to find and waste.
Recipes against the grassy vandalism are being sought, but solutions hardly stand out.
Screws, cigarette chickens, garbage and unrat, demolised garbage and now disassembled signs - this is how the entry with the seat group to the cycle path on the Haässe hill in Treysa has been presented for a long time.
For the show object Bahnradweg in the Rotkappchenland a more than unmistakable sight.
The topic has been occupied by members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt but also others for a long time, says Ulrich Wüstenhagen, the cycling commissioner.
The problem had already been raised in the Council of Bicycles.
There is no solution so far.
The proposals ranged from the installation of the seat group to regular emptying of the waste containers and cleaning of the areas at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the command of the hour - regardless of possible further activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that the topic has also been brought into the local advisory board.
Not only the garbage drives cyclists and residents around - the seat group is regular meeting place on weekends to celebrate.
Not only does it often sound loud, but also destroys the ladders: paws torn out of the ground, garbage dumps demolised, shields bent over, seating furniture smeared.
Volunteers have already cleaned up more frequently, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
But the actions are only the proverbial drop on the hot stone.
They are angry that the rest area on the bike path in Treysa is a meeting place for the hangup.
"The main focus here is clearly along the entire cycle path at the Haaße Hill," confirms the bicycle traffic commissioner, who is now also concerned about the new bike station in Ziegenhain, which is being opened today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it will be really expensive."
Another idea is video surveillance on the hill: "It may well be that the threshold is much higher to get involved in common goods.
However, this would assume that a police strip will pass in a short time.
In principle, Wüstenhagen wishes to see a development of the Haasse hill.
It needs to be made more attractive.
The frequency of the cycle path so far could be very satisfied.
The tourist marketing is still expandable.
Our bike path is very high-quality compared to others in Germany," said the ADFC members.
ADFC member Susanne Klippert estimates the situation on Asheröder Straße in Treysa as an extremely critical danger point.
There is no trace of the hare hill.
With heavy traffic, cyclists may have to wait in the middle of the road between both sides of the road," she explains.
This is not a problem for sporty drivers, but for older people and children in particular.
Music contest at the Kulturbahnhof: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and in harmony.
To present "D a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the district offensive Hiltrup, in the "Music contest for large and small, young and experienced musicians".
A contest "with eye winkings in the sympathetic Hiltruper family", as Karl Franke formulated.
In fact, it was soon a family co-existence with coffee and cakes from the volunteers of the cultural station.
Seven formations took place, from the one-man band to the big ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untucht, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Hirig, a long-standing Albachtener living in Hiltrup, the nine of the "Hiltruper star colours", three members and three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the Lummerland kindergarten and finally Rike Weßling and the Blackies.
This contest, District Mayor Joachim Schmidt explained, was a new one.
We haven't seen that in other districts.
What were the texts associated with?
In the places the Hiltruper See and the Marktallee found particularly common mention.
Rolf Hierig named the avenue as the "Kö von Hiltrup" in his defeat-like song.
The cultural railway station was also appreciated.
Again and again it was about seeing each other in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke revived the short reconstruction breaks with short interviews with the performers or clues about her work.
So they learned from Humberg that he actually studied chemistry, but now he also teaches guitar.
The sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann told Franke that he was recently in Ludwigshafen - at a large event of the BASF with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic has now placed everything on Youtube.
"It's not about winning," Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper gastronomy.
For the jury's favorites there was still something special - so that others can also hear their songs.
A whole CD can be recorded by Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untucht with sound engineer Schemmelmann.
Further musicians can record a song: Him with his Hiltrup-Schlager, who particularly impressed Franke with his musicality, and the "Lummerland-Rudel": "a very nice performance" with ten children and two teachers of guitar and cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like all of them, the children once again appeared at the finale - and even sounded "right well" without electronic support, as Franke said.
The jury could be guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, catchiness of the melody and recognizable value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller from the Westfälische Schule für Musik, Andreas Klomfaß from the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Economic Federation, as well as Jan Kaven, chairman of the district offensive.
The district offensive had launched the event on the occasion of its ten years of existence.
She considered the event to be a full success.
All were "very satisfied" and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon very full cultural station.
The Word Game: "Decyto" in the game test
The players form two teams that sit opposite each other.
For each side there is a screen, in it four cards with keywords, which can only be deciphered - the old trick with the red foil - once you have put them in.
This ensures that the opposite side can also accidentally read nothing.
On the cards is for example, to read from left to right: "1. Renaissance.
2nd window.
3. Dices.
4th solid".
These are the terms that must be encrypted from now on.
For here are not to guess the terms, but codes.
A player per team alternately is the encryption player.
He'll get a code card that might say "3.4.2".
In "Decyto" it is not the terms behind the secret film, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case is to describe - in this order and in this example - the terms "dices", "fests" and "windows" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team does not, as far as possible, win the game if he manages to crack the code twice.
So the encryption player notes and reads aloud: "Throwing" for the cubes, "Lose" as a contrast to Feast; here, of course, something like "Party" would be possible and "Prague" because he watched in school and knew the window crash there.
That's how it goes round for round, team for team.
One does not know the terms of the opposite side - but it can be better combined with any indication given by the encryption agent there.
So maybe mysterious, but not too skewed, the descriptions should be, otherwise it would be unnecessarily difficult for your team.
The most cryptic on "decrypto" is unfortunately the rule book.
The players probably have to study it quite long and in detail until they can finally play.
The explanation video under decrypto.info in the web makes it easier.
But those who first started will be fascinated at how much feeling is in this inconceivable game.
Overall, however, "Decrypto" is not as coherent as the predecessor and genre primer "Codenames", which also puts an agent theme on a game of less words, but is much better to play in small groups.
And whoever it is only about guessing and not about winning points, can easily find a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows police Hitler greeting and harasss guests in the pub
A 48-year-old man employed the police inspection Kulmbach twice the night from Saturday to Sunday.
He first showed the Hitler greeting in the upper city of a passing police strip, later he also noticed in a pub in the upper city when he harassed other guests.
After he was clearly alcoholized by the police, he had to spend the night at the police inspection Kulmbach in the detention cell.
In a sober state, he must then also be responsible for the use of signs of unconstitutional organisations.
The company Pressig was home to the Schublocks
For decades, the station in Pressig was the hub in the Frankenwald.
In 1991 a piece of railway history ended.
"When buffers hit buffers, it was heard in all Pressig," recalls Georg Dinkel, who records the history of the place and the station.
That didn't get anybody.
The brakes squeaked and the wagons squeaked.
It was just a train.
Statements that represent Dinkels Heimat Pressig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was a place so marked by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the steep mountain range to the north, which, after an increase of about 220 metres above sea level, has its gap point in Steinbach am Wald.
To deal with this, train and shoe blocks were used, which had their home in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian Landtag approved the construction of a railway factory with 21 locomotives, apprentice workshop, driving and railway championship.
"Herzstück was the hub, which had a diameter of 18 meters after a reconstruction in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, railway historian and 47 years of professional railways.
From the BW Pressig railway plant, which was subdivided into Bamberg in 1968, locomotives were also operated for the tributaries Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben.
On July 15, 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported a staff of 160 men; 13 steam and eight eloks were then stationed in Pressig.
The electrification of the line in 1939 already minimized the need for train and shoe blocks.
From 1977 onwards, they were only used for freight trains.
By 1991 at least 10,000 weights were still placed in the month.
In 1982, parts of the plant were broken down, and in 1991 the rest were broken down.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that we have not considered better use of the site, even in terms of freight traffic".
At Pentecost 1989 the railway directorate Nuremberg celebrated a pompous station festival in Pressig for the anniversary of "50 years of electricity Nuremberg - Saalfeld".
"There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here," recalls Georg Dinkel.
Just a little later.
On June 1st, 1991, the last 30 men were removed, and Pressig's range station was history.
"The Rangers and brakes were doing the most difficult work in the train traffic," Dinkel recalls.
Any abuse would have had fatal consequences.
Why the station Pressig-Rothenkirchen has led for the conversion of the hierarchy of the two places and many more historical and current pictures are available here in the InfrankPlus article.
Kerber with success in China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon winner Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund reached the second round in the tennis tournament in Beijing as before Julia Görges.
Kerber won the China Open 6:2, 6:2 against the French woman Kristina Mladenovic.
The next opponent of the world rankings-third is either Julia Putinzewa from Kazakhstan or the Spaniard Carla Suárez Navarro.
Siegemund led 6:3, 4:2 against Darja Kassatkina, when the Russian put on number 13 gave up.
The Schwäbin now has to do with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
A special exhibition in Mittelehrenbach was opened on the weekend as part of the series "Art and Delight".
With great relief registered organizers and visitors looked at the ideal weather when the Special Vernissage "Windspiel-Performance" was opened in the open-air grounds of the estate Dahlmann- Schmidt, Mittelehrenbach.
It takes place under the umbrella of the tourist club "Rund ums Walberla" as part of the series "Art and Enjoyment".
This opened its doors in the 15th year.
A large visitor's acclaim showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 copies of 20 artists are now to be visited in Mittelehrenbach.
Mr. Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to the opening of the Vernissage.
He's been there since the first hour.
Just like Volker Hahn, who made a name for himself as the main organizer and artist.
A little surprising but Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, however, he put his job in proven, young hands with good prospects for the future.
Both have already played an active part in the selection of artists in the past and have contributed to the design of flyers.
Also this year there is again a 70-cent special stamp designed by them, available at every art station.
There, this year's poster "Betzn austanzen", designed by Volker Hahn, can also be purchased for eight euros.
Hahn was pleased with the high promise of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg could be won for the musical framing.
As you walk through the spacious garden, it quickly becomes clear to the visitor that the title "Windspiel-Performance" formally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it playfully.
There are works of art made of metal or ceramic, often with color accents.
Already at the entrance of the property, the visitor on the right of the "Glücksbaum" awaits the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree stump, brightly brightened, playfully equipped with 20 windwheels, 24 hoops and 24 aluminium tubes as soundpieces.
With the sun pervading through the bushwork in the background, the object looks fairytale and invites you to stay.
From Eckental comes Barbara Waschneck, who is preferred in three-dimensional letters dedicated to the event 15 years K&G.
There are many parts in motion in the wind.
In the mid-range, Siegrid Frey from Eckental has exhibited her work "The Wind the Heavenly Child".
And at the end of the area, Volker Hahn shows his colorful imagination structure of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The theme of "Windspiel-Performance" is to wander through the versatile art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be visited until 31 December 2018.
50 years MGV 68 Albachten: singer celebrate 50th birthday festive
1968 - this was the time of protest and the student movement.
And the Albachtens also aired their disdain at the time.
At least five of them.
They didn't want to take partout with the fact that after the dissolution of the church choir "Cäcilia" there should be no more Sangesleben in the district.
It has now become a legend: At a bank in the Tinnenbusch they raised the MGV 68 Albachten from the baptism.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated in the "house of the encounter".
"It's going to be full today," said President Jürgen Holstiege, and he should be right.
150 guests were there, a real success for the Albachten singers.
They had revived the Stiftungsfest especially for the anniversary.
For years it was tradition, then there was a break.

Again sovereign was Richard Homann's choir line, one of the five who were in the tin bush at the time.
"It's just fun to sing under his direction," Holtiege said: "He has such a light way, it's a master achievement that he performs." By the way, this time not only men presented themselves in song.
The women's choir "Hohes C" was also a guest whose repertoire includes Evergreens from the 1920s to the 1960s.

Volleyball: 3. League Women: USC II wins high-class derby against BW Asee
The climber marches.
Three games, three victories - the reserve of the USC Münster under the auspices of Axel Büring is really good in league three.
No trace of shyness or fracksuits, the independents do their thing.
And that at 3:0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) against city competitor BW Aasee is good.
"That was not crystal clear, but we have already left an impression," says the rather satisfied trainer.
BWA-Coach Kai Annacker immediately told him: "This is a defeat with which we can live very well.
We are not dissatisfied".
In the evening at a subsequent birthday party by Ronja de Boer, the mood was good, the game was cut off.
Yes, the result is indeed an optical deception.
In the third sentence the guests had a set ball.
"When they bring it to the finish, such a game can already be tilted," Büring knows from years of experience.
Finally, with its routine forces, the USC made everything clear and brought the full yield to the finish.
"We all know who's standing in one of those Derbys on the other side.
This doesn't break our neck.
I've seen really good volleyball in stages," Annacker did not have the 0:3 and immediately went to the agenda.
Where the journey goes for the independent seems not to be foreseeable after just three days of playing.
"It's just too early for that," says Axel Büring.
Only in one he feels confirmed: "The 3rd league has an incredibly good level.
With Regionalliga volleyball, this is not nearly comparable."In the fourth league, they don't want to look down any more.
Should the vests not be polluted in the next few weeks, they must look up.
A first balance sheet can only be drawn after ten or eleven games.
On Saturday we'll go to Emlichheim.
Aasee will take part in Essen on 14 October.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
Heide Keller became a star on the dream ship.
Now she is openly talking about the series having had a co-debt on her marriage with Hans von Borsody.
Her role of Ledebur's chief hostess Beatrice on the dream ship made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 01, 2018 she went off board forever.
The series she became a star could be responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with which she was married for ten years.
"That could have been a reason.
Because I grew up with this work, traveling with a suitcase alone around the world, and many of my admired colleagues noticed me at eye level," Keller tells me in conversation with the "Photo on Sunday".
At first, she had always been only "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but that had changed with the dream ship.
Because now the journalists just called Heide Keller.
"I don't know if he liked it so well."
She thinks it is possible that her husband at that time could have been very jealous, but "how many men also feared Hans talks about problems and feelings".
Keller has always tried for Hans von Borsody "to be the only right person and he didn't want to know my fears, my weaknesses.
That means in good German: I've changed," she continues.
She had always felt like "not good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman whom I was never in truth, even though I sometimes seemed naughty and courageous on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever".
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller once again said Yes, "although I was afraid that it might go wrong a second time."
On the day before the public wedding I was crying in the wardrobe and wanted to cancel everything.
The marriage to Borsody also failed.
Why never did it with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
At the time, Keller's love had come to mind "as in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not commonplace.
I've approached love too naively."
The nightlife, which regularly explores the city's nightlife in the NZZ-ressort of Zurich, has ventured to join the ZFF opening party this time.
Our Falter is not a moth, but a little bit shy.
And the glaring glamour in which a green carpet has been immersed in the 6th lauten square blinds it over a fee.
But it's a movie festival, because more or less famous people want to sunk in the spotlight.
So on this late Thursday evening, he pelts over the square to facilitate himself in the "Aquaclean-WC-Oasis" for a short time.
This is what is called the public toilet facility sponsored by a large sanitary company, which celebrates its premiere at the festival: the need facility in the parterre of a new pavilion makes a lot of effort to flood a luxurious ambience.
That evening, however, it stinks in the Lord's Oasis for some reason to heaven.
So get out here, over to the other side of the street: Loaded guests who have just had a good time in the cinema next to the opening film "Green Book" celebrate the festival beginning each year with a party in the three-storey department store.
Its name fits perfectly with this film festival: The works shown are from the entire world ball.
What do you need to do with an article about this festival in order not to fall into ad for its 190 partner companies?
The folder binds a band around the senses that gave him a good fairy, and two bully doorstands actually waving him in generously.
Inside, the invited people push themselves, they dance to live music far after midnight or can be pretended by DJ rhythms, to which they scream at each other, and rinse down with Cüpli exquisite tips.
In the delicacy shop in the souterrain oysters await slumbering mouths, next door the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut up, a chocolate fountain is sprung.
And the hammer is: All the sales shelves full of exclusive products have not been cleared for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to be working without major losses.
You have to love this country for it!
The folder studies the sign at the escalator: "Wear a long dress, please be careful on the escalator".
If these are two separate instructions, he has turned in the dress code.
But it's more of a conditional construction, and it certainly has saved life.
In the household goods department on the upper floor, the poultry tilts a cocktail prepared with espresso called "Golden Eye", matching the festival award.
This mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself, does not receive the price for the best drink.
And George Clooney, who's been promoting the brand for years, isn't here that night either.
But there, between local prominence, cash desk and kitchen items, a face passes, known to the observer: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
That's probably not where his main actor is.
And really: Viggo Mortensen walks the same way, with soon sixty almost acting like a choir boy, through the crowd.
He's not being squandered, he's not getting caught, he's at most stolen.
Especially for this reluctance, like to be misunderstandingd as a compulsion, international stars love this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with Cumbia dances
Trainer and ex-football star Diego Maradona is delighted with the victory of his team.
Argentina's football legend Diego Maradona seems to have lived well in its new home Mexico.
After a 2:0 victory of his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced with a player in the cabin to Cumbia-Rythmen, as seen in a video already released on Saturday.
In the 15-second clip of a team member Maradona dances in a yellow jersey, fired by the players.
On Saturday, the Mexican second leagueman defeated the Leones Negros by 2:0.
After the game Maradona called in a TV camera "Always with my boys, always".
The 57-year-old has been training the Mexican club since the beginning of September.
Handball: Bundesliga 1: ASV Send according to last-minute plea "destructed on the ground"
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball league league player ASV Send, could hardly believe it: "Such a bitter defeat". His guardians were "destructed on the ground" after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) - Pleite - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday evening at LIT Germania 2.
As in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst, they had not played badly over long phases, the transmitters.
Only the initial phase "we've slept totally," the ASV trainer was angry.
Quickly, at 8:1, the masters of the house did not bear fruit at first, even the early leave that Bieletzki had taken.
"But then suddenly a ruck went through the team," Bieletzki summarized the second quarter hour.
At the break the residue was only two goals.
Above all, Send's Best, Marius Hintze, hit another time in the phase.
After the change it became even better from a visitor's point of view.
After 33 minutes, David took Ernst to 15:15, and then the season changer almost continued.
Four minutes before the siren, the advantage was still apparently soothing three hits (29:26).
And then?
If the impartial is involved in the events.
Bieletzki usually avoids looking for guilt among others.
But: The 120-second time penalty Steffen Mühlhoff filed "was a joke".
LIT had laughed well and met up to the end four more times - while the decimated ASV failed in the last attack.
The boys fought great, stood good in the back against seven men and repeatedly threw into the empty gate.
Only they can buy little for the compliments.
"Now a damn victory has to come," said Bieletzki.
ASV-Tore: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kumper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).
Hoeg (1).
Bavaria: Woman missing for 30 years - Police graves after body parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of an 18-year-old from Naila (Landkreis Hof), the police are looking for the remains of the woman.
On Saturday at Marxgrün, operatives dug up a street.
To this end, the street floor and several layers of it were taken off, as police and prosecutors shared.
According to new findings, the missing may not have been buried far away from their former residence.
The woman has disappeared since 4 November 1986.
The investigators did not rule out a crime at the time.
Since last year, the Criminal Police Court, together with the Public Prosecutor's Office, has been working intensively on the case once again.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Monument Protection Authority, the investigators encountered a conspicuousness under the street near Marxgrün by means of a ground radar.
With the help of a dog trained on the smell of human bones, the officials limited the place to a few meters.
The results of the excavations should be announced during the afternoon.
The hacker attack on millions of Facebook users shows what dangers lie in the web.

Elon Musk, founder of the electric car manufacturer Tesla, has escaped his imminent appointment as head of the billion-weight company.
He and the U.S. board supervisor SEC filed an extrajudicial dispute about misleading Twitter messages in which Musk could have lost permission to run listed companies.
As part of the comparison, Musk and Tesla pay 20 million dollars each, in addition, Musk leaves the office of Chairman for three years, a position comparable to that of the German Supervisory Board.
On the other hand, he is allowed to remain head of the board.
In the comparison, which neither a court nor Musk nor Tesla have to confirm, neither musk nor Tesla admitted misconduct.
The SEC had sued the world-renowned manager before the U.S. Federal Court of Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, who is also head of SpaceX space company, is the public face of loss-writing electric car pioneers, who are now rated at the stock exchange with more than 50 billion dollars.
Musk isn't aware of any guilt
Musk explained that he had done nothing wrong and was sad and disappointed about the complaint.
He has always acted in the sense of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7th, Musk had written his more than 22 million Twitter followers that he might take the company off the stock exchange and pay 420 dollars per share that the financing was secured.
Tesla would have been rated with a total of 72 billion dollars.
Later Musk rowed back: Tesla remains on the stock exchange.
Following the agreement, Tesla now has to find an outside chairman, hire two independent members of the board and also set up a committee to monitor Musk's communication.

Surveys: 46 percent do not want Merkel as Chancellor until 2021
After the cross-sections of the past weeks, GroKo collects several polls.
The SPD falls back in a survey behind the AfD - Angela Merkel is critical.
Berlin - The AfD has overtaken the SPD for the first time on Sunday in the Emnid Sunday trend.
In the weekly survey of the opinion research institute, the AfD increases by a counter to 17 percent, the SPD makes a point compared to the previous week and lands at 16 percent.
CDU and CSU also lose a counter and only reach 27 percent.
This is the lowest value for the Union in the Sunday trend.
Greens reach 15 percent, left 11 and FDP 10 percent.
According to Emnid, the government parties SPD, CDU and CSU would receive only 43 percent of the votes on Sunday's Bundestag election.
In this way, the great coalition has lost the majority of the Sunday issue for all major research institutes, except Allensbach.
Government parties reach 43 to 45 percent of the votes (allesbach: 51 percent).
In 2017, they received a total of 53.4 percent.
The bandwidth is also large for the other parties: The AfD, in several surveys the second strongest party, comes to 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens reach voting shares of 12.5 to 17 percent.
The left side is an average of 10 percent, and the left side is 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, depending on the proportion of votes, such surveys have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent up and down.
But also the restraint for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has fallen significantly since the 2017 Bundestag election.
Currently, only 48 percent of the citizens find Merkel to be the right person in the Chancellor's Office, as the Emnid survey on behalf of the BamS revealed.
According to the survey, only one second (50 percent) is currently wishing that the big coalition holds in three years until the next regular federal elections, 41 percent are for a new election.
In a further survey published on Saturday, there was also a significant fall in popularity for Merkel.
The Germans also split to judge whether Merkel should be candidates for the CDU presidency again in December.
According to Emnid, 47 percent are against it, and 44 percent are against it.
As a result, 64 percent of the Union's supporters are in favour of a candidate country, 35 percent are not.
Hangout at Aldi: Reduced price to love happiness
Will Aldi become Tinder 2.0?
Who says that in times of tinder there are no more romantic acquaintance stories - he should talk to Aldi about puten meat.
Munich - In times of digital "fast-food dating" by Tinder and Co., the supermarket exudes an anachronistic romance as a place of acquaintance for great love love.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced puten meat, boxer short snacks at the sink table or the favorite pudding is in doubt still a better story for the later grandchildren than a mere swipe to the right.
The app Tinder is called to be less a contact, but rather a slippery stock exchange.
We risked the test: How do women react that they don't talk around the hot stock for long in the first news?
Here's the amazing result.
Regular Hollywood Lovestory potential then has it if happiness is preceded by an out-of-the-eye-lost-and-refound plot.
If the guy also reports to his advocacy at the e-mail address bio-putenfleisch@gmx.de, that sounds like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and Consorten - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
For example, the author of this annoyance in an Aldi branch that we don't know, is to wish she would find her dreamer, with whom she had a short conversation about the "30 percent reduced bio-pure meat".
She definitely deserved her Happy End à la Hollywood for believing in the magic of learning analogues.

Football: Reus and Zorc demand peace for idols
Leverkusen (dpa) - BVB sports director Michael Zorc and Captain Marco Reus called for an end to the public discussion on form and fitness of Mario Götze.
"We should stop thinking about Mario.
That's not good for the boy.

ZORC had already emphasized before the game.
For him personally, this is not a simple situation.

Football: Bezirksliga: Researcher appearance of the VfL Wolbeck against the SC Altenrheine takes courage
There were moments in this still young season, when Alois Fetsch went to court with His.
He gave himself the coach of the football district ligate VfL Wolbeck, who left (internally) only to sense about the lack of willingness to perform on the green.
All history.
In the meantime it runs around the Brandhoveweg again.
Taufrischer Belege is the 1:1 on Sunday against the SC Altenrheine, in the past season only thinly swept past the ascent.
Yeah, I'm very happy with the performance.
"We have tightened the rooms and put pressure on the ball.
That could be seen," Fetsch praised his boys and visited each individual for the game, simply to say "Thank you" for so much resistance against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to make a system change after 26 minutes.
After the injury of Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - for him Luca Rehberg - it almost seamlessly passed from the 4-4-2 into a 4-2-3-1, in which Niklas Thewes was waiting in front of balls.
Wolbeck had significantly more game shares in the first section.
And chances.
But Frerichs before his date (17th), Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the tour.
This almost occurred when, in minute 41, the SCA beat up two times in person by Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbaumer dangerously in front of the Wolbecker box - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be the master of his profession.
After the break, the VfL often took full control.
Thewes from 18 meters failed scarcely.
Schroer also came too late after 58 minutes with a Thewes input.
With the change of Miles Geske, Fetsch on the left missed a fresh cell cure again.
When Altenrheines Chris Naberbaumer fell in the 70th minute Robin Westhues, 18 meters in front of the guest house there was an indirect kick-off for the place masters.
The faulted man himself took his own action and demonstrated his peril at standards.
Westhues" Ding with the right flap hit left at the bottom from the point of view of the shooter - 1:0 (71.).
20 minutes to get fucking long.
And then that: VfL captain Florian Quabeck flew in the 80th minute the leather in the punishment room unhappyly at hand.
Arbitrator Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79.).
Afraid minutes Wolbeck had to survive in the final phase before Geske had the victory hit on the pussy in the 87th minute from twelve meters.
Could have been too much of the good.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75th Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26th L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66th Geske) - Thewes

Starting position: Four points after five days of play - that couldn't be enough Trainer Adi Hütter.
Against Hannover 96, Eintracht Frankfurt finally wanted to ensure the first home victory.

Helicopter crashed in Kottingbrunn
At the time of landing, there was an accident at the airfield.
The four inmates were slightly injured.
At around 2 p.m., a drama occurred on Sunday at the airport in Kottingbrunn.
In the landing of a helicopter, there was turbulence, as the police confirmed against oe24.
The heli was captured by a windbow, forced to the ground and came to the side to lie down.
Police, rescue and fire brigade were immediately agreed.
With a large bid, the forces came to the accident scene.
In order to be careful, the ÖAMTC notary helicopter was also called.
Inmates only slightly injured
Fortunately, everything turned out to be largely harmless.
There's only one damage.
The four inmates were injured only slightly and were able to return home on their own.

Report of the Allbright Foundation: Women remain a rarity on corporate directors
As a result, only 8 per cent of the board members were female on September 1st, as is shown by the report "The Power of Monoculture", which is officially presented by the Allbright Foundation on Monday and was submitted to the German press agency in advance.
"The companies will have to stand up differently, otherwise the international competitors will pass by them," said Foundation Managing Director Wiebke Anchoren.
In the United States, Great Britain or Sweden, male-occupied management teams - with few exceptions - are no longer imaginable.
The residue makes the German competitors less diverse, innovation-friendly and future-oriented.
It's a different corporate culture.
The small increase in the proportion of women among the German stock exchange companies is also due to positive impulses among the companies of the index of medium values (MDax).
According to Allbright, only 6.8 percent of the board members are female.
In the previous year, however, the value was still at 3.8%.
The proportion of women stagnated with the 30 Dax companies - in recent years pioneers.
Last 26 women worked on the board.
"I am sure that the Dax companies will recruit consistent women again next year - in their own interest," said Anchorsen.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement would have signalled that they would not continue to commit themselves to increasing the share of "zero percent" so far.
Another picture is given by the Supervisory Boards: As of September 1, the proportion of women was 30.5% - 45 women more and 68 men less than a year ago.
"An equal number of women were recruited every year for the board of directors, and a 40% share would have been reached in 2023," the report states.
Some even make Misese: Luxury Cars: Which manufacturer earns most per car?
It's best to get Ferrari.
The Italians take 280.000 euros with each Ferrari sold and make 69,000 euros of operating profit.

Whoever makes the most profit per car among the nobles providers.

"Autopapst" and economic professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer dealt with this question.
His study shows: The differences are massive.
Ferrari made 69,000 euros of operating profit in the first half of the year with each car sold - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only comes to around 800 euros, Tesla and Bentley even put a lot of money on it with every car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are well in the race with prices of an average of 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and around 3,000 euros profit before interest and taxes EBIT.

Torch train for the opening of the 60th abtswinder Weinfest
With a torch train, the Tourist Association in Abtswind opened its wine festival session.
For the 60th time, the association organizes the wine festivals, which from then on rise every Saturday in October in the large festival tent on Rehweiler Straße.

The president of the Tourist Association, Wolfgang Starz, Mayor Jürgen Schulz and wine princess Lisa Kursawe welcomed the guests in the already profuse festival tent. "60 years of this kind - this is an insanity for a small town with 800 inhabitants.
That's what you can be proud of," said Starz, thanking all the helpers.
Princess of Wine Lisa II later found himself symbolically with the guests from the stage.
"It's nice that so many have found the way to us to abbot wind." Later, "The Troglauer" created a mood.
On Sunday, on which also the abbotswinder Kirchweih was celebrated, the association had set the drinks prices on the occasion of the anniversary in the afternoon as 60 years ago.
A festive evening for the 60th wine festival takes place on Friday, October 5, in the guest's house, before going to the second round a day later in the festival tent.
In Bonn: emergency car power in Taxi
An emergency car is severely damaged next to a road.
A 27-year-old passantin has been killed in the collision of the used vehicle with a taxi.
When emergency doctors are called, they should help - best even save human lives.
Such a rescue took a deadly end for a 26-year-old in Bonn.
Bonn - In the collision of an emergency car with a taxi, a 26-year-old pedestrian was killed in Bonn.
The taxi driver, the emergency doctor and their drivers were seriously injured, as the police told us.
On Saturday afternoon, the 46-year-old driver of the emergency medical car had crossed a red light with blue light and Martinshorn.
He then found himself on a crossroads with the taxi that was driving green.
After the collision, the doctor car slumbered against an ampel mast and a tree.
He captured the passerby who died at the accident site.
Driver of emergency car and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the emergency car were severely injured in their vehicles and had to be freed from forces.
The also seriously injured 29-year-old emergency doctor was able to free herself, but the pedestrian could not help her anymore.
Another convoyed emergency doctor tried this - but without success.
The three seriously injured were taken to hospitals.
The police, in close coordination with the Bonn Procuratorate, determine who is to blame for the accident.
Manchester United loses again, for Mourinho we make it uncomfortable
After the blamable finish in the league Manchester United now loses in the 7th round of the Premier League.
ManU 1:3 is subject to West Ham United. The way of defeat is likely to be still to be spoken.
The scene was illustrated in the 74th minute, in which the recovered Marko Arnautovic shot the 3:1 for West Ham; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford had supposedly led the Red Devils back into the game.
Since they suspected an offside at the pass of Mark Nobel, all the defense players of Manchester remained standing, leaving Arnautovic all the time in the world to shoot the ball past the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative highlight of an already far-reaching performance.
The mood at Uniteds Stadtrivale Manchester City is very different at present.
The Citizens trained by Mourinho's great competitor Pep Guardiola came against Brighton & Hove Albion for an approximate 2-0 victory.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling broke through the defense bar of the outsider for the home team for the first time.
After a good hour and a double pass with the former goalkeeper, Sergio Agüero ensured the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus also the jump to the top of the table.
Liverpool Not More Table Leader
Three days after the 1:2 defeat in the league, Xherdan Shaqiri and Liverpool fought a 1:1 against Chelsea in the Premier League.
As with the Cup-Aus, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man with the Londoners.
The score of the 27-year-old in the 25th minute remained the only hit of the game until the final stage.
Shaqiri, who came to the field in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, barely missed the compensation after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge made it better in the 89th minute with his sling.
So after the Reds started with a flawless balance in the week, Chelsea was not to beat for the second time.
At first, the Londoners eliminated Jürgen Klopp's team in the Cup, and the Blues Liverpool fell from the top of the table by remis in the league.
Like City, the two London City Clubs Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) celebrated 2:0 victories.
However, the fans of the Gunners, where Granit Xhaka played through, had to wait against the surprise team from the county of Hertfordshire until the 81st minute for a success report.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defender Craig Cathcart unluckyly introduced Alex Iwobi to his own goal, but only two minutes later, Mesut Özil made the decision with his third season hit.
Arsenal passed Watford due to the fifth consecutive victory and is now right behind the big rival Tottenham in place 5. A strong impression continues to leave Wolverhampton climber under his Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.
The Wolves remained unbeated in the league for the fifth time in a row at 2:0 against Southampton and finished in 8th place.
The VW core brand is missing: Paris Motor Show in the sign of the diesel debate
The Paris Motor Show takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially no topic and yet omnipresent: The diesel scandal and the ringing of bans and retrofittings should not let go of the German car companies even at the industry meeting in Paris.
At the 2018 Automobile Salon, they will show their innovations from next week together with the competition from all over the world in the French capital.
The diesel does not really play a big role anymore.
The possible exchange and retrofit offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are to be negotiated with the government in Berlin until then, should nevertheless be an important topic at least behind the brilliant scenes of the booths.
A big name is missing in Paris: the Volkswagen Group is involved with Audi, Porsche and other daughters, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are there, among other things, with their first pure electric models: the e-tron of the Ingolstädter will be on the market at the end of the year, the EQC of the Stuttgarter 2019.
Both were officially presented.
BMW's iNext is expected to start in 2021.
The focus in Paris is on the new 3rd.
A total of more than 250 exhibitors will be present this year from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car companies, motorcycle manufacturers as well as numerous mobility services and software providers are present in each of their own halls.
The fair, which celebrates its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, about one million visitors came.
At least 380 people died on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi during the severe earthquakes and the following tsunami.
Dozens are still missing.
In addition, there are more than 500 injured.
The island was shaken by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first earthquake had the strength 5,9, the second the strength 7,4.
Communication and transport links are damaged, and huge material damage has arisen.
After the earthquake, the tsunami broke into the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town of Palu hundreds had gathered on the beach for a festival.
It is feared that the number of victims will rise significantly.
So far, the figures are only from Palu.
However, there are also many other municipalities affected - along Sulawesis's west coast.
About 150 bikers celebrate service in Werdohl
Motorcycle pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the final service for motorcyclists in the Peace Church in Eveking on Sunday with a team of helpers.
Werdohl - The square in front of the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to the motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the final service for the bikers was on the program.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and thus responsible for the mental care of the PS-strong two-wheelers.
Between April and September, the traditional motorcycle service (MoGo) will always take place on the last Sunday of a month at the House Nordhelle.
The bikers traditionally celebrate the end of the season in the Peace Church in Eveking.
About 150 bikers had gathered there on Sunday to perform anything other than ordinary worship.
From 10 a.m. on, the Bolids were lined up in front of the church entrance portal.
At first, the biker-earlies were on the program and it was allowed to be strengthened with coffee and cake or even with a rich curry sausage.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were also present.
The sermon was delivered during the biker’s service to pastor Dirk Grzegorek.
The singer-songwriter Valerie Lill provided the musical support.
"Although the bikers prefer the blues rock, Valerie Lill is rather poetically calm tones," said Father Frank Schröder.
This too was certainly a novel in the history of motorcycle worship yesterday.
Fuchtorfer Heimatverein celebrates a big celebration: After the apple the milk comes
And Borisch was also active on the actual action day.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg was also of great interest.
He had his apple press in his luggage and demonstrated his astounding spectators step by step the process from the ripe apple to the apple juice.
Then and when Hartmann-Niemerg left the field to the children and let them fill the apples in the great funnel.
With a little muscle strength, the apples became a finely crushed mass.
Not many of the children could imagine how it should make a tasty drink.
But they could also look at this important step on this late Friday afternoon.
Packed in shapes and covered with nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the little piece of apple that looks a little like pickle.
Thanks to a certain technical support, the last step was no longer so difficult.
The freshly pressed juice gradually ran into a large container.
But the Füchtorfer farmer had already already filled out specialties with it.
So he opened his "shadow box" and presented the older visitors to the latest spring whites.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Fuchtorf" was accordingly great.
In a cozy atmosphere, the parents came into conversation, while the children were not only able to follow the process of apple pressing, but also discovered the built Hüpfburg for themselves.
Also active in the Führorfer comradeship of former soldiers were engaged in the festival and invited at some stations to leisurely games.
The home association will also offer an action day in the coming year.
But then, as Gregor Krutzkamp stressed, the home house in the heart of the asparagus village will not be the place of the event.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also obvious because of the subject: finally, it will go around the milk.
1:4 vs. Frankfurt: Hanover with fourth season: "Bush Situation"
Frankfurt/Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed professionals from Hannover 96 around him and gave them courage.
However, much positive was previously not seen at the 1:4 (0:2) of the last table at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It's a fucking situation, but you have to get out of there as a team," said 96 football pro Pirmin Schwegler and after, "This is, of course, disappointing, because you always do a lot of things."
The further victoryless Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86.) met, are at the bottom with two counters and in their current constitution are a candidate for descent.
Frankfurt was led by the outstanding Ante Rebic, on the other hand, to celebrate the first season home victory.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45.+1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59.) and Luka Jovic (89.) scored the goals of 46,300 spectators for the DFB Cup winner, who after the successful general sample for the Europa League League game against Lazio Rome with seven points in the middle of the table.
Croatia's Vice-World Champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive action of Hessen during his start-up debut and never to be gripped by Hanover's defense.
The striker, who had been hit for a long time after the World Cup, showed with his speed and enforceability why he was so valuable to the match.
In addition to Rebic, Brazilian Allan, who had been loaned by Liverpool, was the first time in the Frankfurter initial formation.
A headball of Lucas Torró (17th) falsified on the goalnet posed a danger for the first time.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in a promising position at the last moment by the 96-defence around the Brazilian Felipe, who replaced the short-term Kevin Wimmer (back).
The leadership of the housekeepers was almost necessarily and totally deserved.
Filip Kostic raised the ball to the penitentiary after a counter-point, Haller extended by head in front of the gate where Ndicka only needed to hold his foot.
It was the first Bundesligat-reffer for the resistance player AJ Auxerre, who came in summer.
And Frankfurt left before the break.
This time Haller matched his storm partner Rebic, who skillfully refuelled himself and left no chance for a 96-torque Michael Esser.
In the mid-term, Hannover-Coach Breitenreiter responded to the weak performance of his eleven and brought two new offensive forces in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
The Lower Saxony played a little more boldly forward, but lighting ideas remained out until just before the end, when the connecting hit was still successful.
The Hessens were much more efficient.
After almost an hour, Rebic started a solo and then placed across De Guzmán, who had only to push the ball into the empty goal.
For the Frankfurters, the rest were only shows for over-required guests, Jovic also met one minute before the end.
The Morlaix Square becomes a party mile
Würselen Despite cool temperatures, there was a good mood during the October festival in the city centre.
The Munich mayor Dieter Reiter managed to open the 185th in front of millions of people.
Munich Wies'n last week with two hits.
Geisings: Geisinger Christians celebrate Holy Cross Festival
The Geisinger Catholics celebrate the Holy Cross festival on September 14th or on Sunday after.
The festive service takes place in the city church, then a procession to the Holy Cross Church with the final blessing.
The Church of the Holy Cross houses the shot Christ, who comes from the 30-year-old war and on whom the legend is said to have shot a Swedish soldier.
Then out of the gunshot wound, blood flowed.
This led to a great pilgrimage to the shot Christ, which led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
This is still not finished, only the altar is standing, the missing long house is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon, Father Adolf Buhl recalls that the cross is a sign of hope, consolation and life.
Despite the importance for the Geisinger parish, the service was badly visited.
After the service the procession to the Holy Cross Church took place and with the end of the blessing the church part of the feast of the Cross ended.
For many years, the Catholic Church choir has been inviting to the Catholic parish hall for the secular part of the festival.
The choir members provided visitors with hearty food as well as a large selection of cakes and weather adapted, farm ice cream.
In the afternoon the parish community still offered guided tours around the town church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed visitors on behalf of the parish community about the damage to facade, roof, sandstone works and windows as well as the upcoming construction measures that will continue until the next year.
After the scaffolding had been over for some time, the damage could be determined more accurately and the individual tenders could be prepared more concretely.
It is certain that renovation will be more expensive than planned, because the damage already existing a few years ago has grown, but more has also been found, which was only possible through the in-eye inspection by means of scaffolding.
The pedestal cleaning work is completed, the natural stone works are to be started before winter, and it is hoped that half of these works will be completed this year.
Inauguration: Neue Wohnheim in der Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
The Donau-Iller Lebenshilfe opens a new home for people with disabilities in the Münsterblickstraße.
That "a very special house" of its destiny is now handed over in the Münsterblickstraße - there were all present at the inauguration date agreed.
Finally, the twelve wheelchair drivers, who have been living in the home of the Donau-Iller Lebenshilfe for some time now, depend on the special architecture of the new building.
Wider corridors, corridors and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas have been taken into account by architect Rudolf Bader in his concept.
The first plans began about eight years ago when the former US Army officer building was put on the test stand for the residents with mobile phone cap: "The house had arrived in the years and no longer in time in the equipment," Bader said retrospect.
In 2016, the excavators pressed to tear down the house.
The new building should be made as friendly and bright as possible so that the inhabitants can feel comfortable in it, the architect said.
Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens new home
About 4.6 million euros invested in the new construction.
The Free State allocated EUR 2.4 million, the district of Schwaben, EUR 450000.
According to architect Bader, construction work has remained in the planned framework - both time and financial.
He was also thanked by the managing director of Lebenshilfe, Jürgen Heinz.
The gap between a barrier-free and fire-proof construction was not always easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen with the many specifications had built a home that allowed the inhabitants the freedom to move even without foreign help.
Similarly, Gertrud Kreutmayer, head of the Schwaben District Social Administration, said: "The house is geared to the special needs of its inhabitants, who need resources to be mobile."
The homeliness and functionality had been well combined, said Kreutmayer.
And further: "The property in this position is a real happiness, because it is no longer possible to acquire it in the present situation".
Overall, the new residence in the Münsterblickstraße can accommodate nearly 1500 square meters of space for 30 people with disabilities, who are divided into three groups.
Pride is the life-aid manager Heinz on the eleven full-time workers all employed by tariff.
Germany: Heavy complains of differences between East and West
Berlin - Before the Day of Unity, Deputy SPD President Manuela Schwesig has appealed to all compatriots not to deal with the disadvantage of East Germans.
There are differences that hurt after almost 30 years of unity.
We must not be satisfied with these differences," said the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern to the "day mirror on Sunday".
The objective must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that, on average, East Germans worked longer than the people in West Germany, but were 15 percent less paid.
"I can't explain this to anyone almost 30 years after the German Unity," said Schwesig.
North Korea: Does this cute dog end the Korea conflict?
The one-year-old Pungsan-Jagdhund is supposed to smooth the waves between the two Koreas.
In an effort to relax relations with Seoul, Pjöngjang made the South Korean President Moon Jae a gift in two North Korean pungsan hunting dogs.
As Moon's office announced on Sunday, the two dogs, about one year old, reached their recipient on Thursday.
They therefore passed the border town of Panmunjom along with three kilograms of dog food to make it easier for the animals to get used to.
The dogs with the thick white fur, pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They belong to the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The friendship was announced by the North at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean powerholder Kim Jong Un in Pjöngjang in mid-September.
Both countries also agreed to join forces in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and to join forces to participate in the 2032 Olympic Games.
In the course of the mutual approach, Kim also agreed to close the test facility Tongchang Ri for rocket drives.
Austria's moving history in the mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
To the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated for almost ten months since this commemorative year, numerous new books have been published, which usually answer this question in retrospect of the past hundred years.
In a very different way, Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and director-general of the Austrian State Archives, puts it in the magnificent "Bilderbuch" Austria, which will appear on 1 October.
New week, new opportunity for the government
Back to the subject-matter - that is the unofficial motto for today's working week of the Great Coalition.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech in which the Chancellor and her ministers from CDU, SPD and also from the CSU recently did not make a mantra of the "return to the subject-matter".
This may have led so many craftsmen, doctors, cashiers and other working citizens in this country to the legitimate question, which is actually the difference between work and physical work, but be it about it.
Now, when the Federal Government is ready to devote itself again to its mission - to governing - it should not now be held off with debate on terms.
Whether Union and SPD can actually do something together after the provocations and blows of the last weeks, may already show Monday.
In the evening, the Heads of Government meet at the Coalition Committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to convene this round regularly to defuse conflicts early; a lesson from all this dispute.
First of all, the diesel retrofits and the labour force immigration law are again on the agenda for conflict-responsible issues.
CSU transport minister Scheuer wants to let the car companies get away with exchange premiums, SPD and CDU see manufacturers in the obligation to technical retrofit older diesel.
While the diesel crisis over the weekend has seen a close-up, the Union and SPD are still far apart from the planned labour force immigration law.
The SPD calls for a stay perspective for rejected asylum seekers who work or do training.
The Union is strictly opposed to the change of track from the asylum system to the labour market.
So there will be again disputes among the coalition partners - and how should it be different?
Not immediately and equally, GroKo has joined forces, but three partners with partly very different social images and priorities.
Dispute is good.
Without dispute, a society of such diverse, sometimes contradictory interests does not progress.
To be constructive, however, disputes must not be built up again for partial tactical reasons on the question of being or being non-existent.
It's still about politics, not theater.
Union and SPD should argue - but always have in mind the reality of life of people.
What is feasible and useful to many?
With this key question, both the diesel as well as the change of track question can be clarified pragmatically - and thus regain confidence.
Above all, the popular parties must fight now.
Pilz checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister of the Visitors
Does the Minister of Labour infringe the applicable law of service?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look at this.
"Really day and night" had her legalists worked on the social security reform, reported an over-increasing social minister in the presentation of the same two weeks ago.
In Liste-Pilz-Mandatarin Daniela Holzinger, the statement of Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) comes up with surprise - she now brings the matter to Parliament by request.
She assumes that "the minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm about the use of her team and not to declare any infringements of applicable duty in front of ongoing cameras".
Nevertheless, she now has questions to say "no" to Har tinger.
Police are taking a road in search of women's bodies
Marxgrün - Lange didn't want the police to comment on this.
Now there's a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, we have been digging on the state road between Naila and Bad Steben.
The route is still closed in the Marxgrün area until Monday.
It was preceded by the fact that the investigators had previously used an archaeology dog.
The dog, specially trained for the smell of old human bones, together with its leader in multiple use, could finally limit the relevant place to a few meters.
In addition, a soil anomaly was discovered together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the highest Bavarian memorial authority in the area of the said street.
For more than a year, the Public Prosecutor's Office and Criminal Police Court have been handling the missing case.
Again and again a cycle path was blocked at Marxgrün and investigated with sonar devices, because the investigators suspect that here in the course of the new construction of the state road 30 years ago Heike's body could have been tightened.
Color powder and eggs: crayons in Barcelona before Catalonia anniversary
On Monday, the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia will take place for the first time.
But before that, there are scratches.
The separatists did not forget the police deployment in autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan Independence referendum of October 1, 2017, there were conflicts between separatists and police in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by the independent advocates with, among other things, colour powder when they wanted to prevent them from approaching a demonstration of the National Police and the Civil Guard.
Some 3,000 police officers from the Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil police forces wanted to honor their colleagues with a rally that was used in the polls last year at the illegal referendum.
In the attempt to prevent citizens from voting, violence had also taken place at the time.
The Catalan police had formed a chain to keep separate the demonstrations of the separatists and the central government security forces, reported Spanish media.
However, some of the 6000 separatists would have violently tried to break through the police chain, and the officials would have, among other things, threw coloured bags and eggs.
Six persons had been arrested and 24 others had been slightly injured, according to the authorities.
On Monday, for the first time, the independence referendum will be held.
Following the vote and a subsequent decision to split the wealthy region of Spain, the central government in Madrid had forced Catalonia to administer it in autumn 2017.
The then Regional President, Carles Puigdemont, fled to exile in Belgium.
Other politicians also moved abroad.
On the other hand, several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement remain in U-Haft.
In December, elections had been held in the region.
After the new Catalan government took office in May, the forced administration was terminated.
But the new regional president Quim Torra also insists on the "right to self-determination" of the Catalans.
Football: Oberliga Westphalia: Aggregated dissatisfaction: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen separates themselves goallessly
Red-white Ahlen continues on the spot.
Also the FC Gütersloh was only a 0:0 decision.
The final light and the third last they unpupped before 438 spectators at the Heidewald Stadium as a gathered inconsistency.
The first half was very manageable by the entertainment factor.
Therefore, if you would prefer to get a beer or a roast sausage, you could do so without worry.
There was no danger of missing a goal chance, because there was practically none.
First shot after half an hour
Güterslohs Nick Flock was responsible for the first (harmless) goal shot of the entire game in the 28th minute.
The best - and in principle also only real - possibility had the Ahleners, when Cihan Yilmaz FCG-Torwart Frederic Westergerling forced a parade from the criminal room border after 32 minutes.
Even more harmless were the hosts.
Their most effective action was an early change.
Stürmer Lars Schröder had to be replaced as a result of injury, for him came Sinan Aygün.
After the change, both teams decided to do something about the growing boredom.
In the 48th minute Sebastian Mützel from 18 metres just over the housing and after an hour the freighters also appeared offensively for the first time.
After a ball conquest of Matthew Wieckovicz, it went fast.
The speedy concert about Sinan Aygün "kronte" Nick Flock (62.) with a little shot in the arms of RWA-Torwart Bernd Schipmann.
They also played with a headball of Wieckovicz (66.) after a corner ball of ex-Ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA interim trainer Angelo Daut responded, initially brought Marko Onucka to Martin Fuhsy (60.) and later Enes Güney to Sebastian Mützel (70.).
It didn't cause anything.
More than optical superiority thanks to their own initiative the Ahleners did not achieve.
It wasn't until the 91st minute that Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but she didn't get anything.
Angelo Daut tried to stretch out the positive: "I like that we played to zero", but unfortunately the zero also stood at the front.
"We weren't as dangerous this time as we were against woodwindede, and even though our opponent didn't want to play here," said RW Ahlens Interimtrainer.
Offensively, "everything was kind of a bit" against a team that just wanted to defend.
Anyway, I didn't feel like we could get a counter-gate," said Daut.
To his suffering, however, as a spectator, one did not feel that his team could shoot a goal.
The idea was too poor for that.
Breckenfelder Harvest Thank you market: Luckily there are enough Kreimers
Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder Table Edition Office, for which these donations are intended.
The volunteers insure: "These donations remain also in Reckenfeld".
At the opening, the sky was bright blue, but the place was still a little empty, but that should change over the course of the day.
Because: "Here it is so nice social, that's why we're here today," said one visitor.
Organizer of the Feast Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit as always with a proper pinch humor.
For the married couple Brockmann, who should actually be weighed against food, F. Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer short-term.
The Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become ill.
But there's enough Kreimers.
And the "replacement" did not allow itself to entertain the more and more visitors in between.
This was so good that some folk songs were sung at an hour later.
"Just great," Marcel Kreimer was delighted.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to accommodate the opening date this time in his schedule.
He is pleased with the many active people with their stands, among them mostly clubs.
"In fact, there should not be something like a table," he thanked himself for the action of the male choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the use of all those who were in use at the stands and also included the further festivals held in September and the "Clean Up" action.
Our garden town gives itself a colorful painting - here goes something.
Then the Maikranz was taken by Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück with the help of the fire department and taken to the winter quarters.
On many stands, work was done for the physical well - being.
From sweet to hearty, everything was to have.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only been living in Reckenfeld for a year, was creative on his decouper's saw.
Furnace work, beer lid with rear fields motifs and a lot more he had on offer.
A speciality offered three Beekeepers: "Rackenfelder Honig", brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wettershoven and Helen Roth-Bushschlüter.
The latter has a speciality.
Honey cake in the glass, of course with honey from my own production.
The little Elsa had to access it again and again, and the cake tasted so good.
It is the gathering that left the visitors long until the evening hours, even without a stage program that is not available at the autumn festival.
Lubricating with Local Policy Message: No successful advertising for Skate Plant
In Lengerich, unknowns have in no way promoted the construction of a skate plant.
In several places there are corresponding lubrications, says Jürgen Köhn of the city administration at the request of the WN.
In at least one case, the police have been fined for damages.
In large letters, the three words "Skatepark für Lengerich!" rang on signs on the Gempt-Halle and the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, Manager of the Halle, reports that already after the professional election fair on 19 September, a corresponding letter had been discovered on the advertising sign at the staircase to the Gempt-Bistro.
Since the short message had apparently been left "only" with an edding at the time, it could easily have been removed.
"Just a few days later, it was there again, this time sprayed up," says Rottmann.
He assumes that the appropriate advertising sign must be replaced.
A special note is given to this case by the fact that on the board several large companies from Lengerich are also called.
If the skate system is built, its realization will also be made possible by sponsors.
There are already commitments, explains Jörg Hesselmann from the urban department of school, sport and culture, without mentioning any names.
However, it is possible that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the smeared board.
For years, local policy and administration have been dealing with the topic of skating.
After the old at the LWL clinic had been dismantled, the search for an alternative location began after some time.
Finally, the Council declared itself to be a majority in favour of the parking lot for fire brigade.
However, this approach was not implemented - too many factors apparently spoke against a construction at this point.
At the end of June a turnaround followed.
The members of the main and financial committee now voted unanimously for the Gutenberg School area.
Jürgen Köhn says about the state of affairs that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning.
The last word was given to the city council.
He assumes a decision this year, so that a positive vote could be built in 2019.
Air traffic control bottleneck is getting worse
Frankfurt/Hamburg After the European air traffic forecast in summer, the German air traffic controllers see no signs of improvement in the coming year.
"This year we had wind, we will have strong wind in 2019 and then the storm will come," said Matthias Maas, head of the air traffic control union, the German press agency before the aviation summit in Hamburg on 5 October.
An important reason for the numerous delays and flight failures is the long-known personnel shortage in European air traffic control systems, for which there is no rapid solution.
"Airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year, but the training of new pilots lasts four to five years," said the trade unionist.
The market for newly trained pilots throughout Europe was empty.
About a hundred people were missing in the centre of Karlsruhe to monitor the upper German airspace.
Maas once again criticized the fact that various air transport unions were not invited to the summit.
On Friday, representatives of the federal, state, air navigation, airlines and airports meet in the Hanseatic city to address the causes of delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work compression and overtime, this will not be possible without us," said the head of the GdF, who has many members at the German air traffic control in Germany.
Maas once again held the responsibility of the EU Commission for the Lotsen-Miser.
Traffic forecasts for the current regulatory period by 2019 had been far too low.
The resulting costs and personnel savings in national air navigation systems are now fully in line with the operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Minister of Transport Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to work in Brussels for regulations that "do not further decouple the air".
At present, EU targets would be coordinated by 2024 and further strengthening should be feared.
The EU has been subject to constant lobby printing by airlines.
"Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they have sown in recent years," Maas said.
He hoped that the high delay costs of airlines would lead to a rethinking.
The GdF would only be involved in improving the situation if the German Air Safety Agency (DFS) offered a "voiceful training and future pact", said Maas.
The annual intake of 120 lottery students over the next five years has been just enough to compensate for age-related departures.
The necessary staffing is not yet connected to it.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board agrees on corporate restructuring
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously in favour of the plans for the conversion of the Group.
According to Thyssenkrupp's interim head Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed Chairman of the Board at the Sunday meeting, the critical group is to be divided into two independent companies.
Both companies should have their headquarters in Essen and be listed on the stock exchange.
There should not be an additional reduction of staff beyond the already known reductions in administration.
After two resignations, the control body on the capital side only counts eight heads.
Ten representatives of the employees are opposed to this.
However, the final decision is expected to take a Annual General Meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG will include, among other things, the 50 percent share of the merged steel business with the Indian partner Tata.
In the second company Thyssenkrupp Industries AG, the business is to be bundled with lifts and supplies.
Barcelona: Violence in demos of police officers and Catalan independence advocates.
In two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish police officers and Catalan independence advocates in Barcelona, there have been violent conflicts with numerous injured persons.
According to the city administration, about 3,000 police officers from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as well as some 6000 independent supporters.
The Catalan police tried with a big bid to keep the two protests apart.
According to the forces, however, independence advocates repeatedly tried to break through the security barrier.
You'd have attacked the officers with color and shots.
Rangeleien also reportedly existed between the participants of the various protest trains.
According to emergency workers, 24 people were injured.
The police told us there were six arrests.
Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues
With their demonstration, the police wanted to honor the colleagues who had taken action almost exactly a year ago against the referendum of independence prohibited by the Spanish central government in Catalonia.
At the same time, they demanded better salaries.
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil feel it is unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers earn significantly more than they do.
The demonstrators felt it was provocation that the Spanish police protested in Barcelona.
"Why did they come here to protest?" asked the 55-year-old Catalan demonstrator Manel Perez of the news agency AFP.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that a year ago they had drowned us.
A 31-year-old police officer from the Balearic Islands who only wanted to give his name to Daniel rejected the accusation.
"Of course, we want to support our comrades, who did only their duty last year: to defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is in order to enforce our rights and we do it in Barcelona because it is a great European city and there is more echo here.
But he and his colleagues "did not come to provoke," the police assured.
Panne permitted access to personal data of British Minister
A security gap in a mobile app has caused the personal data of ministers and representatives of the British Conservative Tory Party to be temporarily accessible to everyone on Saturday.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from unknowns after the Panne became known a day before the Tory Party in Birmingham.
Two people clamped on B217
On Sunday morning, the Hannover police report a serious traffic accident on the Federal Road 217, Hamelner Chaussee, at the village exit of Wettbergen in the direction of Ronnenberg.
Two people died driving their car against a tree.

Football: Juve Trainer Praises After Top Part: Ronaldo's Best Game
The Portuguese star stormer had "played the best game together with half an hour of Valencia this evening," said Juve-Coach Massimiliano Allegri after the 3:1 (1:1) victory of the record champion against the SSC Naples.
For the coach, the expensive star was also the decisive man in the important game against the persecutor without his own goal.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and is doing well," Allegri said.
Even though we started with tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good at our first goal - and from the moment we grew.
Thanks to Ronaldo's three goal templates, Juve turned the game through the hits of Dries Mertens (10th minute) after the early delay and hung the worst follower for the time being.
The goal hunter, brought by Real Madrid, first imposed on the former Bundesliga professional Mario Mandzukic, who took care of the leadership with a double pack (26th/49th).
After a corner by headball Ronaldo also made the preliminary work for the hit of the defense chief Leonardo Bonucci (76.), who had only to push in shortly before the goal line.
"He gives many templates," the coach praised.
But of course Allegri also wants to see gates from the attacker, who is both in the Champions League and in the Portuguese national team of the record-torso.
"We need to get even better at serving him," the coach demanded.
Best Juve torso is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three on the account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, Juventus’ overpower seems to be even more oppressive.
Seven wins in seven games is the flawless series in the series A. At 21 points the champion of the previous seven years has already six counters ahead of Naples.
The second table, which was trained by former Bayer-Coach Carlo Ancelotti, was not impossible against Turin.
But at the latest after the place reference of the already warned Mario Rui (58.) the top lot was decided.
The Portuguese had to go too hard against Paulo Dybala with yellow-red from the square.
"We played well against a good Naples," the Turin Coach commented.
Emre Can was also allowed to feel there.
The German national player has won out at Juve.
==References====External links==* Official website
The midfielder also played in the Champions League against Valencia, which Allegri said with the "half hour": Ronaldo had fled from the square during the 2/0 victory of the Turiners and was locked for home game on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West changes his name
With a particularly quirky performance, Rapper Kanye West took care of attention at the US TV show "Saturday Night Live" on the weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume provided foreheads and question marks for the spectators.
In addition, the 41-year-old announced a change of name on time to release his new album.
From now on, let's just call him "Ye", says the musician.
"The being that was formerly known as Kanye West," he tweeted in response to the late singer Prince when he took his name from the artist.
The pseudonym, however, is not a news.
The tenth album was released under this name.
In an interview with the radio station KRRL, the artist explained that "Ye" has a religious significance for him.
"I believe "Ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means "you", says the rapper.
Football: Kreisliga A1 Münster: Finally!
Got it!
Hoetmar's coach, Averhage, made no secret of his disappointment.
That was a weak game of ours today.
The opponent was just more sluggish, we have put him almost never before problems". According to the list of Hoetmarer shot options reads accordingly.
Grade two goals in 90 minutes, so it is rare to make games positive.
Football-Kreisliga A1: SC Hoetmar subject SG Sendhorst with 0:2 (0:1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG also had only two options in the first pass, but the first used Maik Krause from a sharp angle to an early guide (7.).
In the 43rd minute Steffen could have increased uphus, but after a great preliminary work of Krause he moved freely.
The hosts had only a double opportunity when Moritz Höne failed at first to Torsteher Jos Schuhmacher and in the advance Jan Blome also found his master in the broadcaster Keeper.
After the break the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49.), Julian Turl (61,) and Heinz Linnemann (69.) all surrendered.
A trade meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved by hand on the goalline and saw red for it - Niklas Eilmann also could not use for the guests (75.).
It was only when Nils Berheide stuttered the ball over the line that the game was decided (81.).
"We had criticised ourselves before, which was different today than in the last weeks," said Florian Kraus.
Sendhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77. Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90. Leibig), Turl.
Towers: 0:1 Krause (7.), 0:2 Berheide (81.).

Football: Kreisliga A2 Münster: Spectacle Football in Albachten: GW Albersloh subject Concordia with 3:4
"I don't know what to think of it," he said.
"We haven't gotten access to them at all," he thought, "with these, he thought, "the wing-snails with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but also all the other green-whites, who noticed with collective offensive urge.
He could still laugh: "A dirty victory," he said, twinkled and moved from then on to His players was the relief to note that they had drawn out of the affair with three points.
Well noticed, after a duel of two teams, one of whom, namely Albachten, plays for the championship and the other, Albersloh, fights for class preservation.
With understandable mixed feelings, GWA trainer Sven Lewandowski looked back at the 90 minutes behind him.
"That was by far our best seasonal performance," he says.
"As we come back after 0:2, as we hold against one of the top teams of the league over the entire season, that was really phenomenal."
The more bitter it is that you have to drive home empty-handed.
Top goal hunter Lars Zymner led the hosts with his 12th season hit (24th).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this goal.
The 2:0 he placed on the left side pattern valid for Fabian Fröhning (39.).
We knew that, but you can't take a player like that completely out.
"That was crazy, what he did," Lewandowski jealously acknowledged the quality of the opponent.
Shortly before the change of sides, his own elves made the compensation: McGill's free shot from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia-Torhuter Hinkerohe through the long toreck (45.).
After the change of sides it was again McGill who achieved the compensation (59.).
Then it went back and forth.
It was a cracky, action-laden game.
Nübel shocked Albachten again (64.), only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann (69.).
Despite overnumber, Albersloh no longer managed to counter the last Concordia hit (80.) again.
We now need to focus our full attention on Wednesday.
"The game against sheep, that's what we need to win now," said Lewandowski.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87th Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87th Bareksai).
Tore: 1:0 Zymner (24), 2:0 Fröhning (39.), 2:1 McGill (45.), 2:2 McGill (59.), 3:2 Nübel (64.), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69.), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80.).
Yellow-Rot: Atalan (74./Albachten).

The entire bureau of football second-ligist Dynamo Dresden has resigned media reports.
Several media spoke in the evening in agreement on a joint letter from the board of Saxony.

Erdogan in Germany: Politics instead of Pomp
Good thing he's gone again.
There are only a few state guests whose departure in Germany provides as much relief as that of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Three days the Turkish president was in Berlin and Cologne, and many had meant that he shouldn't have been invited at all.
Evangelische Akademie Tutzing: Prominent guests and new offers
The Evangelische Akademie Tutzing offers about 80 meetings until mid-next year.
France's President Emmanuel Macron has now signalled that he wants to pick up the price of tolerance personally in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff, the term of office was too short: as Federal President, he was not in Tutzing's Evangelical Academy.
But before and afterwards, Wulff was a guest there.
Akademie director Udo Hahn, when he said proudly: "All the Federal Presidents and Chancellors were already with us." That the Akademie at Tutzing Castle always showed up prominent, was also a topic in the presentation of the annual programme.
At the end of October, songmaker Konstantin Wecker participates in a conference on spiritual experience in philosophical perspective.On 29 September, writer Frido Mann is at a meeting about his grandfather Thomas Mann.
In the meantime, France's President Emmanuel Macron has also pledged to receive the "Tolerance Prize" awarded to him by the Academy in Tutzing, which is also receiving (we reported) television presenter Dunja Hayali in another category.
The around 80 meetings by mid- 2019 have it in themselves.
"The pension is not sure!" is in a conference title.
"SOS on Europe's Borders" - the Academy describes the "risk-and-dead route across the Mediterranean".
"And to a meeting about Syria: "Barbarian without limit".
Weapons Deals, Destruction, Torture, Death - The War Exasperates Every Human Idea".
The spectrum ranges from structural racism in society to the shears between the poor and the rich, to radical changes in labour through digitization.
Akademie Director Hahn was convinced: "Free democracy needs places where a civil society can come together to find solutions or at least to look for partial solutions".
At a meeting of the 200th.
Karl Marx's birthday is about to be expected by a more visitors to capitalism-criticism, while others expect a tendency "from the outside of the left to the middle".
What about neutrality?
"We are 100 percent a daughter of the Evangelical State Church," said study director Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, "so we are not 100% neutral."
Music cabaret: Gender understanding with heart - Wolbeck - Westfälische Nachrichten
"Suitable for both adults and men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christenkirche in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret tester, Teubner mastered gender understanding, not only with humor and warmth for the (feeling) wife and the (feeling) man and what else there may be, but also with music.
The mini guitar used her and also mastered her violin.
On the wing was Ben Süverkrüp.
On the one hand, the male sparring partner, who sometimes also comes to the end of the sentence, is a true pianist: So congenial harmoniously accompanies Süverkrüp Teubner that some may have wished for a solo.
That was also the case with Beethoven and Chopin, but different, that is, as it fit the red thread of the evening.
There Teubner had put a paradox into play: the satisfaction of men when he has a partner, but they do not open the door.
A closed door without a partner, on the other hand, does not benefit.
The piano solo now demonstrates the same thing: What would have sprung from the composition of Mozart would "the Nannerl" have unexpectedly opened the door?
So Süverkrüp slides over in improvisations, from Bach's "O Head of Blood and Wounds" to the "Lied of Death", and from Mozart g minor symphony into a playful dance.
There was great applause and "Bravo" from the full hall.
Flowers handed over Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the club, the Chansonette.
But the chairman Heidemarie Markenbeck could not take an extra thank you.
She had the idea to give the duo a performance in Stuttgart and Frankfurt as well as a performance in Wolbeck.

Handball: Women's Landesliga: Ahlener SG keeps the white vest against TV Wattenscheid
The Ahleners had problems with the third league player Carolin Stallmann, who alone marked ten hits.
"In fact, I was well satisfied with the defense, only one player has made too many goals.
We didn't get hold of them," says ASG-Coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was more angry about the many missed opportunities.
The concentration in the final round made his team miss this time.
The ASG therefore ran almost until the end of arrears, lay at the end of the break at 11:12 and later at 15:18 (45).
It was only towards the end that the wider bank of the hostess made itself felt decisive.
In addition, Aydogdu put backroom Merle Klement on the left, which then made "extremely clever the decisive goals" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Bushkötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pumpe, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5/3), Drewes (1), Smartmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschhaupt (4), S. Fitzek.
Volleyball: 3. League Women: Top performance of the BSV Ostbevern in the top match at the VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the volleyball players of the BSV Ostbevern have once again established themselves in the top group of the 3rd league west.
In the second league climber VC Allbau Essen the blue-whites won with 3:1.
"That was a huge step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz play in the top third of the league.
We have now worked out this," said Trainer Dominik Münch after an almost impeccable performance of his team at the crashing table leader.
The guests dominated the first passage almost as desired.
About 4:1, 16:10 and 22:12 he went with 25:15 to the vice-master of the previous year.
Food has taken place in the double bar, but has not come into play.
We've got them busy.
Our opponent has made high risks, but has also produced many tickets.
In the second sentence the BSV already led at 12:8. "Essen has changed the acceptance to triple bars.
We couldn't keep the impact pressure.
Food has gotten sucked up, and we've got a little bit of food in it," continued Münch.
In 1817, the volleyball players from the Ruhr area had their noses on the front.
Although East Bevern resisted four sentenceballs at 19:24, the fifth attempt reached his goal.
"The game was now a class better," said the trainer to the rising level.
Maike Rüdingloh and finally Wiebke Silge made a significant contribution to the BSV's turn to 25:21 in the third section of 14:16.
Münch: "We played consistently and calmly."
About 7:3 and 15:13 brought the blue-white passage four with 25:22 to their side.
Vera Horstmann was elected the most valuable player, but Maren Flachmeier had also caught an excellent day.
BSV-Women: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish community: Mosque opening as a missed opportunity
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) has criticized the way in which Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan initiated the great Ditib mosque in Cologne.
"In the German-Turkish relationship, the mosque opening in Cologne has left behind a shard pile, which can only be made difficult to come together," said Gökay Sofuoglu, Chairman of the TGD, Germany's editorial network.
Both the Turkish and the German sides had missed out on the chance of a common, conciliatory appearance.
"Instead of highlighting the membership of the Muslims to Germany side by side with German top politicians, Erdogan has used the date for his purposes," Sofuoglu complained.
The widespread exclusion of the German public has "enforced many reservations".
Heimatverein Nottuln: Offer has already established itself
After the long summer break is finally folk meeting time again.
On October 18 (Thursday) at 7.30 pm the Heimatverein Nottuln organizes its fifth Nottuln folk meeting in the fireplace room of the Alte Amtmanneni.
Almost to the day exactly, it is then a year since we first performed a folk meeting.
In the meantime, this event has become an integral part of the musical calendar of events in Nottuln," says Hanns Moormann, chairman of the Nottulner Heimatverein.
I wouldn't have thought that our folk meeting was going to be going so fast in Nottuln.
No matter if Sturmtief Friederike in January or heat wave in July, the fireplace room of the Amtmanni was always fully occupied.
"The program at the next folk meeting is like always a colourful mix of German folk songs, hiking and sailor songs, folk songs, evergreens and old hits," says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who invites friends to Nottuln again and again.
On the first folk meeting "Birthday" Klaus Spellmeyer promised with his accordion.
For many years he was a member of Gaitling, a group from the neighbouring district of Steinfurt, which played music with flat German lyrics.
Now he's on his way with an Irish folk band.
The makers of the folk meeting are happy to remember the last event in the summer, when Christoph Schulz of the Folktreff Emsdetten, with his international version of the song "Frösche im Nacht", enthusiastically sent the audience home with an earworm.
"We expect many cheerful guests to spend a social and humorous evening again," says the invitation of the local association.
Those who play an instrument and want to participate actively are invited to participate.
Since the coveted seats are always fast occupied, it is recommended to be there early enough.
The folk meeting starts at 7.30 p.m., but admission is already at 7:00 p.m.
China approves planned merger of Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons, all open questions must be resolved by 24 October.
FrankfurtLinde and Praxair are on their way to the world's largest industrial gas group.
The Chinese Competition Authority approved the proposed merger, Linde announced on Sunday.
As a result, approvals in South Korea and - as the biggest obstacle - in the United States still stand out for the billion-severe merger.
Had there had improved the chances of an insider's consent, because Linde has agreed to the sale of company parts.
For legal reasons, all open questions must be resolved by 24 October in order for the merger to succeed.
From pure fruit production to ecology
With a gala in the Dr.-Stammberger-Halle, the 125-year-old existence of the Kreisverband für Gartenbau und Landespflege was taken care of.
On 29 September 1893, with a fruit show in the Kulmbacher Vereinshaus, the last founding impulses were set for the Kreisverband für Gartenbau und Landespflege Kulmbach, and exactly 125 years later he celebrated a great anniversary in the Kulmbacher Stadthalle on on Saturday evening.
However, at the time he was called different: as a "cirksobstbauverein Kulmbach Stadt und Land" he was raised from the baptism by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893.
The purpose of the fruit-growing association was also different from that of today's work - it was actually only about fruit-growing, about flowers and horticulture no one thought at that time.
"At that time, at the time of the Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites," said Kreisheimatspfleger Günter Dippold in his lecture.
Fruit trees should fence long roads, so-called industrial gardens have been set up in schools.
Fruit growing is still the task of the 55 horticultural associations in the district of Kulmbach, which have nearly 7,000 members.
But the spectrum is far from exhausted.
Natural horticulture, biological plant protection, village beautification and nutrition play an as great role as imparting knowledge, healthy nutrition and youth work.
The members of the Hutschdorf youth group "Mulewerke" entertained on stage how diverse the tasks of a horticultural association are.
"Youth work is especially necessary in the digital age," said the county chairman Günter Maif, and OB Henry Schramm also stressed the importance of nature's experiences for life.
The chestnut collection was a huge thing for us children, I doubt that with smartphone & co. you can have similar joy.
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with Landrat Klaus Peter Söllner on the anniversary.
"Where to stand, the district association decides," added Landrat Söllner and emphasized the special importance of the horticultural associations for the villages.
The district association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green spaces in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the district left no doubt to be doubted by district managers and expert adviser Friedhelm Haun.
He led the many visitors through the long history of the district association with a presentation and reported, among other things, the need for self-sufficiency after the war.
In the past everything came out of the garden, for the winter it was stuffed.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the farm garden had changed to a ornamental and residential garden.
"Nature has existed, it was there before us, and we have to focus on it," pleaded the specialist for fruit and walnut trees.
Therefore, for the horticultural associations, there is the incentive not to let down so that our home stays beautiful and worth living.
This also includes welcoming the new citizens in our associations, added the President of the Bavarian National Association, Wolfram Vaitl.
"We have to stop the blatant decline in insects, we owe it to our children and grandchildren," Günter Reif concluded the successful ceremony, which was solemnly framed by the tower wind of the music club Thurnau.

Priority on Nafta talks: Canada's Foreign Minister moves UN speech
Mexico's government wants clarity in terms of Nafta: they put both trading partners an ultimatum for an agreement.
Canada's Foreign Minister is now giving absolute priority to the Trade Agreement, and she is moving her speech to the United Nations.
Due to the pressure of time to reprint the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with the USA and Mexico, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland postponed her speech at the UN General debate in New York.
Instead of today's Saturday, the minister will not speak until Monday before the United Nations Assembly, she told her speaker Adam Austen.
In the meantime, she concentrates on the renegotiation of Nafta.
The Mexican Minister of Economic Affairs Ildefonso Guajardo declared on Friday that the negotiators of Canada and the US had 48 hours to agree if Canada would actually want to join the trade agreement already concluded between his country and the USA.
The US and Mexico had agreed in August to a recast of the regional free trade agreement, Nafta.
US President Donald Trump indicated that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.
The talks about a re-release have been going on for over a year.
By Sunday evening (local time) they are now to be concluded, Trump's government intends to present the agreement to the US Senate before 1 October.
In the event of a failure of the negotiations, Mexico’s designated President Andres Manuel López Obrador announced on Friday that he would seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against President Bolsonaro
The Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, injured in a mass attack, left the hospital.
According to a report by the daily newspaper "O Globo", the right-wing ex-military wanted to fly to Río de Janeiro, where he lives.
After his dismissal, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will perform public performances in the South American country in the last week before the presidential elections.
At the beginning of September, the politician had been attacked on open streets during an election campaign in southern Brazil.
Meanwhile, thousands of people went to the streets in several Brazilian cities to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (in German: "The Not") women's associations had called for protests against the ex-military.
In the social networks, too, the associations against Bolsonaros made racist and women's contemptuous statements.
In the economic metropolis of São Paulo, several thousand demonstrators were expected.
In the capital Brasilia, the protests mixed with a rally of the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers' Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He replaced ex-President Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to twelve years in prison for corruption and therefore was not allowed to run.
The presidential election in Brazil will be held on 7 October.
As an ex-citizen of the million-town of São Paulo, Haddad was so far far far far behind the far right-wing candidate Bolsonaro in surveys.
Although the "Trump of Brazil" has been interfering in politics for a long time, it is now presenting itself as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates reach the absolute majority in the first round of elections, there will be an election on 28 October.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not successfully emerge from this - no matter who he is fighting.

After long illness: Danish rock legend died
The Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 years after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jefesen announced on Larsen's website.
On the deathbed Larsen had been surrounded by his wife and his six children.
The musician had been in treatment since the beginning of the year because of prostate cancer.
Larsen had become acquainted with the band Gasolin', which was extremely successful in Scandinavia in the 1970s.
Their songs were influenced by international music sizes like Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the band was dissolved in 1978, Larsen was a solo artist.
He sold around three million records in Denmark.
His 1983 album "Midt om natten" is still the most sold album in Denmark.
On Sunday, Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen praised Larsen as "Street Boys", who was "against everything but in all hearts".
The chief of government also recalled that the monarchy opponent Larsen had occurred in 2010 on the 70th birthday of the Danish queen Margrethe II.
Rock Night at the Shoe Factory: Volume at Press Air Hammer Level
"Here we stand, take the bone saw and light a concert evening with the power of a tiger." The band names of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" alone suggest such a description of the rocky live music experience on Saturday evening in the hall of the Bürgerzentrum Schuhfabrik: Hardrock pure from three other friends.
After the sound check and shortly before the start of the concert, the musicians take time for a group photo.
No trace of lamp fever.
Afterwards, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all in conjunction with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - with their bands are enthusiastically inspired by the 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" rock night.
Already the quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika knows how to convince with the latest, unknown pieces from his own pen and the upcoming CD.
In front of the stage, the band dances to the vocal and busy interaction of the band.
Although "addition" call cannot be overlooked, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leave the stage to the trio "Here We Stand".
That hard rock is not the same as hard rock, demonstrate guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on the bass and drummer Kai Hölscher with her alternative, sometimes reminiscent of classic rock of the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers" "Here We Stand" a synthesizer is also used for guitar rock.
Not only the longing, almost ballad-like "Take Me Home" impresses with the change of melodic passages to the guitar heavy rock riffs of the multi-layered songs.
However, the quartet "The Ignition" from Tönnishäuschen has played a special role since it was founded in 2005.
Full of agility, the band will present their hard rock on Saturday.
The fact that "The Ignition" has a special stage experience with her performances in front of a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the 2017 tour in China - is obvious and unsurpassable.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann also plays with the band in the only covered song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s, very own accents.
At the time when the sound is even higher than before, guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers a cheery solo, with him walking through the audience.
A certain volume belongs to a genre with such a hard rock concert, of course: On the "Mint Mosquito" rock night, according to the information of the mixing board team, the three-way concert of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" lies at about 98 decibels.
This is, for example, at compressed-air hammer level, but is therefore still significantly below the control of the "wack-fesitval", the "The Ignition" on its website.
However, the Ahlen audience does not need an ear-blowing 120 decibels in nozzle drive volume as usual for the annual metal position in the north of the Republic.
After almost four hours, the three bands of the harder, rocking gang have long convinced with their sovereign, virtuoso play and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, have taken the bone saw and lit a concert evening with the power of a tiger," all three groups, of course in the sense of being transferred, can say in the end.
And above all, enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

A dead person in a sailplane accident at Essen/Mülheim Airport
At Mülheim/Essen airport, there was a fatal accident.
A sailplane crashed on Sunday at a parking lot at Mülheim/Essen airport.
The pilot died in the accident.
Near Mülheim/Essen airport, there was a fatal accident on Sunday.
According to the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung", a sailplane had crashed at the parking lot at the airport.
The pilot had died.
As the "WAZ" continues to report, the flight student has been on board alone - the pilot is supposed to be a occupant.
At the time of the accident, the plane had already been in the landing.
The crash site is only a short distance from a festival tent on the airport grounds.
But an October festival has been held since this weekend.
Mülheim/Essen Airport is located at the city border of the two Ruhr district cities and directly at the ascent to motorway 52.
From the parking lot there is a park & ride offer at large events in the trade fair Essen or the Gruga Hall in Essen.
Trump's staring Kim: "And then we fell in love."
The fact that the US President of North Korea has been well received by Kim despite the nuclear crisis is not a secret.
Now Trump has made his colleague a real declaration of love.
She also has to do with Kim's "wonderful letters".
At the tender age of 72, the married U.S. president has become acquainted with a new flame.
The Tragic: It is a remote relationship.
On Saturday Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean powerman Kim Jong Un.
In front of followers in West Virginia, Trump found almost tender words for the half-aged spross of the ruler's dynasty from Pyongyang, although in the ring around North Korea's atomic disarmament proved to be rather tough chunks.
"I was tough, so was he, and between us it went back and forth," Trump reported.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And not only the conversations with Kim would have melted his heart.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Their personal connection also bore political fruit: Trump referred to the stop of all nuclear and rocket tests announced by Kim, even though critics have so far seen little more than lip knowledge.
That the affection for the infamous "Rocket Man" - according to Trump's nickname for Kim - not every memory of his martial threat, seemed to be quite aware of the U.S. president.
At any rate, he took the expected criticism of this at his appearance in a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling immediately ahead: "Donald Trump says they fell in love".
How terrible is that?
This is so unpresidious.
But he took care of this very little, explained Trump and then directed his index finger to the crowd: "I have always told you that it is so easy to be presidential."
But then there wouldn't be 10,000 people out there in this clumsy arena, but we'd only have 200 people out there.
Octoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler's visit to the best, atmospheric as well as spoiled by the sun is full of plenty: Very varied and with a good shot of Octoberfestflair Baesweiler's city centre has cleaned out on Sunday.

Refugees rescued from Libya thanks to video
Nigerian refugees have pointed out their catastrophic arrest conditions in Libya with the help of a mobile phone video, thus enabling their salvation.
The group had shot in their cell in the coastal town of Savoia in July under the threat of death and spread it online.
"They refuse to send us back," said a man in the video message.
We're suffering here. We're dying here.
The recording was sent to the website "France 24 Observers", whose editors alerted the International Organisation for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were finally flown to Nigeria at the end of August.
"We probably couldn't have returned to Nigeria without the video," said Efe Onyeka, who had recorded the video, the news agency AFP.
The 25-year-old had been arrested in Libya when he tried to get to Europe via the Mediterranean.
With the video he put himself in danger of death.
One of his companions was almost beaten to death by the guards, said Onyeka.
In general, the terms of detention were disastrous: "They all beat us with pipes and sticks."
They gave us nothing to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organizes the voluntary return of refugees stranded in Libya.
About 2,700 migrants from Nigeria had been sent back to their homeland this year, said Jorge Galindo, the IOM spokesman in the West African country.
The case of Nigerians who have now been rescued is not exceptional in view of the bad terms of detention in Libya.
But he hadn't heard of a phone call.
International organizations have long criticised the states in the Libyan refugee camps as unworthy of human beings.
The North African state, which is dominated to a large extent by militias, is the main transit country for migrants on the way from Africa to Europe.
When a teacher went to the folk school on Sunday afternoon to prepare her lessons for Monday, she surprised an intruder.
At 4:50 p.m., the teacher enters the building above the main entrance.
In the front hall on the first floor, she saw a man fleeing immediately.
Only through a door, then over the roof terrace and from there via a climb into the ground floor or the foreyard.
The teacher agreed with the police who took up the investigation.
Whether things or money have been stolen cannot be said yet.
Description: about 16 years old, black, very short hair, slightly darker look, dark pants, dark T-shirt.
Please tell the police inspection Obernberg am Inn, phone number 059 133 4244.
German was caught in his own car for days
A 75-year-old had to spend several days and nights in his car in a forest area in central France after he had locked the car off all the forest roads and a tree blocked the car door.
Rescuers discovered the car on Saturday afternoon by chance not far from a pasture and released the missing since Tuesday evening, the police reported on Sunday.
The 75-year-old from Pleinfeld reportedly found himself in good health despite the cold nights and the long time without care.
He said he was now looking forward to his home.
The pensioner had been reported missing by his family after he had not returned from a ride on Tuesday with his terrain car over the local meadows and fields.
Despite intensive search, the man’s stay remained unclear for days.
Laschet states the rule of law in Turkey
Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) in conversation with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, according to his own information, advised the rule of law in Turkey.
The relations between the two countries are currently "overestimated", said Laschet on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne Airport.
This is mainly a matter of waves of arrest, freedom of the press and religion.
He therefore made it clear to Erdogan "that if relations are to normalize in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, the rule of law is a very important prerequisite for this".
According to his own statement, Laschet also addressed the cases of Germans who are in prison in Turkey.
He had expressed the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
Erdogan has once again stressed the independence of Turkish justice.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan had recently been transferred to a building of the German Federal Ministry of Defense at Cologne Airport.
Originally, it was supposed to have taken place at the castle of Wahn - but the owners of the castle had refused this out of political conviction against Erdogan.
Erdogan continued to travel after the conversation at the opening of the Ditib mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had cancelled a joint appearance in the building.
But he said, "The Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country."
And we are also their contacts - and not the Turkish President.
Lack of confidence in the USA: North Korea demands disarmament
While US President Trump does not tire of stressing the successes of the negotiations on the denuklarization of North Korea, the East Asian regime is more sobering.
Foreign Minister Ri calls for a Washington meeting.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho accused the U.S. government of blocking the negotiations for a nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula with its continued sanctions.
"The latest standstill is therefore that the US is building on forced measures that are deadly for building trust," said Ri in New York.
Disarmament is unthinkable for North Korea in these circumstances.
"Without any confidence in the USA, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way that we are the first to disarm ourselves," said the North Korean chief diplomat.
That sanctions could force North Korea to "knead" is "a dream of people who don't know us".
However, to build trust, his country stopped its nuclear and rocket tests and destroyed an atomic test plant, Ri emphasized.
However, from the US side, there had been no "corresponding reactions", the minister criticised.
Last year, the UN Security Council had decided on three sanctions against the internationally isolated country because of North Korea's nuclear and rocket programme.
US President Donald Trump and his Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo have been insisting on strict compliance with the sanctions in recent days at the United Nations.
At the same time, the U.S. government is working on an approach.
In June Trump first met North Korea's powerholder Kim Jong Un.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US President is seeking a second summit with Kim.
In October Pompeo is to travel to Pyongyang again for talks about the end of the North Korean nuclear program.
The HoT serves: New cuisine with donations from the municipality
That they were actually in a youth meeting, of which the many visitors to the house of the open door got nothing with it: white ceilings and flower jewelry on the tables and a large buffet waited for the guests after the harvest-thank you service.
The young people of the HoT had enchanted the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The institution was financed by donations from the community, for which the young people wanted to thank themselves for the food.
The start with the new facility was not just easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the head of the HoT, remembers.
We had filled our refrigerators with food and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared for the big day.
But then the bad surprise came on the first day after the summer break: a power failure had put the huge two-piece refrigerator out of operation, the food was spoiled and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start from the front: although we got a lot of support from friends and neighbors, the children and young people wanted to do it on their own," says Westbuer.
And so they all went along.
The result could be seen, the guests were enthusiastic.
"It's not better for chefs either," praised a visitor, while Hokkaido pumping was served or guests were allowed to use quiche, liver cheese or cake.
"It's really great what the children and young people have put on their feet," said Father Frank Beckmann, while sorcerer Stephan Lammen caused astonishment with card tricks and other pieces of art.
Jürgen Sator leaves the NRW board
Out of frustration about criticism from one's own ranks, the head of the Essen panel, Jörg Sartor, gave his post in the Landesverband.
Sartor had become known all over the country because the Essen panel had introduced a stop for foreigners.
He had already resigned in July as vice-president of the NRW boards, said Sartor of the "World on Sunday".
I fell in my back too many of them.
The head of the Tablet Association NRW, Wolfgang Weilerswist, expressed an understanding of the decision of his long-standing deputy.
Sartor took the sharp criticism with him.
"I can understand his step - there were people who didn't know exactly why the Essen table did it."
Sartor is still active for the Essen table - "six days a week, nothing changes," says Weilerswist.
Sartor criticised colleagues from other boards in the "World on Sunday" in turn.
One should not follow the approach, "without us the people in the city starve".
It is up to the state to ensure that people did not starve.
The Essener did not take part in a convention of tables on Friday in Berlin.
"I'm told too much sweet stuff," he said.
There are all these social puzzles that criticized me so much at the time.
SF Lorch play 2:0 guided tour - Gmünder Tagespost
Football, Bezirksliga Lorch loses against Neuler 2:3 - TV hypocrites wins in Kirchheim after residue - Bettringen clears Lauchheim.
At 2:0 Lorch was already in the lead in the home game against the TV Neuler - at the end it was 2:3 and the disappointment among the sports friends was great.
In Kirchheim the TVH was quickly hit with 0:1, but won after 90 minutes with 2:1. At the top of the table, the SGB could now use a 3:0
Gladbach plays twice guided tour - Schalke without embryo with first victory
Borussia Mönchengladbach must continue to wait for an outward victory in Wolfsburg.
At 2:2 the foals play a guided tour twice.
Schalke comes against Mainz for the first season win (1:0).
(sda) In the first five league games, Schalke has been maneuvered four times with early countertowers.
Now the team of Domenico Tedesco again showed the strength with which it had finished the first place behind the Bavaria in the last season.
Alessandro Schöpf led the home equipment in the eleventh minute after strong preliminary work by Evgeni Konopljanka by head, as a result the hosts preserved the mini pad with a compact defensive performance.
Thanks to an extraordinary comeback Borussia Dortmund greets again from the top of the Bundesliga.
Lucien Favre's team had negotiated a 0:2 residue against Bayer Leverkusen until the break, but came to the 4-2 victory in the 2nd half.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65.) and Marco Reus (69.) alike with a doublet within four minutes, Paco Alcacer, who was replaced by Favre in the 63rd minute, provided with another doublet in the final phase (86./94.) for the crowning completion of the performance increase after the break.
The VfB Stuttgart also won the first victory.
In the meantime, the Stuttgarters were afraid of this because of a yellow-red card against Milos Veljkovic before the break had been decided by Werder Bremen.
Borna Sosa and the inattentive goalie Ron-Robert Zieler fabricated a curious throw-in owner that helped the guests in the 68th minute to compensate.
Seven minutes later, Gonzalo Castro led the VfB to the first victory.
In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang did not experience a complete success, but also no failed debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
The Gladbachers with the Swiss quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang gave a guided tour twice, eventually played 2:2 and have been waiting for a victory in the VW city since 2003.
He was responsible for Wolfsburg's compensation for the 1:1, and Renato Steffen was responsible for his second Bundesliga.
Yann Sommer was powerless on the flat shot from 20 meters of the Aargauer, as was the second hit after an hour.
Nevertheless, the trends at Gladbach are quite hesitant.
Alassane Pléa is more and more visible as a goal-getter in the storm of the foals.
The French record purchase came against Wolfsburg for the third time in a row and for the seventh time in the seventh game of duty.
After seven laps, Gladbach finished 4th.
Within 40 minutes, the previously unbeatable Werder Bremen manned itself against the VfB Stuttgart in an uncomfortable location.
After 19 minutes, Florian Kohlfeldt's team was surprised by a Stuttgart counter, which the ex-Luganesi Anastasios Donis concluded with his first season hit, and after 36 minutes, Milos Veljkovic continued his team: the 23-year-old Serb filed against Daniel Didavi Yellow-Rot after a jersey.
Although Stuttgart's defender Borna Sosa and Goalie Ron-Robert Zieler brought the Bremer back to the game through a curious throw-in owner (68.), one quarter of an hour before the end Gonzalo Castro shot the Stuttgarters in abundance back to the Siegesstrasse.
Nürnberg chose the duel against Düsseldorf 3:0 sovereignly for himself.
After half an hour, Hanno Behrens set up the home team with Foulpenalty.
Macedonian vote on new state names
In Macedonia, around 1.8 million citizens are voting today on whether their country's name should be changed to northern Macedonia.
In a yes, the conflict with the neighbor of Greece could be resolved for almost three decades.
Because of its northern province, Athens had insisted on a change of name and blocked every approach of Macedonia to the West.
The voters therefore also decide on the future West integration.
The US had announced that the country could quickly become NATO members at a positive outcome of the referendum.
Syrer in U-Haft.
Refugee attacked three women.
A Syrian brutally beaten three pensioners and injured them in part.
The 41-year-old asylum seeker had ransacked in the escape alley in Alsergrund at around 10 a.m. on Friday.
When the police arrived, they spoke to the accused, who was going to passers-by with balled fists and tried to attack them, about his behavior.
The Syrian then tried to beat and kick the officials.
A little later it turned out that the suspect had just hit three older ladies (65, 67, 75) with his fists on Währinger Straße at a tram stop.
In addition, he had stepped the trio with his feet.
The pensioners were in some cases seriously injured.
They suffered from hematomas, bruises, and convulsions.
The asylum seeker was also seriously injured "from an unknown cause", as the police said.
He was taken to the hospital and monitored throughout treatment.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Almost exactly one year after the entry into force of the marriage for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his longtime friend Christoph Rohde.
The two gave themselves the yes word on Saturday in Hamburg.
A registered life-partnership had not been questioned for them, Kahrs had previously said the "picture" newspaper.
"If we get married, then right." He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is the budgetary spokesman of the SPD federal group and one of the speakers of the Seeheim district, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage for homosexuals, Kahrs had aroused a rage on June 30, 2017.
For example, he had accused Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "interpreted" on the subject.
"That was your shabowski moment," he said in allusion to the accidental announcement of the GDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since 1 October 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
They had previously been able to register their life-partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, such as adoption law.
Garden day: 400 meters hedge cut
There was a lot of work in front of the members of the Citizen's Association Children's House and the Society for Lepralogy.
For about 400 meters hedge around the gardens of the inhabitants of the House of Pründner should be cut.
Supported by the inhabitants, it went to work for around twelve supporters.
"We are doing this in order to reduce costs," said Walter Schröer, President of the Civil Society.
And there's been a lot of things going on.
Due to the hot summer we're late this time, but fortunately it's just a cut of shape.
Because already in spring the hedges had already been shaved.
The breakfast always following the work has also had a long tradition.
"They should all stay with forces," said Walter Schröer.
World Championship in Rio: Hannes Aigner gets gold at the Canuslalom World Cup
The Augsburg Hannes Aigner won the gold medal in Rio de Janeiro at the end of the Canuslalom World Championship.
The 29-year-old put a perfect race on the Olympic track on Sunday.
Two years ago he had missed Olympic bronze by three hundred and a half seconds.
I was well prepared, had enough rides here on the plant and it all fit today," said the Olympic Third of London 2012.
In the goal, he threw away his paddle for joy and stretched both arms to the heights, knowing well that it would be sufficient for at least one medal.
After all, he had number four.
However, the six remaining starters were unable to peak his fable time of 89.69 seconds.
Second was the Czech Jiri Prskavec in front of the Russian Pawel Eigel.
The police inspection Gauting mentions the first attempt at a single-family home this autumn.
Fortunately, the perpetrators failed.
The days are getting shorter - this is what burglars want to use again.
The police inspection Gauting mentioned yesterday's first attempt at the fall.
The fact that it has remained at the family house on Königswieser Straße is due to the alarm system.
It went off when the perpetrators laid their hands on Friday shortly before 8:00.
The burglars did suspect that the residents were not at home.
The alarm system, however, apparently surprised them so much that they fled without prey.
Notes to PI Gauting, telephone (089) 8 93 13 30.
Pleite bei Hertha: Ensnared by reality: Bavaria against Ajax demanded
The predicate is unbeatable: The defeat in Berlin does not want to be "fallen" by FC Bayern.
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first interim conclusion for the term of office of Niko Kovac.
The first small performance plate under the new Coach Niko Kovac should by no means increase to the greater autumn depth for the Munichers.
"One week ago, they had the impression that we were invincible.
Now a little bit of reality has caught up with us," Thomas Müller noted after the deserved 0:2 defeat at Hertha BSC and demanded a reaction for the Champions League dual with Ajax Amsterdam.
If you know us, you know that's annoyed us and that's why we're heading for Tuesday.
For the first time in more than a year away, no one's own goal was shot, as at the same time as the previous season two mandatory games in series without victory, the table management in the football league lost for the first time to Borussia Dortmund.
Although the overall situation is far from as dramatic as at the end of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, the record champion must be warned.
FC Augsburg in the 1:1 with its running-intensive man-to-man tactics and the Berliners through their playful needlesticks across the outside have supplied two blueprints within three days, as the last powerful Bavaria is to be cracked.
"Those who know the FC Bayern know that we don't like it and we will do everything we can to be successful again," Kovac stressed.
Otherwise, however, with his losers in his hometown, he was surprisingly gentle and pushed his first defeat as a Munich coach only to the again flawed handling of opportunities.
A victory against Amsterdam and against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would nevertheless leave the first interim conclusion of his term of office positive - otherwise the tone would probably be tightened.
Kovac did not take any extraordinary measures before the second King class appearance of this season after the 2:0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After the day off on Sunday, as planned, the short preparation for the second pre-round game against Ajax, which had also overpowered AEK Athens with 3:0, also sovereignly.
"Now it's caught us in two games, but we're also going to make our goals again," announced national team captain Manuel Neuer.
Like after the lost Cup finale against Eintracht Frankfurt in the same place, Joshua Kimmich was mainly speaking plain text.
The legal defender acted as Mahner in the role.
"I don't think that's all bad luck, we have to work it out again, because we don't make the many opportunities and make the mistakes in the back," the 23-year-old emphasized shortly before the departure from the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous season, the Bavaria were already with five counters behind Dortmund, which now took the lead again with a point.
And so Kimmich valued at least positively with an eye wink that now the public debate about the supposedly unbeatable Bavaria has ended.
"Yes, that's all right," said the national player.
It's good for the league.
DFB-Boss in shotline: Özil-Causa: Sharp attack of Erdogan on Grindel
With serious accusations, Turkish President Erdogan condemns the exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, but defends the bandage line.
Now a new post is to be created.
Berlin - On various stages Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the interpretation of the permanent battle theme Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish President of the State of Cologne strongly criticised the handling of the ex-world champion in Germany for the opening of the large Ditib mosque, the DFB chief defended the association line.
On the early Sunday morning, the grindel who had been attacked by Özil in the Mainz ZDF "sport studio" announced consequences from the Causa.
"We have to draw very precise conclusions in the future - because we also have many players with a migration background in the U teams - that this is not repeated," said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without a migration background as further integration commissioner.
At the same time, Grindel again stated that Erdogan does not support the values of football and the DFB.
In sharp words, he had condemned racism against Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Born and raised in Germany, Mesut Özil and our Ilkay.
They excluded them from this society because they were photographed with me in England," said Erdogan on Saturday in the Cathedral City.
To be honest, as their president, I could not digest the fact that our two young men who have gone up to the German national team were excluded.
Grindel referred to Gündogan's statement that, unlike Özil, he felt "reasonably treated by the DFB" after the World Cup affair, which had begun with photos of the two with Erdogan.
At the same time, he announced that he would like to face players in the future.
That someone says: If I win, I'm German when I lose, I'm Migrant - I can't.
"I regret that he has such an impression," Grindel said.
We should have defended Mesut more, I've always said that.
He does not see a basis for Özil's return to the national team either.
In addition to the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who have family roots in Cameroon, an additional integration officer is now to be appointed as a follow-up.
"If one without a migration background is clearly involved in society and football and says, "The topic is important, we have to take care of it," that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our clubs on site where integration needs to work," Grindel said.
Despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup-off and the Özil-Affaire, he wants to run again for the office as DFB President next year.
"I'm doing my job and trying to make her as good as I can," Grindel said.
Year-olds build three accidents within three hours
Coburg/Rödental - As the police report, the 75-year-old caused the accidents on Friday between 10 am and 1 pm.
First of all, the 75-year-old driver was addressed by a lady at the red traffic light in the area of Lauterhöhe.
She told the pensioner that he was driving her car.
However, there was no exchange of personnel, since the 75-year-old could not find the lady in the parking lot anymore.
A short time later, the police received a telephone message about a car driver who had gotten off the road and drove against a guidepost.
The man didn't want a police station and then drove away.
After that, the Rödentaler drove home.
However, the pensioner has acted in his place of residence, in which he has lived for decades, and has rammed a construction vehicle when turning.
Finally, the police were able to find him and stop him.
His car showed significant accident damage.
The 75-year-old made a swirling impression and could no longer think of much.
The damage is about 1300 euros.
Moorbrand in Meppen: Still nearly 1000 operational forces in use.
Around four weeks after the outbreak of Moorbrand on a federal defence site in Emsland, 980 staff are still employed in the extinguishing work.
That was announced by the Bundeswehr on Sunday.
According to a speaker, since the situation continues to be stable, 70 volunteers were removed.
A further reduction in the number of forces is planned, it says.
During the night of Sunday, an above-ground fire had been discovered and removed.
Last week, the disaster was lifted, which was proclaimed a week earlier on September 21st, because it was feared that the flames would put forests and settlements adjacent to the wind and spark flight at risk.
Thursday, it was said, a fire attack on adjoining communities no longer threatens.
At times, more than 1500 staff on site tried to get the big fire under control.
The Luftwaffe further supports the work on the Bundeswehr test site at Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also reconnaissance flights with drones of the Bundeswehr.
According to the Bundeswehr, "Tornados" are also planned for 2 and 5 October.
The fire had been triggered by test rockets fired by Airbus technicians.
The moor brand's smoking flag was temporarily moved up to a hundred kilometers across the northwest of Germany to Bremen.
On Monday, the Bundeswehr wants to set up a contact point that accepts damages.
First claims for damages had already been announced by hoteliers and holiday home owners.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the main church of St. Katharinen in Hamburg after their wedding.
Almost exactly one year after the entry into force of the marriage for all, the politician married his longtime friend in Hamburg.
They've been a couple for 25 years.
Hamburg - Almost exactly one year after the entry into force of the marriage for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his longtime friend Christoph Rohde.
The two gave themselves the yes word on Saturday in Hamburg.
A registered life-partnership had not been questioned for them, Kahrs had previously said the "picture" newspaper.
If we get married, we'll get married.
He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is the budgetary spokesman of the SPD federal group and one of the speakers of the Seeheim district, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage for homosexuals, Kahrs had aroused a rage on June 30, 2017.
For example, he had accused Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "interpreted" on the subject.
"That was your shabowski moment," he said in allusion to the accidental announcement of the GDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since 1 October 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
They had previously been able to register their life-partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, such as adoption law.
referendum started in Macedonia on new state names
In Macedonia, the eagerly anticipated referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has begun.
Some 1.8 million voters are supposed to decide whether their state should be called North Macedonia in the future.
This is due to its northern province of neighboring Greece.
As a means of printing, Athens had blocked every approach from Skopje to the EU and NATO for almost three decades.
If the citizens vote in favour of Yes, they will also launch the West integration of their country.
Elie Wiesel - the author who saves the Shoah from forgetting
The Holocaust-surviving Elie Wiesel would have grown to be 90 years old on September 30.
The Nobel Peace Prize winner of 1986 dies in the USA in 2016 and leaves behind a work that preserves the horrors of the Shoah for the afterworld.
Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The register should facilitate organ donation and relieve members in stress situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs can only be removed with explicit consent, says Swisstransplant.
(dpa) Switzerland will launch an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This should facilitate organ donation and relieve family members in stress situations.
People who want to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes can then be retrieved from Swisstransplant in case of need.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs - as in Germany - can only be removed with explicit consent, Swisstransplant stresses.
It is assumed that 15 percent of Swiss people have a donation card, says Franz Immer, Director of the Swisstransplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of the cases is a card found at the crucial moment in possible donors.
In more than 60 percent of the conversations, relatives do not know the wishes of the deceased.
"You then have to decide alternately in the sense of the deceased, which is often very stressful," says Immer.
A similar registration system exists in Britain.
In Germany, there are considerations to store information on the possible organ donation on the health insurance card, as the spokesman of the Federal Center for Health Enlightenment, Marita Völker-Albert says.
"There is no register in which people can enter their wishes - pro or counter organ donation -," she says.
Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn has voted in favour of a re-regulation of the organ donation.
According to his proposal, everyone would initially be considered organ donors unless he or she objected.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old student is the world champion in the calculation
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is the world champion in the calculation.
He fought in Wolfsburg on the weekend against 39 fellow fighters.
Martina Flamme-Jasper of the Phaeno Science Museum, the venue of the competition, announced this on Sunday.
The 16-year-old Wenzel Grüß from Germany took third place.
The youngest World Cup participant was a twelve-year-old Japanese student, the oldest of a 74-year-old pensioner from France, as main referee Ralf Laue said.
The computer science professor from Zwickau (Saxony) organizes the competition every two years.
To date, for example: 14.130 214 x 17.981.822 or 57.809.355 + 28 x 16.448.333.
As spectators were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon, in which participants came against guests from the audience with calculators.
Wenzel Grüß from Lastrup demonstrated how he holds a ball with his head in the air while calculating.
He's one of seven Germans in the competition.
A total of 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for competition.
Grüß was there two years ago as a 14-year-old in Bielefeld.
With terms such as superbrain, genius or wonder child, organizers can start Laue little.
"Cop calculation can be trained," he said.
Many participants practiced several hours a day.
In India or Singapore, there are even stadia-oriented calculation competitions.
The disciplines include, for example, the square root of six-digit numbers.
When calculating versatility, candidates get surprise tasks for which they need to find a solution strategy quickly.
Here, too, the Germans would have good chances, said the main referee.
Otherwise, Asians are often in favour because early childhood head calculators are taught more intensively and with other effective methods.
An urgent appeal: video with naked Serena Williams: It's about breast cancer early detection
Tennis-Ass Serena Williams shows up from her sensitive and sensitive side.
With this video, the 37-year-old wants to point to breast cancer and make himself strong for early detection.
It is about life and death, but also about courage and enlightenment.
Serena Williams sings above without the song "I Touch Myself" by the group "The Divinyls" - only their hands cover their most intimate places.
The singer Chrissy Amphlett died of it.
The emotional video is part of the "I Touch Myself" project, which is about breast cancer early detection, which can save lives.
Serena Williams died almost a year ago.
At the birth of her daughter Alexis Olympia, there were complications.
An emergency surgery was launched to save the baby's life.
In a subsequent CT, blood clots in Serena's lung were discovered.
Just in time...
Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
Vienna - The Federal Government is planning a significant extension of the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week, the turquoise-blue coalition will send an appropriate bill to the so-called "symbol law" in review.
This will significantly increase the number of those terrorist or comparable groups covered by the ban.
Polar cold air brings in the west new snow on the mountains
Ms. Holle shakes her beds in the West for the first time next week: Polare Kalt Luft reaches Vorarlberg, Nordtirol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to the meteorologists of the Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall limit drops at the beginning of the week to 1,500 to 1,200 meters - in narrow valleys it could snow down with a strong intensity to about 1,000 meters, it was said.
From Bregenzerwald to the Hohe Tauern, 20 to 40 centimetres of new snow can be expected above 2,000 meters.
On higher pass roads (Arlbergpass, Timmelsicht, Bieler Höhe, Brennerpass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße) the road conditions are therefore wintery.
Farmers are allowed to start on Monday with the annual Knickpflege
Schleswig-Holstein's farmers are allowed to begin the annual Knickpflege on Monday.
The "green forests" that have been unique in Germany have shaped the landscape of the forest-poor federal state for some 200 years.
The tree and shrub hedges up to five metres wide are "forest replacement" and for many animals and plants the last retreat rooms.
Knicks combine scattered habitats as corridors, through which the exchange of organisms can still work, as the managing director of the Naturschutzbund Deutschland (NABU) said in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski.
Knicks are living fences
The Knicks were laid on the basis of an order of the Danish king Christian VI in 1766, who ruled Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field limits and cattle fences, they also provided the farmers with firewood and beams for their specialist houses.
His name "Knick" comes from that time: the dense, intertwined demarcations could be developed by "knicking" of branches.
Today, some 45 000 kilometres of hedges stretch between the North and the Baltic Sea and give the picture of a wooded, diversely structured landscape.
According to NABU, they are now used as a spare habitat by some 7000 species.
Up to 1800 different species could live in one kilometer of knick and breed up to 30 bird pairs.
However, its ecologically important function can only be fulfilled if it is maintained in winter.
Otherwise, he takes care of a light row of trees, which, in addition to biodiversity, also loses the effect of wind protection, said Ludwichowski.
Knickpflege may only be carried out outside the breeding period from October to March, according to the Ministry of Agriculture.
After Tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesian talks about situation on the ground
In an interview with the editorial network Germany (RND), the local Radika Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquakes and the tsunami:
Were you on site during the tsunami itself?
No, I was in Jakarta right now on the island of Java.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I learned about the tsunami, I immediately made my way back to Sulawesi.
I arrived on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight, because the airport on Palu was closed at the time.
What's the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that aid can also be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, which are all completely destroyed.
Our "World Vision" office is also destroyed, but we have set up something provisionally where we have also accommodated other people.
Where are the people living on Sulawesi now?
Many are running on surrounding hills, where they still endure for fear of another tsunami and earthquake and where they have no access to water and food.
Some stay in front of their homes, there are still aftershocks.
Because many grocery stores and gas stations are completely closed, people partly steal food and gasoline.
The public service has gone down completely, the national government is helping out.
A prison was also destroyed, the prisoners run around freely, and the search for them is difficult.
There are still many bodies around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How is communication and information on the island going?
At the moment we have mobile phone reception, but before this did not work and we only got information on the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors, and other people they don't know if they live and where they are, because people weren't at home during the earthquakes, but were on their way to work, for example.
The tsunami warning system did not work properly.
Do you have any information on this?
We don't know the reasons for this, but when the warning came, many thought "Okay, no tsunami" - and then he came.
In other regions that were not hit by the tsunami, there was misinformation that a tsunami hit the region and they ran to the surrounding mountains.
Is not an island like Sulawesi on the Pacific Fire Ring prepared for earthquakes?
Yes, there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst thing.
We usually know how we react to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the entire infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has hit a lot of people.
Muscles against Werders: VfB must long renounce Aogo and Donis
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo will be missing from VfB Stuttgart with serious muscle injuries for a long time.
On Saturday, Aogo had a muscle fibrous crack in the rear left thigh in the 2:1 against Werder Bremen, the football Bundesligist announced on Sunday.
At Donis, doctors diagnosed a muscle spectrum crack in the thigh.
Both players are definitely not an option against Hannover 96 on Saturday and will probably still miss games after the following country game break.
The VfB Stuttgart did not give a forecast of the downtime.
A muscle mass crack usually heals within six to eight weeks, a muscle fiber crack usually heals a little faster.
Triumph of Hyperrealism at the San Sebástian Film Festival
San Sebastián - With the Film Festival of San Sebastián annually closes the tour of the most prestigious European festivals.
In spite of this, it is possible to sum up all tracks on the cinema: 2018 was a remarkable year for the film.

On Sunday morning, the Olching fire brigade tried to catch a wounded duck.
However, the action went on for some time.
Even a boat was used.
Olching - Walkers at the Olchinger Lake noticed a white, injured duck on Sunday morning.
She stayed in the area of the water watch station.
To help the animal, the passersby called the police and the fire department.
The first attempts to catch the duck, however, went wrong.
Despite the injury, she was able to escape the forces over and over again.
In the end, she fled to the lake.
With a lifeboat, the fire brigade could encircle the animal and push it back on land, where after almost an hour it was put into a transport box by a fireman with a hearted handle.
The duck injured at the chest was then brought to the LMU's animal clinic in Oberschleissheim.
But according to the first assessments, their chances of survival are rather low.
Biathlet Julian Eberhard scores World Cup Medal
==References====External links==* Official website
In the coming winter, the Saalfelder wants to pick up the missing precious metal at the World Cup in Östersund.
The last shot cost the 31-year-old in the Olympic sprint of Pyeongchang the one to grab near the medal.
Seven tenths of a second were missing on bronze in the end.
"I deliberately took time to process this," says Eberhard at the opening of the MyGym fitness studio in his hometown of Saalfelden.
A medal was the goal, I was in top shape, but it just didn't want to be.
The more motivated the Pinzgauer is to pick up the missing precious metal in the new season: "The goal can only be to get back to a big event with the constitution, to win something.
Someday you have to strike too.
The World Championship in Östersund (SWE) is Eberhard: "I have already closed the track to the heart," he recalls with joy his fourth World Cup place in the single race in the previous year.
Immediately after Olympia he celebrated the only single victory for Austria in the last World Cup winter in the Kontiolahti (FIN) mass start-up competition.
He finished second in Oslo (NOR) with the season.
Brett Kavanaugh: FBI investigation in Turbotempo
Time is extremely short and the number of surveys planned is very limited.
The Republicans in the U.S. Senate, with an FBI investigation in the Turbo-Empo, want to secure the thin majority for the controversial judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
President Donald Trump has set the investigators a deadline until Friday in order to clarify the alleged incidents more than 30 years ago.
The recent turn in the drama for the vocation of Kavanaugh accompanied by a cultural struggle had been triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing of Kavanaugh and the first prosecutor Christine Blasey Ford, in whose course the jurist held out angry tirades against the opposition democrats, the Senate's judicial committee should pave the way for the final confirmation of the arch-conservative judge at the Supreme U.S. Court.
The majority of Republicans seemed secure when suddenly Senator Jeff Flake declared, contrary to his original announcement, that he would agree, but demanded an FBI investigation.
After tumult-like scenes, his party friends consented.
President Trump, who had described the heavy statements on Thursday as "disgusting", initially contained further attacks against women and spoke, on the contrary, of "happiness in disaster".
In this way, the last doubts could be eliminated, he said.
Later, at an election rally, Trump attacked the Democrats sharply because they reject Kavanaugh: "They are trying to block and destroy".
Trump orders FBI investigation in the Kavanaugh case
The White House has also extremely limited the powers of the investigators.
One would specifically investigate the known accusations of two women, no more so, said a government representative to the "Wall Street Journal": "They don't go on a fishing trip."
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses are to be heard.
The mobile radar device of the town council Ried installed in a "civil vehicle" to monitor the tempo limit is stationed on the horticultural road from Monday, 1 October.
There is also the Bundesschulezentrum.
The municipality also operates several fixed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: They felt the fear
Trainer Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated the first season win against Mainz.
The relief on Schalke is great after the first season victory.
However, against Mainz the factor time also played a role.
Gelsenkirchen - In the meantime, it is well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist at football games.
That was no different in the home game against Mainz 05.
"I've seen every ball in it.
And there were many corners and many balls in our penitentiary," said the sports director of Schalke 04 - and breathed.
Finally, the royal blues managed to bring the narrow 1:0 against the Rhine Hesse over time and thus the first season victory under the roof and compartment.
In fact, it could have been different.
After the lead by Alessandro Schöpf 11. the team of head coach Domenico Tedesco had given security to Tedesco: "To sum up, the first half-time was good, both playful and pressive", obviously more and more the head played a role with increasing duration.
Don't create a headball monster.
"For me, the last ten minutes have felt like two hours," Heidel said: "If the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand it."
The boys were afraid to give it out of their hands and therefore moved on.
And defend against Mainz with man and mouse.
To save the first three counters of the season.
"All of us have fallen a huge stone from the heart," said Schöpf, who with his headball hit did not have an insignificant part: "I am actually the worst football player in the manship."
But in the end, only the victory counts.
The relief was noticeable throughout the arena, of course also at Tedesco.
"We wanted to start with pressure in the initial phase and make a fireworks out of it," said Schalkes Chefcoach.
The victory was important.
Finally, we can be happy for a few hours.
I'm very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We have played intelligently, calmly and courageously, so we have to approach games for over 90 minutes
The biggest manko of the afternoon: King Blue missed to worry about clearer conditions.
The possibilities were finally there, for example through the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who met twice the latte 59./72. or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it wouldn't have been a shiver victory," Tedesco said, "you've felt the fear a little bit."
That's why I'm glad we won.
So he wasn't the only scalker.
Fischbachau: smoke column in the Leitzachtal 2 km visible
The smoke was not too overlooked.
A walker in the Leitzachtal observed a fire from about two kilometers away on Sunday at around 1.30 p.m.

Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion at eye level
In front of them is the author, Professor Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He has repeatedly followed the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"I have made it my task to bring interesting people to Greven for many years now," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfeld Treffs" - the association that cooperates with the "Cultural Policy" alliance in the direction of the evening.
El-Mafaalani enters the reading very easily, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the subject comprehensiblely.
With a lot of gestures, hard numbers and some joke, he brings one of the most conflict-rich topics to the audience: migration and integration.
Why do conflicts arise despite successful integration?
The Syrian author uses the answer to the question of a metaphor.
At a table, German society sits, at the cat table, the migrants of the first generation.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to go to the table.
The third generation of migrants is born in Germany, they have always sat at the big table and now want to decide.
This leads to conflicts.
Therefore, it is not decisive whether one is politically right or left, but rather: "Am I for or against an open society?", he emphasizes.
At first, behave more and more, and then the discussion round starts more and more.
And there is a need to speak.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell how they see successful or unsuccessful integration among students.
El-Mafaalani, not on stage, is a symbol of the discussion: it is at eye level.
The sociology professor does not urge his opinion, emphasizes that he speaks of the average, not of individual fates.
He is pleased that there is an interest in the subject, because "only when we understand what the problem is can we find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
During the subsequent signing hour, he also had an open ear for the questions of the guests and also in the foyer, with prepared Kurdish specialities, was intensively discussed further.
Basketball: Bonn and casting win kickoffs

Gießen stood out in a hard-fought game in his own hall with 91:84 (43:46) against the Central German BC.
The ambitious Bonners won 86:79 (49:47) at the BG Göttingen.
The first table leader of the season is Alba Berlin after 112:55-Gala on Saturday against Science City Jena.

Building in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 plots
The demand is apparently huge: over 100 interested parties have applied for the purchase of one of the plots in Landsham-Süd.
The municipality of Pliening has sold the first plots in the new Landsham-Süd building area on the free market.
That tells Mayor Roland Frick.
In addition, the application phase for those 20 properties that the municipality offers at more favourable conditions or prices is completed - similar to the former local model.
A good 100 applications have been received, says Frick.
"The documents are currently being examined", with regard to the application criteria, completeness and accuracy.
According to the mayor of Plieninger, the goal is to have the candidate ranking for the 20 properties established by the end of the year and to present them to the municipal council.
After that, the award could be made.
In total, 50 plots for single and double houses are created on the site in the south of Landsham and four areas for multi-family houses with an estimated eight housing units.
The development is now almost complete, the roads and roads are about to be asphalted.
A single property and two of the multifamily houses belong to a private person, the rest of the municipality of Pliening.
It sells most on the free market, 20 properties in a socially compatible model.
According to Frick, the two multifamily houses of the community are to be built as affordable housing.
With a total of 16 income-oriented homes funded by the Free State.
Space for 200 people
It is estimated that living space for about 200 people will be created on the land of the new Landsham-Süd building area.
Not only that: Now, at the beginning of October, according to Frick, the start for the new construction of a day care centre is taking place.
Three kindergarten and three crib groups as well as a multipurpose room are to be accommodated.
The opening is scheduled for September 2019, at the start of the next kindergarten year.
This is how Schalkes Naldo achieves "great sport" on the bank
For the third time in a row, Naldo thanked Domenico Tedesco for his work at Schalke-Trainer.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues had for the third time in a row not sat in the Schalker Startelf, but on the exchange bench, the understanding would have been great for many people if the nearly two-metre Brazilian had spoken of the frustration of the soul.
But when the Schalker players gathered in the middle circle after the 1:0 victory over the FSV Mainz 05 as usual and thanked Chief Trainer Domenico Tedesco for all his professionals, the 36-year-old, who all call simple Naldo, turned on and said: "We have to thank, trainer!"
"That was very emotional, that was great sport," Tedesco later said about the reaction of his vice-captain, who, despite his renewed reservist existence, did not feel any resentment.
Probably Naldo, who was celebrated as the best scarifier in the past season, knows that he did not actually get on the track with his coach - but for good reasons he gets a break.
A reason called "tax control".
It wasn't easy to tell him that
"It wasn't easy to tell him that, I'm telling you quite honestly," Tedesco reported on the moment he told Naldo that he wasn't in the starter.
He's an important player, he's an important person.
But it's always about the matter, it's about the club," Tedesco explained the step.
Naldo played against Bavaria and Porto for 90 minutes.
He's 36 years old.
It is important that everyone can take a drink at the moment.
And that we all keep in the boat," Tedesco explained the rotation, which last caught Naldo.
And to those of the Brazilians who responded with the wisdom of his advanced age: by also proving himself on the bank as an exemplary team player.
The mood in Austria's industry has accelerated in August compared to the eurozone.
The shopping manager index (PMI) was 46.7 points on a 37-month low.
However, Austria has the third best mood across Europe behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Markit Institute reported on Monday on its survey among 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, while the PMI of the euro zone increased by 1.1 to 45.1 points, the index is still the 13th month in a row below the 50-counter mark, indicating growth.
Only Ireland's industry cracked this threshold in August with 50.9 points.
The final light was the Greeks (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the mood barometer dropped, but slower than in the months before.
In Spain, the index reached the highest level of 44.0 points since March.
"The slightly weakened valley ride could mean that the worst has survived," said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
However, industry - at least in the third quarter - remains the number one brake on growth.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: the export orders in the eurozone were as strong as since November 2011.
The companies therefore decommissioned jobs for the seventh month in a row.
In China, industrial production also dropped more strongly in August than initially assumed.
The mood barometer dropped from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts initially expected 47.8 points.
The shopping manager index is based on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
Developments in sales, employment, warehouses and prices are also being raised.
Tuchel's PSG team succeeds behind victory in the eighth league game
29 September 2018 at 19:45
Nice Trainer Thomas Tuchel continues to win with Paris Saint-Germain in France's football championship.
At the OGC Nice, the title defender won 3:0 (1:0) thanks to two hits by Superstar Neymar and was thus also successful in the eighth league game.

The Brazilian Neymar led PSG after 22 minutes and produced the final position in the post-replay period.
Christopher Nkunku (46.).
This led to the General Sample for the groundbreaking second Champions League team match against Red Star Belgrade on Wednesday.
At 2:3 in Liverpool, Tuchel's team had had to accept the only mandatory match defeat this season.
