Barack Obama is the fourth president of the Nobel Peace Prize
American President Barack Obama comes to Oslo, Norway for 26 hours to receive the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth president of the United States in history.
In addition, he receives the diploma, the medal and a check over 1.4 million dollars for his extraordinary efforts to intensify world diplomacy and cooperation among the peoples.
The head of the White House will arrive tomorrow together with his wife Michelle in the North Wegland metropolis and will be busy all the time.
He first visited the Nobel Institute, where he met for the first time with the five committee members who elected him from 172 people and 33 organisations in October.
The President-in-Office then planned a meeting with Norwegian King Harald V and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit reaches its peak with the ceremony where Obama takes over the prestige prize.
He receives this as the fourth president of the US, but only as the third one who accepts the prize directly in office.
The White House has already begun that Obama will talk about the Afghanistan War when the prize is taken over.
The President does not want to avoid this issue because he knows that he is taking over the prize as a president who is currently at war in two countries.
He reinforced the war effort a few days ago by sending further troops to Afghanistan, which none of his critics forget to emphasize.
At the ceremony Obama also received the Gold Medal, the Diploma and the Check over ten million Swedish Crowns (about 24 million Czech Crowns).
He intends to donate the money for charity purposes, but he has not yet decided on a concrete charity work.
The event programme then provides for a banquet with the President and his wife, in which, besides Norway's King and Queen, the Prime Minister and another 250 invited guests will be present.
Obama was very hesitant about the price from the beginning.
For example, he argued that he felt that he didn't deserve the price entirely.
He also repeated several times that the price is not only for him, but for all those who seek the same values as he does.
Immediately after the announcement, he stated that for him this is "invitation for action".
Natureguard accused of extortion
The Leitmeritz police accused the president of the Civil Society of the Leitmeritz community for blackmailing.
In several cases he made appeals last year against some building procedures, for the withdrawal of his vocations he demanded money from the investors in his favor, said the head of the police spokesman, Alena Romova.
The chairman of the Leitmeritz Nature Conservation Association is Lubomir Studnicka.
Now he's in prison and he's in danger of a prison sentence of up to three years.
The sorting trash container in Brno does not smell good
In Prague people can sort the beverage packaging, in the southern Moravian villages they can find again on foot and step back the sorting trash container.
And in Brno?
There you would have to reserve a few minutes to find the appropriate garbage tons.
I don't want to say that the waste separation in Brno wouldn't work at all.
But I think that even if the councillors take insufficient care of this problem, even if we are the second-largest city in the Republic.
Br√ºnn is located in the waste race in the Urwaldliga, not only because, as a citizen, we are always allowed to dispose of paper, glass and plastics in the sorting container, but above all by the number of waste tons for such waste.
Have you ever tried in the center to dispose of, for example, the PET bottles in a collection basket?
It's art, it takes time and a lot of nerves.
The only place I've found by chance so far is the Moravian Square in front of the hit goose.
Mr Onderka should not be annoyed by his colleagues, but that seems to me far too little.
Apart from the fact that waste separation is not a honey slug in other parts.
Therefore, whole rows of my friends do not sort the waste at all.
Out of laziness.
It's too far to them from the garbage bins.
I'm not surprised.
Even after the celebration, I offered to dispose of a few glass and plastic bottles.
But on the Konicova road I didn't see any ink garbage tons in sight.
Luckily, I came to the right place when I was on the tram.
But the trash almost ran over.
That's still the center of Brno, which represents the whole city, isn't it?!
However, ecology and some kind of aesthetics probably leave the Brunner Socialists cold.
You prefer to buy the city an ice hockey league that makes us a shame throughout the Republic, instead of buying a few garbage tons more and offering the sorting of other raw materials for a cleaner brown.
I am glad that I was able to confirm my acceptance with official statistics after looking for a while on the Internet.
According to the data of the company EKO-KOM Brno is really the worst in the whole district of South Moravia.
The "Paroubek" budget has withdrawn the money for pensions and sickness benefits
After the Left Party gave more money to farmers and officials despite the government's view, there is no longer any money available in the budget for pensions, health care and construction-saving business.
But also not for sovereign interest rates or for international court disputes.
This is causing even more problems to the government in the second half of next year, says Mr Eduard Janota, Minister of Finance.
When the Social Democrats and Communists enforced the increase in salary for some groups, they expected the government to provide additional funding for sensitive expenses, old-age pensions, or health care. "This is just a delay in problems in the future," says Janota.
Loans are supposed to pay higher and higher interest rates, and you have to repay the money sometime.
Too much to choose from, the state bank is empty.
If the social benefits or costs for the state undertaking are not reduced, the tax must be increased.
For all those to whom the Left Party now gave more money: the fire department, the teachers, the farmers.
And later for her children.
People don't have to be afraid to get this money because of the pensions or the sickness allowance, whose account has gone 1.8 billion.
But at the price that the state owes itself even more - the next year, this will not only be missing 163 billion in the public fund, but far more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, debt will increase faster and faster, together with this also the costs and interest.
The state will need the money for compensation, then it will no longer be enough to increase VAT only slightly or reduce maternity money, as the government did in its territory deficit package.
Due to the drop in money in favour of some electoral groups, five billion will be missing next year for the expansion of motorways and railways.
It is mainly the sections gained in competition that can no longer be re-projected and may be reduced.
Most of all, what is not free.
This means delaying or setting up thirty major buildings, and the creation of Europe's money is also at risk, warns the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The CSSD has proposed that it resolves the outflow of money in a regional way - it attacks the CEZ dividends in which the state is the owner of majority, and then the money is distributed into the transport fund.
The problem is that the amount of dividend is never safe, and it is in no way an infinite source.
Last year, 18 billion from CEZ came into the budget.
Every year the dividends pay for the environmental damage liquidations, the pension account is filled up and this money is also used as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
In addition, this trick increases the actual budget deficit to the level of 5.7 percent of GDP in accordance with EU rules.
However, this does not end the carnival of the revolutions.
Nearly three billion people cut the budget for various compensations for victims of Communism and crime or for expenses for the court disputes, even for saving on construction.
Whether the state manages without this money is not certain.
That's pure gambling.
If we lose an international court case, then we have to pay for it anyway, Janota makes it clear.
The Minister then has to save the money in the department or, in the worst case, attack the government budget reserve.
A hundred million are missing for the already started two-billion-dollar project "Staatskasse", which is intended to enable on-line monitoring, for what the individual authorities are spending the money.
The first stage starts in January.
If the Finance Minister did not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and in this case sanctions would come, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will control two operating systems
The Americans expect a mobile phone for the future, where the user can switch between different operating systems by pressing a single button.
The plans presented look promising.
It is enough to press only one button, and from Windows Mobile will change Android within a few seconds.
The American company VMware wants to introduce this very possibility, which focuses on the development of virtual software for computers.
We allow you to perform two user profiles on your mobile phone at the same time.
You can switch between these, they can separate them into two home and work profiles.
Both will work in parallel, Srinivas Krishnamurti from the company VMware pointed out during the interview for the magazine Computerworld.
It was presented in November last year and presented for the first time a few days ago.
On the market, it will come in 2012.
Virtualization of the smart phones is not fiction.
VMware has already successfully presented the smartphone test pattern to the journalist with two operating systems.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with a 128 MB RAM memory on which the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems ran simultaneously.
The development of the new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
Now VMware is working with the European and American operators on smartphone virtualization and the customer is expected to come the devices within 2012.
The lack of snow on the mountains torments the hotel owners
Snowless slopes make worries not only to Giant Mountains residents.
The missing snow also deters people from ordering ski stays in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, you can still get free rooms in Giant Mountains for all winter dates including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
Our pages are often visited.
People go through the offers, set the prices, but in the meantime they are afraid to order legally.
And when they call us, they immediately ask if we believe that this year's Christmas festival will be on snow or "on Matsch", the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura, led.
If you want to stay the New Year's Eve in the spindle mill exactly according to your expectations, no longer should you hesitate with your order.
If you prefer saving and where the quality of the stay only comes second, you can try to wait a few more days.
The Spindelm√ºhle hotel owners now offer mostly weekly stays for New Year's Eve.
I think they'll try to sell them for a while, but then they'll have to give in too, and go into shorter times.
And then the free rooms will disappear quickly, estimated Jandura.
The travel agency Ingtours in Vrchlabi always offers free beds at all winter dates.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which has not yet been sold out.
In our offer about half of the places are still free.
That is why we have already prepared some cheaper Christmas stays for the last moment, said the director of the travel agency Ingtours, Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabi travel agency can also offer New Year's Day in Giant Mountains, but there are fewer free places here.
Good sales also take place during the first fourteen days of February, and the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year the interest in winter stays is also negatively influenced by the fact that in Giant Mountains there is always no snow.
People are waiting for snow to fall.
Nobody wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snowy within a week, Christmas will also be sold out, says Schiefert.
Conversely and a little better than last year, the rooms at the Hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snezkou are well occupied.
We're about five percent better than last year.
On New Year's Day and Christmas we only have a few free rooms.
There is great interest in Polish holidays in Janua, and in February the business will also run well, informed the director of the best Pec hotel, Karel Rada.
80 percent for the New Year's Eve stays is also the hotel Omnia at the central parking lot in Janske Lazne.
On the other hand, half of the beds remain free at the latest hotel in Janske Lazne at Christmas.
We were pleasantly surprised this year in January, for which we are already about 60 percent occupied.
A little weaker is now February, but at the moment when the snow comes, surely also the interest in the stays in the Giant Mountains is increasing, the director of the Hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch, led.
In the meantime, the Giant Mountains hotel owners are waiting for a larger snow infestation.
On Thursday it should cool down and in case of rainfall it should be snow on the mountains.
But after that a warming will come again, Jiri Jakubsky informed Jiri Jakubsky of the Czech Weather Office in Hradec Kralove.
USA: Repeating is the mother of wisdom
It is almost funny with what student fervor Barack Obama, the president with his call of the wisest, repeats the strategy of his predecessor in the Afghanistan question he himself considered to be the dumbest.
When he finally sweated out his long-awaited Afghanistan doctrine, it turned out that he was writing it out about the copy paper from the Bush Iraq scenario three years ago.
Not only that in the text itself he uses the speech "as in Iraq" several times, he even has the name of the Bush Declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New Forward" without taming.
Three years ago, he himself criticised the Bush idea - fresh military quotas in the Iraq plagued by the civil war - as "irresponsible and in its consequences karastrophic decision".
The following months, however, showed that the Bush strategy based on recommendations from the military was the only possible and very successful one today in the news about Iraq.
This did not improve Bush's reputation, for objectively he left his successor a much more grateful starting situation than expected.
In Afghanistan Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will repeat itself.
He was once again asked by the military, especially the chief commander of the Afghanistan Operation General Stanley McCristal, who, despite the subordination habits, severely criticized the bragging shooters in the White House.
He demanded 40,000 soldiers to reverse the situation.
The president hesitated for three months, but did not come up with a better idea, and so he cheated on the general who was about 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe he has pressed the promise for another 5,000, even if he himself initially counted at least 10,000.
The most problematic of the Obama strategy is its intention to withdraw the forces from Afghanistan in 18 months and complete this process within three years. The entire Obama doctrine leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the halved increase will bring the same effect as the measure in Iraq.
Despite the brotherly war of recent years, the Iraq Society is relatively well structured, its leaders honor the values.
The Afghan situation is marked by contraindication - no one can rely on it and no agreements are made.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces who are used to changing their opinion every day.
The political institutions, even if they were formally established correctly, remain only shams behind which patriarchal tribal relations will continue to grow.
The balance of interests between the different ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially because of the uncertainty of the conditions that further complicate the Pakistan and Iran influences.
The establishment of a "actable state", which is the minimalist objective of the whole operation, is also very unrealistic.
Time horizon of the Obama Strategy alienated by its Voluntaryism
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has deteriorated only further and now it is on the verge of explosion.
It is believed that the small soldiers, who have broken into the war cry about the "early return" here, create a miracle, can only create a truly romantic soul that cannot be impressed by facts.
From the political point of view, the date for the withdrawal of the troops is purely irresponsibility, because the Taliban will accept it as the indirect confession of the American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the Europeans' willingness to participate in the battles in Afghanistan is nagging.
Europe's politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is linked to the war in the Hindu Mountains.
Another possible factor that can radically influence the situation is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions do not affect the Iranians, there is a very serious question for the United States whether the problem should not be solved with troops.
This question has to be answered during the period when America is heading for Obama to withdraw from Afghanistan.
However, every solution will also mean a dramatic turn of the Afghan situation.
The only consolation for Barack Obama is the fact that there are still three years to the presidential election, and thus there is still enough time to reach another strategy, it would be a total failure.
Bank Goldman Sachs managers no longer receive bonuses in cash
The executives of the American Bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive bonuses in cash this year.
This has been announced by the company, which reacts to the sharp criticism of their wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers receives shares instead of the money, which can only be sold in five years.
In addition, the shares may be withdrawn from managers in case they are excessively risky.
Goldman Sachs is thus at the forefront of the efforts to combine Wall Street's premium bonuses with long-term performance, according to the Reuters agency.
I believe Wall Street is aware of the further direction in which it has to go, the former banker of the company JPMorgan, Douglas Elliott, argued.
The problem lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs became the target of criticism after she had put aside nearly 17 billion dollars for premium bonuses for the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of premium bonuses over the course of this year is likely to exceed $20 billion in spite of the measure indicated today, according to the Reuters Agency.
The high premium bonuses in the banking sector have become the hottest political issue in a number of countries at the beginning of the financial crisis.
On Wednesday, Great Britain reported that the banker's bonuses, which exceed 25,000 pounds, are intended to burden a 50 percent tax once.
Similar steps are also being taken by France.
This year, women won Nobel Prizes in all disciplines except physics.
Five record women today in Stockholm from the hands of the King of Sweden Carl XVI. Gustaf took over this year's Nobel Prizes in specialist categories and literature.
In addition to the four scientists, among them was the German writer of Romanian descent, Herta M√ºller, among them.
The Nobel Prize for Medicine has been awarded by two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with their countryman Jack Szostak for research in the chromosone field.
The prize for chemistry has been received by Israeli Ada Jonah, together with the Americans, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for the investigation of the ribosom structure and function.
The last Laureate awarded the Nobel Prize for Economics awarded by American Elinor Ostrom and her countryman Oliver Williamson for analyses of the economic report.
The only category in which no woman received a Nobel Prize this year was physics.
Today, the scientists Charles Kao for research in the fiberglass sector and George Smith, together with Willard Boyl, took this prize away for the CCD chip invention, which is the basis of all digital chambers, fax machines or astronomical telescopes.
Each of these winners has received the diploma, the Nobel Medal and the certificate of acquisition of the money prize.
It amounts to ten million Swedish crowns in every category.
If there are several prizewinners in each category, the money price will be divided among them.
Traditionally, the American President, Barak Obama, has already received the most expected Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo this afternoon.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversy of his appointment, because he is only at the beginning of his journey and is also at the head of the country that has two wars - Iraq and Afghanistan.
In keeping with his policy, however, he added that in certain situations wars are necessary for the fight of world peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota is considering retiring. Klaus invited him to the castle
President Vaclav Klaus welcomes the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, on Friday, who is thinking about his remaining in the government because he does not agree with the implementation of the State budget for the next year in the form approved by the Assembly on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget and perhaps the remaining of Janota in the cabinet will be the topics of the Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the budget deficit is too high, which also deepens the crisis of public finances.
The president informed Radim Ochvat about the meeting.
Janota wants to negotiate with the Prime Minister, Jan Fischer, on Monday about his further stay in his role.
According to the Budget Act, which now receives Klaus's signature, the Czech Republic should operate with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, however, Parliament voted on the left-party proposals for a change of money and increased the money for state officials, for the maintenance of the social benefits and direct wages of farmers.
The government has opposed the proposals of the Social Democracy to raise the budget deficit by covertly.
Between the left-wing party on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the right-wing party, on the other hand, a sharp internal political dispute has arisen, because of which the question mark arises about the further work of the fishermen's official cabinet, on which the ODS, CSSD and Green Party agreed in spring.
Critics claim that the budget, as it was adopted by Parliament, practically liquidates the package of austerity measures imposed by the fishermen government in autumn, which, according to their understanding, is intended to end public debt.
Klaus, who can sign the law on the state budget, but does not have to, said today at the discussion breakfast with the entrepreneurs that politicians have for a long time neglected the "serious problem" that represents "the unsustainable deficit" of public finances.
In his opinion, there is no good solution today.
An improvement could only bring a strong government that could build on a broader consensus of political parties.
The ODS President, Mirek Topolanek, pointed out that the budget is horrific, and the government should weigh its further existence.
The ODS Vice-Chairman, Petr Necas, told the CTK that the concept of the official cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party obviously no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer described similar words in the editorial paper as "strong statements".
The CSSD chief, Jiri Paroubek, responded to the Topolanek words that the budget deficit was horrific that the former government of Topolanek had prepared for this year, exceeding 200 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, the CSSD rated the approval of the government budget for the next year as a success.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Mandela was played in the new film by Clint Eastwood by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: The Unbeated" of the world shows much of the country, whose struggle and victory despite some criticisms that the leading role was occupied by an American actor.
The story tells about sport, racial relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighters against the racist apartheid government system in the South African Republic, as well as their first black president, Nelson Mandela, represent the American Oscar actor Morgan Freeman in his life story.
Freeman said he was asked by the ninety-one year old Mandela if he could present him in the Eastwood film.
Another significant role is played by Matt Damon.
I told him, "If I'm gonna play you, I have to meet you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who had received the prize for his role in the Eastwood drama from the boxing area "Million Dollar Baby", was already the leader of the movement to abolish slavery, from which finally became a slave holder, a fictitious U.S. president, and also God in "Evan Almighty", but rarely anyone who is still alive and for many people as important as Mandela.
The former South African statesman was in prison for 27 years for his active activity at the end of apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was set free in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "unbeat", and at the same time it is the name of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, which was published in 1875.
The requirement was how to speak
The film depicts a true event in which Nelson Mandela joined forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to agree on the country. The new President Mandela knows that even after Apartheid, his people still remain racially and economically divided.
He believes that he can agree with his people through the sport, so he decides that the rugby players who belong to the outsiders worldwide.
Finally, the South African team will rise to the World Cup of 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to bring Mandela's story to the screen.
He had no other goal than to play this role in order to approach it as closely as possible to reality, said Freeman.
The biggest challenge was of course to speak as he did.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were in the same country, he would try to meet Mandela, have dinner with him, and be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake Mandela's hand.
I noticed if I shook your hand, I took over your energy, it was transferred, and I felt that I knew what you were feeling, he said.
For me, it's important to have become another person.
Matt Damon is featured in the film Fran√ßois Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team, in which the white players considered.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for the role in the hard rugby world.
It was a great surprise for him when he first met Pienaar in his house.
I remember when I sounded at the doorbell that he opened and the first thing I said to Fran√ßois Pienaar in my life was: 'I look much bigger in the film'.
Despite the obvious differences in the actors' status compared with their actual models, he received positive reviews under the direction of director Eastwood "Invictus: Unbeaten" and one also speaks of prospects for an Oscar.
The film critic of Daily Variety, Todd McCarthy, summarized his evaluation in the following words: "That was very good story, very well performed film."
In the film reviews on the web pages rottentomatoes.com, Invictus has received 76 percent positive evaluations.
Light secret about Norway solved: The Russians tested a rocket
A special light effect of unknown origin was observed over Norway.
Only yesterday did the Russian Ministry of Defence admit that an intercontinental ballistic missile had been tested near the Norwegian border.
The launch, however, was not successful again and the rocket called "Bulava" which was originally intended to be the pride of the Russian army will slowly become the nightmare of the Russian generality as well as the Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Also his repeated presence at the rocket test had no positive effect on the success of the pilot flights.
Bulava has usually not been started at all or damaged in the air.
In the Russian newspapers, "Bulava" is written about "a rocket that does not fly".
A rocket that does not fly, but lights
This already 13th attempt, was normal at the beginning.
It was not until the end of the flight that technical damage to the rocket occurred.
Probably the engine exploded in the third stage.
This time "Bulava" started from the nuclear submarine Dmitrij Donskij, which was driven under the waters of the White Sea.
This type of rocket allows the launch from the submarine.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light caused by an indefinite flying object was actually the damaged "Bulava".
Moreover, since the first moment the Norwegians have not doubted that it is a Russian rocket.
This time the generality has held back and claims that one cannot clearly speak of a failure.
The first two stages of the rocket did not fail and the accident only affected the third stage.
In the previous cases, the engines were damaged in the first stage.
Even if no test started without a mistake, the Ministry of Defence's management only considers six out of thirteen to be unsuccessful.
The almost fifty percent success therefore meets the generality with optimism, and it is still claimed that the "Bulava" will fly once without problems and will even carry up to ten hypersonic atom heads with a total weight of 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
The legendary defense player Vjaceslav Fetisov presents himself in a professional ice hockey game at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic winner, and Stanley Cup owner helps his team CSKA Moscow out in distress, and probably already competes against Petersburg in Fridaysduel KHL.
Fetisov, who finished his career at the age of forty, in 1998, is currently president of the CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas hurt himself, we urgently need another defense player.
Fetisov has regularly trained and agreed that he will support the team.
We only need to clarify a few remaining formalities, the agency AP quoted the coach of the Moscow club of Sergey Nemcinov.
In the meantime, it is not clear whether the comeback of the famous hockey player will only affect one game.
I mean, Fetisov is one of those who can raise the morale of other players, and co-player Nemcinov performed.
When Fetisov comes back to the ice, he becomes the oldest Russian professional ice hockey game after AP.
In the NHL, the legendary storm Gordie Howe played a full season for Hartford with fifty-one years and was able to score 15 hits and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful ice hockey players in history.
In the Soviet Union dress he won two Olympic gold medals, seven world championships, and he also triumphed in Canada Cup and the Junior World Championships.
In the second part of his career, he also gained successes in the NHL, where he twice pushed the Stanley Cup over his head in Detroit-Dress.
Since 2001, he has been a member of the ice hockey star room.
Hyundai gave in to the trade unions. All overtime is lifted
The management of the Nosovice car factory Hyundai agreed with the union on the abolition of all overtime.
The union announced its willingness to strike on Monday because of frequent overtimes.
This was confirmed by the speaker of the Hyundai automobile factory, Petr Vanek.
However, the management wants to agree with the trade unionists on a Saturday shift this week.
We must not give up our production plan, which is a principle, which is why on Saturday, December 19, voluntary overtime was proposed for the reason that two shifts of work would be worked, Vanek said.
The website Sedmicka.cz wrote that the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to employees who would work the Saturday shift.
The staff will also receive it in retrospect for the Saturday shift of 28 November.
According to Vanek, the company has decided to change the type of motivation of the employees for the proposed overtime.
Either they can pay the overtime supplement or they can take replacement leave on 28 December and thus extend the Christmas holidays, Vanek showed.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday shift are paid the fare and lunch.
Taking into account that the overtimes were the most urgent and burning point in the demands and complaints of trade unionists who had discontinued production last week, the management decided with immediate effect yesterday afternoon on the abolition of all overtimes for December, Vanƒõk mentioned.
By last week the employees of the automotive factory had been forced to work almost every day after the eight-hour shift for 2 more hours.
Once the agreement has been signed, the willingness to strike will be withdrawn by the trade unions.
Further negotiations between the management of the automotive factory and the trade unionists are scheduled to take place on Friday afternoon.
The trade union leader, Petr Kuchar, said on Wednesday that if they agree to meet the demands and sign a joint document, they will be ready to cancel the strike.
Last week, on Wednesday, the situation in the automobile factory increased, when about 400 employees spontaneously stretched out because of overtime.
They also protested against the bad payment conditions and alleged shocks.
On the other hand, the management held that employees had to make the overtime to meet the automotive needs.
The trade unionists also called for no sanctions to be imposed on employees who had interrupted production last Wednesday.
In the field of overtime, trade unions call for overtime to be reduced to a minimum.
In addition, this year they are demanding the payment of 5000 crowns.
The Nosovice car factory Hyundai now employs 2000 people.
Serial production was started in November last year.
By this September around 80,000 vehicles were produced here, with the current production capacity of 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also works with ‚Äústeeled‚Äù HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists tests new connections to prevent the spread of HIV viruses in the organism.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works with viruses that are already resistant to drugs.
This fact outweighs the disadvantage that the connection to common virus variants does not work as strongly as one of the already existing medicines.
The AIDS disease cannot yet be cured.
However, patients can prolong their lives and prevent the proliferation of HIV viruses in the body.
However, your intake is accompanied by a number of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of virus reproduction also results in the development of so-called resistant viruses that are no longer effective.
The work of the experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, VSCHT (Chemical-Technological University of Prague) and Heidelberg University opens the way to dealing with virus resistance.
They have shown that the substances described as metalocarborans act on the protein that is responsible for multiplying the HIV virus.
The metalocarborans are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block virus reproduction in a different way than all medicines used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, the scientists come to new ÃÅimproved ÃÅ compounds prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding on the virus protein.
The metalocarborans have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-faceted cages, consisting of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms, coupled by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Insidious and constant virus
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV virus split caused by HIV protease, no mature infection virus particles would arise.
When we disable HIV protease, we also disable the spread of the virus in the patient's body, the scientists explain in the press report published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the work published in the Science Journal of Medical Chemistry, the scientists describe whole series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are coupled by a short organic chain, which is then systematically changed.
A little weaker but more reliable
The effect of this series of substances on HIV protease has been tested in the test tube, including their resistant (resistant) variants obtained by HIV infected patients.
The effect of metalocarborans on the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as in the clinically used medicinal products, but it does not lose its effect on the resistant variants that the medicines used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action, as well as its other characteristics, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and possibility of further chemical design, makes the metalocarborans interesting for further research aimed at the development of effective medicines against HIV, says Pavlina Rezacova, head of the Institute of Structural Biology of the Institutes of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
ODS went to fisherman who is fighting for budget.
The Chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, described the approved budget for the next year as "grauenvol" and the Prime Minister of Jan Fischer's government should, in his opinion, consider its further existence.
The statement of the ODS called the Prime Minister "strong statements".
It's supposed to be time for analysis.
The vice-president of the ODS, Petr Necas, said that the concept of the official cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party obviously no longer works.
According to Necas, the Prime Minister has to decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in Parliament, on the fight against the rising deficit, or whether he is still in office with the help of the Left.
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats to the problem of public deficits is diametrically different, and Necas has pointed this out.
On Wednesday, Parliament adopted the 2010 budget, with left-party amendments over 12 billion crowns.
Parliament has increased the money for state officials' salaries, for the maintenance of social benefits and for direct payments to farmers.
In doing so, the government has opposed the proposals of the Social Democracy to raise the budget deficit by covertly.
The Czech Republic should operate with a residue of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS has left the room before the vote, so it has complied with the government's wish, because the modified budget is also only a less bad variant of the budget proposal. Frase not clear
Disappointment and senselessness
The Finance Minister, Eduard Janota, spoke about his disappointment and a sense of senselessness, whereas Prime Minister Jan Fischer argued that the government is still assessing the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota had seriously threatened with his resignation in case the amendments were adopted, the situation would look different.
According to Czech television, Janota has registered with the Premier for Monday after the government business.
In doing so, he indicated that he was considering his further stay in office.
The reason for this is his disappointment over the negotiation of the budget.
According to Necas, to what extent fishermen express themselves in favour of the further struggle with the budget deficit, the nominees of the Social Democracy (CSSD) who had implemented the changes in the budget have nothing to do in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if Parliament continues to adopt deficit-enhancing laws, such as those relating to sickness benefits and pensions or the service bill.
Topolanek: Ministers nominated by ODS were not mistaken
This is the case of Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS did not make any mistakes, Topolanek emphasized in a text message from the USA.
It has mentioned that in some ministries there are people in deputy function who profess to TOP 09 who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if fishermen decide not to fight the deficit level of public finances, "it is perfectly logical and correct that it is based on the left-wing majority that is currently in Parliament".
Then he is supposedly unable to expect the support and tolerance of the citizens' democrats.
I have not thought about it, and if that is up-to-date, then I will deal with it, Minister of Defence Martin Bartak, nominated by the Democrats, told the journalists in Parliament.
Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels in the afternoon at the European Council.
The ODS resigned at the request of the Prime Minister
At the same time, Necas stressed that the ODS would probably vote against the amended budget in Parliament on Wednesday, should the Prime Minister expressly ask the representatives of the ombudsmen to allow them to adopt the budget.
We do not appear to be orphans, we are not small children, so he responded to the question whether the ODS was not pushed back in the political negotiation of the budget by the absence of the party chairman in Parliament and in the Czech Republic.
I didn't notice my voice was missing.
Even when I renounced the mandate, I knew that in the coming months it would be all positive, especially with regard to the Bolshevization of Parliament and destruction, Topolanek himself responded.
According to the new schedule of the CD (Czech Railway) fewer trains will travel for about the same fare.
The Czech railways will end or limit some less-used high-speed and local trains as of 13 December, while other connections will be reinforced.
The total volume of transport will be reduced by two percent from the date of validity of the new timetable compared to today.
Most tariffs incl. basic and customer fare will not be changed.
Several connection options to the capital are available, for example, to the inhabitants of the Ostrava area, the railway uses Pendolino trains for this route.
The express train will no longer go to Bratislava (Pressburg).
Few fast trains will also drive on the route Prague - Pisak - Budweis, in principle the direct connections from Prague to Letohrad will be reduced.
The largest reduction is planned by the railway in the district of Hradec Kralove (K√∂nigsgraz), a total of eight percent, while an increase can look forward to Prague and the surrounding area.
Two night trains are also lifted on the Prague - Tabor - Budweis route and to a few days a week the operation of some short trains on the Prague - Pisak - Budweis route is reduced.
Among the biggest changes is the introduction of the new direct road from Milovice to Prague, currently the inhabitants of Milovice have to move to Lysa nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth route of the suburban transport system Esko, whose opening is possible thanks to the railway electrification from Lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
The long distance routes to the capital will end in the destination station Prague - Central Station.
The CD introduces more connection lines SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and the trains to Sumperk/Jesenik will drive at a time of two hours.
With the Pendolino, passengers have not been able to travel to Bratislava since December 13.
This year's account for regional railways: increase by 200 million
The express trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, overall, the railway will receive four billion crowns for the so-called loss of liquidity next year, exactly as this year. Local trains will provide the districts with a total of eight billion crowns next year, with the state shooting three billion.
This year the regional trains cost 200 million Czech crowns more.
For the local trains and the express trains, the railway has re-established a ten-year contract, until now the contract has been concluded only for one year.
The railway praises the system, perhaps it has not taken advantage of the increase in the price of the large majority of tickets.
Changes are only made with one-day network tickets CD Net and with cheap internet tickets eLiska.
For passengers without the customer card, the price CD Net is increased from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The eLiska price will then depend on the driven stick, so far it was uniform for the trip between any district cities and cost 160 crowns.
Philippine Milliante arrests more than 50 people, the children were released.
Millitante abducted 75 people in the south of the Philippines today, including some primary students and their teachers.
That is what the AFP agency mentioned, which originally only informed about 65 abductees.
All 17 children detained were released after eight hours, including a teacher.
It was abducted in the province of Agusan del Sur.
About 19 millitants reportedly used the hostages as a living sign in the escape from the police.
The local negotiators are now seeking the release of the remaining hostages.
According to the agency AFP, the billions belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the arms fraction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CCP).
According to AP, the police persecuted the kidnappers for the violence that called for revenge between the two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, the right to stand was imposed because of the recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre, which was associated with the election to the governor's office, were 30 journalists.
Because of suspicion of participation in the massacre, the governor of this southern Phillipan province and his father Andal Ampatuan, Patriarch of the influential Ampatuan clan, were arrested.
On the island of Mindanao, Muslim separatists are also active.
On Tuesday, however, the peace negotiations with the Phillipan government were resumed.
The history of South Africa affects everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Nelson Mandela
In the next few days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwoods will come to the American cinemas "Invictus: the Unbeated", which includes part of the life story of the former President of the Republic of South Africa, Nelsona Mandela.
The role of the world-famous fighter against apartheid has been given to Morgan Freeman, who had already been supposedly chosen by Mandela himself a few years ago.
The side role of the legendary South African champion in Rugby, Francois Pienaar, has received Matt Damon.
With the cinema launch of the film, reactions from critics as well as the public also become loud.
Nelson Mandela
His name is Nelson Rolihlaha Mandela, born on 18 July 1918 in South African Mvez.
In 1988 he received the Sakhar Prize, then in 1993 together with de Klerk the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was elected President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
Great expectations are placed in the film because it comes to the cinemas in South Africa, where on the one hand, preparations for the World Championships culminate, but at the same time, the media shake the world public with frightening news about the rising racial hatred and discrimination of the inhabitants by the black ruling majority.
According to the news agency AP, the reactions to the new film in South Africa are for the time being consistently positive, despite numerous reservations against the occupation of the main roles with American Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is still proud of the new film in his own words.
I have dreamed of this role for many years and have prepared well for it.
Several times I also met Nelson Mandela personally, so that I can receive his energy, as you say, he performed in the interview after the film premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's good to be able to get in touch with Mandela's personality and his message with this film.
This is a history of South Africa, but it affects every person, he added.
In the dress of the Rugby national team
The film is based on the book by British writer John Carlin, freely translated ÃÅIn the role of the enemy ÃÅ: Nelson Mandela and the game that has united the people, portrays the South African advocate of human rights within his first presidential term.
In the course of the film, Morgan Freeman endeavours to bring together two racial and for years and a day delimited population groups and, like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also plays in the South African National Rugby Address World Cup, which then won South Africa.
For entering the lawn in the dress, which is almost like a sacred act in South Africa, Mandela reaped great ovations fourteen years ago, mostly from the white audience and thus won the recognition of the white population.
The rugby championship may have brought the people together to form a single people, led by the rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa is improving will only show up.
However, the white South Africans are skeptical, as in the recent interview for LN of the Rugby fan, Christopher Dawson, who fled the country to Great Britain.
The championship starts on 11 June 2010.
In Louny fires, transformers burn for more than 10 million crowns
The fire broke out in the morning at the transformer of the company Ceps in the switchgear near the municipality of Vyskov in Louny area.
Six units were attacked during the fire, according to the speaker of the Usti nad Labem District Fire Department, Lukas Marvan.
Originally, the fire department wanted to burn out the transformers, but later it changed the view and now the fire is deleted with a mixture of water foam and special extinguishants.
The cause was a technical defect, a transformer-short end.
No one was injured, the havary was at risk according to the company spokesperson, Pavla Mandatenova, the security operation of the management system.
The damage was estimated at several 10 million crowns, more precisely the damage will only be counted after the fire.
The destroyed transformer must be replaced by a new one according to Mandatenova.
For more than 10 years, nothing similar has happened with the company Ceps, mistakes of this kind are rare, supplemented them.
The power supply was not interrupted according to the spokesman of the company CEZ for Northern Bohemia, Sona Holingerova, by the fire of the Trafostation was not affected by the functioning of households, authorities and companies.
A.G. Ceps operates in the Czech territory as the sole operator of the transmission system, the power lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renews and develops 39 switchgear with 67 transformers, which transfer the electrical energy into distribution system and line with a length of 4339 kilometres.
Jancura makes a criminal complaint for slandering three heads of the CSSD.
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jancura, is now raising criminal charges for slandering three social-democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the district of South Moravia, Radko Martinek from the district of Pardubice and the head of the district of Olomouc, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a twenty-minute inteview in the radio journal.
The action is linked to the company's efforts to operate regional trains in some districts.
However, all regions have finally signed the long-term contracts with the Czech Railway.
All three ladders attack us and say that we take out the raisins, and we have presented the offer only on the extent of the agreement with them.
They claim that we are expensive than the Czech Railways because we would know the prices of the Czech Railways that were completed last week.
So nothing is left to us but to defend us.
Because of this slander of the company Student Agency, Jancura told the radio journal.
At the same time, he argued that he had evidence from all districts that they had taken their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing an indictment for the European Commission.
Hasek considers the collection of criminal charges to be the further continuation of the medial show of Jancura, which serves him as free advertising for his society as well as for his own person.
I am of course prepared to defend my good name and the good reputation of my district, and I also call on other leaders to do so.
I assume that even on this issue it will become clear that it is Jancura, who manipulates the public in the matter of regional railway transport and uses lying and false arguments, said Hasek.
Jancura reported last week that he had invested several million crowns in advertising that will point to the adverse step of the districts.
He told the radio journal that he wanted to interrupt the campaign after Christmas and continue it after New Year.
He specified that he would lead the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign started in Jancura after the districts agreed to operate the regional railway transport with the Czech railway and did not tender for the contract in a high of 150 billion crowns.
According to Vancura, such conduct is unlawful and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
Because of the criticism of train traffic in the districts, according to Jancura, he was already threatened by a member of the CSSD.
The only threat was if we don't give up on losing the bus licenses.
He introduced himself as a member of the CSSD, I know who it is, I don't say his name, Jancura told the radio journal today.
Vaccination against pneumococcal agents free of charge and voluntary
Imputation against pneumococcal changes the habit from January onwards.
She is the first one to be free and voluntary for families.
But even now, votes indicate that compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
Culinise preparations for the introduction of the free vaccination against pneumococcal.
The Institute of Medicine has already set the maximum prices for vaccines to pay for health insurance.
The experts are also aware of the vaccination process.
New vaccination
Vaccines free of charge for August children
From January onwards, children can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcal diseases, which were born on 2 August last year and later.
The condition is that they have not yet received a dose of vaccine.
Those who have already started vaccination in the past year or earlier must also pay for further repetition vaccination themselves.
The first dose must be given between the 3rd and 5th months of life of the child.
Last year, a quarter of the families had their children vaccinated against pneumococcal.
The parents paid 1600 crowns and more for one dose.
Four doses are required for the vaccination of the youngest children.
Overall, experts estimate that the health insurance for the vaccination doses spends 300,000 to 450,000 crowns a year.
But they save on the treatment that the children would need without vaccination.
Up to now, the state has spent around 500,000 per year on all children's area vaccinations.
The mandatory vaccination was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcal agents cause middle ear inflammation, but also serious infections including cerebral inflammation and blood poisoning.
Pneumococcal infections kill us after examination in hospitals every year up to 28 children aged up to 10 years.
Outside the Czech Republic, the compulsory vaccination of children against pneumococcal agents was introduced in about 40 countries.
Will vaccination be compulsory?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccination could be mandatory in the future.
From January, it will be paid by the insurance companies and voluntary.
For example, Rudolf Kalovsky, the head of the Nahlas Civil Association, mentioned that compulsory vaccination would be better.
His association is already promoting the pneumococcal vaccination in the long term.
The experts at the international conference in which our association was involved were not very satisfied with the fact that we have voluntary vaccination.
It's not ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad that we managed to enforce at least that.
I think this is the way we have to go now, Kalovsky pointed out.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococcal.
At this moment, we don't think of it at all, said his speaker Vlastimil Sesen.
The voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, the doctors claim.
The chairman of the specialist company of practical pediatricians, Hana Cabrnochova, admits that voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
If all children had been vaccinated, we could think about reducing the number of repeat vaccinations "In a situation where the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccination was started as a voluntary one," says Cabrnochova.
The experts expect more than 80 percent of parents to have their infants vaccinated against pneumococcals next year.
The vaccination against pneumococcal disease is also groundbreaking in that it is the first area vaccination paid by health insurance and not by the state.
Insurance should spend the money on prevention, saving them for further treatment, Cabrnochova explains.
The doctors must buy the vaccines themselves.
However, this involves a concern of the practical pediatricians concerning the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original plan, the vaccines should be bought by insurance companies and the doctors should then receive them in the same way as other vaccines issued to them by the State.
However, some Members feared that the insurance companies could "employ the money from health insurance".
Therefore, the doctors will have to shop and wait for the vaccines themselves until the insurance companies pay them.
It is estimated that the individual practical doctors will have to invest 40,000 crowns a month, which is a significant sum.
That won't be easy at all, says Cabrnochova.

The son of the famous American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta was accused of trying to steal 20 million dollars of paintings from his father's museum.
According to Pennsylvania Police, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was captured in his vehicle with trailer when he invited 90 paintings.
It is said that Frank Frazetta junior and another man used a excavator to penetrate the museum into the Pocono Mountains.
The 81-year-old Frank Frazetta Senior is famous for his representation of figures such as Conan the Barbar and Tarzan.
As the Associated Press news agency reported, the artist stayed in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP quoted an unnamed police officer who said that Frank Frazetta Junior could have been motivated by a family feud.
According to a police affidavit, Frazetta Junior said that he was instructed by his father "that he should enter the museum by all means to bring all the paintings into a camp".
The agency announced that Frank Frazetta was in the process of having granted any permission.
Labour defends budget and tax increases
Ministers have defended the tax increases and stoppages announced in the preliminary report against the criticism of the opposition, the economy and trade unions.
The Conservatives said that Alistair Darling had left an opportunity to show that he meant it seriously by reducing the deficit by putting forward the decisions until after the election.
The Chancellor also came under fire for targeting low- and medium-income workers.
Its main proposals include a 0.5% increase in social security and a 1 percent cap of public wage statements for 2011.
Social security contributions
The trade unions have protested that low wage recipients are being punished for a recession that they have not caused and warned of upcoming "problems".
The rise in social security - to approximately ¬£3 billion a year - has annoyed the private sector, which says that this is a tax on jobs, although the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase limited to those who earn more than 20,000 pounds a year will affect about 10 million workers.
SURVEILLANCE OF THE PRE-ACCESSION REPORT
An additional 0.5 % increase in social security from April 2011
This year, the economic downturn by more than the expected 4.75%
New 50 % tax on banker bonuses
1 per cent increase in corporate tax for small enterprises
Control axles for electric vehicles and wind turbines
Increase in public pensions by 2.5 %
According to estimates by the Treasury, a person with an annual income of ¬£30,000 will be poorer by ¬£90 a year and a person with ¬£40,000 a year will be poorer, while a person with an annual income of ¬£10,000 will be richer by ¬£110.
Ministers said that their objective of deficit halving by 2013 meant "difficult decisions", but they also said that 60% of the additional tax burden would be borne by the 5% of the top earners.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms argued that the tax increases and expenditure stops outlined would be "a drop on the hot stone" compared to the necessary measures.
"These are great figures. You will bring us deficit relief and this is absolutely necessary over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident that the economy would return to growth by the end of the year.
The Labour Party's predictions of future economic growth, which affect the extent of the re-indebtedness and the speed of deficit depreciation, were questioned after the treasurer was forced to revise earlier figures.
He said in his opinion that the economy is likely to shrink by 4.75% this year - far more than the 3.5% drop predicted in April - while debt would be ¬£3 billion higher than previously estimated.
Missing opportunity
The Conservatives, who want to launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday to warn of the "debt crisis" of Labour, said that the planned debt of ¬£789 billion over the next six years is unsustainable.
They added that ministers have failed to present a credible plan of how they will repay this and press themselves "cynically" before difficult decisions until after the election - which must take place by June 2010.
"They didn't say anything about what they're going to do," said shadow finance minister Philip Hammond. "They had their chance to do this, and they let them pass by."
"The important announcements will only be made after the election, whoever wins them."
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police are protected from future cuts, unlike in the proposals of the Conservatives, which see deficit capping coming faster and more quickly.
But the Liberals said that the money won by tax increases and spending stops is used to cover the expenditure for the next year, not to reduce the deficit, and therefore argue that the plans were "built on sand".
The BBC's political editor, Nick Robinson, said that at the time of the announcements, such as the above inflation adjustment for some invalids' pensions next April, the treasurer would be exposing the accusation of the catch of votes, as the money could simply be recovered next year.
Labour insists on providing extra assistance when people need it most and that the situation will be re-examined in September 2010.
"Hohler Etat"
Although the ministers have not announced any budget details beyond 2011, economists say that the pressure on public expenditure will only come in the medium term.
The recognised Institute for Tax Investigations said that the Chancellor's figures would mean strong cuts in many areas, possibly in the future also in the areas of transport, higher education, science and defence.
"It only shifts the pain to later," said his director Robert Chote.
"The important announcements are made only after the election, whoever wins them," added Roger Bootle, business consultant at the audit firm Deloitte.
"This was just the hollow pre-etat report. The markets recognize it."

The FBI is investigating the arrest of five reported US citizens for suspected extremist connections in Pakistan.
The men were arrested in an attack on a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern Panjab province, the American Embassy in Pakistan announced to the BBC.
The FBI said it was being investigated whether the same men were reported missing last month in the U.S. state of Virginia.
The US Department of Foreign Affairs said that they are also looking for information about the men.
Three of them are said to be Pakistani descent, one is Egyptian origin and the other has Yemeni background.
"If they are American citizens, we are of course very interested in the charges that they are accused of and under what circumstances they are held in," said Spokesman Ian Kelly.
The FBI spokesperson Katherine Schweit said the authority was informed of the arrests and was associated with the families of the missing students.
"We work with the Pakistani authorities to find out their identities and the purpose of their stay there, if it really is the missing students," she said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington announced that the men were arrested in a house belonging to the uncle of one of the students.
He said that the local police had previously been interested in the house and that no charges had been filed against the arrested men.
The news agency Reuters reported that it refused to comment on the arrests, but she said that the US "must work more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan to eradicate the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people."
The five students were reported missing by their families in North Virginia at the end of November.

According to a report by the human rights organisation Amnesty International, human rights in Iran is still as bad as in the past 20 years.
The report details "abusive patterns" by the regime, both before and after the debated presidential elections in June.
One man quoted in the report said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran rejected earlier criticism of its human rights balance.
Officials said that such criticism was politically motivated.
After the disputed election of President Mahmud Ahmadinejad, thousands of people were arrested in Iran and dozens were killed, leading to the greatest street protests since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
Dozens received prison sentences and prosecutors said that at least five people were sentenced to death.
BBC Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne, who is now in London, said that at the beginning of the protests of the highest leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the abuse claims and ordered the closure of the Kahrizak town centre.
But since then, there has been no more tolerance for criticism by the authorities, our correspondent said.

Amnesty International quoted the report of 26-year-old computer science student Ebrahim Mehtari, who said he was accused of "work with Facebook networks" and of protesting the election results.
"They hit me more often in the face," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, on my head... they threatened me with death and they humiliated me."
After five days he signed a false confession and, still bleeding and half unconscious, was released on the street, Amnesty announced.
The beaten presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some protesters who had been arrested after the election were tortured to death in August in prison and others were raped.
The Iranian authorities denied the charges of rape, but admitted that abuses had taken place.
Amnesty also mentioned the case of a former prisoner who said that with 75 others he had been detained in a container in a detention centre in Kahrizak for more than eight weeks.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian Parliament and the judicial authorities had set up a committee to investigate the government‚Äôs unrest after the election and reactions, but Amnesty, the mandates and the power of these bodies would have been unclear and the results obtained by the parliamentary committees had not been published.
The group said that in the last three weeks at least 90 persons have been arrested to prevent further demonstrations.
Skihang has been set up in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn a landmark in Bristol into a competition run.
The ski slope of this park event attracted 16 semiprofessional skiers and snowboarders who fought for money prizes.
On the top of the slope in the Brandon Hill Park there was a short jump at the beginning of a 100 meter long slope.
The student John Hickman, who studied medicine in the fourth year, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the slope, but it was also quite intimidating.
It is a great view with all the lights of the city that shine below.
He added: "There are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country here - some real talents."
Prizes were awarded for the best pieces of art or tricks executed on the slope.
After the event on Thursday night, the snow is left to melt.

Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters voted in favour of a ban on the construction of minarettes and the concern about the alleged Islamization of Europe is widespread, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote a well-founded and well-considered report on whether Muslims can be integrated into and integrated into one of the most clearly secularised societies in Europe.
Some readers will admire this new book for the author's last work: "Why the French don't love headscarves" (original title: "Why the French Don't Like Headscarves") (2006), an elegant and densely reasoning study of an issue that divided and occupied the country for over a decade and a half, and whose effects can still be seen today.
Bowen's latest book offers a more comprehensive and bold spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he not only wants to know what politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but also what is really happening in the field.
He spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now offer the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as it calls the Bowen "Islamic Free Spaces".
He is a good listener, he reflects debates between teachers and students about the questions they are most concerned about.
Should a Muslim marry (or both) in a mosque or town hall?
Should young Muslims be taught about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it permissible for a Muslim to use a interest-based banking system to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly proficient matters, he claims, that make up daily life, quite unlike the political dramas that occupy the media.
The author recognizes a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a well-known name, possibly with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, an Arab-Muslim scholar and academic born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open up the debate on how it is possible to be a good Muslim on the one hand and a good citizen in a modern secular society on the other.
They don't have all the arguments on their side.
The conservatives are suspicious of the idea of French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists polled by Bowen are mostly disunited with their Salafi counterparts ‚Äì advocates of purist Sunni Islam, which is associated with Saudi Arabia ‚Äì who nowadays show a small but influential presence among European Muslims.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But an agreement requires giving and taking on both sides.
He questions the extent to which French political decision-makers (and the intellectual elite who so passionately guard the separation of church and state) really feel committed to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may experience a harsher treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews who, in turn, had to make their historic compromise with secular Republicanism.
He recognizes a "enhancement of the value screws" rather than a growing pragmatism.
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one tends to say "Yes, but not yet".
The world‚Äôs most insolent view
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramaticly than any other environmental region on earth.
The ice that characterizes it melts with alarming speed and takes life with it, which nowhere else can survive.
Oil, gas, shipping and fisheries interests have recently entered open water, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors in their keel water.
Richard Ellis, an author and illustrator, draws a natural story of the icon of the north, the polar bear in "Auf thine Eis" (original title: "On Thin Ice").
In the complicated history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic researchers who proved themselves in hunting the polar bears.
Admiral Nelson's encounter with an polar bear as a brave 14-year-old fencing to the lake, who fought only with the rifle butt of his Muskete, is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bears caught swimming behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers were brought to zoos and circuses.
A circus performance at the beginning of the 20th century showed 75 polar bears at a performance.
Even today, zoo plants still typically still have a millionth of the life of a wild old animal. The climate is rarely suitable: the polar bear in Singapore became very green by the algae growing in the hollow hair of its fur.

Ellis refers to the reports of other authors and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters represent for the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, laying down in Greenland and Canada continues where hunters use powerful storm rifles in helicopters and motor-sleigh Inuit to get their prey on track.
Ironically, in the waters in the north of these two hunting nations, the ice will remain the longest.
In his new book "After the Ice" (original title "After the Ice") Alun Anderson, a former editor of the scientific journal "New Scientist", offers a clear and disturbing description of the Arctic's science and an exciting insight into how the future could develop.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of change.
But this is not due to a lack of explanation attempts.
The pioneer trips of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries were the first to imagine the confusion of the pack ice.
In the Cold War, submarines scaled the shifting ridges when they went down.
A useful addition are satellite measurements and the large-scale deployment of measuring probes on icebergs, but still much is achieved by fearless people camping outside in the cold.
Anderson takes a look at the strange, tiny world of the inflow system within the Arctic ice formed by saltwater cinnamons that are compressed together during freezing.
But, starting from the bear on the ice to the microscopic little wonders in the ice, all of them are threatened by the passing of the summer ice, which is expected between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months ... could this be us"
Marine infantry was among the 6,000 laid down in Arlington cranes
De'Angello Robinson, who had been free, traveled seven hours by bus to put a single wreath on the tomb of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marine infantryists who made the trip from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the National Cemetery in Arlington to decorate graves, the day was a tribute to the men and women in whose footsteps they stepped.
In a few months, from wherever we are brought back, we could be that, said Robinson about the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I would wish someone would do the same for me, so I try to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who had gathered on Saturday morning to lay cranes on the tombs of veterans in several sections of the Arlington cemetery.
Morrill Worcester, owner of the wreath manufacturer Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, founded this tradition in 1992 when he and some others decided to decorate several hundred graves at the cemetery in Arlington.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition and Morrill and his wife Karen, who make this journey every year, stop in different cities along the way to host events dedicated to the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which also extended the event to other states.
This year, volunteers laid more than 16,000 wreaths on the graves at the Arlington cemetery, in areas on the Pentagon, on graves of the National Cemetery Fayetteville in Arkansas, in the Battery Park in New York and at the memorial for the United Airlines 93 flight in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second time, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 for the purchase and transport of cranes.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster said she made the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a late professional soldier.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said, this is her way of giving back to those who have made sacrifices.
She said that this is a small contribution, how we civilians can support our soldiers.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Boxed in areas of warm clothing, the volunteers hiked across the extensive lawns and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers had the goal of older tombs from the 1st and 2nd World Wars and the Vietnam Wars, as they are not visited as often as the newer tombs, according to the organizers.
The mood was cheerful, children played and couples held their hands while carrying the fresh pine branches to the graying tombstones.
Each round wreath was dark green with a small red loop attached to the upper part.
Section 60, which is located nearby and where mainly veterans of the wars are buried in Iraq and Afghanistan, remained almost quiet.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 wreaths to decorate this section, but the gloomy mood of the current wars fulfilled this area.
Individuals cried openly, others prayed, and families and friends held to each other in the icy air.
Some read aloud the names carved in stone, while others bowed down to small black-and-white space cards, which had been placed for those in the damp mud whose tombstones had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who shed bitter tears before her son's grave.
She was driven for 8 hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the graveplace of naval infrateria deputy David Shane Spicer, who fell into battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free ..., my son paid for it, she said.
"If I haven't been in a long time, I want someone to remember him."
Supplier of the U.S. government of Cuban authorities arrested
The Cuban government has arrested a contractor of the U.S. government who sold mobile phones and notebook computers in the country, said representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for customers, such as USAID, the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular U.S. representatives in Havana are trying to gain access to the prisoner arrested on December 5.
The special charges have not yet been published, although according to Cuban law a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost everything, under the charge of "hazard".
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including light protests and critical writings, pose a risk of arrest.
Anti-governmental graffiti and statements are considered to be serious crime.
Cuba has a growing blogger community led by popular reporter Yoani S√°nchez, who often describes how she and her husband are persecuted and attacked by government representatives.
S√°nchez has repeatedly requested permission to leave the country to receive prices, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractor will probably increase the tensions between the Communist government of the Castro Brotherhood in Cuba and the Obama government, which had sought a "slow" approach to improving relations with the island.
The news of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times on Friday night.
The new US policy places emphasis on the fact that the United States will provide a return when the Cuban government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more room for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, although they are new and sought-after products in a country where the average earnings of a government employee are 15 dollars per month.
The Cuban government has only since this year allowed normal citizens to buy a mobile phone, they are used to send text messages, as a 15-minute phone call would cost a daily wage.
Internet use on the island is extremely limited.
It is available in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and at some government offices, such as universities.
Cubans who want to log in often have to report their names to the government.
Access is limited to many websites.
On Cuba, the arrest of an American is rare.
Most of the few U.S. citizens who are in prison in Cuba are sitting behind bars because of crimes such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berbena, the press spokesperson of the U.S. interest office in Havana.
Berbena said she couldn't give any further information on arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that would be legal in any other free society - the release of free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of the group "Human Rights Watch", which recently issued a hard report on freedom in Cuba entitled "New Castro, Same Cuba", an allusion to the establishment of Raul Castro as leader of the country replacing the sick older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the defendants would be arrested, sentenced and detained very often within one day.
He said that probably every solution would be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, especially when both countries move towards more dialogue.
Pakistani government representatives plan to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, Pakistani authorities discovered a alleged leading head of a conspiracy aimed at sending five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill US soldiers, and said they hoped that this case could help to detect an extensive network of terrorist seekers who are looking the Internet for radicalized young men.
Researchers said that they had been looking for an opaque insurrectionist, known as Saifullah, who had invited the men to Pakistan after he had found them because one of them had made comments on terrorist attacks on YouTube on the Internet video page.
Saifullah became the leader of these men after their arrival in Pakistan and tried to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt, which is the home of Al Kaida and his terrorist training camps.
But a representative of Pakistan's intelligence service, who was informed about the matter, said on Saturday, Saibullah could not convince the Al-Qaida leaders that the men are not part of a CIA conspiracy to inmigrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were held for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far away from the inhospitable mountains in the northwest, which have become a terrorist refuge.
They were considered part of a hidden operation.
Therefore, they were rejected, said the government official who wanted to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the matter.
The government official said that the men were by no means discouraged and continued to try to obtain the right recommendations to gain access to the Al-Qaida camps when they were arrested by the Pakistani penitentiary authorities.
The case of the five men - who are still in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI - underlines the decisive role of the recruiters in coordinating future terrorists and possibly even more important in deciding who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, US intelligence has made it a matter of utmost urgency to accommodate human assets within Al Kaida.
The recruiters of the organization act as gaters who do not let in those whose commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and those who could be spies.
American would-be recruits are subjected by A Kaida to a special test, said analysts.
However, due to their potential access to U.S. targets and their propaganda value, they are also considered to be extremely attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, the highest-ranking analyst of the NEFA Foundation based in the USA, said that in recent years terrorist groups have become much more cautious as to who they allow access to, because the US intelligence services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to include someone in these groups, what better way to go than to follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed?, says Kohlmann.
The model is now much more based on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of demonstrators call for climate action in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched here on Saturday through the streets and demanded from the negotiators in the Bella Congress Centre of the city bolder action in climate protection.
Demonstrations said that 100,000 people had joined the event, whereas police estimates amounted to more than 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists lit small explosives near some government buildings in the city center.
On one day, when the UN-funded climate negotiations saw little happen, thousands of activists migrated with banners through the city, on which "There is no planet B" and one in Spanish, which said "The Earth says "genug".
Some stars joined the protest, for example the Danish model, the photographer Helena Christensen, who said that the travels to Peru, the birthplace of her mother, make her aware of the heartbreaking problems the country has to face due to the already noticeable effects of climate change.
That is part of the reasons why I decided to take part in the great demonstration - to pass on the word and appeal to the world leaders to establish a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it has to be done now and there is no way around it anymore.
The police kept the demonstrators from getting too close to the Bella Centre and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because they were either masked or carried pocket knives.
Under Danish law, these actions are prohibited in the event of demonstrations.
According to one spectator who did not want to be mentioned as he was involved in the climate negotiations, masked demonstrators in black clothing fired several body bodies near the main channel in Copenhagen, near which there are several ministries.
They threw them near the buildings, he said, adding that they started as light rockets, but then they were followed by "a few big explosions".
Inside the Congress Centre, people gathered in front of television screens to follow the demonstration all afternoon.
But the protest has apparently not reached the consciousness of the main functionaries, such as Su Wie, China's chief climate negotiator.
When asked if he thought that the demonstration would have a constructive effect on international considerations, he replied in English: "This is something I wasn't aware of."
He then went on in Mandarin and said, "Because the venue is big, I can't hear what's happening outside."
He noted that it depended on the perspective of the individual whether the demonstration would harm or help.
It shows the concentration of the general public and different sectors on the issue of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they are disrupting the negotiations or the freedom of other people".
Test data show persistent racial gap
The testimonies of mathematics were welcome good news last week for the public schools in Washington D. C.
Although Washington District is still far behind the schools of the country, the testimonies show that the fourth and eighth graders have made faster progress in the past two years than cities that include Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
However, what is included in the latest figures of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is the persistent performance gap between African and White students, both at local and national level.
The average score of the white fourth graders from Washington D. C. rose in the last two years from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but their African American counterparts rose only by three points from 209 to 212.
The power gap actually rose from 53 points to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of African-American eight-year-olds basically remained the same, falling by a statistically negligible point from 245 to 244.
The average score of white students was not included in the test data, as the sample size was not large enough.
The picture over a six-year period is also not more encouraging.
The gap, which separated white and black fourth graders in 2003, when the first NAEP was recorded in this district, was 60 scale points (262 to 202).
And although the score reached by children from both groups has grown during this period, the difference has hardly decreased by 58 points.
Some educational advocates of the district expressed concern last week that the results, celebrated by Chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and the democratic mayor Adrian M. Fenty, were largely driven by white students, who are already powerful children anyway.
This suggests that we have raised the overall rating by treating those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, member of the board of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group who is committed to the equality of education in Washington D.C.
I am not jumping up and down for a span of two or three points, said democratic Washington City Councillor, Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth grade of the Eaton primary school.
Brown, a frequent critic of Rhee's management style, said that the message of the exam points is that the city's middle schools urgently need attention.
Of course, you always want to see the positive signs, I respect that.
But what scares me is that we don't spend nearly the time and energy we have to use for our middle school.
Rhee said the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of the weak students.
This autumn, for example, some teachers will be trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, which aims at pupils in primary and middle school, who have not mastered basic skills of reading at the beginning of their school career and who are significantly behind their old-fashioned classmates.
Everyday mathematics, a curriculum that focuses on games from kindergarten to sixth-class games and life-like experiences, was brought to Washington under the former senior school inspector Clifford Janey, and this curriculum is attributed to some of the NAEP progresses reported last week.
I believe that we must continue to work to benefit the best measures for students below the grade of grades, said Rhee.
Others say that the NAEP results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system while still providing the additional money and resources for the weak schools that are needed to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, professor of education at the University of California in Berkeley, who examines urban examination results.
The conventional remedy is to focus its resources and management reforms on schools located in the poorest areas of Washington D.C.
The objective could lead to political aftereffects that are working against this important item on the agenda.
The weak point, like other urban school inspectors, is of course that it tries to keep the white and black middle class.
Our focus is to ensure that we build a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the districts so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive excellent public education.
Janey, who is now a school inspector in Newark, said this week in an interview that one of the most important elements to close the performance gap is to extend the traditional public school year, which is currently 180 days in Washington, to compete with the charter schools.
One must increase the school year to about 200 days to have the power to change, said Janey, who reached an agreement with his teacher union last year about 185 days a year, which he considered to be a "mile" on the way to a greater increase in the next contract.
Higher education for more people than prospects for the future
The coach reaches the Gettysburg-College with a loud pipe.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, rises and blinks for a moment at the sight of the white columns, the brick facade and the emerald green lawn.
Graciela's parents barely graduated from high school in El Salvador.
Until recently Graciela, who was buried in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Their attitude and that of the other eight-year-olds of the group who explore Gettysburg, where the class costs $38,690 a year, was more of an awe - inspiring visitor than that of an enthusiastic future student.
"Yes! I'll be here soon!" said Graciela, who would like to study medicine when the leader announced that they had now entered the building for natural sciences.
"Wow, really?" she said thoughtfully when she was told the low professor-to-student ratio of the school.
The College in Pennsylvania was the 7th that the children visited on their three-day tour and now they have taken up the intended message completely: the question is not whether to go to college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is a growing concern over the large number of Hispanic immigrants born in the United States who do not end high school or become pregnant as a teenager, but on the other hand there are hundreds of thousands of people who receive college education necessary to get into the middle class.
In fact, one of five of the "second generation" of Hispanic Americans graduated from college ‚Äì which is a remarkable achievement because many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the US without having graduated from high school.
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because they show the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the country's labour force.
Those who examine powerful children say that these often have a natural affinity for the school and an indwelling drive for success.
Many of them also have parents who set their children high goals and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But consulting programs also play a major role in helping Graciela and millions of children like them to get to college, especially if these efforts continue for a longer time.
If you look at low-income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them find their way through the system, then a single measure will not solve the problem at any time, said Patricia G√°ndara, researcher at the University of California in Davis, who examined hispano-American students.
We need to think about providing these children with a supportive network from preschool to high school.
The federal program, which Gracielas College-Tour had financed, is a useful example.
It is known as GEAR UP - A gear up - and provides more than 300 million dollars a year for local school systems to start college preparation programs that start when low-income students are in high school and continue to run until they finish high school.
According to the U.S. Department of Education, the programme has helped more than 10 million students since 1999, more than 60% of whom have gone to college.
Iraqi oil ministry contracts with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has been able to restore its damaged infrastructure in two large oil companies, which were closed on Saturday.
The 10 contracts concluded with foreign oil companies by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are willing to play an important role in the renovation of the Iraqi oil industry, which has been paralyzed for decades by war and economic sanctions.
American companies could book only shares in two of the 10 auctioned fields for themselves.
Seven American companies had paid for participating in the second auction that started on Friday.
The only company that made a bid has pulled the shorter.
Two American companies were able to conclude contracts for fields auctioned in June.
The thinly sown representatives of American oil mult at the opening of the Iraqi oil industry surprised the analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after 6 years of war, and instead of US companies, Asian and Europeans set the path, said Ruba Husari, the editor of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service.
There will be no further offers in Iraq for a long time.
Security concerns, highlighted by massively coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability by the withdrawal of the US military, have probably prevented American oil companies, according to analysts, from becoming more involved in Iraq, which has the third-largest proven crude oil reserves in the world.
US companies were in some cases disadvantaged because competitors, especially the Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower wage costs and are more at risk because they do not have to account for shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies to conclude contracts with the Ministry.
Bigger US companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who have close relations with the Iraqi oil ministry and have been at the side of technical advice in recent years, have gone empty.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the contracts agreed this weekend.
The state of China National Petroleum Corporation has offered more contracts than any other company and has been able to go home with large packages of contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, the spokesperson of the oil ministry, Assam Jihad, said that China is on the way to becoming one of the world's largest economies as well as a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company can measure up to its competitors and fulfil its obligations to Iraq.
Companies pre-selected for the bid issued bids, which were then compared to the fee per barrel of oil that the Ministry was willing to pay to increase the emissions of each field beyond the current level.
Al Kaida's top planners apparently killed in Pakistan
In an obvious U.S. missile attack along the Pakistani border with Afghanistan, an Al Kaida's top-use planner is said to have been killed this week, according to U.S. anti-terrorism representatives on Friday.
This would, if it were confirmed, be the second deadly attack on a high responsible terrorist organisation this autumn.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani authorities, were killed by a number of rockets that hit their vehicle near the city of Miran Shah in the province of North-Waziristan on Tuesday.
Local authorities reported that the rockets were fired by a drone type used by the CIA in the lawless tribe belt of Pakistan.
They drove in a white vehicle towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, said a government representative of a Pakistani civilian intelligence service from Miran Shah by telephone.
Residents who were suspected of belonging to the militants ran to the place and quickly took on everything that was left of the "completely destroyed bodies".
The local authorities could not confirm the identity of the victims, but two representatives of the U.S. counter-terrorism led to certain evidence that Somalia was one of the dead.
Somali was described as the leading military planner of the Al Kaida, who led operations of terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was involved in conspiracys around the world, noticed a senior official who wanted to remain anonymous and pointed to the delicate character of the US air raids on Pakistani soil.
If you assume your central role, this included planning attacks against the US and Europe.
He took strategic instructions from the top leaders of Al Kaida and implemented them in operational planning for possible terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. government representative said that Somalia had risen rapidly in the Al-Qaida hierarchy and had best connections with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to some Americans, said the second government representative, but this certainly does not reduce the danger he posed to us and our allies.
If his death were confirmed, Somali would be the second leading Al Kaida or Taliban leader killed since September when a similar attack by Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant group in the tribal area and three other top activists were killed.
Since the summer, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, a web site operated by a non-profit organisation, the pace of attacks by CIA drones has dropped from an average of six operations per month to two.
The decline may be based on improved tactics of the terrorist groups that have taken steps to reduce their attackery while brutally killing suspected informants, the page reported.
Leader UN envoy in Kabul will resign
The UN's leading envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Aide, said on Friday that he would resign from his office in March, which would end a stormy term of office that was saddened by allegations of widespread corruption in the Afghan presidential election supported by the UN.
Eide's departure took place when the Obama government decided to send another 30,000 US soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said that he supported the increase in the troops, but he also expressed his concern that the US timetable for the military withdrawal, which is to begin in 18 months, could lead other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We must speed up the construction of Afghan security forces and thereby send the right signal to the Afghans that they can trust the international community, said Eide in a telephone interview from Kabul.
Engagement must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilians to help in the political transition of Afghanistan.
The military increase must correspond to an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Aide said that he did not leave his office, but only fulfilled an agreement to his family in March 2008 to stay in Kabul for only two years.
He said he wanted the notification to UNO
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon now so that he has time to make a replacement.
What I said is that he'd better start looking for a successor, said Eide.
When I got here, there was a two-month vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
Ban has started a search for a replacement according to UN representatives.
The UN representatives say that he has considered the Swedish-Italian-born Staffan di Mistura, who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad and the Frenchman Jean-Marie Gu√©henno, who previously led UN peace operations.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, charged him in September with preferring President Hamid Karzai in the presidential election in the country and concealing evidence of massive election fraud.
Eide rejected all accusations, but he also said that Galbraith's accusations - which were fired - "have undoubtedly harmed the mission because there was already a great deal of scepticism about the international interference in the election".
Eide said he recommended the appointment of a leading civilian representative to coordinate the aid measures of the American-led forces in Afghanistan.
He also insisted that the UN leadership allow its successor to recruit more staff from the United States and other Western countries who are donating for the Afghan mission and said that this would strengthen their confidence in the proper use of their money.
Eide expressed his disappointment at the limitation of his forces in Afghanistan and said that the cumbersome UN settings have undermined his ability to bring in capable people.
The UN rules are designed in such a way that since May, he said, only one person has been able to hire.
This is disastrous and must not go on that way.
US Defense Minister Gates: Iran must expect additional sanctions
Minister of Defense Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because he did not participate in discussions on his nuclear plans.
During a 7-day trip through the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, Gates spoke to a group of approximately 300 U.S. soldiers in northern Iraq and played down the prospect of a military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In Iran there are no good choices, he said in answer to a soldier's question about the likelihood of such a development.
"One of the things that lie on my soul is if we have learned something from Iraq in the last six years that is unpredictable to the war."
The Obama government is considering a sanction package aimed at the military and political elite of Iran, but Gates has announced that some sanctions may also affect the average Iranians.
He said that a "package of positive and negative incentives" is needed to "convinc the Iranian government that it is actually less protected with nuclear weapons" because "their people will suffer immensely" from the sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by Robert Gibbs, spokesperson of the White House, the American government joined the top European politicians in warning that Iran must expect "faithful" consequences if it does not meet the requirements of the UN Security Council and its nuclear monitoring organisation, the International Atomic Energy Authority.
Iran continues to claim that knowledge of nuclear technology should only be gained for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on 1 October Iran said that it would resume talks to limit its nuclear programme and refrain from a substantial part of its stock of enriched uranium in exchange for urgently needed nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor.
The US government has urged this kind of agreement to build confidence between the two parties and to gain time for negotiations.
But Iran seems to have left the negotiations on the provisional agreements since then -- partly, experts say, because the Iranian leadership disagrees on whether they should commit themselves to the United States.
That Iran has simply left the international community with regard to some of the proposals that they had already agreed to at the beginning of October, has openly said that the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, has brought together in a way that they have never been in connection with important additional sanctions for Iran, said Gates.
President Obama has set the 31st Dec. as a deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals before he will continue to pursue other options, including those once called "oppressive sanctions" by Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton.
In a New York opinion, Iranian representation at the United Nations condemned what they called on Thursday "unfounded and unfounded claims" by some Security Council members on Iranian nuclear activities and said they were willing to continue the talks with the United States and five other world powers "to achieve an appropriate long-term solution".
Gates, who was to return to Washington last Friday, met with the Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in the morning before flying to the oily Kurdish region in Iraq to meet the soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish authorities in Irbil.
The tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq continue to be high, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and the sharing of public revenue.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the conflict potential to prevent delays in US plans to reduce the American force force from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also tried to disperse the Kurdish concern about the forthcoming military withdrawal. US representatives quoted Gates, who said to Masud Barzani, president of the Kurdish regional government, "We will get your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a united Iraq.
We will not leave you."
A Change in Courses in Older China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that gave them lectures that "Mother Earth is too tired to entertain other children" and "A baby more means a grave".
These lessons they learned so well that when government officials in Shanghai, who suddenly started to change the course this summer through the low birth rate and the ageing population, and encouraged young couples to have more than one child, their answer was immediate and final: "Neither so."
We have already invested all our time and energy in a child.
For a second child there is nothing left, said Wang, 31, a staff manager with an 8-month old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, which has produced two generations of notablely thick, abandoned children, who are lovingly called "little emperors", a population crisis is emerging in the country.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple compared to 6 at the time this policy came into force, the UN
Population Issues Division, while the number of population aged 60 and over in 2020 is expected to rise from 16.7% of the population by 2050 to 31.1% of the population. This is well above the global average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is stronger in rich coastal cities with educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and olders accounted for almost 22 percent of Shanghai‚Äôs reported residents, while birth rates were below one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, head of the Shanghai Urban Population and Family Planning Commission, said that couples in the productive age need to have babies in order to "help reduce the ratio of the ageing population and reduce the labour shortage of the future".
Shanghai will soon be "as old -- but not as rich -- as the industrialized countries, like Japan and Sweden," she said.
A gradual relaxation
Ensuring in the country's Constitution in 1978, China's one-child struggle is probably the most controversial order introduced by the ruling Communist Party to date.
Couples who violate this policy have to expect enormous fines -- up to their three-fold annual salary in some regions -- and discrimination at their workplace.
Chinese representatives have attributed it to this policy that the critical demand of natural land resources could be avoided, whereas human rights representatives have condemned abuses in the enforcement of politics.
In rural regions some officials have forced pregnant women who have already had a child to quit.
Many couples also had sexual selective abortions, resulting in an unnaturally high relationship between men and women.
Over the last few years, government representatives for the population have gradually weakened their attitude towards one-child policy.
In 2004 they allowed more exceptions to the rule -- including city dwellers, members of ethnic minorities and cases where both husband and wife were single children -- and in 2007 the tone of many hard slogans was reduced.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the University of Beijing's Institute of Population Research, said that government representatives recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children in whom a partner is an individual child.
Shanghai became the first Chinese city in July to launch an aggressive campaign to promote more births.
Posters who taught families to have only one child were replaced almost overnight by guidelines describing in detail who would be in charge of a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city administration has sent out urban employees and volunteers for family planning to visit couples at home and to post information sheets under the doors.
She also asked to provide psychological and financial advice for those who have more than one child.
The reaction was not very encouraging, said family planning representatives.
Disappointing reaction
Although officials from a rural small town in Shanghai's outer areas said that a recovery in the applications of couples who want a second child after the start of the campaign, the urban districts do not report any change.
For example, only four to five applications are still received per month for the Huinan municipality with a population of 115,000.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that despite the campaign, the expected number of births in the city for 2010 will still be around 165,000 -- slightly higher than 2009, but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of the Shanghai community of Caolu, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don't want to have children anymore.
They want to give her the best, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that they would like to have two children and that this would be permitted by law.
But they have, like many Chinese people, only a minor health and life insurance of the government.
Without a social network, they say, this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West falsify the one-child policy as a human rights issue, said Yang, a civil engineer whose wife is pregnant with her first child in the seventh month.
Yes, we are deprived of the opportunity to have more than one child.
The problem is not simply a policy.
The problem is money.
Other couples give psychological reasons for their reluctance.
Wang, the head of staff, said she only wanted one child because she was also an individual child. "We were the focus of the family and used to everyone taking care of us.
We are not used to taking care of others, nor do we really want to."
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old who owns a translation company, said it more unmistakably.
For parents from the middle class with double careers, through which the birth rate drops, he said, it is about to be successful and for that one must be selfish.
The age group of today's 20- to 39-year-olds grew up to see their parents fighting during the early days of the Chinese capitalism experiment and they don't want such a life for themselves, he said.
A single child, he said, also places enormous demands on the time of parents.
A mother must give up her social life for at least two years.
Then there's the space question -- "You have to remodel your apartment" -- and the life plan -- "When the child is 9 months old, you have to already have a curriculum for the best preschools."
Most of his friends are ready to go through this once, Chen said, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to achieve a higher standard of living, he said.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
UNO Group drafts emission reduction plan
The UN-funded climate conference, which has so far been characterised by wild poses and mutual accusations, again focused on Friday with the publication of a document that sets out for the next 40 years an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gases, with industrial nations having to learn the biggest burdens in the near future.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement on greenhouse gas regulation, has shown both the remaining obstacles and the way forward.
But he was considered to be an important progress in a negotiation that is about to take place, since next week more than 100 top politicians from all over the world will arrive in Copenhagen.
The text, formulated by a specially created UN working group, is silent about the amount of money that rich countries should give to the poor countries so that they can cope with global warming in the short and long term.
It also offers a range of key options, including how industrial and large emerging countries can limit their carbon emissions and how high the global temperature increase should be, which policy-makers would contribute.
The process is given great flexibility, says John Coequyt, executive representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who designed the six-page document, has summarized a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the leading UN climate protection representative, Yvo de Boer, called "the big whole".
It shows the outline of a possible agreement in which industrial nations would jointly reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by 2020, compared to the 1990 limit values, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent in the same period.
Together, countries could reduce emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Community has also given the Friday talks a boost by its assurance that over the next three years it will provide 3.6 billion US dollars per year to help poorer countries adapt to the effects of climate change - from mastering floods and droughts to avoiding deforestation.
Friday nevertheless brought the same verbal fireworks that had determined the discussions last week.
The American climate specialist Todd Stern has rejected formulations requiring binding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialised countries, compared with voluntary reductions for larger emerging countries, if these are not financed by the industrial nations.
This move announced that the Obama government is driving a harder line with China than the Bush government did not even two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without larger emerging economies standing up and taking action, said Star, who also complained that the text would not go far enough to ensure that the reductions could also be confirmed by outsiders.
Stern gave his opinion an hour after the Chinese Vice-President He Yafei declared that the leading American climate negotiator was either lacking in "reason" or it was "very irresponsible" of him that he said at the beginning of the week that the United States would not help China effectively to master global warming.
The future economic march towards the world's major powers has opened up between industrial nations as well as between industrial nations and emerging economies.
The current struggle relates equally to the rescue of individual economies, as well as to the rescue of the planet, with China and the United States concerned due to their corresponding commitments, while poorer countries claim that the two dozen most influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take more courageous measures.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the large powers are fighting for those who should bear the cost of brakes on greenhouse gas emissions, since even affected countries have taken a more aggressive approach to making the countries with very high greenhouse gas emissions account for their actions.
This is clearly a game from which a new economic domination will develop, says Ulate, who is also a regional climate change consultant for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries most exposed to the effects of climate change stated that they would continue to fight for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although the leading participants say that the talks will lead to a political agreement at best.
The alliance of the small island states with 43 members presented a draft contract of 24 pages in the early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the offensive of the small island states "is exerting political pressure on the entire political process," partly because they are now united and demand action from emerging countries, such as China and India.
The talks were given a new urgency when delegates focused on the fact that most of the open questions still need to be resolved before the leaders arrived to reach an agreement.
High-ranking representatives, such as the Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister, fled their planes and raced through the steps of the Bella Center to meet behind closed doors and press conferences to complete claims negotiated during the next week.
The pure extent of the assembly -- 13,000 people go to and out in the Congress Centre every day, guitar-playing activists organise nocturnal shows in which they make fun of the countries they think are betraying and selling, and contract drafts are passed on by hand rather than by e-mail -- is already a challenge.
The intensity is just beginning to build up: almost all the important ministers are here now and from Wednesday 60 leaders will be in Copenhagen.
We come to the Upper League, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice-President of the Global Policy of the Organization Conservation International.
The heavy weights are coming.
Great Britain's first 225 km/h faster train defines the Monday feeling
On Monday morning at 5 p.m., a pipe will penetrate the darkness to announce a train departure, which is a revolution in traffic in the UK.
The first high-speed dispenser train in the country will be reached on its flash drive from Ashfort, Kent, to London St. Pancras 225 km/h and will travel 93 km in 38 minutes.
At Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, Lady Kelly Holmes will then board the first Javelin Pendler Service from London.
He hopes that the new UK service will eventually connect to an international rail network for faster, reliable trains and connect the large conurbations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could become vibrant congested cities, working hours would be radically reduced, and the change from plane and car to rail would reduce national carbon emissions and congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three major parties believe in this vision.
But the many billions of British pounds needed for the construction of a new national rail network could still brake the inevitable planning battle and fears about environmental damage in British high-speed railways.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company founded in January to present a feasibility study to the government, says Lord Adonis will present the report on December 30.
This gives it a detailed route map of the next planned level of the high-speed rail network.
The new railway line, which will connect London with the West Midlands, will pass through urban areas and places where the impact on the environment is controversial, with a span of five metres.
In the free terrain, the plan will show the concept within a distance of 25 meters from the final route.
HS2 is also intended to create three options for a larger, northward leading high-speed rail network.
Lord Adonis will respond to it in spring.
The preferred option is a Y-shaped route where a single high-speed track would lead to the West Midlands.
The route would be divided in or near Birmingham and a branch would lead west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another towards Northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the best working option," said a railway insider.
After completion, the travel time between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first section, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow travellers to travel the line London-Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to today just over an hour.
The drafts offer trains the opportunity to drive at a speed of 400 km/h, which would make the British rail network the fastest in Europe.
The first route was planned in such a way that 400 metres of trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 people can travel on it.
Up to 18 trains could be in operation per hour on the line London-Birmingham.
This would, in turn, mean that in London a terminal would be needed, on which 20,000 travellers could be shipped per hour.
Given the spatial constraints in the capital, it is expected that an existing station would be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Railway experts say that only St. Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether this plan should be continued or not, but the lengthy public consultation and planning measures mean that a final decision will only be taken after the parliamentary elections.
But even if it sets the wheels in motion, the rail network has to be built in sections.
The trains would first have to switch from high-speed trains to existing railways in northern Birmingham, which would continue to mean that the journey time between London and Scotland would be more than three hours.
This is considered to be a crucial crack so that a change from plane to train can be ensured, a guide for the rail revolution.
Tax payable on mortgages for 75,000 pounds of orangery of a conservative
Alan Duncan, the leading sub-house member of the Conservatives, has charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orangery he had built in his constituency residence.
The prison spokesman of the party, who was degraded by David Cameron because he complained about having to live underhouse members "of lean rations", increased his mortgage by 75,000 pounds in order to have an oak-wood-work plant grown on his second house in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge the taxpayer the additional interest income, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
At the time, the Vice-Presidents of the House approved the applications and were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who carried out a review of the expenditure of the House members. Last night, Duncan said that the applications could not have been "more clean or understandable".
Duncan, one of the richest sub-house members, has a two-storey house in a village in his constituency Rutland and Melton.
Nearby houses have achieved a purchase price of almost one million pounds (1.1 million euros).
The ground floor includes kitchen, living and dining room, but the Fees Office, an expenditure control center of the lower house, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year he built a winter garden called "Orangery" in the plans.
Neighbors described him as a "glasshouse for entertainment".
Duncan was also not asked to comment on the increase in money during a recent examination of his previous mortgage contracts by the Committee on Standards and Privilegies.
The Committee acquitted it last month after examining its expenditure from breaking the rules.
In 2004, Duncan transferred the security for a mortgage over ¬£271.406 (EUR300,000) from his London house to his constituency house, which he had bought in 1991, one year before his election to parliament.
This week's documents show that by March last year, Duncan received a refund of approximately 1,400 pounds (EUR 1 500) per month as mortgage interest.
In April his claims increased to more than 1,800 pounds (2,000 euros) per month.
The interest rate of Duncan's RBS mortgage has not changed during this period, which suggests that the total increase was used to finance the cash uptake of 75,000 pounds (85,000 euros).
The normal steady RBS mortgage rate fell from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March of this year, where it is still standing.
The latest documents published by the Unterhaus show that Duncan continued to assert its right to 1,250 pounds (1,400 euros) per month this May.
Duncan lost his post as opposition leader of the House in September, after an undercover reporter filmed him when he said after the spending scandal that members of the House would live "from leaner rationale".
"In essence, it means working for the state, having to live by leaner rations and being treated like S*****e."
He said, "I have spent my money on my garden, and I am entitled to a small portion that goes away, measured by what is heard.
And I could have demanded the whole damn sum, but I'm not doing it."
The Member of Parliament, millionaire from his former career as a wholesaler of oil, was attacked for his first time in May because of his expenses when it became clear that he had requested thousands of pounds for his garden before he had cleared with the Fees Office that this could be considered "exaggerated demand".
As a protest in Duncan's lawn, an activist dug a hole in the form of a pound mark after it became known that he had claimed 4,000 pounds (4,500 euros) over three years.
When he was questioned about the increased mortgage last night, Duncan said, "This was approved by both the Fees Office and the following by Legg for the increase in value."
He added: "There is no debate about evasiveness or slinging or bending the rules or the like.
Everything is perfectly manageable and moves strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It could not be cleaner and clearer at all."
Come all of you believers to admire Brighton's beach cottage adventure calendar
Beach huts in Brighton have found a new life content for the winter months as an interactive Advent calendar.
"Beyond", an alternative church group that stimulates spiritual discoveries through creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their huts for every December day with Christmas songs as a theme.
The event started on 1 December and visitors were allowed to watch the latest hut every day from 17:30 to 18:30 with free light wine and traditional Mince Pies, pastries filled with dried fruits.
The Christmas songs selected so far are "I saw three ships", "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The first No√´l", where the hut decoration is the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an volunteer clergyman of the Chichester diocese and head of Beyond.
He said, "We want to make religion more important to people in a post-Christian society.
Why do we as a church expect people to come to a strange old building? I think the church should go to the people and organize enthusiastic celebrations.
The idea of the beach cottage adventure calendar began as a conversation with some friends at dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastic creative and lively place and we try to express this through our spirituality."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world for the climate.
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated on Saturdays and in Copenhagen to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against climate warming, where the police have made several hundred arrests.
At least thirty thousand people, according to the police, hundreds of thousands according to the organizers, are marching in the cold of the Danish capital, on the verge of the United Nations Climate Change Conference, which should lead to a finale that could enter into force from 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish chairman of the Climate Conference, increasing world mobilization for the climate contributes to what is illustrated by these demonstrations that the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen would be very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital took place a short time after the train passed, when a group of 300 demonstrators, dressed in black, smashed the windows with paving stones and hammers, found a journalist of the AFP.
Anti-unrest police immediately and without regard, intervened.
The police have announced that 600 to 700 people, according to their assessment mainly members of the Blacks Blocs, were arrested in the east of France, in April, of these extremely violent splinter groups, which have already made themselves famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, has been arrested the conditions under which hundreds of militant followers were "without distinction", severely criticized, and has underlined that about one hundred of you "were always held in the streets on Saturday evening," despite the extreme cold with handcuffs and in seat position.
The rather peaceful move has been made by Parliament towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 metres from the building without trying to get in.
A stage was installed to welcome the intended speakers for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of former South African archbishop Desmond Tutu.
Most of the demonstrators have traveled with fines and trains from the major European cities, but also many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, as well as some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most of you with sky blue raincoats, have made a first run in Copenhagen in the morning, as you have followed the call of the Earth's friends to form "blue tides" for the "climate justice".
Today we go to the streets to demand a restitution of the ecological debt in favour of the south, explained Lidy Nacpil, filippinian activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't go on like this and say: we have time, said Angelique Kidjo, singer from Benin.
There are rivers in Africa that dry out, watercourses where you can walk, as it has never been in the past.
For the first time in the history of climatic diplomacy, founded in 1992 with the adoption of the UN agreement, the movement of globalisation critics has approached environmental organisations.
European representative Jos√© Bov√©, the form of globalisation critic, announced that he came to Copenhagen to link "climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no difference between the fight against climate warming and the struggle for another world."
The Asia-Pacific area, where there are many islands that are particularly endangered as a result of warming, has given the launch shot for the demonstrations.
Some 50,000 people have gone to the streets, according to the organizers in Australia.
In Manila there were several hundreds of people, mostly students who marched in red and hoisted bandanas in which you celebrated the solar energy.
In Hong Kong or in Djakarta, but also in Canada, a number of hundred protesters took place to demand an energetic approach to climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organised by the network "350" gathered several hundred people, namely in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
Some people have gathered in Geneva.
The separatist Abkhazia has elected his president, Georgia is demonstrating that this is a "stretched" thing.
Abkhazia has elected his president on Saturday, this happened a little more than a year after Moscow had recognized this pro-Russian separatist Georgian area as independent, Tbilissi defied the "land".
About 131,000 people were called to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgian war of August 2008 for control of the South-Ossetian area, another Georgian secessionist area recognized by Russia.
The polls closed at 5 p.m. GMT.
Electoral participation was about 58% some hours before the election, according to the Abkhaz Electoral Commission.
The first preliminary results should be announced during the night from Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including the previous president, Serguei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemns the election.
These elections are a farce.
On the other hand, the Georgian President, Mikheil Saakachvili, regrets that Abkhazia is now under Russian-backed total occupation, has declared his press spokesperson, Manana Manjgaladze.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this area with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world sees it as part of Georgia, which is illegally occupied by Russia.
After it had separated itself from Georgia during the 1992 - 1993 conflict, with several thousand people dying, Abkhazia wishes to prove through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, a new era, as an independent state, has explained Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claims to have chosen Mr. Bagapch.
She was one of the electors who went to vote in an election room located in a school in the capital Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful landscapes on the black sea.
Large signs on which Bagapch can be seen on the side of the Russian President and the Head of Government, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are located everywhere in this small area that has 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, which is located in the east of the country, the head of the district, Beslan Archba, has prepared a warm welcome to the Russian representatives who have come to monitor the election.
We, the Abkhaz people, are grateful, he said at a small celebration as an allusion to Moscow's support, especially with regard to the decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, said Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament and raised a glass of vodka.
The opposition on its part, represented by the former Vice-President and two Russian businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticized the agreements made with Moscow in the previous year, as the one in which Abkhazia left Russia the control of the railway for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banba, claims neither to support the current government nor the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is necessary to win the election.
If none of the candidates reach this limit, a second round of elections must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: Demos worldwide, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated all over the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding contract from the Kaufhagen Climate Conference, where the police, ready to use at any time, arrested about 700 people on the brink of an important demonstration.
Thirty thousand people according to the police, hundreds of thousands according to the organizers have demonstrated in the afternoon colds in the Danish capital, which receives delegates from 193 countries from 193 until December 18, which are looking for an agreement to enter into force on January 1, 2013.
From Parliament, the peaceful train marched towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations take place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the center and did not attempt to penetrate.
A stage was set up to welcome the intended speakers for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of former South African archbishop Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the train had passed, a group of demonstrators who were completely dressed in black and were armed with bricks and hammers began to punche disks, noted a AFP journalist.
Anti-unrest police immediately circled you and have intervened without regard by throwing some of you on the floor.
The police announced that 600 to 700 people were arrested and made it clear that they were mainly members of the Blacks Blocs, these extremely violent splinter groups, who had already made themselves famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
Towards the evening, a police officer was injured by a patchstone during the incidents where, according to police, about twenty persons were temporarily arrested. Four vehicles burned near a occupied house.
"We have the extreme groups under control," said Henrik Jakobsen, spokesperson of the police, while the helicopters of the forces of the order were creaking in the air.
Most demonstrators arriving by train or by private vehicle from German cities, from London, Amsterdam or Milan were Europeans.
However, there were also many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, and Africans.
Almost 3,000 people, mostly in the sky blue raincoat, formed in the morning in Copenhagen after the call of the "Friends of the Earth" to a first group, which should represent the "blue seas" for "climate justice".
"Today we are going to the street to demand that the ecological debts be repaid to the people of the south," said activist Lidy Nacpil of the Jubilee South Coalition of the Philippines in Copenhagen.
"We can't say we still have time," says singer Ang√©lique Kidjo from Benin.
"In Africa, there are rivers that devastate, there are watercourses through which you can walk, which was never the case before."
The first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was launched in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalist movement has approached environmental organisations.
The French MP of the European Parliament and globalisation critic Jos√© Bov√©, told AFP that he had come to Copenhagen to "connect climate justice and social justice." "Today, there is no difference between the fight against global warming and the struggle for another world."
The Oxfam organization has mobilized several personalities, such as the Danish Model Helena Christian or the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, who addresses the masses.
The Asia-Pacific region, where many islands are particularly vulnerable to global warming, has given rise to demonstrations.
In Australia, according to the organizers, about 50,000 people went to the streets.
In Manila several hundred people, in which most students, dressed red with Bandanas, have made advertising in front of the city administration of the Philippine capital for the solar energy.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, hundreds of demonstrators have also gathered in an action against climate change.
In France several hundred people joined together during the demonstrations organised by the 350 network, especially in Paris, Marseille in the south, Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the west and Lyons in the east.
Several people gathered in Geneva.
According to Chatel, subjects of geography and history emerge from the school reform of Lyc√©en.
In an interview published in the Sunday newspaper "Journal du dimanche", National Minister of Education Luc Chatel stated that subjects of geography and history are strengthened by the school reform of Lyc√©en, even if they are not required in the terminals (12th year).
"The pupils of the Premi√®re (11th year of school) now have every four hours of the week and the same program," says Mr. Chatel.
For the minister, "this hypocrisy must be overcome", because according to him, "the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile", but generally a concentration "the best student."
"The economic and social profile and the literary profile (ES and L) must not become a sub-profile of the scientific," he continued. He underlined: "I have not yet heard many historians and intellectuals who would have outraged themselves about the lack of historical-geographical education in the terminals on technical lycees."
On Saturday, an IFOP survey published in the Humanitarian revealed that nearly seven out of ten French (69%) criticised the government project of the abolition of compulsory education in history and geography in terminals S (12th school year with scientific profile). Many teachers and intellectuals also complained about this project, as well as the left and some representatives of the rights.
The Minister replied that there would be no question of limiting the philosophy of the Terminals Programme.
Luc Chatel also defended the educational reform for teachers, while 16 organisations (students and trade unions) had called for a protest on Tuesday against the project, which, in their opinion, is a victim of the pedagogical training of future teachers.
The Minister stated that at the beginning of the year they were subject to a professional qualification examination and at the end of the year an admission examination, in which their teaching skills were examined.
In addition, they conduct internships during the year in the M2 and then teach a year before the students as teachers in the internship.
He continued: "If you add all the internships offered before the performance check, you will reach more hours you have spent before the students, i.e. more than 300 hours."
Finally, the minister stated that he wanted to offer "the individual right to education" - a "thing that does not exist in folk formation."
He confirmed that he would like to abolish the school card "until 2012.
15 minutes for the climate at the "Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure"
Fifteen minutes to talk about the commitment at the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, had to face on Saturday morning at the Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure in Rue d'Ulm in Paris.
As a journalist of AFP noted, Nobel Peace Prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, at which experts each address the audience for fifteen minutes with filmed contributions.
You want to do something to reach people and make them feel like learning more, said Edouard Hannezo, 22 years old and one of the organizers of this day, on the verge of the conference. The name of this event goes back to the name that the students have given to the fish in the basin of the school.
"Among the experts, about twenty discussion participants have been selected, even after their charisma," he explains.
"For climate warming you can talk for hours, but the core goals can also be explained in a few minutes," said Jean Jouzel of AFP, who spoke only with the help of films before about 50 people.
"That's part of our role as a scientist," he stressed in the hope that the audience might learn from the fact that "the Copenhagen Conference is based on an absolutely serious scientific dossier."
The videos filmed by these conferences will be available online on the page of the school from 15 December.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February and will take place every two months thereafter.
Delay of payment : angry prison guards, actions planned
On Friday, the unions of impunity officers called for a general day of action to ensure that the premiums and overtimes, which were postponed for budget reasons by January, were transferred before the Christmas holidays.
The Second Trade Union of Penitentiary Officers (FO-P√©nitentiaire) called on the staff who have no service to demonstrate and block before the Detention Centre on Tuesday morning, in order to draw attention to the "theft of what is to be done to them".
The Third Trade Union of Penitentiaries ("CGT-P√©nitentiaire") called for "to unite into a strong mobilization in the various prisons", on which the non-payment of the overtimes, night surcharges and the Sunday and holiday surcharges in December will be burned as "damage and unacceptable".
The first union of prison officials, the Autonomous Federal Detention Centre Union (UFAP/UNSA), called for "general mobilizations ... to show discontent and anger."
The management of the detention centre and the Ministry of Justice stated that the overtime in 2009 had increased significantly and not all were foreseen in the budget. However, they guarantee that the remaining claims will be paid in January.
As reported by the Ministry of Justice in the evening, Mich√®le Alliot-Marie sent a letter to the unions of the law enforcement officers guaranteeing that the payment will be made next month.
"I am well aware of the staff's efforts to maintain and modernise our system of punishment," the Minister of Justice says in this letter.
"I have instructed the management of the detention centre to take immediate action so that such a situation, which has arisen due to the lack of assessment of the overtime, will not be repeated in the future," added Ms. Alliot-Marie.
The december wage is therefore poorer, except for the management staff who benefit from high service and target premiums, the UFAP/UNSA explains for which the "budget constraints" have to meet.
"This is an absolute scandal," indignants the interregional trade union FO in Marseille and announces to boycott "all assemblies and convocations" up to new instructions.
"The staff will not go to work on Sundays and holidays when the hours of October in December are still not paid. This also applies to their overtime," also threatens the FO Rh√¥ne-Alpes-Auvergne.
"In a time when more and more tasks are being imposed on us without more staff being recruited, the attempt to enrich the staff's funds is more than inappropriate," said the Bordeaux CGT trade union.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, and some are less affected than others.
In any case, however, it is wrong, notes the Secretary-General of the UFAP, Jean-Fran√ßois Forget.
Obama believes he always distributes better gifts than he gets himself.
The American president, Barack Obama, who will spend Christmas with his family in the White House for the first time, has looted at the TV talkmaster Oprah Winfrey that he always distributes better gifts than he gets himself.
On a special show, which was broadcasted via the ABC channel on Sunday evening, the president and his wife Michelle gave insight into how they will spend the holidays in their new illustrative home.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family, will be part of the game.
"Santa Claus also loves Bo," affirms Michelle Obama, adding that the dog of course also receives a gift.
Michelle Obama decidedly rejected her husband's claims on the quality of the gifts. "I made you beautiful gifts last year," she nodds the president.
"Well, please," he summoned her and pointed out to the First Lady's pearl chain: "And who gave you these?"
During this one-hour broadcast in a casual atmosphere with the well-known television presenter, who had supported Barack Obama so vehemently during his election campaign, the president and his wife also talked about gifts that she loved most as a child.
Barack Obama recalled a ten-course bicycle and also a basketball that his father, whom he saw very rarely, had brought to him at Christmas from Kenya.
"I remember when my father visited us once and brought me a basketball," said the president.
"Not until much later in my life did I understand that I had this ball from him."
The First Lady, in turn, remembered her doll house.
"I didn't know how to arrange the furniture in a house at all, so I put them all on the wall instead of grouping them around the fireplace, but I loved this little doll house," Michelle Obama said.
Johnny Hallyday re-operates, RTL confirms that he was put into the artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was again operated on in Los Angeles because of significant "damage" after surgery in France. According to the people surrounding him, the situation was "under control", although RTL confirmed that the singer was put into artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock musician was re-operated on the night of Wednesday to Thursday at the Cedars-Sina√Ø Hospital in Los Angeles, after the American doctors had found "damage due to the operation of a disc disc incident" he had suffered in Paris on November 26, according to his production company in Paris, which added that these damage would have required a new operation.
Nevertheless, the singer's production firm wanted to clarify that the situation was "controlled" and announced that a new medical opinion would be available no later than 48 hours.
However, according to RTL, the partner during the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday was put into an artificial coma to avoid "smarts and complications".
It was only after 48 hours, however, that a little more certainty was added to the patient‚Äôs condition when he opened his eyes.
On request of the AFP there was neither a confirmation nor a comment by the production company.
RTL also confirms that "from certain sources" that after its first operation in Paris "no pressure" was laid.
The rocker had been operated on in the international clinic of Parc Monceau because of a disc incident.
The surgery planned for several days was performed by neurosurgeon St√©phane Delajoux, a well-known doctor who had already treated many stars.
This was not available for comments to RTL on Thursday evening.
After Johnny Hallyday's surgery, the singer was delivered on Monday at the Cedars-Sina√Ø Hospital in Los Angeles due to a follow-up infection after the procedure.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, who is very close to Johnny Hallyday, thought to RTL on Thursday that his friend was just going through a "deep valley". However, he assured him that "no worries" were needed to make the rock musician because he was "a good fighter".
"He called me before he left for Los Angeles. I told him that it was nonsense to be on a plane for twelve hours after such an operation," said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening the producer of the singer, Jean-Claude Camus, confirmed that Johnny Hallyday "reacts well to antibiotics" and that "infection is contained".
Mr. Camus also said that he had spoken to Laeticia, the singer's wife, and he had not felt any particular concern.
Nevertheless, the concern for the singer's health had increased ever since he was hospitalized in July nine days after he crashed on his yacht.
Two months later, to the general amazement, it was said that Johnny Hallyday had a "small intestinal cancer surgery", which resulted in a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer recorded his long "Tour 66" as a farewell tour.
Since then, however, every health problem has been extensively commented on. Fans and journalists have not missed the fact that the singer on stage had difficulty moving.
It was not until mid-November that the people surrounding him had to re-dement into the hospital.
Euro-2009/Shortway: First place for Bousquet over its favorite distance
On Thursday, the Frenchman Fr√©d√©rick Bousquet, triple medal winner at the 2009 World Championships, won an international title on his favorite distance, 50m freestyle, at the Euro-2009 in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition, on which the polyurethane suits were allowed for the last time, there were only three world records, while a real record flood was expected.
A record was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verrazto over 4 x 200 m locations and the two others by Russia at 4 x 50m locations of the men.
Shame for Bousquet, who wanted to catch the 50m freestyle after the world record, whose record he held in the large basin (20.94).
In one of the two royal distances in swimming, 50m freestyle, 28-year-old Frenchman claimed himself in 20.53 sec. in a finale with ten swimmers at the start (usually there are eight) - a premiere at international level.
Bousquet defeated the Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but he failed to break the world record (20.30) as planned.
"You can believe in ever bigger, and in the present case I have said, when the world record is in my reach, I will try."
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers started in polyurethane suits, which are banned from 1 January 2010.
With 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations end their Epos in Istanbul, which began in 1999 at the same competition for the first time.
The use of the combination has not paid off this time for the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in the basin this summer in Rome and world record.
The young swimmer has failed to improve his best time over 400m freestyle (3:32.77), yet with the second best time in his career (3:34.55), in front of Russian Nikita Lobsev (3:35.75) and Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
"I didn't give everything this time.
I knew I couldn't win a world record today, but I defended my title and fulfilled my task."
"Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future," said Biedermann.
USA : Tomb plate at Zola estimated at 1.5 million US dollars
A Roman tomb, which appeared only with French writer Emile Zola, was estimated to be worth 1.5 million US dollars on Thursday, according to Sotheby's art dealer.
This plate is two meters long and 63 cm high. It dates back to the IIIrd century AD and has always been rated with 150,000 to 250,000 dollars.
The marble, on which "four scenes of Dionysos are represented in a sophistic architectural d√©cor, surrounded by satyren and baccus figures, is a rare piece. There are only four or five of them in the world," said Florent Heintz, Vice-President for the auction of Roman and Egyptian antiques at Sotheby's, on Tuesday to the AFP.
It was sold among hundreds of pieces.
"The sale is still in progress, but this part is certainly the one for which the buyers have so far offered the most," says Sotheby's spokesperson, Dan Abernethy, to the AFP.
The discovery of this acquisition of marble by Emile Zola goes far back.
The record was at home in Rome for almost 300 years in the famous collection of the Borghese family, after which she appeared piece by piece with the French actress C√©cile Sorel, who was used in her bathroom of her Parisian hotel and with Paul Reynaud, Minister in the III French Republic and President of the Council before Marshal P√©tain came to power.
The next fifty years are in the dark.
When searching the Louvre database, Florent Heintz discovered that this record was part of an "inheritance of Emile Zola" which was opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of the "Th√©r√®se Raquin" and the fresco "Rougon-Macquart".
Zelaya's exit attempt from Honduras towards Mexico has been destroyed
On Thursday, Mexico declared the conditions for the transfer of the overthrown Honduran President Manuel Zelaya on domestic ground to be no longer compatible after this guide had been rejected as unacceptable by the coup government.
After a telephone conversation with President Zelaya at night, everything seems to suggest that one disagrees on the possibilities of carrying out this transfer, said the Mexican Minister for Foreign Affairs Patricia Espinosa.
According to the immigration authority, the aircraft provided by the Mexican government, which arrived in Salvador on Wednesday for the purpose of transfer to M. Zelayas, had returned to its destination.
The coup government wanted M. Zelaya to "resign" and asked him for political asylum abroad.
However, the crashing president refused to do so, wishing to return to Mexico as the welcomer, the head of state.
The coup regime "has suffered a further failure by trying to move me to give up at my expense (...), they wanted me to resign," said Mr. Zelaya to Radio Globo on Thursday, in which he has often spoken since the beginning of the political crisis that has lasted in the Central American country for five months.
I can stay here well and gladly for ten years, here I have my guitar, added the crashing President who had fled to the Brazilian Embassy of Tegucigalpa two and a half months ago, with attacks on some chords.
The Mexican Embassy has sent us a request for guidance, but unfortunately we cannot accept it, as it does not include a request for asylum, on Wednesday Oscar Raul Matute, Minister of Interior of the Putch Government, had explained to the Honduran Radio HRN.
I did not seek asylum in any country at all, Manuel Zelaya had answered in an interview with the Telesur Channel, whose seat is in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras, he had underlined, would only take him as President of the Honduran people.
On Wednesday, the rumors for an exit from M. Zelayas had mobilized the followers of the fallen President who had opened up to the Brazilian Embassy and gathered around them, and the military there had strengthened its efforts.
The Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the position of the coup government.
This, according to his assessment, revealed the marginal nature of this government in the light of international standards.
Zelaya, who had approached the socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, had been overthrown on 28 June, on the day of the referendum he organised to prepare his reelection, against the advice of the Supreme Court, the Army and Congress.
From his exile in Costa Rica, he had returned surprisingly on September 21st and had fled to the Brazilian Embassy.
If he leaves, he will be arrested for high treason, which he is accused of by the justice, according to the coup government.
Putsch President Roberto Micheletti succeeded in organizing a presidential election on 29 November to replace M. Zelaya.
In the course of the controversial election, Porfirio Lobo was recognized by the United States, but was rejected by the Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, the Cogress voted massively against M. Zelaya's return to office until the end of his mandate on 27 January.
Wall Street in recovery, the US trade balance nourishes optimism
The New York Stock Exchange concluded on Thursday with a high figure, the figures of the US trade balance show a recovery of the United States' shares and their partners: the Dow Jones has increased by 0.67%, the Nasdaq by 0.33%.
According to the figures for the closing of the stock exchange, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has increased from 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points, the Nasdaq, which is dominated by technology, from 7.13 points to 2.190.06 points.
The extended Standard & Poor's 500 index has been written at 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1.102.35 points.
There are good news from various industries, Lindsey Pigegza judged by FTN Financial.
However, this remains anecdotal under the premise that the market is focused only on "half-full glasses", so it was moderated.
According to Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are mainly focused on the figures of the US trade balance, "which has an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter".
The United States' trade deficit fell by 7.6% in October to $32.9 billion in September.
In contrast, the analysts expected deficit growth.
Imports as well as exports have increased.
The major news is the increase in the total volume of trade, especially in the export of goods, which reflects the economic growth of the main trading partners of the United States, said Christopher Cornell of Business Research Economy.com.
In return, unemployment rates in the United States have increased in the last week against all expectations and have now reached the level of 474,000 requests.
However, the mean value of new job seekers during the last four weeks had " fallen to the low of the year," stressed Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The profitability of government bonds to 10 years has increased to 3,482% compared with 3,432% on Tuesday evening, the profitability of bonds to 30 years to 4,492% on the 4,408% on the eve.
Cuba: hundreds of partisans in power pipe "Ladies in White"
On Thursday, several hundreds of partisans in the Cuban power impelled the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for the purpose of the World Human Rights Day and also destroyed another rally, which temporarily arrested a good dozen dissidents.
To mark the forty "Ladies in Weiss", wives or close-up political prisoners, some partisans from the government under Raul Castro were blazed, just as they were on their way to the center of the city to demand the liberation of the political prisoners, a AFP journalist confirmed.
Down with the Yankies!, "S√∂ldner!", "The road belongs to the revolutionarys!", "It lives Fidel and Raul!", the authorized partisans with raised fist scanned the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilian agents who had appeared to "guarantee their protection".
A similar demonstration against the "Ladies in Weiss" had taken place in Havana on the eve of the evening, in which there was neither injury nor arrest.
On the other hand, in the Havana district of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who also joined the Thursday demonstration in the face of the International Human Rights Day were temporarily arrested by civilian police, a AFP reporter confirmed.
According to this journalist, the police forced the dissidents exploited by the partisans of the government to enter civilian vehicles under force.
The temporary detention of dissidents under such circumstances is usually limited to only a few hours.
As candidates for the Sakharov Prizes awarded by the European Parliament in 2005, the "Lamen in Weiss" organized an unauthorized march for the purpose of "the request for the release of all political prisoners", whose number according to the dissident list has around 200 persons, said Laura Pollan, one of the leaders whose husband Hector Maceda holds a prison sentence of 20 years.
M. Maceda belongs to the group of 75 Cuban dissidents imprisoned in March 2003, of which 53 have been behind bars until now.
The Cuban authorities feel the opponents of the regime as "soldiers" or "agents" at the service of the declared archenemy, the United States.
A rarity in itself is that Cuban television reported on the demonstration events on Thursday between militant pro-government fighters and "contra-revolutionary".
The Cuba led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of evasion of rights and freedoms, in particular of freedom of expression.
Insanity kills eighty-year-old with the knife and leaves 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
A madman armed with two knives killed an eighty-year-old on Friday about late afternoon at the main business time in downtown Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) and injured five more people.
According to the first information of the survey, the 28-year-old attacker had injured the eighty-year-old for previously unexplained cause in or in front of a pharmacy on the boulevard of Jean-Jaures with two knives and this, according to police information, with witnesses present.
The old man, born in 1929, according to one of the officers of the police syndicate Alliance in the hospital, has suffered the consequences of his injuries.
In or in front of the same pharmacy, he had a couple with a pregnant woman.
The man, about in the Dressigers, intervened and was injured.
The first two victims were severely injured in the hospital, where the eighty - year - old died.
The other injured person floats in the danger of life, since, according to police sources, vital organs were apparently affected.
The pregnant woman has become sick as a result of the events, and according to a police source, she is said to have been hospitalized in the "shock state".
The armed man, who seemed to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs according to police records, should immediately have escaped on the road, the same boulevard Jean Jaures.
He would have injured two other passersby, apparently by chance: a thirty- and a forty-year-old, the latter of both heavy.
The scenario remained in the dark in the evening.
He had been with two carnivores, which he carried crossed behind his back, explained on site Arnaud Press√©, a responsible for the Syndicate Alliance of the territory of Hauts-de-Seine.
Several passers-by, including young people, are said to have tried, according to the AFP's witness reports, to cover the mad.
I saw a guy in the Drissiers with a green vest.
Three young people tried to intervene.
They couldn't do it because the guy was well built, reported Alberto, a waitress of a nearby bar.
A horde fell over him, he added, including a city police officer who broke the wrist.
Still on the boulevard of Jean-Jaures, at the level of house number 61, two city police officers, including their superior, tried to arrest the armed man and were injured with knives, so police statements.
The event took place in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are a number of shops.
Passersby have come to me to tell me there's a injured person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old person lying on the ground, I put them in first-aid position and noticed a clumsy wound in the stomach area, said Fr√©d√©ric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, the AFP.
Five minutes later, a second, about thirty-year-old person was injured by cut wounds.
Finally, state police forces arrested the man who did not carry any identification documents.
The Procuratorate of Nanterre has commissioned the District Department of the Criminal Police of Hautss-de Seine (SDPJ 92) to investigate the case.
The madman was hospitalized on Thursday night.
In view of his condition, he has not yet been heard judicially.
A police source does not rule out his being sent to a nervous hospital.
According to another police source, six police officers were blaming him on the police commission in Clichy, where he had been deported.
He was "in a state of exasperation" like "all mentally confused of this kind, in which the forces released themselves during the Tathergang".
USA: Polanski's lawyer again calls for the prosecution to be stopped
For the time being, the lawyer of French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski has repeatedly demanded on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, western United States) to drop the prosecution against his client, who is currently in court at his place of residence in Switzerland because of a moral breach more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, attorney of the director of the "Pianist", denounced gross procedural errors in the second district of California in 1977 before three judges of the appeal court.
I pleaded at the time of the sentence, M. Hummel explained before adding that the conduct of the judge Laurence Rittenband, commissioned at the time of the trial, "let it run down a cold back."
According to him, the - now deceased - judge Ritzenband had discussed with a prosecutor who said that Roman Polanski had earned a penitentiary - which is a serious procedural mistake.
This discussion was raised in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski: persecuted and coveted), especially by the inquisitive prosecutor David Wells.
M. Wells had finally declared at the end of September that he had "lyed" the authors of the documentary.
If the Court of Justice refuses to terminate the criminal proceedings, Mr Hummel would request that a trial be conducted which would enable him to present the evidence of his argument.
The indictment, in turn, repeated the evidence already presented in the first instance, i.e. that a discussion on the removal of the offences charged to the defendant cannot be seriously considered as long as Roman Polanski does not appear in court.
The 76-year-old director had fled the United States in 1978, before the announcement of the penalty for "illegal sexual relations" with a minor of 13 years.
Since then, he has not traveled to the United States.
The deputy prosecutor of Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, had stated that Roman Polanski "must be there to attend the trial".
Would you like to spread the message on this matter, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants who are a way out?, asks Ms. Asayma.
In your opinion, "the filmmaker asks the Court of Justice for a favor and thus despises its authority".
One of the three judges ‚Äì who now have 90 days to announce their decision ‚Äì even emphasized "that there were other refugees."
Hummel was not the only one who had applied to stop the prosecution against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also demanded the removal of the criminal proceedings.
She recalled that her client would no longer bear to be harassed by every resurgence of the Polanski affair and added: "No one in this room can say that this procedure was just.
Thirty-two years are enough".
Roman Polanski was arrested in Switzerland on 26 September, on the occasion of an American arrest warrant.
After spending two months behind bars, he was then sentenced to house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad in expectation of any extradition.
Wall Street is inhibited by the rise of the dollar and ends without price.
On Friday, the New York Stock Exchange closed without price in a market torn down between better indicators than in the USA and an increase in the dollar: the Dow Jones won 0.63%, while the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
Based on the final figures present at the closure, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has increased 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points, while the predominant Nasdaq has scored 0.55 points to 2.190.31 points.
The extended Standard & Poor's 500 index has increased by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
"Truly, the market is quite quiet," said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
"It remains very limited, the volume of trade has become very low, and I think this will remain so until the end of the year."
The trend was supported by the publication of better indicators of industry than planned, which "contributed to improving the market view of the solidity of economic recovery", summarized Charles Schwab's analysts.
In the USA, sales in retail trade increased by 1.3% in November, i.e. two months in a row and far more than planned.
Furthermore, American consumers' confidence improved significantly in December, up to 73.4 compared to 67.4 in the previous month, according to the University of Michigan index.
However, the indices have been slowed down by a new rise in the dollar rate, which has reached the highest level in relation to the euro for two months, thereby pushing '''the sectors sensitive to the economic situation downwards', said Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
The technological values have thus lost some ground.
The bond market has declined.
The return on the bonds over 10 years on Wednesday evening increased by 3,540% compared with 3,482% and the bond over 30 years to 4,497% compared with 4,492% of the previous day.
Miss World election again in South Africa
After a month of tour of South Africa, the 112 women candidates for the title of Miss World will pass the last obstacle on Saturday in order to realize her dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world and watch this in front of a billion TVs.
During this great beauty fair, which is held for the second time in a row in the Johannesburg area, five of them have already met up with their ticket to the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada have been named Miss Sportive or Miss Top Model during their African stay.
This was a true swirl of pleasures.
Beautiful cities to visit, such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Horn, were simply exceptional.
I have seen many things and had a lot of experiences!, said Miss Sierra Leone with full enthusiasm.
This competition will take place for the ninth time in South Africa and will be broadcast live on Saturday, starting at 5 p.m. in Central European time, from Midrand, north of Johannesburg.
I couldn't imagine a more beautiful country to hand over my crown.
This experience was simply fascinating.
I am happy to have had this experience twice, underlined Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the South African summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges of experience with candidates and the rediscovery of "breathing landscapes".
After a month of gala, samples, meetings with the press and safari, misses now focus on the competition.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to enter the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, who was elected in 2000 and will also be present at this election, as well as Aishwarya Rai, who was elected in 1994 and both became Bollywood stars.
Of course, it is the dream of every woman to be crowned as the most beautiful woman in the world, but it is not just about the appearance.
We are ambassadors of our country, and I want to come home with the crown, and Miss India throws a wide smile.
According to the organizers, this 59th edition is underlined with music and dance.
The candidates defil in traditional costumes and not to forget, in bathing suit.
The performance is presented by a television presenter, Chinese woman Angela Chow, ex-beautiful queen from South Africa, Michelle McLean, and a responsible Miss World Committee member, Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it knows the world with a hardly overwhelming warmth and pride to receive, assures Julia Morley, Chairman of the Miss World.
Like last year, the candidates have made a safari, visiting the famous township in Soweto, but this time they have tasted by bicycle and local cuisine.
The meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who gave them the hand, was exceptional.
Not usual for a head of state, Ms. Sierra Leone noted.
Her most beautiful memory, however, no doubt remains the release in Cape Town (Southwest) to the World Cup in June 2010, a kind of country to advertise for this event.
I'm wrong with people I'm probably never able to approach.
I'm sure I'll come back to the 2010 World Cup, and I promise Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
According to his son David, the news of Johnny Hallyday is "very positive"
The news about Johnny Hallyday are "very positive," his son David assured on Friday when he arrived at Los Angeles Airport, where he visited his father who had been in the hospital for a few days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, everything is going very well, explained David Hallyday to the press when he got out of the plane, in which he arrived shortly after 1 pm local time (21 o'clock CET) from Paris.
The singer's son, who made a relaxed impression, assured that he would go to the hospital of Cedars-Sina√Ø "fastest" on Monday, in which Johnny Hallyday was sent to Paris for a bacterial follow-up infection after surgery on a disc incident on November 26th.
The singer was "moved this night in Los Angeles into an artificial coma to relieve his severe pain and to perform his treatment, the press service announced.
Johnny Hallyday was transferred to an artificial coma by the doctors of the Cedars-Sina√Ø Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was sent to Paris on Monday due to a bacterial follow-up infection after a disc surgery on November 26th.
The singer had to undergo surgery again during the night from Wednesday to Thursday due to the sickly changes caused by the last intervention.
His wife Laeticia attended a school event on Friday morning in the French gymnasium of Los Angeles, where her daughter Jade goes to school, a photographer of the AFP noted.
The head of the department of orthopaedic and traumatological surgery at the H√¥pital Piti√©-Salp√™tri√®re, Yves Caton√©, announced that he would visit the singer on Monday in the hospital in Los Angeles.
The producer has heavily burdened neurosurgeon Dr. St√©phane Delajoux, who operated on the singer at the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris on 26 November.
They told us he did the purest massacre.
The Los Angeles surgeons said they were completely dismayed, said Mr. Camus.
I heard about the possibility of initiating a trial, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday "traveled to Los Angeles with the permission of the Parisian surgeon".
I personally telephoned with this doctor, who assured me that he considered this trip completely unproblematic, which really surprised me, since I already have two tape disc operations behind me, he added.
Shortly before, he announced to RTL that the singer apparently had left the hospital after the operation "without drainage, without everything".
Dr St√©phane Delajoux is very well known in the artist environment.
He had operated on the actress Marie Trintignant, a few days before her death in Vilnius, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where he practised at that time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to absorb a hematom after a brain hemorrhage.
However, he is also a doctor with a dubious reputation who has already been condemned several times for failure and not to forget for tax evasion and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, lawyer of the doctor's board, called him "a man without scruples" who has to be responsible "regularly" before the board of directors and "everything else is recommended".
After a few days of silence, Dr. St√©phane Delajoux made a statement on Friday about his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
This said that the intervention would have been "perfect" and the post-operative investigations would have been "normal".
The operation "did not cause bleeding and therefore does not require drainage," he added.
In any case, the singer's tour, whose health problems have arisen since last summer, seems to be challenged.
It is quite clear that it is too short for a continuation of the tour on 8 January (in Amiens), said Mr Camus.
The UDF (Union for French Democracy) party alliance becomes energetic and calls on the Nouveau Centre Party to stop using its seal.
The party alliance, supervised by Fran√ßois Bayrou's MoDem party, strongly responded on Friday to an attempt to take over the seal, the party once founded by Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing, from the chairman of the Nouveau Centre Party, Herv√© Morin, and urged him, under threat of judicial persecution, to stop using this seal on a document.
Herv√© Morin publicly announces his intention to take over this UDF seal, since he believes that Fran√ßois Bayrou would not be worthy of defending this political heritage after he had given the left hand.
By the way, the Minister of Defence, whose party partner is the UMP, wanted to reaffirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
To emphasize his efforts, he had received the support of Mr Herv√© de Charette (formerly UMP, now NC), who is entitled to the ownership of the UDF brand, since he was the first to apply for this brand in 2004 at the "Institut national de la propri√©t√© industrie".
However, the office of the UDF party alliance, supervised by Fran√ßois Bayrous's friend, was silent and made it clear that they could not be expropriated and set a time limit for the Minister and the Member, under the threat of judicial persecution, to cease using this seal and to transfer the trademark's ownership rights.
In recent days, you have made numerous statements that you would propose your political movement to +take over the UDF seal+, the party alliance wrote in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 office members, including Fran√ßois Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the MoDem Party and Senator Jean Arthuis of the centrist alliance.
You also believed that you had the right to have the name of this movement +Nouveau centre+, the slogan + today's UDF + printed on their political material as well as on the homepage of your website.
As you know, you have no right to use this seal, stated the UDF office and called on the NC Party to "remove the name UDF from all the material and (your) website".
Herv√© de Charette was also required to transfer the trademark's property rights to its legal claimants.
If you refuse to do so, we will bring an action against you in order to respect the law and to defend the legitimate rights of UDF members, the undersigned warned.
In their letter they emphasize that "UDF" has been a full political movement since 1978 and reminds us that Morin and his friends "have made the choice" to leave these 2007 to establish a competing movement, as others had already done in 2002 to establish the party "UMP".
The Nouveau centre party therefore has no rights, according to the undersigned, to use the UDF seal (Union pour la democracy fran√ßaise).
They continue to recall that the last UDF Congress in 2007 approved the three-year accession to the MoDem Party and the establishment of a branch for the defence of "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing.
As far as Herv√© de Charette is concerned, the branch continues, "He was no longer a member of the UDF for three years when he applied for the brand name" but the UMP.
It benefits in a scandalous and fraudulent way from the lack of deposit of the acronym UDF in order to carry it out for itself.
Furthermore, consider that this recklessness is in the best way to turn into a crime, and ironize the NC's strategy: "It seems more dignified to us in politics and in life to make a name for ourselves instead of trying to get out of anonymity by, in a deceptive way, acquiring a name on which one has no legal claims".
Affair Liliane Bettencourt : Fran√ßois-Marie Banier is condemned for exploiting weakness
On Friday, the Court of Nanterre decided to judge the artist Fran√ßois-Marie Banier to determine whether, as the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt claims, he had taken advantage of a weak moment of the eighty-year-olds to cover up some of her assets.
The 62-year-old photographer, who is known for his star photos, will have to answer for the exploitation of weakness in court on April 15 and 16, 2010, a crime that will be punished with a imprisonment of up to three years and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means, in fact, that there will be a process in this affair worthy of the Saga of one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter feed and at the same time have the reins of the cosmetic empire L'Or√©al in their hands.
However, the 15th Chamber of Criminals also ordered a medical examination of the 87-year-old Liliane Bettcourt, which is carried out jointly by three doctors.
The heir and main shareholder of L'Or√©al has so far refused to undergo such an investigation, especially under the conditions presented during investigations by the Procuratorate of Nanterre.
The doctors appointed on Friday are expected to present a report before 10 March 2010 stating clearly whether and at what times Liliane Bettcourt may have been in a state of weakness.
I think she'll go through these investigations.
I'll talk to her, said Ms. Bettencourt's lawyer, Me Georges Kiejman, after the trial.
As regards the lawyer of Fran√ßoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, he is very satisfied with the decision of the court.
This is an excellent news (...). The opinion will prove that he (banier) has manipulated this old lady that one must protect, he affirmed.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter has initiated a criminal action against Fran√ßois-Marie Banier, photographer and all-round artist, and accuses him of having used her mother's weakness for years to cover a billion euros in total in the form of bank checks, insurance policies or paintings.
Liliane Bettencourt, for her part, had always disproved of being manipulated by the photographer whom she sees as a long-standing friend.
Although the court had to examine the admissibility of the action brought by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the court of the lawyers had led to a large family debacle on Friday.
Thus, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer has appealed to her notary on three letters sent by his client (1999, 2003 and 2005) in which she wrote that she misrepresented the husband of Fran√ßoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
According to her lawyer, Liliane Bettencourt added the following: "Please tell my daughter that I wrote to Banier once or twice a day for fifteen years.
I have never been able to speak since her marriage."
The Procuratorate of Nanterre again considers that the applicant had no right to respond in this way, especially because a guardian judge in the last days has refused her application to initiate a court appeal against her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully legal, is not protected and has no guardian.
No one has the right to act in her place," said Marie-Christine Daubigney, representative of the Procuratorate.
The Court has now decided to give a judgment after the admissibility trial of Mme Bettencourt-Meyers has taken place.
Manager revolution or the end of early strategic education?
If nothing changes in the leadership of the big French companies our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been in vain ...
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies in relation to its employees, said the position of the companies vis-√†-vis consumers before the marketing revolution: It is for personnel joining "values" determined the best as it was previously designed on the consumer products designed by the technicians in the factory.
By giving the customer the focus of the company's marketing revolution the strategies of conquering the markets in the place ... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products separate factors preferences of the customers again regularly!
Demobilization of employees can lead to deadly demoralization.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the tip of a much larger phenomenon that affects employees in particular.
This demobilization has a negative impact on the development of all the company's intellectual functions, especially those of F&Eand, which is even more crucial, on those of economic intelligence.
Indeed, the IE (Intelligence Economique = Economic Intelligence) requires "a proactive approach and a forward-looking perspective from all involved parties"; it demands a commitment from the employees that is completely contrary to the instructions of authoritarian management.
That is why we demand an operational revolution, which would consist of putting employees at the centre of the company's concerns in the same way as customers.
The very conditional benefit of internal opinion surveys
Will internal opinion polls, as the questionnaire that Orange has presented to its wage earners, stimulate this revolution in terms of management practice?
I'm afraid I'm afraid not.
First of all, because I could find that the whole structure, given a new situation after many detours, finally arrived to do what it has always done.
Also because authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power - increases proportionally to the meaning of its own failure.
And finally, because most executives have a much simplified idea of human behavior.
From the major engineering schools, their interpretation of psychology is mechanistic.
Through intellectual comfort, they take over the old behavioral theory, which has recently been reactivated by the US "neurosciences" and unwittingly widely disseminated by research institutes and by the media.
Thus, and by suggesting that it is possible to use the "hebel" (sic) to engage employees, a recent survey of Ipsos published Le Figaro.fr strengthens the leadership in an attitude to a mechanistic control system that is inappropriate for the present world.
Identify and measure the mobilisation factors
Instead, an operational revolution necessary for the smooth functioning of modern companies requires the adoption of a definitive view of human behaviour.
It is to integrate a basic protocol into any consideration or practice of governance: it is only possible for wage earners to commit the company if it appears clearly as a means of achieving some of their dreams, ambition and intentions.
Currently, only the studies from the multifunctional analysis take on this concept of the motivation of the employees.
These studies have shown that they assess their business on the basis of a predetermined doxa that allows them to estimate what it offers them to achieve their life objectives through their perceived image of the company.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, corporate managers can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and place their human resource management in the right place.
In this way, they create a fertile soil that is favourable for the coordinated development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
The speech of Oslo: the "righteous war" brings Obama praise from the right
On Friday, American rights welcomed the speech given by Barack Obama in Oslo on the eve of the night before, and was satisfied that the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009 defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives who had ridiculed the awarding of the prize to Obama on 9 October applauded this time the speech of the President, the example of the former Vice-Presidential candidate for the 2008 elections, Sarah Palin.
I liked what he said, explained Palin, the face of the right wing of the Republican party in the daily US Today, and added that she had raised the subject of a "sometime necessary" war in her memoirs just published.
Of course, the war is the last thing I think the Americans want to do, but it's necessary.
We have to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, tried on Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of violence; one way to declare his decision nine days ago to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, expressed the view that the President had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really very good, the former president of the House of Representatives, who especially acknowledged the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in the words of Obama.
Ginrich, who was interviewed in the radio show "The Takeaway", explained that in some parts he felt that this speech was entirely historical.
The previous Member, considered by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said he was pleased to have seen a "right-wing president" who reminded the members of the Nobel Committee that they "could not be free and would not hand over a price for peace if the use of violence did not exist".
For Michael Gerson, former writer of George W. Bush and now editor at Washington Post, Obama has given "a very American speech".
In addition, he represents himself as a "cosmopolitan" as "he always does", he has "spoken like an American president" when he pointed out that Europeans "live like a security bubble that they have not created themselves and for whose protection they do not do much," says Gerson.
Among the few unconvinced rights, former UN ambassador John Bolton, a falcon of the Bush era, described the speech on the National Review Online website as "a boring, high-speed and inspirationless".
To the left of the President, democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is concerned about how Barack Obama defends the use of the forces.
If you pack the war under the guise of justice, the massacre of the innocent can simply be justified, he warns.
However, the media of the moderate left continues to praise the President.
The Los Angeles Times, which still believes that the Nobel Prize was early awarded to Obama, called the speech itself for a speaker like him, who is known for his talent, as "monumental work".
The speech in Oslo " bids a timetable for managing international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression", the California daily says enthusiastically.
The New York Times believes that Obama "preached the necessary discourse" and calls his speech "dark and exemplary at the same time".
Fernfahrter: Three Marathons for an agreement to secure the supply for Christmas
After a three-week negotiation marathon, the trade unions of the Road Association and the TLF - the only employers' organisation that remained until the end - reached an agreement on Friday evening that put an end to the strike order and the threatening severe supply shortage at Christmas.
At the signature meeting on Friday evening, the Secretary of State Dominique Bussereau, responsible for transport, welcomed the agreement which was launched on Wednesday morning after several weeks of negotiation.
After a second night of negotiation, the negotiators separated on the early Friday morning in the hope of quickly signing the agreement in the late morning.
Although the three employers' associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had left the meeting.
However, more than six hours passed from the beginning of the meeting at 11:00 until the end of the agreement and only at 18:00 the agreement was signed.
The conflict "had done a lot of damage to companies" and "it was to be feared that it would affect the holidays at the end of the year," says Bussereau.
The agreement provides for a 4% wage increase for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest wage groups (international transport).
The hourly rate for workers with the lowest wages thus rises from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros.
"That's not very much, but we'll start small first," said Patrice Clos (FO).
The activists are now instructed to stop blocking the supply centres.
"However, there will probably always be some reluctances that are not satisfied with the agreement," he adds.
TLF President Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good agreement" although it was "hard to grant these wage increases in the face of international competition".
According to him, the increase is 170 euros per month for the low and 100 to 120 euros for the high wage groups.
"This agreement is based on common sense and respect for employees," says Maxime Dumont (CFDT), whereas Thierry Douine (CFTC) spoke of "a historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) commented on this "an acceptable compromise".
The Agreement also provides for a 3% increase in travel costs and for the maintenance of the total road transport budget in the first half of 2010, which will in particular enable the issue of 13 months' salary and the modernisation of the tariff agreements to be addressed.
M. Bussereau recalled that "the reduction of taxes for employers amounting to EUR 100 million" was the subject of an amendment by the government to the 2009 draft law of the corrected finances, which was adopted by the National Assembly at the night from Thursday to Friday.
The government demands "an identical" vote from the Senate.
The TLF's signature allows the agreement to first apply to the companies associated with the organisation and then applies to the entire profession in the event of an extension by the Minister of Labour.
This will be the case "in the shortest time", Bussereau assures.
The opposition of employers' associations can only delay the procedure.
The FNTR group called for a "deceptive trade" because the EUR 100 million "had already been promised to the sector to compensate for part of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but in order not to dispel the Gans-Esser on the upcoming Christmas days, the Unostra complains.
For the Otre Association, the agreement threatens to "shoop a large grave for the small and medium-sized enterprises in the industry in the next 12 months".
Line RER A: Disorders this weekend, trade unions dissatisfied with the proposals of the RATP
The disturbances on line RER A, the largest high-speed rail network in France for the Greater Paris region and the √éle-de-France, continued on the weekend, while a meeting on Friday, the 2nd day of strike between the trade unions and the management of the RATP (Independent Paris passenger transport administration) allowed strikers to continue to wait with their demands for pay surcharges.
At this important shopping weekend before Christmas there were no trains between 10:00 and 20:00. On the central line (between La D√©fense and Nation) only one of two trains and outside the central line only one of four trains was ready for use.
The connection to SNCF trains was interrupted in Nanterre Pr√©fecture, which forced travellers to change.
The department store chain Galeries Lafayette, which counts 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "the RATP is trying to connect the big business to traffic".
The line RER A crosses the Paris conurbation from west to east.
The section of the RATP connects the towns of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre as well as Boissy-Saint-L√©ger and Marne-La-Vall√©e.
On Friday, about one in two trains went on schedule at the main time, and almost none during the low-traffic time.
As on Thursday, there was no human feeling on the tracks, as the inhabitants of the √éle-de-France had adjusted to the situation.
So early in the morning, the train station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less overrun than usual, especially because of the lack of gymnasiasts.
In Boissy-Saint-L√©ger (Val-de-Marne) Jack Nbakina, engineer (29), said that he would have been "standing up one and a half hours earlier to get to work on time".
The SNCF, which had planned to care for travellers by staff and regulatory forces, pointed out that there had not been any bottlenecks at Saint-Lazare station.
The trains operated by SNCF on line RER A or towards Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or drove off via Saint-Lazare station to ensure the connection to the metros.
On Saturday and Sunday, the general meetings of the strikers took place again, during which the results were reviewed, which the associations had classified as "poor" after the meeting with the leader on Friday afternoon.
The RER Managing Director proposed the specific preparation of a protocol for line RER A with regard to all relevant aspects, working hours, careers, etc.
But that's not what the drivers want. According to Thierry Garon (Sud), they demand a long-term wage supplement.
The CGT was indignant that the RATP itself put its wage surcharge proposals in brackets and stressed that the leadership "cannot solve a problem, although this was possible for the long-distance drivers and SNCF."
The RATP made it clear that a new meeting was planned to be held on Monday for the full review of working conditions.
This also shows the associations that the company "ignores the weekend drivers".
In the morning about 150 drivers visited a committee in Paris.
Once again it was the leader who so far rejected any discussion during the strike and suggested a meeting after a calming down of the situation.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened to spread to the line RER B after a preliminary announcement of usa and Ind√©pendants.
The associations demand a wage supplement of 120 (unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Ind√©pendants). Furthermore, they complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this route, on which millions of travellers travel every day.
The drivers of the RER line, who have many years of professional experience, receive a gross wage of 2,200 to 2,700 euros and a pay supplement of 600 to 650 euros for shift services as well as on Sundays and holidays.
Turkish Constitutional Court resolves pro-Kurdian party. Decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court announced on Friday the dissolution of the country's main pro-Kurdish party, a decision that followed immediately angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the southeastern part of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision threatens to make the government's work enormously difficult to reach out to the Kurdish community in order to put an end to the conflicts that have been going on for 25 years.
The "Party for a Democratic Society" (DTP) was dissolved, since it had become a "stand for activities that are detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity", says the President of the Constitutional Court Hasim Kili√ß four days after the decision to the press.
According to Kili√ß, the decision would have been taken unanimously by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes needed to impose the resolution. Furthermore, he pointed out that 37 of the leaders of the party, including chairman Ahmet T√ºrk and parliamentarian Aysel Tugluk, were excluded from political events for a period of five years.
In addition, the judge announced the abolition of parliamentary immunity, which Turkish and Tugluk enjoy, as well as the confiscation of the goods of the party.
The DTP now has 21 seats in Parliament (from 550).
The party leaders expressed themselves before the ruling that the parliamentarians would rather leave Parliament than meet as non-partisan parliamentarians.
The decision was followed by a trial initiated in 2007 by the State Attorney of the Turkish Federal Court of Abdurrahman Yal√ßinkaya. He accused the DTP of following the "turns" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which Ankara and many other countries regard as a terrorist organisation.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political display window of the PKK rebels.
The party assures that it has "no connection" to the PKK, but refuses to call it "terrorist organisation" and calls on the government to negotiate.
The ruling of the Constitutional Court runs between the Government, which seeks to meet the Kurdish community and propose a series of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurds in order to allow the Kurds to complete the support of the PKK and to put an end to the conflicts.
The leaders of the DTP confirm that a resolution could lead to a recurrence of tensions in south-east Anatolia, where numerous demonstrations against the arrest conditions of the PKK chief Abdullah √ñcalan in recent weeks had led to clashes with the police.
Since the court's announcement, thousands of demonstrators have gathered in front of the DTP premises in the million-dollar city of Diyarbakir in the southeast, mainly populated by Kurds.
The forces used tear gas grenades and water pitchers when the demonstrators began to throw Molotov cocktails and stones.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
According to the Turkish judgment, the decision of the Court of First Instance "will deepen despair even further".
"It is not possible for Turkey to clarify this question on the basis of the prohibition of a party," he explained to the press.
The government, consisting of a party that emerged from the Islamist movement, also regretted the decision.
"We object to the closure of the parties on principle.
That doesn't solve the problems," says Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
"This decision is a torpedoing of the democratic opening promoted by the government," said political market observer Ahmet Island.
"You can obviously get involved in a reaction from the PKK," he adds.
On Thursday, the PKK declared itself to be an attack that killed seven soldiers in northern Turkey three days earlier, one of the most brutal attacks in recent months.
The snowfall can come
A really cracky winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburg wants.
Not because he wants to harass the citizens, says the FES Winter Service Manager.
But so that his employees can try and learn to master the entire vehicle technology.
According to meteorologists, the weekend could be this far for the first time.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
In doing so, the FES proceeds according to a precise plan.
As soon as it snows in Frankfurt and temperatures are below zero degrees, 20 so-called A-roads will be run off with large-range vehicles, explains Brauburger.
These include major traffic and transit roads such as the Neue Weg and the Hanover Landstra√üe.
But also fire brigades, public routes, pedestrian zones and tracks with slopes, such as the Atzelbergstra√üe.
The FES service starts at 3 p.m.
The approximately 1040 kilometers would have to be spread in a maximum of three hours with moisture salt which is better liable.
That's why the FES starts at three o'clock at night, "so that the routes are free until the professional traffic starts."
It'll be difficult if it doesn't snow until 7.30.
Then we have a problem, says the winter service manager, "because then no one is willing to make room for the scattering vehicles".
It is only after that, if it does not continue to snow, that roads of supply and development, including the Council-Beil-Stra√üe, are on the line.
The last priority is side and side roads.
There will be complaints there, Brauburger.
At five o'clock in the morning, the foot people of the FES are getting on the way, danger points and transitions are being cleared up as a priority.
The FES can't take care of all the bike paths.
There is a special service in Frankfurt, which keeps an eye on the bridges from 22 to 4.30 o'clock, says Brauburger.
As there is smoothing on these fast, as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees, the scatterer is on the road.
If necessary, this is also called by the police.
The cradle of the dinosaurs
Tawa hallee looked like many other meat-eating dinosaurs: The two-metre-long and 1,50-metre-long animal ran on two strong hind legs, had an elongated skull with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with sickle claws and a long tail.
If the species had lived a few million years later, it would be nothing special.
But Tawa hallee was one of the first dinosaurs with these body characteristics, reports Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in Science magazine of Thursday.
The animal lived some 215 million years ago in today‚Äôs New Mexico, which was then on the equator in a dry zone of the supercontinent Pang√§a.
Tawa opens a new window to the early evolution of the dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
He shows us a lot about the relationship, the spread and the characteristics of the early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began to dig on the Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
We have sometimes found a dozen dinosaur bones in one day, which is unprecedented for deposits from the trias, reports team member Randall Irmis from the Utah Museum of Natural History.
Some of the bones quickly identified the researchers as a new species.
In the course of the excavation, they gathered the remains of a total of five individuals.
Fund confirms theories on early Dino history
The name Tawa comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it is an extraordinary find: "Dinosaur fossils from the trias are extremely rare, usually only individual fragments can be found."
Other dinosaur experts do not necessarily share enthusiasm.
This find is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the early history of the dinosaurs, says about Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to the current opinion, the dinosaurs appeared for the first time about 230 million years ago.
Many of the oldest fossils, however, are incomplete, which is why the assignment of these Ur-Dinos is usually controversial.
For example, the experts debate when the lizards split into their three main development lines: the meat-eating theropods, which later included the tyrannosaurus rex, the Velociraptor and also the birds, the four-legged Sauropods and their relatives, and the plants eat Ornithischia (Birds‚Äô Sauriers), which included, for example, the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
After analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hallae is an original theropod.
He has an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, says Nesbitt.
At the skull of Tawa hallae, for example, the researchers found evidence of air bags, as they also possess the descendants of the theropods, the birds.
Thanks to the air bags the breathing of the birds is more efficient than those of the mammals.
At Tawa hallee, the bones of the spine were apparently partly filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropod with air bags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the relative line of the huge Sauropods later also had air bags and lightweight bones, probably the common ancestor of both groups had already produced this useful innovation.
At least three migration waves to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs known so far lived in South America, the researchers concluded that the lizards appeared there for the first time.
As a result, the three lines of development separated early and spread from South America across all continents, which at that time still formed a single land mass as a supercontinent Pang√§a.
The fact that the team together with Tawa hallae found the remains of two other not particularly closely related theropods speaks for this.
The three cannot originate from a common, immigrant ancestor, the researchers argue.
We believe that there were at least three migration waves to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the science study.
Of course, there are also contradictions.
An even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to a sister group of the dinosaurs, lived in today's Poland, says the Bonn palaeontologist Martin Sander.
In his opinion, a distorted picture could arise, because in South America, there are just a lot of primitive Dino fossils that have been preserved, while on other continents, there is hardly anything to be found.
As the dinosaurs managed to develop from a relatively rare sideline of the reptile tribe to the dominant agricultural vertebrates of the middle age, is still enigmatic.
During the trias, the dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of today's crocodiles and the fly-sauriers and with numerous other lizards.
Toward the end of the trias, the dinosaurs spread all over the world and developed many new species, while the kinship died on the border from the trias to the law.
Success story did not last forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There may have been a mass death that the dinosaurs survived by chance, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted so that they could beat the competition out of the field.
The success story did not last forever.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact of a group of animals gave rise to bloom, which had also developed in the trias and since then had a shadow existence: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatures are international.
Professors of the University of Toronto insist on it, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley in California.
Teachers from Naples are there, from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police clearance of the occupied casino at Frankfurt Goethe University is beating waves worldwide.
278 professors and lecturers of Goethe University, but also of universities throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America solidarity with the protesting students on the Campus Westend.
In a statement written in German and English, they "disapprove" of the police intervention made by the Bureau.
University President Werner M√ºller-Estler had let the building occupied by students and teachers in the educational strike be cleared in the past week because walls and artworks had been smeared.
Five students were injured.
The property damage, the signatory judge, did not justify "the violent dissolution of self-organized courses of students and teachers by a police command".
Space represents a "non-acceptable intervention" in the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves "the deligitimization and criminalization of protest" and distracts from the contents.
The Bureau had abstained from the necessary discourse.
The lecturers call for the immediate cessation of criminal prosecution.
The majority of the occupyers did not support the damage, it says.
Protest Protested
The youth of the Verdi trade union and the German Trade Union Confederation also solidarity with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of a growing concern for its own future, says Verdi State Youth Secretary Alexander Klein.
Hessen's Minister of Science Eva K√ºhne-H√∂rmann (CDU) defended the actions of the UN President and the police.
We are grateful to the University President.
Destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, she said at a current hour on Thursday in the Wiesbadener Landtag.
We understand the protest, but we have no understanding of vandalism, according to the CDU member of the parliament Peter Beuth.
Otherwise, the opposition groups SPD, Greens and Left saw it.
The CDU takes painted walls on the pretext to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (left).
Instead of dealing with the arguments and demands of the students, one has cleared up.
The left has submitted an application asking the Interior Minister to report on the police deployment.
New Silicon Valley
For many years it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of ten districts of Moscow's capital, was a strictly guarded site for secret weapons research in the Soviet Union.
Today, the municipality with its 216 000 inhabitants, 37 kilometres from Moscow centre, is considered "Russian Silicon Valley".
Significant research and production facilities for micro- and nanoelectronics are located here.
Since September 2008 representatives of Selenograd had made contacts with the Frankfurt scientific site Riedberg - with the University Institutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Center (FIZ).
There were several visits and on Wednesday Selenograd and Riedberg signed a "protocol for closer cooperation" in Frankfurt.
Moscow Deputy Mayor Yuri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation, signed for Frankfurt Planning Department Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, FIZ representatives and small and medium-sized enterprises of the research focus will travel to Selenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
It is about a continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
FIZ companies will be able to take a foothold on the growing Russian market.
Conversely, Russian science companies want to catch orders in Germany.
Selenograd is the headquarters of important Russian research institutes and companies.
This includes, for example, the Moscow Institute of Electron Technology, the large companies Sitronics and Rossijskaja Elektronika.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist plan city" for armaments research.
Selenograd (literally translated "Green Town") received his name from the wooded hill landscape where the research institutions are embedded.
Stuttgarter Brakeklotz
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be set high enough.
For the promoters of the project, it is simply about "the new heart of Europe".
That's right. S21 is much more than lowering a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project that will plunge the city of the Baden-W√ºrttemberg state capital for a decade into unhealed construction site chaos.
Stuttgart 21 was born from the spirit of the 1980s.
Central railway stations with tracks ending in the middle of the city were then considered to be transport fossils of the 19th century, which acted like a brake block of modern rail transport, since it once took a lot of time to span locomotives from the rear to the front.
Get in there, hold on, continue driving - so let's go.
And that's why the main station should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a transit station, which is located about halfway through the trans-European rail-magistral between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - therefore the slogan of the "heart of Europe".
S21 is now actually being addressed, although the visions of the 1980s are far from compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have realized that in the Hessian and Bavarian cities, it is almost priceless to implement the deepening.
However, central stations have no longer had an entry and exit problem, since there have been modern turning trains with motor vehicles and steering cars at both ends.
Nevertheless, Stuttgart 21 next to the new ICE line to Ulm is now under way.
National and local politicians have enforced it.
The railway is involved, also because the risks of the largest infrastructure-individual project of the Republic of the taxpayers and not of the state group are borne.
The project can still be justified in some way in terms of urban planning.
New urban space is created, which is - one believes the computer-generated graphics of the planners - equipped with a lot of greenery.
S21 is harmful to the rail transport system.
The railway station and the extension of the route are intended for passenger transport, which is typically attributed to enormous growth in the 1980s.
At that time there was not yet the competition of the low-cost flyers.
However, modern transport policy must first be to strengthen freight transport, as rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than road transport.
But the new construction route is not suitable for freight trains due to heavy climbs.
Even more serious is the fact that S21 also indirectly tackles many other railway projects.
Approximately six billion euros will be spent in Swabian.
That's the official number.
Experts consider ten to 15 billion realistic.
It is clear that in the next decade the money will be missing from other nodes and bottlenecks on the net.
A total of sixty major projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the expansion of the well 180 kilometres long route through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, it has been built on the track in the slow pace.
It would be necessary to press the tube right here.
But S21 will act as a brake block.
The Rhine valley line becomes a bottleneck for international freight transport: in the heart of Europe.
Government examines judgment on the airport
The state government has left open in the Wiesbaden Landtag whether it will go into revision against the judgment of the Hessian Administrative Court (VGH) on the night flight ban.
The CDU/FDP coalition has commissioned experts to examine the VGH judgment, which is more than 400 pages in legal terms, said Economic Minister Dieter Posch (FDP).
On that day, VGH in Kassel had stated in writing that, in the event of the construction of the planned northwest runway at Frankfurt Airport, the country had to re-regulate the night flight ban.
The authorisation of 17 flights between 23 and 5 o'clock, as the state government provides, is not to be compatible with the legal protection of the population from night flight noise.
The coalition will have to decide by 4 January whether it is against the judgment in revision.
The opposition criticised this postponement and urged the representatives of the government to waive a revision at the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD leader Torsten Sch√§fer-G√ºbel called on CDU and FDP to return to a night flight ban on their promises made before the election. Otherwise, this should be regarded as a "word break".
It's damn hard to keep your word, Green Chief Tarek Al-Wazir said, alluding to the FDP election log "We keep word".
Minister Posch rejected the allegation of Sch√§fer-G√ºmbel, who tried to come to their night flights with "right-hand twisting and trickery".
A precise legal examination takes its time.
The coalition does not want to operate on the basis of a "fast first impression".
We need a legally secure decision, said Stefan M√ºller (FDP).
As it represents the opposition, his group's statements on the night flight ban had never been.
US banks pay back help
The crisis-shaking US major banks are stripping off their state bonds.
On Wednesday, the Bank of America paid back the aid from the Tarp Bank rescue fund to a total of 45 billion dollars (approximately 30 billion euros).
And the Citigroup, according to a report by the US sender CNBC, plans to repay the state aid.
The institutions aim to eliminate the restrictions associated with the adoption of the money, such as the restriction on the payment of manager bonuses and the payment of high fees.
The Bank of America had received a good $19 billion of fresh money from investors about the changeover bonds.
She took the rest of the sum from her own cash register, which was well filled, among other things, by division sales.
On Wednesday evening, bank manager Kenneth Lewis expressly thanked the American taxpayer: The money injection had helped over a very difficult time.
The money house had risen at the height of the financial crisis with the takeover of the investment bank Merrill Lynch.
The Citigroup also wants to obtain money on the capital market in order to free itself from its liabilities to the State.
Already on Thursday, the U.S. bank could announce a 20 billion dollar increase in its capital, CNBC reported with appeal to circles.
A Citigroup speaker didn't want to speak out.
In June Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already paid back their help.
Quick Choice
It all went faster than thought.
Soon two weeks after the ZDF Board of Directors forced Nikolaus Brender out of office, the station can present a successor.
Last night, the committee wanted to vote on the staff.
The favourite was Peter Frey, head of the ZDF Capital Studio in Berlin.
However, there was no confirmation from the sender - officially in order not to prejudge the procedure.
However, ZDF's director Markus Sch√§chter should also have played a role in not harming the Board of Directors.
Frey, shaft candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 panel members.
The outcome of the vote was not yet established at the end of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schachter failed in the Board of Directors with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender by another five years.
Only seven members spoke out for Brender, seven voted against him. Brender‚Äôs election was a severe defeat for shafts, but an foreseeable one.
For the Union majority on the Board of Directors had already signalled weeks before the election that Brender would not want to be confirmed in office.
He organized the resistance to the chief editor of the Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch.
With the argument that under Brender the ZDF's news transmissions had lost at intervention rates, he rejected another term of office of the highly respected editor-in-chief.
Until shortly before the election, there were therefore protests in which the political influence on the ZDF was teased.
In fact, 35 state lawyers had been involved in the debate, which considered Koch's approach to be unconstitutional.
It didn't use anything.
To the person
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, education and romance.
After that he worked at the S√ºdwestfunk and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983, Frey moved to ZDF, initially to the "today-journal".
Afterwards stations: from 1988 to 1990 personal speaker of the editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 head and moderator of the "Morgenmagazin"; until 2001 head of ZDF's foreign policy; since the head of the ZDF's capital studio.
The Greens announced a constitutional complaint after the election of Brender, who was still elected journalist of the year on Wednesday by the branch magazine Medium Magazin.
Koch's opposition to the Board of Directors, Rhineland-Palatinate's Prime Minister Kurt Beck, said last week that the countries should change the ZDF State Treaty in such a way that staff proposals by the intentionant cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, Beck also excluded party politicians from the ZDF supervisory bodies.
Brender's expected successor Peter Frey had recommended himself to the Board of Directors with a smart move - by strongly criticizing the panel immediately after the Brender election.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, he was able to nominate shafts without loss of face for the post of editor-in-chief and to elect the Board of Directors without suspecting that he would hold a party member in office.
In partyarithmetics, Frey is already assigned to the left-wing liberals.
Studied
Some success for the students: After a year of educational strike, the country's ministers of culture finally agreed on Thursday: at a meeting of the Ministry of Culture and Higher Education, both sides agreed to want to improve the study conditions at Bachelor and Master.
Students should be able to cope with their studies in the future.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the test loads: in principle, each study module should only complete with a single test.
In addition, the workload of students is to be reviewed and "a realistic and acceptable measure" ensured.
Politics and universities also want to simplify the recognition of examinations between universities within and outside Germany.
The countries committed themselves to making common structural requirements for Bachelor's and Master's programmes more flexible.
In addition, there should not be any different country regulations.
Less tests
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, cult ministers and university rectors bear the winged word of better studyability in their mouths.
Now it was filled with a concrete content for the first time.
The so-called accreditation council decided to reduce the number of exams in part dramatically: "Every module usually concludes with only one examination," says a 30-page paper, which is intended to re-regulate the admission of studies.
With the "significant reduction of the audit burden", said the accreditation council chairman Reinhold Grimm, a "feel development is to be stopped which significantly affected the studyability."
In addition, "studentability" is to be "the crucial criterion" in design in the future.
Modules such as content should be "strengthened to check whether "necessary adjustments by students in the choice of the
This is the first time that the Commission has adopted a proposal for a Council Directive on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to the marketing of
The students would have "pronounced that they would have room for manoeuvre that would enable and promote their own initiative".
The rules should apply to the admission of new courses, but also to the review of existing courses of study.
These must be "reaccredited" every five years ‚Äì which means, however, that it will take up to 2015 until all studies have been reviewed.
For this purpose, there are ten accreditation agencies throughout the country that are subject to the accreditation council set up by the countries.
In October, the Ministers of Culture had called on the countries to act on the agencies in such a way that the material filling is not too large and the audit regime is not too strict.
In individual federal states universities and colleges have already agreed on appropriate measures with the state ministries.
As the only country so far, Rheinland-Pfalz has committed additional funds for the further development of the Bologna process.
Of the money, universities are mainly to set up tutor programmes and strengthen study advice as well as audit and foreign offices.
Country and universities want to spend ten million euros on this.
At the beginning of 2010, the government intends to introduce an amendment to the Higher Education Act into Parliament.
After this, only one examination is required for the completion of a study model.
The aim is to make study design more flexible, to ensure recognition of qualifications at other universities and to facilitate access to the Master's degree.
By the end of next year, all studies in the country will be reviewed for their studyability.
On Thursday, the government and opposition had again disputed the study conditions in the country.
In addition to praise, however, there was criticism of the decisions.
The Federal Board of Directors of the Juso High School Groups called for the design of education policy to no longer take place "behind closed doors" of ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the educational strikes, students should now also "speak a word" as affected.
The future academics received support from the President of the University Rectors Conference (HRK), Margret Wintermantel: "We need the experience of the students," she said at a meeting with the Ministers of Culture on Thursday, with which the HRK discussed a joint reform paper.
The Trade Union Education and Science (GEW) did not go far enough in the decisions of Bonn: it calls for a legal claim that allows each graduate with a Bachelor's degree to have access to a further master's degree.
On the other hand, the countries must ensure that sufficient Master's places with the best possible study conditions are available for today's generation of Bachelor's students tomorrow, says GEW Board member Andreas Keller.
Countries need to employ significantly more lecturers.
However, the cult ministers did not express themselves to a more free access to the master.
More than one footnote to Herta M√ºller
Entering into Germany and coming out is almost no control..." is the beginning line of a poem by the poet Werner S√∂llner, in which this language fetts in disturbing language addresses the arrival experience of a dissident who has gained freedom but at the same time lost his language space.
Born in 1951 in the Romanian Banat, Werner S√∂llner had initially worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a editor in a children's book publisher before moving to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
S√∂llner has been awarded several literary awards, in 1993 he gave the legendary Frankfurt poetic lectures at Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been head of the Hessian Literary Forum in the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
Last Tuesday, during a conference in Munich, he saw to it that he was concerned with "German literature in Romania in the mirror and mirror of her security acts".
S√∂llner visibly insinuated and misplaced a statement in which he stood up to Romanian-German writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmututh Frauendorfer, his cooperation as an IM for the Romanian secret service Securiate.
In 1989 S√∂llner received the German Language Prize together with some of the participants.

I'm, S√∂llner concluded, "that's someone who hasn't resisted enough of the securitate's intimidation attempts."
The poet Werner S√∂llner is IM Walter.
Nearly at the same time as the Nobel Prize ceremony for Herta M√ºller and its unprecedented literary debate with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene and in particular the community of German authors from Romania are shaken by a case that identifies the abysses and disdains of a political system based on surveillance and discipline.
Werner S√∂llner is, as far as one can say according to the previous knowledge, not only perpetrators, but also victims.
In his Securitate act IM Walter had played a role, according to the confession of S√∂llner of literary scientist Michael Markel and referred to the positive influence of IM Walter for him.
He had "cut him out" in all the significant points for him at the time," says Markel.
It is a moral need for him to make this remark.
S√∂llner's statement was unexpected in the form and before this audience, but the confession of an earlier dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian intelligence service is not quite surprising.
Germany had been a cozy reserve for Securitate Spitzel, Herta M√ºller had already written in July in the time after she had read her own file, 914 pages.
The persons concerned, one may suspect, are speculated and in some cases probably also knew which clear name was hidden behind the cover names Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Unlike in the country in which the Stasi acts are now highly procedurally visible, dealing with the legacy of the Securitate monitoring is still very diffuse.
A systematic education has been pushed behind and hindered in recent years.
One of the Birthler authorities of the corresponding National Council for the Reprocessing of Securitates (CNSAS) was not established until 1999 but the publication of the files has been slow since then.
Only since 2005 has there been a law governing the administration of the files.
The fact that the influence of former Securitate members in Romania is still very large showed an interview following the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta M√ºller, in which a former Securitate boss from Temesvar gave a negative opinion about the prize winner.
She has a psychosis, after all, she's only been interrogated once.
The infamy of power meant being able to express itself here entirely unheeded in the form of freedom of expression.
Certainly, the case of S√∂llner, as so often in connection with secret debt, raises inevitable questions.
Why only now? Whom has been harmed? The wise response of the listeners to S√∂llner's confession makes it hope that the continuation of this chapter will be determined by a desire for knowledge rather than by a debt assignment and shame.
It is more than a footnote to the healing of the work of Herta M√ºller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday.
Saturation Supplement Champions League
It seemed as if there was just an adredly dressed outsider from a very nice Christmas celebration on which a sports goods manufacturer had distributed Goodies when the new VfB trainer Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag of the equiper, rose to a C-class a quarter hour after midnight. Ãà
The man with the striking glasphemy let himself be drivered because of the still strange city.
Otherwise he could have driven himself - alcohol was finally not in play, and drunk for luck the 55-year-old was no more.
Had been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow the work goes on.
Or let's go.
In the words of the Swiss commitment only three days earlier: "We have achieved the eighth finale", namely in the Champions League thanks to the 3-1 success against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not let ourselves be blinded by the success: it will be a brutal hard fight against the descent."
The " much more important task" is on Sunday.
Then it is necessary to repeat the royal class performance in the league everyday in Mainz.
And to put off the again revealed weaknesses after the fast three gates by Marica (5th), T√§sch (8th) and Pogrebnyak (11th).
Explosive
The eighth finale of the Champions League (links 16./17. + 23/24 February/ Playback 9/10. + 16/17 March) will be released in Nyon on 18 December.
So the joy over the fulminant achievement of the Babbel successor continued to behave.
Not only with the supposed salvation provider, who had given the uncertain Stuttgart professionals a short time of self-confidence, willingness to use and joy of playing.
I went to the players and told them to think about their strengths, and stopped them to be more courageous, Seelenklempner Gross explained the so simple-sounding recipe of success, which, however, had no effect under Therapist Babbel.
He has kindled a certain magic, admitted Babbel advocate Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse comes in football, sometimes things happen that you would not have thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, after a week's break for injury, immediately became the best player on the square, tried to describe the "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the workings of the new superior: "He is a man who breaks through and demands discipline.
That's what we need in the current situation."
Under Babbel, it was obviously lacking.
VfB Stuttgart is not yet over the mountain, warns Sport Chief Horst Heldt
The VfB Stuttgart, however, mainly needs consistency.
Like Gross, players and managers also guarded against overvaluing the victory against a weak and overly demanding defense of Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen the bad awakening had come in 0:4, gave Khedira to consider.
And sport director Horst Heldt warned that although a season goal had been achieved, the other was still far away.
We're not over the mountain yet.
The fact that on his 40th birthday, even after the first home victory in three months, hero was not meant to celebrate was due to the events of the weekend, which, in the form of a TV interview by goalkeeper Jens Lehmann, which was broadcast immediately before the start of the game.
There are decisions that others make and not the Jens, hero countered the harsh criticism of Lehmann.
He had accused the board of directors of weakness and had decided to change the coach on pressure from puberty fans.
Also that his free day had been removed after games, Lehmann regarded as a sign of lack of sovereignty and disfavor.
Lehmann's statements were "influenced by pure egoism," Heldt receded and announced consequences for the finale.
They're probably no longer friends for life, the two forty-year-olds.
But after all, they agreed with all the others that without the preliminary work by the replacement coach team, the playful and martially strong idea would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a large share of the success," said Heldt and Lehmann unisono - and the man with the plastic bag also agreed.
WM-Fight in heavy weight
Hot duel in Bern: Time and again provocative challenger Kevin Johnson World Champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
After twelve hard rounds, however, the Ukrainians defended his heavyweight title according to the version of the WBC.
The judgment of the judges was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains the world champion of boxing.
The 38-year-old champion, according to the version of the association WBC, defeated the American Kevin Johnson unanimously on Saturdays in Bern according to points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko it was the third successful title defense after his comeback in October 2008.
The Ukrainians were already the world champions of WBO and WBC twice before.
Unfortunately, it did not work with the K.o., which everyone expected.
Klitschko expanded his balance to 39 victories in 41 professional battles, twice he had to be beaten for injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to take the first defeat in the 24th battle.
In front of some 17,000 spectators in the Berne Arena, the 2.02 meter-sized Klitschko wanted to dictate the struggle with his left hand.
The 11-centimetre-small Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, repeatedly excluded himself from the battle of the world champion, so that Klitschko could not decisively reach his dangerous rights.
Overall, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and tried to get over the rounds.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his beatings met the world champion only rarely.
After all, he is only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who went with Klitschko over the full distance of twelve laps.
The challenger had caused a few whirls before the struggle in the Swiss capital.
He insulted Klitschko as an ugly zombie who "can't do anything right".
On Friday, the champion was provoked to shake Johnson's sunglasses off his nose to see his eyes."
Fourth victory after Klitschko's comeback
Klitschko also remained victorious in his fourth fight after his comeback on 11 October 2008.
After almost four years of time off, he had beaten Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin at the time and had taken back "his" WBC belt, which he had previously had to give without a fight.
This year he defeated Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and in September Chris Arreola from the United States.
In this fight I got only one blow and am physically very good in shape, Klitschko had founded the quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains the union of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is the world champion of the WBO and IBF associations.
However, the Britishman David Haye wears the belt of the WBA after he was able to dethrone the 2,13-metre-long Nikolai Walujev in November.
Haye had previously cancelled a September-planned fight against Vitali Klitschko.
According to his doctoral company, he is already planning the fight against Klitschko at the Wembley Stadium in London.
Case Kunduz
Frontal attack from the opposition: Green leader J√ºrgen Trittin has called Defence Minister Guttenberg a liar for false information on the Kunduz affair.
SPD and Left demand clarification from the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the recent findings of Kunduz's air raid, the opposition minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has been consciously deceived.
The minister had said "Knowledge the untruth" to the deadly bombardment on two tank trucks in September, said Gr√ºnen-Fraktionschef J√ºrgen Trittin on Saturday in the ARD news broadcast "Dayshow".
It's referred to as a national: he lied.
The order for killing had been issued in disregard of the rules of the International Armed Force for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the substance of the report that NATO had read by Mr Guttenberg, said Trittin.
On Friday, it became known that the attack was not only about destroying the abducted vices, but also about specifically killing two Taliban leaders.
In the US air raid requested by the German Kunduz commander Colonel Klein, up to 142 people had been killed or injured, according to NATO investigation report.
On Saturday, Greens, SPD and Left asked Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to express himself immediately before the Bundestag and to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms Merkel has to clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the government's Afghanistan policy - and whether Chancellors, Bundeswehr and Intelligence have approved this new strategy, J√ºrgen Trittin and Green Collegiate Renate K√ºnast demanded.
Government spokesperson Ulrich Wilhelm firmly rejected the criticism.
The Chancellor's Office had not influenced concrete operations of the Federal Army in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, doubts had also been expressed about the backgrounds of the release of General Inspector Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert.
According to the SPIEGEL, the two Guttenberg have correctly and fully informed about the backgrounds of the tank truck attack.
Officially, they said they had denied the existence of NATO reports and denied the Minister sensitive details.
However, in the context of the two top officials, they stated that they had even pointed out to the Ministry of Defence several reports, including a two-sided document by the commander-in-chief Klein and a field hunter report.
Wichert is said to have asked for clarification of the facts in a letter, reports the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung".
He has not received an answer so far, it is said.
The Ministry did not comment on the allegations on Saturday and pointed out that this would be clarified in the Parliamentary Investigation Committee, which intends to constitute itself on next Wednesday.
Dream worlds
Some see images in a state of alertness and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in the mentally ill and in the intoxication of drugs, the boundaries between imagination and reality are blurred.
As long as it happens in sleep, everything is fine.
If we lie in our dark rooms with our eyes closed, we may freely surrender to the wildest ideas and imaginations.
However, those who experience traumatic conditions in the wake, see and hear things that others do not see or hear, in the modern Western world are usually considered crazy or drug addicts, at least as special.
However, such images and voices do not arise only in the psychologically ill or in the intoxication of drugs.
Blame is our imagination: the same neuronal processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels sometimes make sure that the boundaries between dream, madness and reality fade.
Dream-like altered awareness states can occur in a wide variety of forms, at best we call them visions, in the worst case madness.
Even though triggering and effect may differ, the visions of mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, Shamanian rapture states, psychoses and hallucinations can be traced back to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of the neural messengers of the brain - most importantly dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - is removed and the interaction of different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and insane thoughts occur very often during a schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity has no power over him anymore
The connection of madness and dream has occupied philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of dream in alert condition, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, observed in 1861 a "great similarity of error with dream conditions", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis, with all inconsistencies, delusions, sensory illusions of such".
It is autumn 2001 when Henning T. turns into a comic figure.
His body is two-dimensional and squeaky.
Gravity no longer has power over him, he floats on the ceiling.
He feels a step.
Behind it winged devils with blood-red, distorted frats, tooth-flickering.
They hunt him, kick him with heavy, flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels the pain all over the body.
Loud, evil voices roar from walls and radio.
He can no longer bear them, the voices that insult and insult him.
Henning T. pulls two cables out of the stereo system, knots them to a loop and fastens them to a hook on the ceiling.
It rises on a speaker and lays its loop around the neck.
Jumps.
The loop dissolves.
That's supposed to be a lesson to you, yelling at the voices in drum-felling choir, "go to the clinic and let you heal!"
Today, Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychosis, the last 2 years ago, the first almost 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoftive paranoid psychosis, he is also manic-depressive, he takes medications, against depression, the mania, the schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he's been married for three years.
In the psychosis, I've experienced worst fear and deepest despair, he says.
The tricks are cruel reality
About one percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia at least once in life, and in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common disease after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, those affected can no longer distinguish between the interior and the outside world, they get into an excruciating state that can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship or persecution.
Especially common is listening to voices - voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Also optical hallucinations are not uncommon.
The affected person can no longer separate important things from the unimportant, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like the dream, the psychosis also opens the locks for a flood of ideas and fantasies that originate from deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in the psychosis is subject-centered, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, Chief Physician of the Department of General Psychiatry at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is at the center of the event, everything has a meaning directed towards it.
At the same time, he gets into a passive role, he is overwhelmed, as in the dream, by the events and cannot actively shape them.
Thus, schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
They are usually not able to balance reality; the tricks are cruel reality, awakening is excluded.
Once in a lifetime a hallucination has to be experienced
Unlike in the dream, says Fox, "but the sensual and spatial structure of the reality perceived in the psychosis remains in principle."
The insane thoughts and hallucinations are in reality, the alienation of the experience takes place in the real context.
Why exactly our brain beats caprioles still presents a mystery to researchers.
Exceptional states can lead to a short-term loss of reality in any human being, says Fuchs.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that the genes are not the sole determining factors.
Researchers assume that minimal brain damage is present in the affected.
We suspect that the neuronal maturity of the brain is disturbed at an early stage of development, due to a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, for example, explains Fox.
But there remains a mystery as to how the disorder of the neuronal system comes about, which, moreover, does not manifest itself for many years at all.
Environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can trigger a psychosis when the disposition is present.
Hallucinogenic drugs can also trigger psychosis as they intervene in the transmitter system.
When Our Brains Run Hot
The crazy one is, psychologists suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive medications to get rid of them, others spend money on drugs to get some, says L√ºbecker psychology professor Erich Box.
Whether trickery is felt to be pleasant or unpleasant is often only a question of the point of view.
Box has been collecting reports on hallucinations and trickets for ten years, last year he evaluated his results in the book "The Irregular World in Our Head".
Hallucinations are among the typical accompanying symptoms of psychosis, but also of amazing many other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as borderline or depression, these often include diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's and cerebral trauma.
Surprisingly, even the brain of healthy people is hallucinated under certain conditions.
Hallucinations, says Box, are composed of memory contents that are normally held back.
They arise when brain areas where sensory perceptions are processed are overactive or too little inhibited; when our brain runs hot or if stimulation is missing.
Drugs can cause this condition as well as brain damage or psychosis.
But also irritation, stress, pangs of love or other mental exceptions.
In recent studies, up to a third of respondents reported having experienced hallucination at least once a lifetime.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old and lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and attends the gymnasium there.
A normal girl, actually.
If there weren't the pictures and voices.
During the break, it may happen that a sluggish boy with long, dark hair appeals to it.
When it answers him, the fellow students look at it surprised - no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think the shy girl is a crazy daydream, but Sarah K. doesn't dream, she knows.
She's awake, she hears and sees this boy just as she hears and sees the girl in the bank next door.
She can even feel his presence, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is that she likes the boy.
Am I crazy?, she sometimes wonders.
But she knows that this boy and the other tricks are not real and are disappearing again.
At night, the apparitions are mostly frightening
Often the trick images are also a burden.
When she sits in the classroom, she sometimes cannot follow the teaching material, because the teacher in her eyes and ears is just presenting a new fellow student, while he explains mathematical equations for everyone else, listening and visible on the table.
At night, the apparitions are mostly frightening.
When she waits for sleep in her dark room, which comes far too rarely and too late, she often cannot distinguish whether she is awake or already dreaming, whether the pictures she sees appear in front of her open or closed eyes, the frets or the girl with the bleeding cut wounds on her arms and legs.
Leave me alone, she screams at the figures.
Parents and friends don't tell her that they think they're crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She passed her high school last year and lives with her friend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Ever since she contacted the psychologist box on the Internet, she knows she's not crazy.
Wahn is also a work of art from despair
If someone is socially isolated or suffers from irritation, he is likely to have hallucinations after a while, says Box.
I guess the brain is then underworked and cares for its conversation itself.
Sarah K., a single child, was afraid of other children as a little girl, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when at the age of 13, she learned that the man she calls Papa, since she can think, is not her physical father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations involve the same brain areas, which also process real impressions and sounds, it is difficult for those affected, such as Sarah K, to distinguish tricks and reality. "Every experience," says Box, "is taking place in the brain, the reality is pictured there.
Hallucinations are also images that cause the brain to develop, which is why they seem so real."
Also, nocturnal dream pictures value box as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, mental health is able to recognize their tricks as false.
Box therefore advises his patients to value hallucinations as a special ability.
Border state between dream and hallucination
Unfortunately, in our overly conscious world, imaginary experience is mostly pathological, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, Professor of Heidelberg and Chief Doctor of the Clinic for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at the Florence Nightingale Hospital in D√ºsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful disease, but it also carries positive, creative - madness is also a work of art from despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has explored the so-called uneirode form of experience, a particular form of trauma-changed wake awareness.
Oneiroides are highly complex, detailed quasi-dreams, which the experienced considers to be real and which he cannot distinguish from the wake-up state afterwards.
The oneeiroid state of consciousness arises in trauma or disease-related extreme situations, for example in polyradiculitis patients who experience motor paralysis in full consciousness.
When a person is threatened with self- and world loss, for example by persistent, complete inability to move, he replaces the life-threatening real situation with his own, imaginary world decoupled from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of border state between dream and hallucination.
Since dealing with a situation in reality is not possible, a world change takes place, but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
An intense form of meaning and sense in a situation that is unbearable in itself, which allows humans to be able to design themselves, not to fall into nothing of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
The Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his oneiroid experiences in his book "Change of Heart" as a rescue action of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness goes on trips for days after a heart valve operation followed by heart transplant, while his body at the intensive care centre is condemned to motionlessness.
Clausen dives into a self-created world, visits strange times and places: he experiences himself as a bedridden, old man, aboard a train sanatorium, a robot watches over his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among nobles who produce intoxicants from blood.
It is carried away by a Greek on the motorcycle in its homeland, surfs with its hospital bed in the fir snow of the Alps and meets a Korean mafioso.
He comes up completely in the imagined events, everything is real, even later in memory.
These inner journeys are fundamentally different from every dream for Claussen.
Dream is another state, he describes his experience.
In contrast, the memories from mental journeys are still obvious to me after years and in minor details.
More clearly and intensively even than truly experienced.
The intensity of this experience exudes the horizon of our other worldly experiences, says the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, oneiroids, psychosis, hallucinations and drug noise show how fragile our inner images of external reality are also in the wake.
Every change in the state of consciousness, the psychologist sums up box, "may lead to a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be enriching.
The snowfall can come
Burda
Children are to take over the publishing house at 27 years of age
The new publisher head Kallen is an intermediate solution: In the long run, Hubert Burda wants to give his company into the hands of his two children, he told the SPIEGEL.
The holding company will continue to belong to 100 percent of the family in the future.
Hamburg - The publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the long term.
Both children inherit at the age of 27 and have the firm will to enter the company, the 69-year-old told the SPIEGEL.
We have provided for the details of this.
The question of whether they are also active in the company arises only after that.
The question is also whether they are in a position to do so.
One cannot introduce 7500 employees to his children if they are not adequately qualified.
That kills the children and the company, too.
On Thursday, Burda announced that he was withdrawing from the board of directors from January and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
The 52-year-old Kallen has been a member of the board at Burda since 1999.
At first, he was responsible for technology.
Later, with the Treasury sector, the responsibility for the company's assets came, and after the withdrawal of J√ºrgen Todenhofer also the responsibility for direct marketing, abroad, printing and finance.
For the first time, no family member is at the head of the publishing house.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who is 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
The designation of Kallen also serves to bridge "10, 15 years", says Burda.
The holding should continue to belong to 100 percent of the family in the future, said Burda.
In view of the cases of Schickedanz and Schaeffler, Burda said that family companies are not safe from the downfall: "This always concerned families that were infected by a capital addiction that had been completely speculated and thought they could rise to the very big player.
My strategy was never that.
He never had world power dreams, Burda said.
I don't see myself as the political preceptor of this country, as it was Springer, and I don't want to play with 'Time' in the World League, these stores have become too big.
Perfect Beauty
Everything you want in terms of beauty and well-being is now at your disposal.
At least this is what El Corte Ingl√©s has done, who recently opened a shop with an area of more than 1000 m2 in the shopping centre in Callao (Madrid), in which everything is only about personal care.
In the wellness area, which is located on the eighth floor, you will find well-known companies such as Hedonai, who provide for a dehairing with laser; Spaxi√≥n, with rooms for relaxation and beauty treatments; the hairdressers Luis & Tachi, Marina d'Or with a fitness studio or L'Occitane with their natural cosmetics.
However, there is also a food department that stands out through its tea house with more than 130 different teas.
Enjoy a relaxing massage together with your partner while at the same time having a fantastic view of the capital, or for two hours renting the relaxation area to put your own "beauty party" with eight friends on your feet and then relax in the hot tub or with massages and a glass of champagne, these are just some of the many possibilities that Spaxi√≥n offers.
The total area is 250 m2, which is divided into 12 rooms for the latest facial and body treatments as well as for hydrotherapy.
For example, for cavitation in the fight against cellulitis or with vibrating surfaces.
The fitness studio also has this kind of equipment, there are also virtual trainers who take care of the training units of the customers and thus offer them a completely personal training.
You start a training unit by entering a personal password on a touchscreen that is located opposite the devices.
After that, various videos will show you how to perform your training sessions properly.
The head of the gym ensures that 15 minutes (including warming up and stretching exercises) are sufficient to train the body muscles.
And if you want to look past the hairdressing salon after you have trained your body, Luis & Tachi has a room where treatments are offered to regain hair splendour, shine and health for your hair in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to be the key words for this wellness area in the middle of the city, which is always open from 10 a.m. until 10 a.m. in the evening 365 days a year.
The Most Different Decollet√©s
Christmas is getting closer and closer, and that's why it's a good opportunity to copy the look of the stars and get their clothes in our wardrobe.
The shape of the decollet√©, which is very important for highlighting the silhouette, is one of the points to consider.
Here are some proposals.
The singer Fergie has chosen an exaggerated and very complicated decollette. You can only advise.
Endesa and Barcelona by car
The electricity company Endesa created the "LIVE Office" together with the city of Barcelona.
This is a project to develop and promote the electric car in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE Office" (Logistics for the introduction of the electric car) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the introduction of the electric car in the city and make agreements on mobility by managing, coordinating, subsidizing, etc.
On the other hand, the project "LE" is being developed to promote the electric car and to summarize opinions and actions of the areas involved.
This is an attempt to advance the means of transport of the future.
3 "electric cities"
However, Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville are also participating in this project.
These are the three cities selected by the government to accelerate the introduction of the electric car.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Government of Catalonia (la Generalitat).
This framework agreement aims to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These activities include activities related to energy and, in particular, to its performance.
However, it is by no means the only initiative in which Endesa participates in the promotion of the electric car.
The company participates in standardisation groups across Europe and maintains a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees "a horizon of calm" for the automotive sector
The President of the Government, Jos√© Luis Rodr√≠guez Zapatero, prophesied by the Spanish automotive industry, which is the country's largest exporter, "a horizon of peace".
In the presentation of the 2009 Economic Report by the President of the Government, Zapatero recalled once again the measures launched by the government to support the automotive sector during the government year.
"Without the plan for the competitiveness of the automotive industry, today we would have a panorama of neglect and the closure of some of our main production plants," said the President of the Government.
"Thanks to this plan and the willingness of the car manufacturers to continue to produce in Spain in a very competitive industry, we can see a calm horizon for this industry, which is our largest export industry," he added.
He also recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, which is part of the overall automotive industry plan (PIA), provided EUR 800 million for projects by 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which in turn provided investments of more than EUR 3 billion.
The Head of Government stated that these investments were intended both for the development of new models and for the modernisation of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also underlined the government's action to stimulate demand, in line with Plan 2000E, which is applied in cooperation with the Autonomous Communities and car manufacturers.
According to the head of government, this plan allows exhaust gases to be reduced by 6% on average in the new vehicles sold on the Spanish market, which in turn led to a "strong increase" in the registrations which increased "by 40 percent" in November.
On 20,000 quadrometer classic vehicles

Mazda3 i-Stop: Environmental Sportiness
Mazda would like to prove that sportiness is quite compatible with the protection of the environment.
For this reason, Mazda recently introduced the automatic stop and start system of the engine, named i-stop, in the Mazda3 model, which is currently only available for the 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
This second generation of Mazdas 3 stands out by its good grades in the overall picture.
The final processing, the design of the vehicle, the comfort, its street behavior, the mechanics, the i-stop system ...
All these aspects are "very good" in the new Mazda3.
Starting with the front seats, it can be found that the front seats offer excellent ergonomics and good grip.
Furthermore, the game of the steering wheel is excellent.
As you continue to look at the unit, which consists of the instrument board and the dashboard, you can see that Mazda is red and blue with a variety of buttons and switches in the eye-catching colors, on the same line as the Japanese trend towards a futuristic interior design.
This style reminds us partly of the style of Honda Civic.
That is why it can easily be said that both the Mazda 3 and the Civic, both Japanese models, stand out from the sobriety of the German automobiles, especially the Volkswagen Golf, which all want to surpass.
The passenger room of these two Japanese compact cars offers more than ever the appropriate comfort so that four adults can drive comfortably by car.
All of this comes with a large and clearly shaped trunk.
The stop- and start-up system is now only available for the 2-litre petrol engine with 150 hp and a 6-speed circuit.
This engine is a real pleasure. It stands out by its fineness, its quiet sounds, its performance and its low consumption.
And all those who do not travel many kilometers a year should consider this i-stop with petrol engine because of its great comfort in switching gears and its low consumption, even though at Mazda especially the diesel models are the most sold.
With regard to the equipment, the so-called Sportive model selected for the test run is a special feature, since it has a much larger number of elements from the standard equipment.
From the serial equipment, the RVM stands out in particular from the driver for the change of lanes, which eliminates the dead angle, but also also the controls for traction and stability, speed control, light-sensitive inside mirrors, the on-board computer with a large screen, the sensors for parking, independent air conditioning, rain and light sensors, Bluetooth and audio bluetooth as well as the chromed 17-inch rims.
In addition, this version also includes, as if this were not yet enough equipment, the Premium package, which includes the following for additional 1,500 euros: in addition to other elements, especially the learning Bixenon headlights and the sound system BOSE with CD-charger.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is particularly outstanding in terms of the materials used, because of its driving behaviour and the variety of equipment.
In addition, those who do not travel many kilometres a year can also buy the i-stop version, which is only available with a 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
The only negative thing about this model is its slightly high price, which is between 21,770 euros for the luxury model and 23,270 euros for the trial-driven model Sportive.
In return for this high price, however, the Mazda3 offers us every day the highest driving pass.
A premiere with lots of glamour
L. A. rolls out the red carpet of sensuality for Pen√©lope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premiere of "Nine" the stars, dressed in models that look as elegant as sexy, were shining more than ever.(Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as elegant as ever, chose a dark "Lady" dress.
The promises of FonPeek
Peek is very limited, a device with which you can only read your emails without having a chance to see certain attachments or surf the Internet.
It enjoyed its five minutes of fame when it chose Time magazine as one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the street is rather unlikely, but the idea in itself is still of particular interest to young people.
Unlike the smartphones, Peek costs very little and has a very cheap flat rate, for example only half of the price of the flat rate of an iPhone.
After the company has seen the success of this, it has launched two new devices: one that is intended for Twitter only, the other with a lifelong free service for data, quite unlike the Peek, in which one has to pay a six times higher price.
Fonpeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same limits as its American counterpart, however, has a surprise ready.
The monthly maintenance price for the telephone, about 12 euros a month, includes roaming for the whole of Europe.
Those who travel around the world with a smartphone already know what it means to have to do without all the data in order to be able to read their emails as soon as you cross the border or if you are desperately looking for a caf√© with WIFI (or a connection with Fon).
The idea of roaming with flatrate is incredibly seductive and should have been possible for a long time.
It is true that some telephone providers already offer special contracts and prices for stays abroad, but in my experience you already need a doctorate in physics and a good glasses in order to be able to read all the small prints.
The repeated criticism of affordable roaming tariffs for Europe as a whole by the European Commission has almost always been ignored.
Outside of your own country, you are always afraid of reading your emails and that is right.
That a small device such as FonPeek (which is always amazing that it has the name Fon, although it does not have Wi-Fi/WLAN) can offer this kind of tariff, means that telephone providers must change their mind slowly, but safely and start to consider different ways to use their data network.
Kindle is another good example of this, its prices include downloading books and further requests on the Internet.
Without vet and no hooks.
This is an Internet-enabled device, and you pay for it only once, that is, at the time of purchase, and not month by month.
And that's exactly what I expect from FonPeek one day, a purchase option with lifelong internet access as the Peek already offers in the USA.
And that's not because I want to buy it.
I read my emails with the phone, thank you.
But I expect this because I believe that it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The fetish color of Michelle
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the American First Lady.
Even when Barack Obama took office as president of the United States, she appeared in a dress and a coat of this color and chose the same color again to accompany him in his, no doubt, second most important moment in his life: the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama wore very similar models on both occasions: besides that it was almost the same color - a shiny greenish yellow -, the clothes consisted of three parts - dress, jacket and coat made of the same fabric, and for that she wore a slightly groovy embroidered or a necklace.
It even goes so far that at first sight it appeared that the First Lady of the United States wanted to follow the example of the Princess of Asturias and decided to wear the same dress on more than just one occasion.
However, the two clothes differ greatly in the type of fabric they are made of.
At the introduction she wore a dress made of lace and in Oslo a patterned velvet.
Also the accessories were different: for the first time green shoes with half-high heels and for the second time a similar model, but gold color.
Also the hairstyle was different every time: the hair was put up on this occasion as a hairbreadth, while the hair was open on the previous occasion.
75% of working mothers have had problems at work because of their motherhood
Discrimination in work has increased in recent years, especially among the younger women who want to have children.
This is the result of the study "Fruitability and Career of Women in Spain" carried out by CSIC in cooperation with the Institute for Women.
The survey among 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 leaves no doubt about this: 75% of women in work view their career opportunities in the labour market as a result of their motherhood.
The study reveals that there are major differences in the decision to start a family and the number of children, depending on whether women work or not and if so what kind of occupation they practice.
Those of them who do no other work outside the house, work only half a day or have no fixed employment contract, are more likely to be mothers and have more children.
In contrast, women with fixed employment, especially in the public sector, move towards the creation of a family and motherhood and therefore have fewer children.
"The women in the age group between 35 and 49 with a fixed job receive their first child on average only 3.7 years after the contraction, a number that increases to 4.1 years for women with fixed employment who have needed longer to achieve this and who have only completed their contraction and the first child much later.
In addition, the type of work also has a major influence on maternity, although less than the calendar on the readiness to be conceived," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that must be taken into account in the age of women in marriage and the first child.
According to the survey, age at the time of marriage and the first child is the higher the level of education.
This difference could also be seen among women of the same age.
For example, women in the group aged 35 to 49 years, depending on whether they only have the upper secondary school or higher education, were on average with 25.1 or 32.1 for the first time.
There is also a further difference between women, depending on their level of education.
While the women are already getting married before their first permanent job and have their first child, the women with a middle or high school degree are doing it exactly differently and are only looking for a permanent job and getting married after it and then getting their first child, says Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
L'Or√©al Paris recently added a new name to its envious list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
Starting next year, the German actress will be the image of various products of the brand and will also say the popular advertising saying "Because you are worth it".
The leading actress from "Joyeux No√´l", one of the most elegant actresses at international level, will become another famous sign like Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spaniard Pen√©lope Cruz.
In front of her were the last to join this exclusive club the actress Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millonaire").
Among men, the cosmetics company also has only exceptional ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey ÃÅs Anatomy') and Matthew Fox (Gospel of Evangeline in Lost).
The award ceremony of the British fashion industry
The British have an important word to speak in the fashion world.
Their highest representatives - fashion designers and models, both yesterday and today - met at the annual award ceremony held in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
On this occasion they had all appeared.
The ex-model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was elected the best model this year.
The poker game by Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent presents in "Poker der Asse" (Alfaguara, images of Fernando Vicente) to the three x-rays of writers who accompanied him in his literary life (and, in some cases, in real life).
He does not use a predictable and fear-inducing genre (short biography, life and work), but looks for a similarity to the glowing heart of the Creator.
The journey is exciting and Vicent doesn't save on horrors or enlightenments.
Besides that this book is a delicious reading pleasure, it is also a moving invitation to read and read again and again.
Here are some excerpts from the book.
About Albert Camus: "When I read his pages, I found that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but rather a spiritual, almost sensual impulse, just as I always thought it would be, without having found words for it: the joy in contrast to the unwholesome fate, the morale without guilt and the innocence without any God".
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote about what he had in his blood, not in his mind, between ignorance and ignorance, with a stunning poetic humor, without any sense, like the knife blade that almost killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our husband was attracted by this woman, with a passion that lasted for thirteen years, to the extent that the flesh in which the emotions of adultery combined with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that was to enter heaven on the path of destruction."
About James Joyce: "The Odysseus" was published in Paris by Sylvia Beach in 1922. It is one of the 8000 peaks in worldwide literature, one has to climb up the north wall, on the wall where the best climbers try again and again."
About William Falkland: "He was a funny Kauz.
He sometimes said about himself that he was the heir of a landlord of the county and again other times he said he was the son of a black man and a crocodile.
Both dreams bore witness to a certain grotesque."
About Louis-Ferdinand C√©line: This writer recorded the insane cry, which was cried out from a bridge by that person from Munich, so that his echo, deep into the night of the 20th century, echoed in his literary way. This he made on a journey on which he fled from himself and, with a speech full of violence, begged afterlife before the worms.
About Dorothy Parker: "One day they knelt down and prayed: my dear God, I beg you to do everything in your power so that I may finally stop writing like a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave these verses of Spencer are engraved: 'the sleep after the effort,/ after the thunderstorm of the port,/ the rest after the war,/ after a full life one finds pleasure in death."
About Virginia Wolf: "In her luggage she always had her depression.
The husband took it with total normality when she told him that Eduard VII was spying them out between the azaleas or the birds were singing on Greek.
There is no other case known where the man showed so much patience and was in love with a neurotic whose literary talent was much worse than her craziness."
About P√≠o Baroja: "What else did Mart√≠n-Santos do than try to infuse Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet mean, if he didn't lead Baroja to the weapons of Falkland?
What did Cela do, except to destroy the glory of that man, so that he might put himself on this pedestal?"
Fig Aggression
My 70-year-old mother walked through our neighborhood last week in the village of Fuenlabrada, when suddenly a group of young people between 15 and 18 years of age came next to her and our dog, our dog is a mixed woman we brought out of the shelter and weighs just six kilos, and then out of the blue sky they missed him two footsteps and so badly hurt him.
We cannot put our indignation into words, because it is incomprehensible to us where the fun is supposed to be in a cheap aggression against a small and helpless animal that was carried out on the leash, of course.
In addition, the suffocation attack that a woman who was going for a leisurely walk received when she wanted to correct these persons on the basis of the incident even feared for her own life, for if such a madman attacks a dog, he may also do the same with a woman, a child, an older master or probably even with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The incident occurred in a normally quiet district at five o'clock in the afternoon on an ordinary Tuesday.
The dog's been crying all day.
Of course, we have returned to an ad in a nearby police station, but we have great doubts as to whether this will bring anything at all and to prevent any prejudices from the start, we just want to make it clear that the cowardly criminals were Spaniards.
Our indignation over the event has led us to indicate this incident.
We cannot understand what must be done in the minds of these young people, that they find a cheap attack on a helpless animal funny, on an animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and persons have remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
The tire manufacturer Michelin, in cooperation with the Spanish Transport Safety Foundation (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote helmet use, especially among younger motorcyclists, as both companies announced today.
This initiative aims to draw attention to the importance of helmet use, since it is ultimately the only protective element that can prevent head injury or even death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of her commitment to road safety, which "contains far more than just the design and manufacture of products that are becoming more and more safe every day" and further reaffirmed that they also contribute to the achievement of this goal every day with other actions of educational and informative character.
This new campaign for the promotion of helmet use on the motorcycle, which runs under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will distribute posters at over 500 motorcycle workshops in a first phase in order to achieve the best possible dissemination.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety is "a constant concern" of the company, and especially for the reason that, as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles, they are always committed to the fact that one of their main objectives must be the development of ever safer products.
The sale of small trucks is rising again
After almost two years, the car market for small transporters finally begins to see some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9.425 vehicles registered in Spain in November represent an increase of 12.6% in 2008 and, more importantly, they are thus the first growth ever after 22 consecutive months with steady decline, in accordance with the figures presented by the manufacturer association Anfac and the car dealer association Ganvam.
However, these good figures are currently only to be enjoyed with great caution, since the reference data used for comparison are November 2008, which was a particularly bad year of sales with a 60 % reduction in the previous year.
However, it must be borne in mind that, apart from the increase in the last month, the total authorisations of these 11 months are still 40% below the sales figures for the previous financial year.
Since January a total of 95,853 vehicles have been sold, but this number includes all the vehicles that make up the small transporter market: descendants of passenger cars, pick-ups, small vans, small vans and lighter vans/cars.
Moreover, the same thunderstorms are still in the sky, which cause the most demand, because even if some of the vehicles are bought by private individuals, the majority of sales to small and medium-sized enterprises that make the purchase with a third-party financing in almost 100% of all cases.
These restrictions, which are the result of the credit institutions being turned on, must include other factors, such as the increase in the rate of unemployment or the continuation of the poor economic situation.
In this panorama and in contrast to the passenger cars, the financial support has been of little help in buying a vehicle of Plan 2000E.
However, this plan is not only intended for private individuals, but also for self-employed and small enterprises, if they want to buy a small transporter up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emission, which must not exceed 160 grams per kilometre driven, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday, Ganvam had reminded us that it is essential for the state to pay special attention to these small trucks as well as, of course, to the industrial vehicles (last-cars and buses).
The car dealer association is forecasting for 2010 a year similar to that just before, for which it expects a sales failure (in the case of passenger cars and off-road vehicles) of 19 %.
Support for brake maneuvers in critical situations is now compulsory
As with the ABS anti-lock braking system at the time, and just as with the ESP stability control system, the emergency braking aid systems must become a requirement in European cars.
In fact, they are already compulsory for all newly approved passenger cars and light mini-carriers, and for the remaining vehicles a time limit has been set until the end of February 2011.
The action taken by the European Union aims to improve the protection of pedestrians, but these braking systems can also help to prevent many accidents due to their operation.
The task of the emergency brake assistant is to exert more pressure on the brakes in the event of a critical brake maneuver, which the system detects on the brake pedal using the brake strength executed by the driver.
However, this system does not exercise this pressure until the end.
According to an investigation commissioned by the component manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles, a third of the drivers involved in an accident did not have to enter the brake pedal before the collision and half of them had not braked with full force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The brake aid, on the other hand, intervenes in the braking system with maximum force and thus reduces the braking time and thus also the brake distance that a car takes during the braking process.
According to an EU study, every year up to 1,100 fatal accidents affecting pedestrians could be prevented if all cars were equipped with this type of emergency brake assistant.
There would be even fewer accidents - one expects that every fourth accident could be prevented with personal damage - as soon as the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems become popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that detects obstacles (by radar or a camera) and warns the driver, while at the same time exerting a slight pressure on the brakes.
If the driver responds, the system helps him increase the pressure on the brake pedal if it becomes necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the collision is inevitable, the brake assistant exerts the maximum pressure on the brakes in order to keep the damage as low as possible.
General Motors moves the plan for Opel until January
While the staff of the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) had already been informed by Nick Reilly, the new Chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April, probably on 8th, according to Javier Ortega, the American vehicle manufacturer points out that it takes more time to complete the Opel rescue plan.
Nick Reilly, the new chairman of GM Europe, wants to achieve that the site concerned already gives its consent to each point of the plan in advance.
And for this reason, it may be that the final document, which will be presented first to the workers and then to the governments of the countries in which there are works, will move until the beginning of 2010.
However, GM is assured that it will make a decision on the sale of Saab in the next few days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased pressure on the American car manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to be in contact with some potential new buyers.
One of these buyers could be Geely, who would also like to buy Volvo, but the option of the Dutch manufacturer of Skyper sports cars, who has back cover by the Russian group Converg, is gaining ever stronger support.
If none of these buyers were to reach an agreement, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year, if it has not been sold until then, will continue to be maintained.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive jewels, the engineers used the Boxster S as a basis and really managed to make it easier by 80 kilos, which makes it only 1,275 kilos.
In order to create such a thing, they were the first to abandon the automatic folding roof, which was replaced by a tent screen roof with a manual drive, so that only 21 kilos were saved; thanks to the aluminium doors used in this model such as those of the GT3 "disappear" another 15; by taking out the air conditioning again 13; moreover, the fuel tank was reduced from 64 to 54 litres, thus saving another 7 kilos; by installing sporty Bacquet seats again 12 and with the light 19-inch rims again five.
Then another six kilograms less had been achieved by the renunciation of the audio system CDR-30 and by the replacement of door handles by handles of fabric the missing kilo.
Although it is also available with the double-coupling transmission PDK, the test drive was carried out with a 6-speed hand-driven vehicle, mainly on the smaller country streets of California, on mountain routes that were really very curvy.
When driving, you can only give him the note perfectly.
However, the reduction in his weight has by no means led to the fact that he would no longer be so safe on the road.
It is rather the opposite: for a long time we have no longer tried such a small and light model, but at the same time it also gives you a feeling of great security at the curves, even at high speed.
He is a small athlete, able to warm his muscles at a low course in the required time, until we give him the orders to race, brake, recover and then take everything out of his engine again...
The car does everything we can with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to its steering, which is as communicative as it is precise.
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon.
A motor sound for all tastes
The sound of its V6 boxer with 320 hp (10 more than the Boxster S) has been very successful and you can even increase it with the 'sport' option as well as with a system that can change the engine noise, which was already used for the first time at the Panamera.
The acceleration power is unimaginable brutal, whether from standing out or when re-accelerating.
The suspensions are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the country streets on which we drove with the Boxster Spyder was already quite damaged, but the car mastered the punchholes well.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do on the entire route; and this, although we found ice in the morning gray and roll split in some of these curves in the morning.
In summary, you can say that it is an ultra-light car, a car with which you have an indescribable driving pass, as it is usually rare and in it is much more than just a small improvement of the Boxster Ss.
The car will be on the market in February 2010 and will cost EUR 70,831.
Bag Girl'
The singer, a bust friend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of the Coco Cocoon cosmetic line and an opportunity starlet at the fashion shows of 'maison', she presents her evil face with the same neck rigidity as her pockets of Chanel.
Much more than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl", she is a "Bag Girl".
Bassonia gives itself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboratory, despite the many outstanding players in the Dusko Ivanovic team, celebrated an excellent triumph with 82-91 on his visit to the complicated football field of Maccabi Electra and thus came first within his group after the grand performance of Mirza Teletovic, who was the best of his team with eight triples (29 at the review).
The team from Vitoria was able to replace the significant failures of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Mikov with a large dose of dedication and teamwork, even though they had to wait until the bitter end of their victory.
The great hits out of the perimeter with 16 rated triples contributed significantly to their final victory.
The game began with the lead of the blue reds who sat at the top of the scoreboard from the beginning.
Since the first four baskets of the team from Vitoria were already coming out of the perimeter, it was already possible to imagine that they had come to the field with well-heated wrists.
It was English and Teletovic, who were mainly responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was hardly different, only that the team from √Ålava chose a Barac's internal game and the Eliyahu game, which was received on his return to the team with whiffs and applause, which is his home to extend their advantage until the break (34-43).
Teletovic has already begun to highlight himself as the best of his team with 13 points, even if the "minus six" rating of Splitter already suggested that this would not be the best evening of the Brazilian.
Nevertheless, despite the obvious advantage in the break, the game was not yet decided and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Vitorians once again that not everyone wins on their field, and thanks to the repeatedly attacking "Hand of Elias" they came back to play.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the fact that the "yellow" turned the row (50-49).
More Disadvantages
The team of Ivanovic, injured, but anything but dead, had to prepare a few moves with safety to get air again and one of them suddenly came the gun of Mirza Teletovic, who with three almost consecutive triples and with the support of English and Ribas made sure that on the scoreboard was again a calming distance from (54-67) which the host could beautify at the end of the third quarter with (57-67).
The Alivesen were blushed in the last quarter and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already announced that they would not allow anyone to take away the victory they had earned honestly in the first three minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson resigned, not the best of their team and tried to give their team strength again through three points from the line (70-77).
Nevertheless, and even though Splitter was put out of place because of Fouls, Ivanovic's team did not give up, defending itself well and although the Israelis were still catching up in the last minute (80-85), the game had already lost a winner and Tel Aviv for the first time this season.
Injuries prevented Unicaja‚Äôs forehead from being offered
Unicaja lost out in Greece against Olympiacos and had to assign the leadership in the group B of the Euroliga to him, and this was marked in a game characterized by the failures by the players of Unicajas (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially in the indoors, which facilitated the victory of the Greeks.
The M√°laga team was not afraid of the mood in the hall of peace and friendship, nor of the opposing team, which is perhaps one of the strongest in Europe and has a lot of money.
Thanks to their offered game in first quarter the Andalusians were allowed to start dreaming. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two of them by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, the hosts faded at 12-18 in the 9th minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the one Unicaja, even though the local team with an inner play between Bourusi, Vujcic and Schortsanitis managed to display the scoreboard in the 13th minute 22-20 in their favor, the minute in which it would almost have come to the beat between the two Americans Beverley and Williams and why both were disqualified.
The Greek team finally began to warm up and its superiority on both sides of the game, while the elimination of Englishman Joel Freeland due to an injury and the three errors of Carlos Jim√©nez themselves left clear traces at Unicaja.
Among its players in the inner field and the Lithuanian forerunner Linas Kleizas, with its triples, they increased their advantage in the 19th minute to 44-32.
A catch-up was impossible
The third quarter was characterized by many attacks against the Olympic team, which, despite its 19 losses, proved superior and even managed to offset the difference between the 66-48 game held in Malaga in the 27th minute, which in turn caused the leadership within the group to decline.
Unicaja tried to overcome the many failures and the elimination of the Scotlandn Robert Archibald who had been injured during the game.
Despite the many disadvantages for Unicaja in the 31st minute, thanks to the leadership and triples of Cook and the use of Lewis, some hope came to 66-57.
Nevertheless, it was actually impossible because the Olympiacos, as soon as it attacked and showed its superiority with centimeters within the basket area, could not be braked.
The Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic managed in the 37th minute to increase the basket difference to 81-62 and Unicaja had to give himself beaten and had to abandon the leadership toOlympiacos.
How much should you earn from your profile in Facebook?
Thanks to the new application Trovit, the search engine with most ads of real estate, job offers and cars in Spain, the users of Facebook can now learn their salary that they should earn due to their profile.
The "How much should you earn?" tool calculates the user's salaries on the basis of more than 140,000 job offers available at Trovit in Spain. Users can enter a form on Facebook in which their profession, professional experience, age and city in which they work.
After a week after the application was first available, the search engine found that the worker feels "bad pay on average", explains Albert Ribera, responsible for the product Trovit, in a press release.
The Spanish are the worst paid according to the data that Trovit has through its search engines in Great Britain and France.
A British programmer receives an annual gross salary of 45,226 euros and a Frenchman 31,059 euros, as opposed to the 24,000 euros a Spaniard deserves.
As a result, a truck driver has an annual net salary of 34,247 euros in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 euros in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid work in Spain is that of a waiter with an annual price of 11,592 euros; followed by the work of a seller with 14,725 euros and that of a worker with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the Internet in the last three months are those of a driver, half-day jobs and social workers.
Brazil calls Zelaya a date to leave
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya's stay at her Embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The President removed from office must leave diplomatic representation by 27 January 2010 at the latest if his mandate expires officially.
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegate of the Brazilian Embassy in the Hunduran capital, confirmed to TV TV Globo that "Mel" knew that before that date he must have left the message in which he had found asylum since September 21.
"He is aware that he must leave on January 27th, as his mandate expires on that day and he has to look for a new accommodation."
The station also quoted the ex- president, who confirmed his intention to leave the message before the fixed date: "My point of view is to go as soon as possible, logically with the back cover of the government of Brazil," Zelaya explained on the phone.
After the elections on 29 November (where Porfirio Lobo was the winner) Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian Embassy until January.
However, this week he tried to get refuge in Brazil.
However, this failed due to the refusal of Zelayas to recognize the status of an asylum-seeking politician who wanted to impose on him the "de facto" government chaired by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you!
After the most tempting days since last spring, when the inflation of assets was the dominant mood in the markets, uncertainty has returned to the markets, which is in no way surprising, since this is its natural condition, in an environment where brokers make decisions about a naturally uncertain future.
The measure applied to stabilizing the markets was to settle the debt with the direct purchase of assets and indirectly leave the liquidity free at interest rates moving around zero so that banks buy assets for billing.
The central banks have already confirmed that asset direct purchases are almost finished and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, they are starting to spread some sand into the drive, as the BCE n√§c already suggested with its annual auction, which will take place next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without these heterodox measures and we are now witnessing a reverse in reducing risk premiums.
The fleets of the stock exchanges and the differences in corporate bonuses are rising again, although they are still far away from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
The states were forced to state the private risks and sovereign debt rose again.
We now rely on quality again and the USA, Japan and Germany are the preferred resort of investors, which in turn leads to an increase in the differences in the countries of the eurozone in relation to Germany.
Until now, Spain had hardly been affected by this episode of instability, but then came Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new revision downwards regarding the assessment of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty does not harm to silence the defenders of the moral risk who once again tried to raise awareness among those responsible for world economic policy, for what they had caused, because they had slowed down the devastating effects of limiting credits to job losses when they should have decided on a new day of thank-giving.
Nevertheless, what happened in Dubai points to a tribal war between the Emirs in order to restore power in the Emirates and the development in Greece has already been predicted.
A government that conceals the debt of the state, elections and a new government that draws the same line.
Prodi made it in Italy to Berlusconi and S√≥crates in Portugal to Dur√£o Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to save Hungary from non-fulfilling its foreign payments at the beginning of the year and thus allow a euro-member country to cease to fulfil its obligations.
On the other hand, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and to include its citizens in the obligation to maintain the stability of state funds when it comes to the need for extra-ordinary measures.
Yes, we are as expected before an episode of normalization of risk premiums, after some excesses on too high amounts, would now be within the expected amount.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to worry as long as the differences in public debt increase at the same rate as European corporate bonuses.
However, if the European differences were to be reduced and the Spanish increased further, this would be a special Spanish risk.
The standard & Poor's is a farce. While the local preferred indicators force a large part of the market research institutes to prefer their scenarios for recovery and correct their scenario up for 2011, including the OCDE and the European Commission, which come back with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, all this does not promise a long service life despite warnings.
Once again, it seems that it is an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish shares, although at the moment "Care in driving" is promised.

The President of Iberdrola, Ignacio S√°nchez Gal√°n, was the first to appear yesterday in front of the subcommittee of Parliament, where in these days the strategy on the energy supply of Spain will be debated over the next two decades.
After his appearance, followed by the chairman of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Gal√°n gave the press some clues about what he had submitted to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to the chairman of Iberdrola, by 2020 Spain will have to invest EUR 50 billion and a further EUR 60 billion from that date until 2030, provided that the current nuclear power plants continue to operate.
If this were not the case, the investment needed would not amount to 60 billion but to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that it is no longer necessary to invest in an increase in energy production capacity, but in distribution networks and international alliances.
From 2020 onwards, the issue will change and performance should be increased.
His proposal focuses both on gas and coal plants with facilities for the collection of carbon dioxide and, of course, mainly on renewable energies.
In this case, it assumes that 18,000 MW more is needed, under the pre-condition of course by other "support energies".
Gal√°n, who believes that the draft law for a sustainable economy, which has just been adopted by the government, is in line with what his company has demanded, did not want to say anything about this law, how to create incentives for national coal consumption, which would be exactly the opposite of all political strategies in the fight against climate change.
In his opinion, "in the long term, we are putting clearly on this direction, despite some individual measures", as the chairman of Iberdrola called it.
Whether it is like it or not, Gal√°n believes that decisions on investment should be taken already now, even if they are long-term, as it will take some time and a stable remuneration framework will have to be set up to tackle them.
Ferrovial gets the "handling" of Aer Lingus at ten airports
Ferrovial‚Äôs subsidiary for airport services on the ground, Swiss Swiss port, is the preferred partner of the Irish Flu Company Aer Lingus for luggage service at ten European airports where they are represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The agreement, to which no figures have yet been published, is set out for five years.
On the other hand, yesterday Ferrovial, the Government of Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcal√° de Henares signed a protocol for cooperation with a view to creating an innovation centre for intelligent infrastructures.
The alliance plans to invest 20 million by 2012, of which 50% will be from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be to investigate energy efficiency at motorways and airports.
Acciona competes with Hochtief and Bouygues for its first motorway construction in Australia
Acciona is fighting for the approval of its first motorway in Australia, a market in which they are already represented as energy and water companies.
The construction is a tunnel that will cost 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about 1.047 billion euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German high depth are its competitors.
A five-kilometre tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for Acciona to establish itself in the country as a construction company and motorway operator.
The city administration wants to complete the construction at the end of 2014.
After the administration has chosen public-private cooperation (PPP is the English abbreviation) to advance the project according to a business plan established by Ernst & Young, the administration is already in possession of a final list of candidates for construction and toll management.
In anticipation of the offers presented in May, the estimated investment amounts to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1,047 billion euros), with three consortia, mainly composed of European construction companies, competing with each other in the last phase.
The group named Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first company is one of Australia's largest construction companies, while the second is based in Italy, one of the best civil engineering specialists.
The Acciona team is represented by the Consortium Northern Direct, formed by the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield, which is responsible for the infrastructure and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium, which is in the narrower choice, is called LBRJV, made up of the capital of the Australian Leighton (the subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, which in turn belongs to ACP), the local Baulderstone (in possession of the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the French company Razel, which specializes in public construction.
The Australian market for infrastructure promises enormous construction and privatization, but has a barrier to overcome, because only by buying a local construction company can you be admitted.
A strategy that has been followed by the said companies Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and which still needs to be pursued by the Spanish construction giants.
Even ACP has gained access to this market only through its participation of 30 % in high depth, owner of the said Leighton.
Millions of assets
Acciona is of the utmost importance in this geographical area for the sector in which it is already very well known due to its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination industry.
Among other assets, it already has its largest windmill park (192 MW) in Victoria and heads the group of companies commissioned to build and manage Adelaide's desalination plant with a budget of 700 million.
Its intention is now to consolidate itself in these two areas and to use these synergies to gain access to the construction and infrastructure branches.
The subterranean toll route, which is funded by the Office for Infrastructure of the City of Brisbane and is called Northern Link (Nordic Tower), is intended to connect the western highway in Toowong with the bypass road in Kelvin Grove (see map) on a length of 5 kilometres through tunnels, which is the largest measure to reduce congestion on the streets of Brisbane.
The timetable issued by the city administration provides for the award of the summer 2010 and the start of the construction work in December of next year.
Even if this toll route is already intended to open up to traffic in the last months of 2014, construction work is expected to continue until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
It has two lanes in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
With 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros), the Queensland government is involved in the financing.
For high depth Brisbane is already a big business.
Australia is again and again granting considerable orders to high depths, which yesterday signed a contract with the government of 154 million.
The sub-contractor ACS will improve the infrastructure of the domestic broadband network with fiber optics by means of its domestic subsidiary Leighton.
This improvement will provide fast Internet access for 400,000 people and will employ the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the construction project of the King George Tower with 27 floors in Brisbane, Australia. Construction work has not yet begun and high depth has received 129 million.
Also in the United Kingdom, in Manchester, it competes with Laing O'Rourke for the construction and administration of two schools to 25 years.
Initial investments amount to 75 million euros.
FCC receives the order for a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
Through its subsidiary Alpine, FCC has provided itself with the construction of a tunnel over 2.1 kilometres in length for a motorway in Slovenia over the sum of 64.5 million euros.
The company received this contract only a few days after it had received the award for the construction work to expand the Bosruck tunnel (Austria) over 130 million.
In this way, Alpine strengthens its experience in tunnel construction.
The start of the construction work is planned for the beginning of 2010 and its execution will last over 32 months.

Renfe has credited the advertising and marketing services for the next two years to the agency SRA. Rushmore over a sum of about three million euros annually, the railway company reported.
In this contract there is also the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Sra. Rushmore has been selected among 16 agencies which presented themselves to this competition, of which 4 came into the final round, TBWA, which has been responsible for advertising over the last three years.
From now on, SRA. Rushmore will be commissioned to design and manufacture the campaigns.
Punishment over 63 million for France T√©l√©com for the out-of-competition brake.
The Competition Authority in France has imposed a penalty of more than EUR 63 million on France T√©l√©com for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean regions.
According to the Authority, the telephone provider has restricted competition in fixed and mobile phones by signing exclusive contracts, pricing plans and loyalty programs for consumers on the margins of regulation.
Together with this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned companies have accumulated more than 560 million euros in penalties since 1994 because of the disability of its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday was even increased, since the authority that is watching over the competition believes that France T√©l√©com has committed similar violations in the past and has therefore fallen back.
Trafficking in use
On the other hand, the French company‚Äôs subsidiary has followed the example of other telephone providers and has opened an application trading site on the Internet to increase the revenue from business not arising from the telephone connection.
In principle, this website of Orange is active in France and the United Kingdom.
One has to wait until 2010 until this victory will also be available in other countries, such as Spain.
The game at the Champions League has brought in Madrid and Bar√ßa 476.4 million since the beginning.
The Champions League has developed into a source of income for football clubs since 1992.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have since taken 476.4 million, which brings them third and fifth place in football clubs that have earned the most money in the league.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
To win the UEFA Champions League brings not only fame. It is also one of the main sources of revenue of the big clubs.
According to UEFA, the league has distributed up to ‚Ç¨5,362.5 million to the 105 teams (of which 12 Spanish), who have participated in this event since its foundation in the 1992/1993 season.
Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The white club is located in the third place in Europe, which has earned the most money through its participation and the only one who has won the trophy three times next to the AC Milan.
The previous Catalan champion and last winner of the 1992 European Cup has fifth place.
The list is led by Manchester United and Bayern Munich, two teams that also took the most money by participating in the past Champoins League.
And that even though they lost to Bar√ßa.
On the other hand, Spain is only in third place of the countries that could take money through the Champions, although it has more titles than all others (five, in contrast to four bee Italy, three with England and two with Germany).
Distribution
This obvious contradiction is explained by the complicated funding procedure applied by UEFA.
In this financial year, Michel Platini's chairman, the organization, expects revenue of 1,090 million from the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA provides 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 football clubs participating in the qualifying round (including the Atl√©tico de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who fought for participation received 3.8 million by their bloody presence, in addition to the 550,000 euros for each game they fought.
There is also a bonus for winning (800,000 euros) and for a final (400,000 per team).The clubs that have come to the eighth finals receive three million each; the four that have come into the quarter finals, 3.3 million.
The last four get 4 million each.
The winner earns 9 million, as opposed to the second, who receives 5.2 million.
For example, a football club receives at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million fixed revenue.
Bar√ßa in turn won the European Supercup in August.
However, the variable payments for which 337.8 million are planned will be added.
This money is allocated proportionally to the value of each individual television market.
The Spanish is one of the first and has 4 assigned places.
Last year's champion receives 40% of the allocated money, 30% of the second, 20% of the third place and 10% of the fourth place.
The other part is distributed according to the number of games they play at this year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million for 29.9% participation in Sos
Yesterday, the Nueva Rumasa group had details of the purchase offer of shares to purchase a ceiling of between 25 and 29.9% of Sos' capital.
A percentage that does not force them to make a public tender (opa) due to the number of shares.
In concrete terms, Nueva Rumasa offers 1,5025 euros per share, which are paid out for ten years and with an interest rate of 1 % per year due to this shift.
Yesterday, Sos shares closed with EUR 1.85, which is why Nueva Rumasa assessed 18% below the market value.
According to Nuevan Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real rating of Sos.
The offer is linked to the appointment of eight of the 15 consultants.
The group from Jerez gives shareholders a period of 15 days to communicate its interest in the sale of its shares.
CNMV assured that it had not been informed of this offer, although Ruiz Mateos confirmed that it had entered into contact with the Authority.
At a conclusion, the deposit would amount to 611.7 million, while the value of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos further restructures its management.
In an attempt to remain on the brink of possible sales offers and the judicial crusades of his ex-managers, the brothers Jes√∫s and Jaime Salazar announced the appointment of Mar√≠a Luisa Jord√° as head of the internal audit.
A decision that makes her the first woman to have a high position in the food business.
This is a newly created post, which is directly under the chairman of the Group.
This is anything but free from polemics, because the company is involved in a judicial battle because of suspicion of diverting more than 230 million from Sos to other companies of the Salazar family.
It cannot be excluded that Sos will shift further capital over the next few months.
With regard to Salazar's credit, former advisers Ildefonso Ortega and √Ångel Fern√°ndez Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) appeared before the National Assembly yesterday and confirmed that they had approved the move of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV approves the public exclusion of Paternina presented by the investment company Mer
The National Stock Exchange Commission (CNMV) approved the public exclusion invitation for Federico Paternina submitted by the investment company Mer on 9 October.
The supervisory authority stated that it approved this invitation to tender after it had been proven that the conditions of the laws were complied with and that the contents of the explanatory leaflet submitted, after the amendments of last 2 December, could be considered "sufficient".
CNMV has also announced that this offer aims at acquiring 550.008 shares of Federico Paternina at the price of 7.65 euros per share, which in turn represents 8.95 % of the company's capital, consisting of 6,142,786 euros in shares admitted to the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
In addition, it has been notified that 5.592.778 million shares have been fixed which can in no way be transferred until the end of the tender and whose price has been fixed by Federico Paternina in accordance with the laws.
New vehicle assessment programmes
In these days of storms and accidents not only the car workshops deserve
Each day, thousands of vehicles involved in an accident are towed into the workshops where an expert has to assess the damage caused and the costs of repair.
No accident is equal and the calculation of costs for parts and working hours can be a long and complicated task.
The calculation of repair costs of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros by hand, including parts and working hours, may take up to two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest computer tools, it is a matter of minutes
That is why almost 100 % of the experts use this type of system.
The service providers and application providers for the assessment of accidents and repairs shall collect the information they receive from the manufacturers to process them afterwards and offer them to their customers in the form of a useful program.
In Spain, Audatex, part of the American group Solera, is the market leader; 80% of all the opinions are produced with their products.
The two other companies competing in the tool market for evaluation and preparation of a report are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by the manufacturers is anything but simple.
According to Eduardo Vel√°zquez, sales manager of Audatex, 63 producers and importers are working together, each of whom provides the information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed is growing, up to the point that over the last five years more versions, variants and motorizations have come on the market than in the whole fifteen years before.
As soon as a new car enters the market, work starts for the companies.
It is a laborious task, because every single one of the thousand parts of the vehicle must be catabolized and its price entered.
In addition, each model creates an "intelligent" graphic image on which you can "click" on different parts of the vehicle.
If this is a much-sold model, work can be completed in one week if the procedure proceeds quickly.
If this is a less common car, it may take up to three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information at 99.2% of the cars sold in Spain.
Among the more exclusive models, they have information about the Porsche models, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini.
With regard to the road-driven vehicle park, it is above 99%.
Audatex has eight centres distributed worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, the USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) for the execution of the documentation and the production of databases and each of them has specialized in certain brands.
Its national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanical experts) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million euros annually in the development of these databases.
Every month they record 2.5 million data and their customers receive updates every second day.
The development of this vast flow of information enables companies to use it in different ways and thus offer different products.
The most common use is the use of repairs and repairs, but there are also tools for the management of scrap parts depending on the country or for the calculation of the file or residual value of a car.
The only company that informs of the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex offers this offer not in Spain, but in the United States.
The transparency of the products offered by Audatex makes it easy to get an overview of the type of support given to industry experts.
This company offers ten different tools, the star of the products AudaPlus, a standard solution for assessing accidents for the experts.
It includes vehicles, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the paint prices.
This tool is paid according to the purpose of use, i.e. for each opinion.
It will be most expensive for customers who rarely use it up to ten times a month, namely 5,75 euros per month.
On the other hand, every insurance company that produces thousands of opinions negotiates the price with Audatex.
With other products, such as AudaVIN, you can fully identify a vehicle and the equipment with which it ran from the mounting belt using the chassis number alone.
AudaGlass deals with the vehicle discs, and AudaSubastas is an Internet service open to the specialist market, which can be used for vehicles that have been declared total damage.
Your statistical service is very useful in identifying trends, performing geodemographic analyses or in obtaining information about the deviations by brand and model.
For example, one can examine how many models of a particular car brand had to be used in the workshop due to pans or how many of them were involved in a serious accident during a certain period of time.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of computer tools.
It distributes, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and provides in the same way digital images, access to parts or prices and official working hours of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the group Einsa, which was founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of damage, pans or maintenance of vehicles.
The GT Guide for Opinion is a reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Their business volume has increased by 20% per year over the last three years and sales in 2008 amounted to EUR 10.8 million.
At the beginning of last year, they began to go to the international market with the opening of an office in Paris.
Audatex was founded in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its business is carried out in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. They work with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.
Total sales in the world of Solera (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) amount to 557 million dollars, 3.35 more than in 2008.
For this purpose, the company has revenues of 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than in the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was worth $1 billion on the stock exchange and today its shares are traded at a value of 2.4 billion dollars.
Since 2007 they have been on the New York Stock Exchange and part of the reference index Standard & Poor's.
Auction of accident cars on the Internet
Last October, the group Solera Autoonline bought a flat-foma on the Internet for the sale of accident vehicles and motorcycles.
This purchase meant the payment of EUR 5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could increase to the remaining 15% next year.
The purpose of this purchase was to offer its customers more services and value-added, with the opportunity to gain access to a huge international market.
This assessment and purchase service addresses only industry professionals, such as insurance companies, experts, car rental companies, workshops, scrap yards and car dealers, who must be registered prior to their activities.
This platform was founded in Germany in 1996 and manages more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany alone.
Their main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
Today, the website has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 experts.
3,000 ads are managed every day and 100 new ads are added on the Spanish market every day.
According to Spanish legislation, a vehicle whose chassis number has been unregistered may no longer travel on the streets, but certain parts not damaged may be used as spare parts.
The cars of historical value may, however, be re-approved even if they have been registered after difficult administrative procedures.
Estimate of workshop costs in four steps
With the Auda-Counter tool, the company Auda-Counter ensures that the user receives a cost estimate in just four steps: identification of the vehicle, search of the spare part, creation and creation of a cost estimate.
The ease of handling of these systems is a fundamental condition, especially in order to convince older professionals who are usually more or less opposed to the use of these new computer techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, 666 of which are passenger vehicles, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 small transporters and 44 trucks.
Of course, you need to use a computer with Internet connection.
After the model to be repaired has been identified using the chassis number, a graphic of the respective model appears and then the required spare part is selected.
The user can include variables such as the price of the working hours, surcharges or discounts and then have the cost estimate printed out and passed on to his customers.
However, AudaCounter is not a tool for evaluation such as AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop does not include estimated working hours.
The cost of using this tool is 350 euros a year, an amount which the customer can pay without further delay.
Currently, the company Audatex is working to offer these images in three-dimensional formats.
This is an innovation that automechanics have been waiting for for for a long time, as one can choose a door with it for example and then turn the picture completely around to look at the inside.
