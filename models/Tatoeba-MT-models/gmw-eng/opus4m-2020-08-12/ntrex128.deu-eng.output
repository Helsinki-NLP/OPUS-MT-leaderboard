Members of the National Assembly for Wales fear confusion with the Muppets
For some members of the National Assembly, the proposal to change their title to 'MWP' (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Welsh Parliament) is a shock.
The reason for this is to change the name of the National Assembly to 'Welsh Parliament' (Walisian Parliament).
National Assembly members of all political groups fear becoming the target of ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party said that his group was concerned because the name "with "Twp" and "Pwp" is rhyming".
For non-Wallisian readers: in Welsh 'twp' stands for 'doof' and 'pwp' for 'aa'.
A national assembly member of the Plaid Cymru party stated that the whole group was "not happy" and proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said that his group was open to the change of name, but pointed to the great similarity between "MWP" and "Muppet".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similar to the letter u in the English spoken in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission (National Assembly Panel), which is currently drafting a law on the name changes, said: 'The final decision on designations for the members of the National Assembly is naturally with the members themselves.'
The 2017 Government of Wales Act authorised the Welsh National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the panel published the results of a public hearing on the proposals which gave broad support to the name 'Welsh Parliament' for the National Assembly.
With regard to the titles of the members of the National Assembly, the "Welsh Parliament Members" (Walisian Members) and "WMPs" committee preferred the most support at a public hearing, while the "MWP" option was the most supported.
The members of the National Assembly seem to propose alternative options, but reaching a consensus for chairman Elin Jones, who is to present a draft law within weeks, could be a problem.
The Reforms Act will include further changes in the functioning of the National Assembly, including rules on disqualification of members of the National Assembly and on the design of the Committee system.
The members of the National Assembly may vote on their names in their debate on the law.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on a change to the country name
The voters will decide on Sunday whether to change their country's name to 'Republic of Northern Macedonia'.
The referendum was set to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has a province with the same name of Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor means that this claim is raised in the Greek territory, and has repeatedly opposed its inclusion in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the change of name, said he would not accept the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change was the price to be paid for accession to the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's remain silent in view of the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
"The old people I spoke to said that in the past there was a bar and a church at every corner," said Adams.
"Today, there are no more two."
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"People's social life today looks different," he said.
"Bars are no longer the living room of the neighborhood where people regularly find themselves."
At the churches, he fears that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the church leaders assume, and that they will "be at the beginning sooner or later".
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment houses with apartments where people do not support the remaining resorts.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy residences in these buildings will be whites," he said, "and thus speed up the complete closure of these churches, as it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these residences will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist community moved out in the 1930s.
A black church that held its services nearby became the owner of the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black community under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, a large shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or support blacks.
In a fire in 1939, the building was severely damaged, but when Johnson's parishioners planned the reconstruction, they commissioned the belfry.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's, proudly described the bell play as "the bells of the poor".
The expert who rang the bell game in July used other words: 'A treasure of culture' and 'an irreplaceable historical instrument'.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world's first belfry played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who was turned 18 years ago to the larger belfry in the Riverside Church.
Merriweather said he wasn't replaced by St. Martin's.
What has happened in St. Martin's in recent months is a complicated story with architects and contractors who were drawn partly by the lay leaders of the Church and partly by the diocese of the Bishops.
In July, the parish council, consisting of lay leaders, expressed written concerns to the diocese that the diocese would try to pass the costs on to the council, although it was not involved in the commission of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complain about lack of transparency on the side of the diocese.
Shark hurts in California 13-year-olds while diving to Lobster
On Saturday, the first day of the Lobster season, in California, a shark officially attacked a 13-year-old boy while diving to Lobster.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near the Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Hammel told the KSWB TV in San Diego, he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy's help cry and paddling with several others to help him pull him out of the water.
Hammel said he thought at first that the boy was happy to have caught a praiser, but then he realized that the boy screamed “I've been bitten!
I've been bitten!".
When Hammel arrived with the boy, he found that his entire keybone had been torn up.
“I screamed that everyone should come out of the water: ‘There is a shark in the water!’” Hammel added.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack was unknown.
Rescuer Captain Larry Giles told the media that a few weeks earlier a shark had been seen in the area. However, it was concluded that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles added that the victim had suffered traumatic injuries in the upper body area.
Officials closed the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Encinitas for investigation and for security reasons for 48 hours.
According to Giles, there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans advance on the cosmetics market in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's attacks with cosmetics departments that appear to be at department stores occupied by specialized assistants, boats, super drugs and Debenhams.
As part of a major advance on the 2.8 billion pounds UK-wide cosmetics market in the UK, which continues to grow, while fashion and household sales are falling, the major cosmetics departments in eleven branches are being tested nationally, and if they prove successful, they will be extended to other branches next year.
The investment in cosmetics coincides with the search of supermarkets for opportunities to otherwise use store space previously used for televisions, microwaves and household goods.
According to Sainsbury's, the range of his cosmetics is doubled to up to 3,000 products for the first time, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Also available series of L'Oreal, Maybellline and Burt's Bees receive more space and brand areas similar to those in shops such as boats.
In addition, the supermarket carries out a relaunch of its makeup series "Boutique" so that most of the products are vegan-friendly – an aspect that is increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will test the perfumer in two Sainsbury's branch sales outlets. The first sales office was opened last week in Croydon in the south of London, and a second will be opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, during this year.
Online shopping and the transition to the daily purchase of small quantities of food in local commodity stores mean that supermarkets need to do more to get customers to visit them.
According to Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, sales outlets will increasingly look like department stores, as the supermarket chain tries to fight against the discounters Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's has set up a number of habitat sales outlets since the purchase of the Argos and Habitat chains two years ago. This has increased food sales as well as the profitability of the acquisitions.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to reorganise its cosmetic and pharmaceutical departments failed.
At the beginning of the 2000s, Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with boats, which ended after a discussion of the distribution of revenue from the drug dealer's branches in supermarkets.
The new strategy follows the sale of Sainsbury's 281 branch pharmaceutical business to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million British pounds three years ago.
The company stated that Lloyds will play a role in the plan insofar as an extended range of luxury skin care brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy is added in four branches.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director at Sainsbury's, said: "We have remodelled the appearance of our cosmetics departments to create a more attractive environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in specially trained colleagues who are available as consultants.
Our brand range is tailored to all needs. Due to the tempting environment and the favorable locations, we are now an attractive destination for cosmetics purchases that challenges the previous type of shopping."
Peter Jones "wrote" after the withdrawal of Holly Willoughbys from a business worth 11 million UK pounds
"Dragons' Den" star Peter Jones is "angry" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdrew from a business worth 11 million UK pounds with his lifestyle brand company to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for the common homewear and accessories brand True.
The business of the two was compared to Gwyneth Paltrows brand Goop.
The "This Morning" presenter, 37, announced her retreat to Instagram.
Holly Willoughby angered "Dragons" Den" star Peter Jones through her extremely short-term withdrawal from her lucrative lifestyle brand company to focus on their own new connection agreements with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Jones is said to have been angry when the "golden girl" of television admitted to be unable to devote enough time to the common homewear and accessories brand True due to her new business – worth up to 1.5 million pounds – at a tense meeting on Tuesday in the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and probably doubled Willoughby's estimated fortune of £11 million.
While Willoughby, 37, announced her withdrawal from Truey to Instagram, Jones left Britain on his way to one of his holiday homes.
One source said: “Truly had by far the highest priority for Holly.
It should secure their future over the next decades for them in the long term.
Their decision to withdraw came completely surprising to all those involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, just before the launch of the market.
At the Marlow headquarters, a warehouse full of goods is waiting to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the "This Morning" presenter, which is one of the most promising stars in the UK, could cost millions of people due to high investments in pillow and candle products to clothing and homewear and possible further delays in market launch.
In addition, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been closely friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded True in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, was added as chairman in March.
The couples spend the holiday together, and Jones holds a 40 percent share of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is to become brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as presenter of the ITV broadcast "I'm A Celebrity".
A Jones nearby source said last night: "We do not comment on his business."
Hard words "and then we fell in love"
He was surprised by the criticism he expected from the news media for a comment some would consider 'non-premium', and for such positive statements about the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said, imitating the voice of a news moderator:
"I didn't give up."
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting, as the first meeting in Singapore in June was praised by Trump as a major step towards the denuklarisation of North Korea.
However, the denuclearization negotiations are under way.
Over three months after the June summit in Singapore, Ri Yong Ho, North Korea's highest diplomat, told leading politicians from all over the world on Saturday at the UN General Assembly that the North does not see any "corresponding response" to North Korea's first disarmament measures.
Instead, he noted, the US insisted on sanctions that should maintain the pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his rally speech.
"We are very successful with North Korea," he said.
“We were facing a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim showed positive results: end of rocket tests, support in the release of hostages and return of the mortal remains of American military personnel.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about the relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be Presidential, but instead of 10,000 people standing outside trying to get into this crowded arena, about 200 people would be standing here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquakes devastate an island in Indonesia and cost hundreds of human lives
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were said not to be needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population were expelled, no national emergency was declared a prerequisite for the mobilisation of international aid.
"Unfortunately, they have made it very clear in many cases that they do not request international support, so that's a little difficult," said Sumbung.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain whether foreign employees can work on site.
Sutopo, spokesperson of the Civil Protection Authority, said that Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu as to whether international bodies should participate in the aid measures.
Given the global tremors that Indonesia is constantly struggling with, the country is still, unfortunately, poorly prepared for natural forces.
While Tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, they are not a daily sight on other coastal strips.
In spite of a warning that had entered into force, it seems that there was no tsunami warning in Palu, it was likely that it contributed to the deaths.
Traveling between Indonesia's numerous islands is a challenge in the optimal case.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A Lombok Lazarette ship stationed in Lombok for the treatment of earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but will reach the place of the new disaster in at least three days.
President Yoko Widodo has made the improvement of the Indonesian infrastructure as the core of his election campaign and has spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
However, the government of the Joko, which is looking for re-election next year, suffers from financial deficits.
In addition, Joko is under pressure due to persistent religious tensions in Indonesia. Members of the Muslim majority there practice a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were driven out of their homes and homes when gangs of Christians and Muslims fought on the streets with machetes, arrows and bows as well as other primitive weapons.
View: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge achieves deep compensation against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool on Saturday at the Stamford-Bridge Stadium in London with a hit in the 89th minute before a Premier League loss against Chelsea.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri at 0:1 of his team at about 27 meters distance from the gate of Chelsea.
He directed the ball to the left and then shot it in the direction of the rear post.
The shot sailed high over the punishment room and drifted into the top right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball fell over the jumping kepa arrizabalaga and then into the net.
“I’ve just tried to get into this position and get to the ball. Players like Shaq always play forward as much as possible, so I just tried to create as much time as possible for myself,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and I had a contact with the ball. I didn't think too much about it and just took the shot."
After a hit in the 25th minute, Chelsea led through the Belgian star Eden Hazard at half-time at 1:0.
The blues storm gave a pass with the heel back to Mateo, then turned off near the middle field and sprinted into the Liverpooler half.
Kovavic played a fast double pass in the middle of the field.
Then he shot a good steep pass, so that he got into the penitentiary.
==History==Hazard left the defenders behind and took a left shot at Liverpool's Alisson Becker in the back of the net.
Liverpool will be playing at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples on Wednesday at 3:00 p.m.
Chelsea is on Thursday at 3:00 p.m. in London in the UEFA Europa League Videoton.
Number of deaths of the tsunami in Indonesia increases to 832
The number of deaths of the earthquake and the tsunami in Indonesia has increased to 832, as reported by the Civil Protection Authority on Sunday morning.
Many people are said to have been caught in the ruins of buildings caused by the earthquake of strength 7.5 from Friday, which had caused waves up to six meters high, reported government spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho in a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with the ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrests man, 32, for murder suspicion after a woman was stabbed
After the discovery of a female corpse this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside, a murder investigation was initiated.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 with stab wounds in Grayson Mews on John Street. A 32-year-old man was arrested for murder suspicion.
The police are asking residents to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: “The investigation is at an early stage, but I ask all those who have stayed near John Street in Birkenhead and have seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
In addition, I ask all persons, especially taxi drivers, who may have made some contact with a Dashcam. They may have information that is of utmost importance for our investigation."
A police spokesperson confirmed that the woman whose body was found lived in Birkenhead and was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman arrived at the crime scene to find out where she was found this morning.
The investigations are ongoing, and the police told us that they are in the process of informing the next members of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews was just trying to get into his apartment, but was informed by the police that no one should enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he learned what had happened.
The residents are now informed that it will take hours for them to enter the building again.
It was heard how a police officer told a man that the whole area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears dissolved at the place of the event.
It repeats over and over again, 'this is so terrible'.
At 2:00 p.m. there were two police vehicles within the lock and another vehicle before the lockout.
Within the lock, several police officers were in charge of the residential block.
Persons with information are asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously under No 0800 555 111 and refer to the record entry 247 of September 30.
The Cromwell statue in front of Parliament will be the latest monument to the dispute on the rewriting of history
Its banishment would be poetic justice for the destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious arts by its fanatical puritan followers.
The Cromwell Society, however, described Crick's proposal as "terror" and "trying to reword history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell’s statue in front of Westminster’s palace was aimed at.
The picture storm in the English civil wars was neither arranged nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the false Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent depiction of Cromwell is proof of the opinion and part of the history of a figure that many believe is still worth celebrating.
Goldsmith said to Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is viewed by many, perhaps at the end of the 19th century more than today, as defending Parliament against external pressure, in his case naturally through the monarchy.
Whether this is a perfectly true representation is the subject of continued history debates.
It is certain that the conflict formed the subsequent development of our nation in the middle of the 17th century, and Cromwell is a single recognizable figure representing one side of this gap.
His achievements as a Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and reminding them."
Killer pig bites Chinese farmers dead
According to local media reports, a farmer on a market in southwestern China was attacked and killed by a pig.
The man to whom only the surname "Yuan" was mentioned was found in the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou Province, with a severe artery flooded near a pig's stable, reported the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer is ready to inject pigs vaccines in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, on May 30, 2005.
He was reported to have arrived on Wednesday with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and saw that a door was open to a neighboring pig house.
He said there was a big male pig in the barn with blood on the snout.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that the 250 kilo pig had bitten the peasants.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and mutilated," the cousin, to whom the surname was called "Wu", was quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
Photos of a security camera showed Yuan entering the market on Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was neither Yuan nor his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent attacks on other people while the police collected evidence at the crime scene.
Yuan's family and market authorities reportedly negotiate a compensation for his death.
While it is rare for pigs to attack people, such cases are known.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on her farm in Massachusetts, and the man suffered serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a 290-kilo pig pulled a Welsh farmer between him and a tractor until the farmer's wife could hide the animal.
After a farmer was eaten by his pigs in Oregon in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "starter".
“They’re just playful.
They like to twist and are very curious, ... they are not about to hurt someone.
You just have to treat them with the right degree of respect," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa bring widespread heavy rains in the southwest of the USA
As forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weakening on the way over the colder water on the north coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring about floods of rains in northern Mexico and the southwest of the USA.
On Sunday at 5:00 East Coastal Time, Rosa showed wind speeds of 136 km/h, corresponding to a hurricane of category 1, and was located 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, above the Pacific, a trough is beginning to move east to the west coast of the United States. When Rosa reaches the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, high tropical moisture is transported north to the south-west of the United States.
Rosa will rain up to 25 centimetres of precipitation on Monday in parts of Mexico.
Then, in the coming days, tropical moisture will generate widespread rainfall in the southwest by interacting with the moving trough.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 centimetres of precipitation can cause dangerous floods of fluids, water-driving debris and possibly landslides in the desert.
In some cases, high tropical moisture leads to precipitation rates of almost 5 to 7.5 centimetres per hour, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest, especially in a large part of Arizona, up to 5 to 10 centimetres of rainfall is expected.
Due to the scattering of tropical rainfall, there is a possibility of floods with rapidly worsening conditions.
In view of the threat of tropical rainfall, it is strongly advised not to walk into the desert.
Strong rainfall can cause canyons to become exciting currents, and thunderstorms bring local winds and wind that leads to dust.
The approaching trough brings local rains in parts of the coast of Southern California.
Total precipitation levels of over one centimeter may be possible, which may lead to a small amount of water-driven dirt and smooth lanes.
This would be the first rainfall of the rainy season in this region.
The first single tropical rain showers reach Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning. On Monday evening and Tuesday it rains widely.
On Tuesday strong rain spreads into the Four Corners region and lasts over Wednesday.
In October, strong temperature fluctuations are possible throughout the United States, as the Arctic cools, while the tropics remain relatively warm.
This sometimes leads to drastic temperature differences over short distances.
On Sunday there is a good example of drastic temperature differences in the middle of the USA.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, there is a temperature difference of almost 12 oC.
In the next few days, the persistent summer heat will try to develop and expand again.
For a large part of the middle and east of the US, a warm October beginning with widely spread temperatures is expected from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
New York City could reach 27 oC on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast suggests a high probability of above-average temperatures in the first half of October in the east of the US.
Over 20 million spectators have seen the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
Over 20 million spectators saw the captivating statements of Kavanaugh Board nominated for Supreme Court and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assaults in the 1980s, on Thursday at six TV networks.
In the meantime, the political situation continued. TV stations interrupted their regular program on Friday due to a turn in the last minute: an agreement negotiated by Jeff Flake, Senator from Arizona, which the FBI is to carry out a one-week investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate's judicial committee to be 100% sure that Kavanaugh had been drunk at a high-school party, pressured her and tried to remove her clothes.
Kavanaugh said in a passionate statement that he was 100% sure that this had not happened.
It is likely that more than the 20.4 million spectators reported by Nielsen have seen the hearing.
The company measured the average audience numbers at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
For other networks such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, which had broadcasted the hearing, the figures were not available immediately.
Furthermore, Nielsen usually has problems measuring spectator numbers in offices.
To put this into the right perspective: This corresponds to the number of spectators in a play-off football game or in the Oscar award.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose opinion-oriented moderators strongly support Kavanaugh's nomination, recorded the highest numbers of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers of the full-day hearing.
ABC came second with 3.26 million spectators.
CBS reported that Nielsen had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers.
The interest remained great after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in the Friday drama.
After the moderate Republican office had published a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was filmed on Friday morning by cameras from CNN and CBS, as protesters in the lift on his way to a hearing of the judicial committee with loud words.
He stood for minutes with a lowered look while being shocked. The scene was broadcast live at CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?"
"They have power while so many women are powerless," said one woman.
Flake said that his office had published a statement and supplemented it before the elevator concluded that he would have more to say at the hearing before the committee.
All cable and broadcasting networks sent live hours later when the Justice Committee was to vote on the transmission of the nomination of Kavanaughs for the vote to the entire Senate.
However, Flake said he would do this only on condition that the FBI, as requested by the democratic minority, investigate the charges against the candidates in the next week.
Flake was partly convinced by talks with a friend, the democratic senator Chris Coons.
After a discussion with Coons and then various senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was of great importance, since it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes for Kavanaugh's confirmation without the investigation.
President Trump has initiated an FBI investigation of the charges made against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of using Brexit for political purposes
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of their plans for the withdrawal from the European Union of exploiting the future of Britain for political purposes and undermining the interests of the nation.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will attend the Conservative Party's party meeting in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In an interview with her on the cover page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson intensified his attack on her so-called "Chequers Plan" for Brexit by calling a proposal that provides for the mutual collection of customs duties by Britain and the EU "fully absurd".
Killing shots at Wayde Sims: Police arrests suspect Dyteon Simpson in connection with death of the LSU player
The police arrested a suspect in connection with the deadly shots at Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University (LSU).
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and detained for killing, according to Baton Rouge's police.
The authority published video recordings of the dispute between Sims and Simpson. According to the police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
As reported by WAFB's CBS partner station, the police ensured the glasses at the crime scene and said that Simpson's eyeglasses had been found.
After a survey of Simpson, the police reported that he had stood the deadly shots on Wayde.
The lawyer reported that the deposit had been set at $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office published a preliminary report on Friday, according to which the cause of death was a gunshot wound on the neck.
The police thank the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the criminal technical laboratory of the state police, the Southern University Police and the citizens of the area for their support in the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked the regional executive authority for "their care and their pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
He was born in Baton Rouge, New York, where his father had also played for LSU Basketball.
In the last season, he scored an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, the LSU basketball coach, Will Wade, said that the team was "deeply shocked" and "shocked".
"You're always afraid of such a thing," said Wade.
Volcano spews ashes on Mexico City.
Ash thrown out of the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern quarter of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the activity in the crater had increased and 183 emissions of gas and ashes were recorded within 24 hours.
The Authority monitored numerous cases of riots and tremors.
Images in social media showed thin ash layers on the windscreens of cars in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists, since an earthquake of strength 7.1 rocked in September 2017, detected increased activity on the 72 kilometers southeast of the capital volcano.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Conflicts between police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence voting
Six persons were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after conflicts between the standby police and pro-independence demonstrators. Thousands participated in other demonstrations to commemorate the first anniversary of the polarising independence referendum in Catalonia.
A group of masked pro-separatists, who were held back by the standby police, threw eggs and also sluggished paint powder, resulting in dark dust clouds in the streets normally populated with tourists.
In the course of the day, there were also hand-cuffs with the police who used their batons to control the fights.
For several hours, pro-independence groups "No forgetfulness, no forgiveness" were scanned while they faced Unionists who called "Long live Spain".
As the local press reported, fourteen people were treated for minor violations in the protests.
A year after the referendum of 1 October, which was seen by Madrid as illegal, but celebrated by separatist Catalans, the situation in the independent region is still very tense.
The voters had chosen independence with overwhelming majority, although the vote was low, as the opponents largely boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when the police tried to prevent the vote in violent conflicts before the polls.
Pro-independence groups had camped outdoors on Friday night in order to prevent a demonstration for the national police.
The demonstration took place but was forced to take a different course.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated with his wife in the protest of the separatists, said that he saw the prospects that Catalonia would gain independence, no longer with hope.
“Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy because they could choose, but now we're stuck tight," he said.
Despite an important, though scarce, victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan pro-independence parties had difficulties maintaining the momentum this year. Many of their most famous leaders are either in exile or in custody, where they await their proceedings because of their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in favor of the police on his phone, said that the conflict had been fueled by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is becoming increasingly tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in detention since the end of last year, announced his candidate for the election to the European Parliament next year.
"As a candidate for the European elections, it is the best way to condemn the reduction of democratic values and the oppression of the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after house was rammed by car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a house in Londonderry had been rammed several times by a car.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 after British summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself were damaged.
In addition, an armbrush may have been shot on the car.
Menga hit means for Livingston 1:0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory.
The raised Livingston FC surprised the Rangers and led to the second defeat for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox Association.
Dolly Menga's hits proved to be decisive for Gary Holt's team to match Hibernian in the second half of the season.
Gerrard's team will remain in the Premiership this season without a victory and will face the Hearts on the next Sunday, which will score eight points behind.
Previously, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Europa League.
Livingston can in the meantime increase his victory series in the division to six games, that is, Chief Trainer Holt has not recorded a defeat since he took over Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses opportunities against freely playing guests
Holt's team should have been in the lead long before the hit, since his directness put the Rangers before the various problems.
Scott Robinson broke through, but slowed down in front of the gate. Then Alan Lithgow could only shoot a long way after he had slipped in here to hit Craig Halkett's headshot past the gate.
The hosts were content to let the Rangers play in front of themselves, as they knew they could hinder the guests in standard situations.
In this way the decisive goal came to pass.
The Rangers allowed a free shot, and Livingston prepared a chance to shoot Menga with Declan Gallagher and Robinson, who shot the gate with a ball contact from the middle of the prison room.
At this stage, the Rangers had dominated the ball ownership, but could not overcome the defense of the hosts, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly remained largely unlit.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly once to defend.
Scott Pittman was rebuffed by Ranger's goalkeeper Allan McGregor with his feet, and Lithgow passed the ball from another standard situation of Livingston.
Flanges repeatedly entered the Livingston Penal Area and were regularly taken out of the danger area, while two required criminal acts – one by Halkett against Glenn Middleton and one by hand – were refused.
Livingston 'Phenomenal' – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and a strong result for Livingston.
They were without exception excellent and exceeded the expectations of this upward trend again.
Their style of play and their team have hardly changed since their return to the top teams, but Holt deserves great praise for the way in which he has woken up the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great and led an excellent organized defense while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall kept on the trail throughout the game.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
As good as they were temporarily under Gerrard, they could not reach this standard.
Their last ball was insufficient – only once could they penetrate the host's team – and that's something like a wake-up call for the Rangers who are in the middle of the table.
Receive Erdogan with mixed reactions in Cologne
On Saturday (29 September) smiling faces and blue sky prevailed when the heads of government of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which was intended to repair relations between NATO allies.
There had been disputes on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and the EU's accession to Turkey.
Erdogan then traveled to Cologne to open a large new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police mentioned security reasons for preventing a 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many followers found themselves nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan demonstrators – many of them Kurds – were also heard. They condemned Erdogan’s politics as well as the decision of the German government to welcome him in the country.
The opposite protests reflect the polarizing effect of the visitor, who is praised by some German Turks as a hero and being reproached by others as an autocrat.
Traffic accident in Deptford: Bikers die when they crash with cars
In a collision with a car, a cyclist died in London.
The crash occurred at about 10:15 a.m. British summer time near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a traffic-rich street in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped, and medics took care of the man who died at the accident site.
Another cyclist was killed in an accident on Childers Street, about 1.6 kilometres from the Saturday accident, months before the accident.
According to Metropolitan Police, officials were working to identify the man and notify his next family.
Roadblocks and detours for buses are set up, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long-Lartin Prison: Six officials injured in riots
According to the Prison Office, six prison officials were injured in a men's high-security prison in riots.
The unrest broke out on Sunday at about 9:30 a.m. British summer time in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and continues.
Specialized "Tornado" officials have been drawn to end the unrests involving eight inmates and limited to one wing.
The officials were treated on site for minor injuries in the face.
Said one speaker at the Prison Service: “Specially trained prison personnel have been used to fix an ongoing incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and want to make it clear that the police will be handed over to the police and may spend some time behind bars."
In HMP Long Lartin there are more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the prison manager was reported to have been treated in the hospital after an attack by a prisoner.
In October of last year, officers were called to prison to deal with serious riots in which the staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with floods of fluids (during areas may benefit)
It is rare for a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that's exactly what will happen at the beginning of next week when the remains of Hurricane Rosa cross the desert-induced southwest and bring with them the risk of floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings of floods on Monday and Tuesday from the west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada as well as to the southeast of California and Utah including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will approach with rain on Monday evening and move directly across Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix informed in a tweet that “since 1950 only ten tropical cyclones have approached Phoenix as a tropical storm or tropical depression up to 320 kilometers!
Katrina (1967) was located as a hurricane within 64 kilometres of the border of Arizona."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimetres of rainfall with a single inch in the Arizona Mogollon Rim.
In other areas of the desert-shaped southwest including the central rockies and the Great Basin, 2.5 to 5 centimeters are likely to be possible, with a total of up to 10 centimetres.
For those who do not have the risk of flooding, the rainfall associated with pink may be a blessing due to the drought in the region.
Although floods are of great concern, this rain is likely to be useful in part, as there is currently drought in the south-west.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, at least extreme drought occurs in just over 40 percent of Arizona, the second highest category," reportedweather.com.
First of all, the Hurricane Path means that Rosa will meet on land on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning Rosa will still have hurricane strengths with maximum winds of 136 kilometers per hour and 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico. Afterwards, the hurricane will move north at 19 kilometers per hour.
In the Pacific, the storm will meet on colder water and thereby weaken.
Therefore, Rosa is expected to meet on Monday afternoon or evening in Mexico with the strength of a tropical storm on land.
Precipitation may be severe in parts of Mexico, so that there is a significant risk of flooding.
"From Baja California to the northwest of the Sonora Desert, precipitation amounts are expected from 7.5 to 15 centimetres, with up to 25 centimetres possible," reportedweather.com.
Then, as a tropical storm, Rosa will cross Mexico in the north, reach the Arizona border as a tropical depression in the early Tuesday morning, and then move up through Arizona to the south of Utah until late Tuesday evening.
"As the main danger, very strong rainfalls are expected in Baja California, the northwest of the Sonora Desert and the desert-based southwest of the USA," said the National Hurricane Center.
As a result of these rainfalls, life-threatening floods and water-driving debris are expected in the desert, as well as in mountainous areas of landslide.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for attempted murder
After the discovery of a 16-year-old with stab wounds in Somerset, three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested under suspicion of the attempted murder.
The teenager was found injured on Saturday at 4:00 a.m. British summer time in the Excelsior-Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to a hospital and his condition is stable.
According to Avon and Somerset police, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
Officials asked all those who had records of the events on a mobile phone to report.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had suffered "under the common ground, the anger" of the Democrats.
"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the unscrupulous and unheard-of tactics of the Democrats," said Trump at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had suffered during the entire nomination process "under the common sense, the anger" of the Democrats.
Kavanaugh announced on Thursday before the Congress and rejected the accusation made by Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually harassed her decades ago when both teenagers were.
Ford also charged her at the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that the American people had seen the brilliance, quality and courage of Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote for the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for the confirmation of one of the most experienced legal heads of our time, a lawyer with an excellent balance in service to the general public," he said the amount of his followers in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the nomination of Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of the participation of the Republican voters in the interim elections.
“Five weeks before one of the most important elections of our life.
I'm not acting, but in reality I'm acting," he said.
"That's why I'm fighting everywhere for great candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats saw their mission as "resistance and blocking".
The first important procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place on Friday at the latest in the Senate, said a high staff member of the GOP leadership to CNN.
Hundreds killed in earthquakes in Indonesia, number of victims rising
According to the authorities of Saturday, at least 384 people were killed. Many of them were flooded when, due to a strong earthquake and a tsunami, huge waves hit the beaches on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Friday at a festival on the beach of the city of Palu, when at nightfall, waves up to six metres high struck the beach and many people were torn to death and destroyed everything that stood in their way.
The tsunami had preceded an earthquake of strength 7.5.
"When yesterday the threat arose by the tsunami, people were still doing their activities on the beach, not running away immediately, and they fell victim to him," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian Civil Protection Agency (BNPB) at a conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, it was flooding cars, tree trunks and houses, it hit everything ashore,” Nugroho said. He added that the tsunami had moved across the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before it hit the coast.
Some people were on the run from the tsunami climbing trees and had survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated and accommodated in 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial images published by the Civil Protection Authority showed numerous destroyed buildings and shops, bowed and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city was shaken by further aftershocks.
The earthquake series was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian authority BPPT (Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology) said in a statement that during the massive Friday earthquake, the energy released had corresponded to the 200 times of the energy of the nuclear bomb thrown off Hiroshima in the Second World War.
Due to the location of the city at the end of a long, narrow bay, the tsunami could have grown larger, said the authority.
Nugroho described the damage as "comprehensive" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had collapsed.
According to his information, the bodies were found among the ruins of collapsed buildings. 540 people were injured, and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and damage along the coast could have been 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communication with Donggala was completely paralyzed, according to Nugrohos, and there was no information.
According to a Red Cross statement, more than 300,000 people live there, and his employees and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse," said the statement.
On Saturday, the Authority was often criticized for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the waves arrived at the time of the warning, according to official information.
Amateur recordings published in social media show a man on the upper floor of a building who is desperately warning the people on the street under him of the approaching tsunami.
Within minutes, a water wall pushes onto the shore and floods buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the recordings.
The earthquake and the tsunami caused a massive power failure that interrupted communication around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue measures.
According to the authorities, the military has started to send cargo aircraft with support from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuaters still urgently need food and other vital goods.
The city's airport remains closed until October and was only re-opened for relief measures.
On Sunday, a visit by President Yoko Widodo was planned to take place in evacuation centres in Palu.
The number of tsunami victims has increased to more than 800.
The situation is very bad.
The staff of World Vision from Donggala have safely reached the city of Palu, where the employees are housed in tent accommodations in the courtyard of their office, but after words Dosebas passed scenes of devastation on the way.
"They said they had seen many destroyed houses," he said.
The situation is very bad.
Even when the relief groups began the hard task of starting the disaster relief, some gathered that expert foreign helpers would be prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, financial aid, supplies and personnel from abroad will only be possible if the place of an accident has been declared a national disaster area.
This has not happened so far.
"At the moment, it is still a disaster at the province level," said Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says ‘okay, this is a national disaster’, we can accept international support, but so far this status has not been valid.”
While the second night since the earthquake and the tsunami of Friday fell over Palu, friends and family members of the still missing ones hoped for one of the wonders that brightened the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of a wastewater canal.
On Sunday, rescuers liberated a woman who had been confined to the body of her mother for two days under rubble.
Gendon Subandano, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding national team, had trained two of the missing paraglidings for the Asia Games ended in Indonesia at the beginning of this month.
Others of the prisoners at the Roa-Roa Hotel were, as Mandigi added, his students.
"As a senior in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden to bear," he said.
Gendon told how in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa-Roa hotel under the paraglidings, he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the contestants from Palu who participated in the beach festival.
His messages, however, only led to grey question marks instead of blue ticks.
"I think that means the news has not been delivered," he said.
Thieves steal 26.750 US dollars during the space of a ATM in Newport on the Levee
According to a news release by the Newport police on Friday morning in Newport on the Levee Thieves stole a Brink’s employee when filling a cash machine with 26.750 US dollars.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied a ATM in the entertainment complex and wanted to deposit more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, "a man came running behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money for the machine.
According to the press release, Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not indicate how many people were involved in the incident.
Persons with information on the identity of the suspects are asked to contact the Newport police under 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapid changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name – in Ye.
In the announcement of the change on Twitter on Saturday he wrote: 'The being formally known as Kanye West' (the officially known beings as Kanye West).
West, 41, has the nickname Ye for some time and has used it as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change is due to his appearance at Saturday Night Live, where the release of his new album "Yandhi" is expected.
He is acting as a substitute for singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the producer, has refused for 'emotional reasons'.
The word is not only an abbreviation of its current professional name, but it has a religious significance for West, according to its own statement.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most common word used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” said West this year in a conversation about his album with Radio moderator Big Boy.
“So I’m you, I’m us, it’s us.
From Kanye, which means ‘the only one’, only ‘Ye’ – simply a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album rather reflects what we are."
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, with whom West used to work, has already written his name with and without hyphen and capital letters.
Mexico’s AMLO pledged not to use the military against the civilian population
The elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised never to use military violence against the civilian population during the 50th anniversary of bloody repression against students in his country.
On Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza, Lopez Obrador promised never to use the military to suppress the Mexican people.
On October 2, 1968, soldiers fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people. At that time, left-wing student movements were establishing themselves throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans through monthly support for students and the opening of other free public universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of training opportunities led young people to criminal gangs.
USA should double financial resources for artificial intelligence
In view of China's increased activities in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double its spending on research in this area, says investor and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow AI announcements from various areas of the U.S. government, although the US generally lacks a formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: The country intends to become No. 1 in the field of AI innovation by 2030.
“The doubling of the budget for AI research would be a good start in view of the fact that all other countries are so much further behind the US. We are looking for the next AI breakthrough,” said Lee.
The doubling of financial resources could double the chances that the next major AI success would be achieved in the USA, said Lee this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of the company Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that defeated the highest-ranking American Otello player. Later, he was senior executive at Microsoft Research and president of the Google subsidiary in China.
Lee praised earlier technology competitions of the U.S. government such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and asked about the date of the next competition as he wanted to help identify the next visionaries.
According to read words, researchers in the USA often have to work hard to obtain state subsidies.
"It is not China that takes away the academic top forces, but the companies," said Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited coryphages from universities to work on AI.
Reading believes that a modified US immigration policy could also be conducive to US AI efforts.
"I think Greencards should be offered automatically in the field of AIs," he said.
In July 2017, China’s State Council presented its plan for the development of the next generation of AI technologies (Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan).
According to read words, the National Natural Science Foundation of China finances persons at academic institutions similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organizations awarding funds to US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
At the beginning of this year, the US Department of Defense founded the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, in which partners from industry and science are to be involved. In addition, the White House announced the establishment of a special committee for artificial intelligence.
In addition, DARPA announced this month the investment of $2 billion in the AI Next initiative.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) is currently investing more than 100 million US dollars annually in AI research.
In the meantime, US legislation on the formation of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has done nothing for months.
Macedonian vote in referendum on a change in the country name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on whether the country's name should be changed to 'the Republic of Northern Macedonia', which would resolve a decade-old dispute with Greece that had blocked Macedonia's applications for membership into the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor means that it is entitled to the Greek territory, and Greece has therefore filed a veto against the inclusion of Macedonia into NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name. However, nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum. A boycott campaign casts doubt that the election vote reached the 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the voting paper was: 'Are you in favour of membership of NATO and the EU by adopting the agreement with Greece?'
Supporters of the change of name, to which Prime Minister Zoran Zaev belongs, argue that Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, is worth taking part in organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, as this means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members have said that they will adhere to the result so that it is crucial.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission said that there had been no reports of irregularities by 1 p.m.
However, the vote was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent of the last parliamentary elections in 2016, with 66 percent of the registered voters voting.
"I am here for my children to vote, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voters in Skopje, the capital.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko will give their vote in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018, in the referendum on the amendment of the country name that would open Macedonia's way to joining NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, presented a small stage and presented chairs in front of tents set up by people who wanted to boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join the raised head, not through the back door," said Kavadarkov.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the integration between Europe and Asia."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will result in urgently needed investments for Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
"I believe that a large majority will be in favour of this, as more than 80 percent of our citizens are for EU and NATO," said Zaev after his vote.
According to him, a 'yes' result would be a 'confirmation of our future'.
According to a survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum. This figure is below the required electoral participation.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian broadcaster Telma TV found that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
70 percent said they would vote 'Yes'.
For the referendum to be successful, the vote must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since its takeover in May last year.
View: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero maneuvers through the whole Brighton defense to achieve goal
On Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling won the Brighton Defense at the 2–0 victory of Manchester City.
Aguero made his hit look ridiculously simple in the 65th minute.
At the beginning of the sequence, the Argentine attacker received a pass in the middle of the field.
He raced between three Brighton resistance players and then ran into the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green jerseys.
He played around a defender and then overtaked several other defenders at the edge of Brighton's criminal area.
Then he shot a pass to the left to Sterling.
The English attacker used his first ball contact in the criminal room to play the ball back to Aguero, who with his right shoe covered Brighton Gatekeeper Mathew Ryan and shot into the right side of the net.
"Aguero fights with problems in his feet," said City Manager Pep Guardiola to reporters.
“We had talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to have reached a goal at this moment."
It was Sterling, however, who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League dual.
This gate fell in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball on this train far on the side of Brighton.
He shot a good steep pass along the left flank to Leroy Sané.
Sané needed a few moves to control Sterling to the long corner.
The Sky-Blues attacker set the ball in the net just before he slipped into the car.
City plays in the Champions League team game on Tuesday at 12:55 in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim against Hoffenheim.
Scherzer wants to spoil the rockies the game
Since the Nationals were expelled from the Playoff competition, there was little reason to force a further deployment.
However, the ever-consuming joker hopes to stand on the hill on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if this is relevant for the rockies who have a match ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the West.
The Rockies scored at least one wild card with a 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but still want to secure their first division title.
“Although we don’t play for anything, we can throw at least because we know the atmosphere of the spectators here in Denver and the other team would probably play at the highest level that would meet me this year.
Why should I not want to participate in this competition?"
The Nationals have not yet announced a starter for Sunday, but according to reports they tend to have jokers thrown in such a situation.
Scherzer, for whom this would be the 34th bet as a starter, practised in the bull on Thursday and would throw on Sunday on his normal rest day.
This season, the Washington law firm has a statistics of 18-7, an ERA of 2,53 and 300 Strikeouts in 220 2/3 Innings.
Trump is holding a rally in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation related to the board Kavanaugh chosen by him for the Supreme Court when he spoke about the importance of the participation of Republican voters in the interim elections.
“All we have done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before one of the most important elections of our life.
That's one of the big, big ones – I'm not acting, but in reality I'm acting, so I'm fighting everywhere for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued, “You see this terrible, terrible radical group of democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to take over power by all means, you see the common sense, the loathsomeness.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to cross, to gain power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we won't give them."
The Democrats, he said, saw their mission in 'to resist and block'.
"And you see this in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "agonizing and mean and disgusting and dishonest."
He named the highest-ranking democrat in the Senate's judicial committee, Senator Dianne Feinstein, which triggered loud noises in the audience.
“Do you remember their answer?
Did you get the document out?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, I'm waiting for you – that was a really bad body language – the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour no longer makes all opinions valid.
The party is intolerant to those who express their opinion.
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted to blame me, this came little surprising.
Finally, I am the last of a number of Labour Members who are told that they are not welcome – just because we say our opinion.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly, as she had been very much opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for expressing a different opinion than Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically on similar issues on which Jeremy did not agree with previous top politicians.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said that 'all meetings should be included and productive'.
Mostly the Friday evening GC meetings in my eight years as a local Labour member were exactly that.
Unfortunately, today most of the meetings are not influenced by this tone, and the promised 'friendly, more careful' policy has long been forgotten if it has ever started.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged whether it is accepted by the top of the party.
This started shortly after Jeremy became a party leader. Members with whom I previously believed to share similar political views now expected me to take a turn and take positions that I would otherwise never have agreed to – whether in terms of national security or the European internal market.
Whenever I speak publicly – and it doesn't matter what I say – a smear irade follows in the social media that calls for my election, condemns the political centre and says that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
And with this experience, I'm not alone.
In fact, I know that I am doing better than some of my colleagues, as the comments I am addressed to are mostly of a political nature.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues, who daily face a flood of sexist or racist abuses and never give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political age is that abuses have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn demanded last week that the Labour Party promote a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we no longer have all our opinions, and with every motion of censure and any amendment of the electoral rules, the party becomes more narrow.
In the last two years, I have often been advised to take my head in and not express my opinion so clearly, and then I would not have any problems.
But I did not go into politics.
Since I was 32 years ago as a student, led by the neglect of the Thatcher government, because of which my classroom literally fell apart in the general school, who joined the Labour Party, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most – as a municipal council as well as as as as as as cabinet ministers.
I have never made a feast from my political views, not even at the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be in any way unclear about my political positions and areas where I do not agree with the current leadership.
I would just like to say to the supporters of the Friday request: given the fact that the country is heading for a Brexit that will harm households, businesses and our public service, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
But in fact, I am not sending this message to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether they are Labour Members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that so many other threats or political intentions will not prevent me from acting in my opinion on the best interest of all of you.

Ayr vs. Melrose 38:17: Unbeated Ayr team rises to the top
Two late attempts may have distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr earned the victory in this very entertaining game of the day in the Tennent's Premiership.
You are now the only one of the ten teams to stand unbeated at the top of the table.
Finally, the success of the home team was due to their superior defenses as well as their better use of opportunities, and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
"We've been tested in our games so far, and we're still unbeatable, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Acknowledgment for Ayr, they have exploited their chances better than we have."
Grant Anderson’s attempt in the 14th minute, which was raised by Frazier Climo, led Ayr. However, because of a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who had been released from the Warriors’ game, Melrose was able to speak the numbers, and Jason Baggot caught a non-enhanced attempt.
Climo expanded Ayr's leadership with a penalty step before reaching a hit directly at the mid-term and then making an increased attempt on his own, so that it stood for Ayr at break 17:5.
Melrose started well for the second half, however, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was raised by Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
Then there was a longer interruption due to a serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, which was carried by the field. After the continuation Ayr expanded his advantage by an attempt by Climo raised by Stafford McDowall.
Then Blair Macpherson, a captain of Ayr, received a yellow card, and again, at the end of a phase, Melrose had the additional man paid for by a non-enhanced attempt by Bruce Colvine.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for tackling without ball against Climo, MacPherson reached a touchdown from the criminal court alley behind the moving Ayr package.
Climo increased, as it had been since the interruption, after Kyle Rowe had intercepted David Armstrong's boxkick and sent out the flank player Gregor Henry for the fifth attempt of the home team.
"Still Game" star seems ready for new careers in gastronomy
"Still Game" star Ford Kieran seems to be ready for a change to the hospitality after it turned out that he was named as the managing director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old is playing Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC broadcast, whose screenplays he writes and in which he plays one of the leading roles together with his long-standing comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last of the show, and Kinning seems to be planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official registrations, he is Managing Director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a source of the Scottish Sun suggested that Kinan would be interested in entering Glasgow's "floring restaurant business".
"The sea belongs to us": Bolivia, which is surrounded by land, hopes that a court will open its way to the Pacific
Sailors patrol in front of the roped Marine Headquarters in La Paz.
On public buildings a sea blue flag blows.
Fleet bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon have the motto: “The sea is our rightful property.
It is a duty to recover."
Throughout Bolivia, the memory of the coastal section lost in a bloody conflict around resources in the 19th century in Chile is still alive, as is the desire to cross the Pacific again.
These hopes may not be as strong as they have been for decades, since Bolivia is waiting for a judgment from the International Court of Justice to be delivered on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and expects the result of course with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Nationally, many Bolivians will follow the judgment of the IGH on large screens, hoping that the court in The Hague will decide in favour of Bolivia’s claim. According to this, Chile is obliged to negotiate a sovereign access to the sea after decades of sporadic discussions.
For Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, who is facing a controversial fight for his re-election next year, there is also much at stake in the judgment on Monday.
"We are about to return to the Pacific," he praised at the end of August.
However, some analysts think it is unlikely that the court will decide in favour of Bolivia, and believe that this would also make little difference.
The UN body, based in the Netherlands, is not entitled to grant Chilean territory and has stated that it will not decide on the outcome of possible talks.
According to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law, that the ruling of the IGH was already in place six months after the final plea, suggests that the case was "not complicated".
Far from supporting the case of Bolivia, the last four years could also be a setback.
"The current Bolivian government has taken the issue of access to the sea," said Zárate.
She indicated that Morales' wary rhetoric suffocated any remaining good will of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their discussions at some point, but after these events this will be extremely difficult.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the view that the court's decision was unusually rapid.
On Monday, Bolivia "has an exceptional opportunity to open up a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "put an end to the 139 years of disputes for mutual benefit", he said.
Calzadilla also argued that morale – still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America – used the subject of the sea as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access to the Pacific," he added.
"The judgment is an opportunity to realize that we have to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament takes place only if it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation would never disarm their nuclear weapons first if it could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke before the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to implement the promises made during a summit between the heads of state of the rivals in Singapore.
His statements come at a time when, more than three months after the summit with North Korean head Kim Jong-un in Singapore, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be about to re-establish the trapped nuclear diplomacy.
Ri described the idea that further sanctions and the resistance of the US against a declaration to end the Korean war would ever force the North to kneel, as "spinning."
Washington is skeptical and does not want to accept the declaration without Pyongyang taking significant disarmament steps at first.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread scepticism that Pjöngjang is serious about the abandonment of an arsenal in which the country probably sees the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pjöngjang next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion Shows in Paris show the latest collections for huge headgear that will soon be available in the shopping streets near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely shield the sun, you no longer need to search.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed a palette of crazy oversized headgear for their 2019 summer collection, which fascinated the fashion world at the Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats have flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their amazing creations over the runway.
The most outstanding piece of Valentino was an extravagant beige hat with a spring-like wide edge, which almost pushed the heads of the models.
As additional oversized accessories were shown with jewels of watermelons, a magic hat and even a pineapple. However, these are not intended to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a number of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks were covered with sewn lips and had more resemblance to Hannibal Lecter than to Haute Couture.
One creation resembled a diving equipment, including snorkel and diving glasses, while another looked like a melted ice bag.
And if you want to set another huge fashion statement, you're lucky.
Fashion watchers predict that the huge headgear could find their way into shopping streets near you.
The oversized hats follow directly to "La Bomba", the straw hat with a width of 60 centimetres, all wearing from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the extremely impractical hat, which struck great waves in the social media, sent another great creation over the runway: a beach bag made of straw, which was almost as big as the one bathing suit carrying the bag.
The bass bag in reddish orange with bast francs and a white leather handle was the outstanding piece of Jacquemus' summer-2019 collection "La Riviera" at the Paris Fashion Week.
Prominent stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: “I expect that big hats and beach bags will be available in the shopping streets next summer. The designer has aroused so much attention that the demand for oversized accessories will hardly be ignored.”
John Edward: Language knowledge for world citizens essential
Scotland’s independent schools continue to be distinguished by academic excellence. This continued in 2018 with further outstanding examination results and is supported only by individual and joint successes in the areas of sports, art, music and other joint ventures.
With more than 30,000 students from all over Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are striving to support their students and their parents at the highest possible level.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further education, higher education, the profession of their choice and their place as world citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a customized curriculum, we see that modern languages are still popular and coveted in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to someone in a language he understands, you reach his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you reach his heart."
This is an impressive reminder that we cannot rely on English only if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The current examination results this year show that languages with the highest existing rates are at the top of the rankings of the independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of the students who learned foreign languages reached grade A in the higher examinations.
The data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of the students in Mandarin reached grade A during the higher examinations, while 72 percent of the students learning German also reached grade A, 69 percent of the students learning French, and 63 percent of the students learning Spanish.
This illustrates that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as an important knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now regarded as electors as well as STEM subjects (natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools and elsewhere.
According to a survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014, 17 percent of the reasons employers mentioned for the problems of occupation were linked to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly imperative when it comes to preparing young people for their future occupation.
As more and more open spaces require languages, this knowledge is essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the chosen profession, young people who have learned a second language will have a real advantage through such a lifelong ability in the future.
To be able to communicate directly with people from other countries, multilingual people will automatically take advantage of competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, and French was spoken as the only language of a double-digit percentage (15 percent).
For this reason, it is important for the children of today that we now invest in language lessons.
Children who speak several languages, in particular languages of developing countries, will have better opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, different languages are taught at all schools.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other languages will teach that are considered the most important for the United Kingdom, for example Mandarin or Japanese, with a view to 2020.
Wherever your child's interests lie, in independent schools there will always be a number of languages with specialised teachers to choose from.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment that prepares the children and equips them with the skills necessary for their success, whatever the future looks like.
At this point in a global economic environment, it cannot be denied that languages are still of fundamental importance for the country’s future, which is why this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be regarded as 'international communication'.
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this choice, diversity and excellence.
Il fat bee le faire.

LeBron before Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
For fans who want to see LeBron James for the first time for the Los Angeles Lakers, waiting soon ends.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday in the opening game of the previous season.
How many minutes it will play, however, is not yet established.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the official Lakers website.
The Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will probably play only a few minutes.
At the beginning of this week James was asked after training for his plans for the six games comprehensive pre-seasonal play plan of the Lakers.
“I don’t need pre-season games at this stage of my career to prepare myself,” he said.
Time for Trumps rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts a series of election rallys tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump's five planned rallys for the next week, including well-minded places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Given the floating vote on the confirmation of his election to the Supreme Court, Trump wants to build support for the forthcoming mid-term elections in November, as Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress.
When will Trump's rally take place in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for today, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 19:00 (East Coastal Time).
You can follow Trump's rally in West Virginia below as a live stream on YouTube online.
Trump will probably appeal to the hearings of Kavanaugh Board nominated for Supreme Court to accuse sexual misconduct that this week was led into a tense atmosphere. The expected Senate vote on the confirmation remains in the suspended for up to one week while the FBI conducts investigations.
However, the main objective of this rally series is to support Republicans who have to face difficult elections in November.
That is why President Trump's election campaign team told Reuters that the next week's five rallies will be used to 'mobilize volunteers and supporters, while Republicans try to maintain and expand their majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives'.
"The control of Congress is so important for his plans that the president will travel to as many states as possible, while the active election season is approaching," said a Trump campaign spokesperson who did not want to mention his name to Reuters.
According to West Virginia Metro News, the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling will be able to participate in "Ohio and Pennsylvania and report media from Pittsburgh" in the event for tonight's event.
The visit to Saturday is Trump's second visit this month in West Virginia, the state he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump tries to support former Republican Senate candidate from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to try to give him a boost in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The team of the United States shows willingness to fight to maintain the hope for the individual on Sunday
After three one-sided rounds, the four-parties on Saturday afternoon may have been exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of the momentum is a pure invention as a sports concept, but one that players really believe in, especially in competitions like this one.
So where do you think the momentum is now?
"They were in the lead with six points, and now they're four, so I think that's a little momentum for us," said Jordan Spieth, leaving the venue.
Europe is, of course, in favour and four points ahead, while twelve others follow.
However, according to Spieth, the Americans feel some wind in their sails and have reason to feel encouraged, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and can each have three out of four points.
Spieth was tremendously strong from the turn to the green and progressed with good example.
The good-natured cries became louder in the course of his round as he sank an important putt in order to decide the fourth match with four points for himself after he and Thomas had returned to two holes with two points.
His putt, who decided the match for her on the 15th hole, triggered a similar scream, which suggests that the American team is not yet out of the game.
"I really have to kneel and take care of my own game," said Spieth.
That's all that remains for the individual players.
18 holes to set a sign.
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood have scored more points in the last two days than Spieth and Thomas, undoubtedly writing the history of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's uneven but sympathetic duo is four out of four points and can't do anything wrong.
"Moliwood" was not the only couple who had not beaten Bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they had also avoided Bogey on Saturday morning, on Friday afternoon and on the back nine holes on Friday morning.
This series and the apparently between them and the exuberant amount of flowing energy underpinned that they are the players to beat on Sunday. Fleetwood and Molinari would be the most popular players who will seal a possible European victory at the sunset of the sun over Le Golf National.
preferably both at the same time on different holes.
However, speaking of European fame would be premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a short trial with Sergio Garcia, the four-hero of the morning, who played with Alex Noren.
A Bogey and two doubles on the front nine holes brought the Spaniards and the Sweden into a terminal that they could not nearly overcome.
On Sunday, however, no one can help them out.
The fours and fours are so fascinating to see from nearby due to the interactions between the couples, the advice they give or do not give, and the way a strategy can change quickly.
The Europeans have so far played better as a team and are clearly in the lead on the last day. However, this four round has also shown that the US team is ready to fight, which some, especially in the USA, had doubted.
Europe takes a lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup with 10:6
After the four and four-parties of Saturday, Europe is at 10:6 a.m. across from the United States and will take a solid lead in the last day of the Ryder Cup.
The brilliant duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari went ahead with two victories over the difficult tiger Woods, which made it possible to score four points in Le Golf National.
The European team led by Thomas Bjørn, who wants to win the trophy lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated in the fours in the morning against the misplaying American team and won the series with 3:1.
In the four-parties, the U.S. made more resistance and won two matches, but could not pick up the residue.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points in the twelve singles played on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood won four points in a row as the first European newcomer, while he and Molinari, who were baptized after a sensational weekend 'Molliwood', won four points only as a second duo in the history of the Ryder Cup in their four opening matches.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fours, they harmonized excellently and beat the degenerated Woods and the American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau with an even stronger 5&4.
Woods, who had towed through two matches on Saturday, occasionally flashed his brilliance, but has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fours and fours and sevens in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested during the four in the morning, returned and played the four games as partner of Henrik Stenson. They won 2&1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, number one and three in the world.
For Europe, however, on this pleasant windy day south-west of Paris not everything ran according to their ideas.
The three-time major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the bar for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They achieved a tough 2&1 win in the fours over the Spanish-playing Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter and beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the four-party 4&3 after losing the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, it was only twice that a team came back after it had left with a residue of four points in the single. However, as title holder for Furyk’s team, it was enough to keep the trophy.
After they've been in second place for two days, it doesn't look like they could start a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea rejects unilateral disarmament without confidence all around
North Korea's Foreign Minister said on Saturday before the United Nations that continued sanctions would deepen their distrust of the United States and, under these circumstances, the country would in no way unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons.
To the annual General Assembly of the World Organisation, Ri Yong Ho said that last year, for example, North Korea had taken substantial measures, for example, to stop nuclear and rocket tests, to reduce the nuclear test site and to commit itself not to multiply nuclear weapons and technologies.
"However, we do not see a corresponding reaction from the US," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and in these circumstances we will by no means unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
While Ri trusted North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phase-wise" approach to denuclearisation, in which North Korea would be rewarded for successive steps, his statement seemed significant in that it did not reject a unilateral denucarization from the outset, as Pjöngjang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint declaration by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June. In this meeting, Kim had agreed to work on the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees for the security of North Korea.
North Korea is seeking an official end to the Korean war that took place between 1950 and 1953, while the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up his nuclear weapons.
Washington also opposes demands for a reduction in the strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US insists on "first denucarization" and increases the pressure by sanctions to achieve its goal by force, and are even against the "declaration of the end of the war," said Ri.
“The assumption that sanctions can force us into our knees is a brain-spinning of those who don’t know anything about us.
However, the problem is that the continued sanctions deepen our distrust."
Ri did not respond to plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. head of state had emphasized at the beginning of the week at the United Nations.
Instead, the Minister pointed out three meetings between Kim and the South Korean head of state Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If South Korea were the other party in the denuklearization question instead of the US, it would not have come to this halt when the Korean peninsula was denuced."
Nevertheless, the tone of Ris' speech was very different from his speech last year when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target North Korea's missiles on the mainland of the USA, after "the evil President" Trump Kim had called "the rocket man" on suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who had threatened with the 'full destruction' of North Korea last year, praised Kim to the United Nations for his courage in the face of disarmament, but said that there was still much work to be done and that sanctions should remain in force until North Korea was decarbonized.
On Wednesday Trump said that he did not have a time frame for it: "Whether it takes two years, three years or five months – does not matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The enforcement of the sanctions of the Security Council must in any case continue vigorously until we have achieved the complete, final and verified denuklearisation."
The Security Council has strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to financially dehydrate Pjöngjang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri on the verge of the UN General Assembly and then said that he would visit Pjöngjang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not successful.
In July, when he left Pyongyang, he said that progress had been made, only to be accused of being charged by North Korea hours later, that he had made "gondola-like claims".
North Korea praised this month at a meeting with Moon, a rocket base and a nuclear complex when the United States took 'equivalent measures'.
He said that Kim had told him that the 'appropriate measures' were security guarantees given by Trump in Singapore, as well as steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn in a course to sleep enough
A new course at Harvard University ensures that all students get more sleep in basic studies this year. This is a measure against the expanding macho culture, keeping awake with caffeine and learning all night.
A scientist has found that students at the world's leading university are often unnecessary when it comes to taking care of themselves.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, and in his opinion is the first such course in the USA.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep withdrawal on learning.
“In the end, a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why do I only learn about it now, in my last year?’
According to her words, no one had ever told her how important sleep is. That surprised me," he said to The Telegraph.
The course, which took place for the first time this year, explained to the students how the basics of good sleeping habits contribute to academic and sporting performance and also improve the overall overall.
Paul Barreira, professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and managing director of the university's health services, said that the university had decided to introduce the course after finding that students suffered from severe sleep withdrawal during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In a section, the students see the picture of a room in a living room and click on coffee cups, curtains, training shoes and books. They get information about the effect of caffeine and light as well as the effects of sleep deficiency on the sporty performance and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another section, participants learn that long-term sleep withdrawal can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes and cancer.
They are then encouraged to think about their daily routine by means of a map of the university grounds with interactive symbols.
“We know that it will not immediately change the behaviour of students.
But we believe that they have the right to know this – just as you have the right to know how the decision to smoke affects your health," added Professor Czeisler.
The pride in "smoothing a night shift" was still widespread, he said, adding that modern technologies and the ever-growing pressure on students made sleep a growing problem.
Sufficiently good sleep should the "secret weapon" of all students be against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said. Furthermore, weight gain can be avoided as sleep withdrawal puts the brain into hunger mode so that they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California who is studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to design the course. Last year, in his first year in Harvard, he completed one of his courses.
He said that the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to take a university course.
He hopes that in the next step all postgraduate students will be invited to complete a similar study program before they start their studies at the competitive university.
According to Professor Czeisler, students should set up an alarm clock for sleep time and wake-up time and be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" that comes from electronic screens and LED lights and can get the circadian rhythm out of the clock. This leads to problems in falling asleep.
Livingston vs. Rangers 1:0: Menga-Tor forces Gerrard's players
The Rangers lost another away game when Dolly Menga's match for Steven Gerrard's unique team meant a 0:1 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to record their first outward victory since the 4:1 triumph at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team added Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager, so that his team is behind the eight points in the Ladbrokes Premiership by far leading Hearts.
Menga met seven minutes before the mid-term, and the low-inspiration Rangers seemed to have no chance to compensate.
While the Rangers now fall to the sixth place, Livingston rises third and lies only behind Hibernian in the goal difference.
The Rangers are also threatened with further trouble after liner Calum Spence had to be treated by a seemingly thrown object from the guest block because of a head wound.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that overtaked Ayr and reached the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, remained with the same eleven Livingston players, who took a point from the Hearts last week, and would have to be enthusiastic about how his well-trained team kept their opponent under pressure on step and step.
Although the Rangers dominated the ball, Livingston achieved more if they had the ball.
They should have scored a goal after only two minutes, when Menga’s first charge led Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor’s Gate. However, the middle field player missed his chance and shot next to it.
Then a long free shot of Keaghan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his defence partner Alan Lithgow could only shoot past the rear post.
The Rangers took control, but their game seemed more hopeful than convinced in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos was obviously of the opinion that after a quarter of an hour of conflict between him and Steven Lawless, he should have received a penalty, but referee Steven Thomson did not apply the Colombian's complaints.
The Rangers came in the first half of the year with only two goal shots, but the former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little difficulty with Lassana Coulibaly's headball and a tame shot of Oviedo Ejaria.
Although Livingston's hits in the 34th minute may not have been in line with the game history, it is not to be denied that they had earned him alone for their hard work.
Once again, the Rangers could not handle a ball shot by Jacobs in a standard situation.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher shot the ball at Scott Robinson, who kept the peace and chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard acted half-time and exchanged Coulbaly with Ryan Kent. The change almost immediately showed effect when the wing player put Morelos in position, but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block the ball.
Livingston, however, continued to get the guests to play exactly the game they were playing, while Lithgow and Halkett received one long ball after another.
Holt's team could have expanded their lead in the last phase, but McGregor stood well and resisted Jacobs before Lithgow shot a headball out of the corner.
The Rangers exchange player Glenn Middleton also claimed a penalty for a crowd with Jacobs late, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now one page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanach: On September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for recognizing and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as a violin counter.
Since then, the violinist has also become a standard element of pop culture, for example in the 1950 film "Bels of Coronado" with the seemingly unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is this all over the world?"
Rogers says: “This is a violin counter used to search for radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you set up these headphones, you can hear the effects of radioactive radiation in the minerals."
Evans: "In fact, I hear a crack!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention that bears its name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" degenerated cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" and destroy degenerated cells.
In the course of treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to detect degenerated cells.
By the method, immune cells are taken from a patient, which are altered in the laboratory.
These cells can "see" a lot of cancers of common protein and are then re-injected.
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
The ovarian cancer of a woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to detect degenerated cells disappeared for more than 18 months.
By the method, immune cells are taken from a patient, which are altered in the laboratory in such a way that they can “see” the many types of cancers common to HER2.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promotes the growth of various types of cancer", including breast, ovarian, lung and intestine cancer, as Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar method in which patients are taken from immune cells and taught to attack cancer cells has helped to treat a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West released a pro-Trump tirade after his performance at SNL, wearing a MAGA cap ("Make America Great Again").
It didn't work out well.
Kanye West was built at Saturday Night Live in the studio after he praised US President Donald Trump and said he wanted to be a presidential candidate in 2020.
After singing his third title of the evening, Ghost Town, wearing a Make-America-Great-Again cap, he continued with a chimp canonade against the Democrats and stressed his support for Trump.
“I’m so often asked by whites, ‘How can you like Trump? He’s a racist.’
So if I were worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star made fun of the statement made by Brett Kavanaugh in front of the Senate's judicial committee on the charges of sexual harassment raised by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the recording of West's chimphtirade was not sent, it was uploaded by comic Chris Rock in social media.
It is not clear whether Rock wanted to make fun of the publication about West.
West also complained to the audience that he had difficulty behind the stage because of his head covering.
“They harassed me behind the stage.
You said, "Don't go out with the cap."
You harassed me!
And then they say I'm in a sunken area," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the submerged area?" He said he would "put on my supermancape, because that means you can't tell me what I have to do.
Try it with love."
His remarks triggered at least twice bubbling calls from the audience, and SNL contributors were embarrassingly touched, Variety reported. One person said to the magazine: "It was dead-silenced in the studio."
West had been committed late as a substitute for singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, the rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused many with a lecture entitled "I Love it" in which he was dressed as a perrier bottle.
West received support from Candace Turner, the head of the conservative group TPUSA. She tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: DANKE, THAT YOU DOWN THE MASS."
The talk show presenter Karen Hunter, however, tweeted that West was just him himself and that was absolutely wonderful.
“But I do not want to reward anyone who, in my opinion, makes an ideology that is harmful to my community and gives himself (by buying his music or his clothing or by supporting his ‘art’).
He's free.
The same is true of us," she added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and was now "The Being formally known as Kanye West" (the officially known as Kanye West being).
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper colleague Snoop Dogg bore the name Snoop Lion, and of course Prince, the late music legend, turned his name into a symbol and then into "The Artist Formerly Known As Prince" (the formerly known artist).

Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as a sword swinging Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series "Game of Thrones".
However, the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the macho hero. He said that such roles on the screen would mean that boys often have the feeling of having to be strong to be respected.
In conversation with "The Sunday Times Culture", Harington said that he believed something had gone wrong, and asked how to solve the problem of toxic manhood in the #MeToo age.
Harington, who recently married Rose Leslie, who also participated in "Game of Thrones", also admitted that the solution to the problem was "very important" to him.
"I personally find the question very important at the moment, what has gone wrong with manhood," he said.
"What have we taught grown men about the problem we are now observing?"
Harington believes that because of the masculine characters, television may be partly responsible for increasing toxicity.
He continued: “What is innate, and what has been learned?
What is taught on television and on the street that gives boys the feeling of having to embody this particular side of a man?
I think this is really one of the big questions of our time: How do we change that?
For there was clearly something wrong with the young men."
In addition, he admitted in the interview that after the end of the series he would not participate in prequels or sequences of "Game of Thrones" next summer. He had "enough of battlefields and horses".
From November on, Harington will be shown in a new edition of Sam Shepard's "True West", the story of a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently revealed that for him the best thing was "Game of Thrones" that he had met his wife Rose.
"I met my wife on this show, so I got my future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose Leslie played in the numerous Emmy's award-winning fantasy series Ygritte, the lover of Harington's character Jon Snow.
The two of them married in June 2018 in Leslie's family affairs in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced an increase of 14°% in the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
In contrast to the past, transmission took place in the vast majority of new cases through sexual intercourse.
To date, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people thus infected with HIV was almost reduced to zero, reported at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000 in China each year.
HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is an acute problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT community members is said to be widespread.
Based on the conservative values of the country, studies have estimated that 70-90 % of men with sexual intercourse with men eventually marry women.
Many of the disease transmissions are due to insufficient protection in sexual intercourse in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has, among other things, promised general access to HIV drugs to address the problem.
Maxine Waters argues that employees had the data of the GOP senators soaked, criticises "hazardous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Maxine Waters, deputies at the U.S. House of Representatives, argued on Saturday that a member of their staff had published the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the Wikipedia pages of the delegates.
The Democrat from Los Angeles felt that the claims of "ultra-law-oriented" experts and websites would be spread.
"Lieing, lying and even more disgusting lies," said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The published information will include the private addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday. During the hearing of a Senate Committee on the charges against the Supreme-Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, they were published by an unknown person in the government quarter.
The publication took place after the three Senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Poundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the contributions is assigned to Waters’ office and published the information of a member of Waters’ staff, reported The Hill.
"This unfounded accusation is completely wrong and an absolute lie," continued Waters.
“The member of my staff – whose identity, personal data and security were threatened by these fraudulent and false accusations – was in no way responsible for channelling this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely wrong and an absolute lie."
Waters’ statement quickly triggered criticism online, including that of Ari Fleischer, a former press speaker of the White House.
"This dementi is angry," wrote Fleischer.
“This suggests that she does not have the right temperament to be a Congressman.
Persons accused of something they have not done must not be angry.
You mustn't be defiant.
You must not question the prosecutor's motives.
You must be calm and calm."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters’ reaction with the criticism of the Democrats to Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of having been angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who takes part in the mid-term elections to replace Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great thing, if that's true," he tweeted.
Waters said in her statement that her office had informed the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities of these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are revealed," she continued, "and they will be held accountable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all my staff members."
Criticism of "Johnny English – You live only three times" – weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now tradition to look for Brexit references in every British-colored new film. This also seems to be true for this revival of the action comedy parody franchise "Johnny English", which began in 2003 with "Johnny English – Der Spion, who painted it" and in 2011 with "Johnny English – Now It's Just Quite" stuttering.
Will an ironic self-parody on the subject of how obviously stupid we are become a new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, the license of the glamorous, Grimasting and incompetent Johnny English was extended for the second time. His name signals more than anything else that he is a general comic creation for cinema visitors in non-English-speaking areas.
Of course, he is again the beaten secret agent, who bizarrely considers himself to be cool and worldly, while in reality he consists of something Clouseau, a pinch Mr. Bean and a crack of this guy, who contributed a single note to the title melody of "The Hour of the Winner" at the 2012 Olympic Games opening ceremony in London.
In addition, the figure was originally based on the chaos behind leaving travelers and international secret agents, which Atkinson played in the forgotten Barclaycard television spots.
The last adventure of Johnny English has one or two nice moments.
I liked how Johnny English approached a helicopter in a medieval armor and the rotor blades were short on his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comics is evident, but the humor seems rather weak and strangely superfluous, especially because the "serious" film series such as "007" and "Mission Impossible" now offer self-confident comedian elements.
The humor seems to be more directed to children than to adults, and for me, Johnny English's crazy miscarriage is not as resourceful and focused as Atkinson's silent film gags in the role of Bean.
The ever-present premise is now that Britain is in great danger.
A cyber hacker infiltrated the super-secret British espionage network and revealed the identities of all British agents in use, very much to the displeasure of the service agent, a unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the Prime Minister, an inflated and crowded figure that is already in front of the complete collapse because of her political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best with this quasi-teresa-may character, but the script doesn't give much that she can work with.
Their intelligence consultants inform them that all active spies have been degenerated and therefore they have to get someone out of retirement.
This includes the tolpatschige Johnny English himself, who is now working as a teacher at a chic institution, but who is an unofficial teacher in the work as an undercover agent. There are a few gags, because English offers a spy academy reminiscent of "School of Rock".
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunited with his former heavily tested Kumpan Bough, who is played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, an annoying woman of the higher society in whose role Vicki Pepperdine is somewhat wasted.
So Batman and Robin, who in the secret service of your Majesty always do everything awfully wrong, are back in action, meeting Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme Fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister gets dangerously into the spell of a charismatic tech billionaire, the dark Jason Volta played by Jake Lacy, who claims to be able to solve the computer problems of Britain.
English and Bough start their odyssee of the grotesque fun: as waiters dressed up, they set fire to a fancy French restaurant, they take care of chaos as they smuggle on board Voltas luxury yacht, and English sets off pure anarchy when he tries to get familiar with the interior of Volta's house with the help of a virtual reality headset.
In this last sequence, all registers are drawn, but as sympathetic and funny as they are, the subject is already dealt with in detail in children's television.
Pretty moderate substance.
As with the other Johnny-English films, I had to ask myself: "Can the British film industry Rowan Atkinson not play a role that really meets its talent?"
Labour contests to work on a plan after which the British work four days a week, but are to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyns Labour Party is supposed to consider a radical plan that provides that the British work four days a week, but are paid for five days.
The party wishes to report that corporate managers pass on the savings made by AI (artificial intelligence) in the form of an additional day off to workers.
This would have given employees a three-day weekend, but would still receive the same pay.
According to sources, the idea of the party's economic agenda and its plans to shift the balance in the country to the benefit of workers is 'appropriate'.
The change to a four-day week was supported by the Trade Union Congress as the opportunity for workers to take advantage of the benefits of the changing economy.
A high-level Labour Party source said to the Sunday Times: “Before the end of the year, a directive review is expected.
"A change will not take place overnight, but a working week of four days is an effort that is consistent with the party's approach to restoring the economic balance for workers and with the general industrial policy strategy of the party."
The Labour Party would not be the first party to support such an idea. During the 2017 general election campaign, the Green Party already promised the introduction of a 4-day week.
However, the approach is not currently supported by the Labour Party.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: "A 4-day week is not a party policy and it is not considered by the party."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell made concrete in the Labour Conference last week his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of "anonymous directors" and "profitmakers" from public utilities.
The chancellor's plans also mean that the current shareholders of the water supply companies may not receive their total share, as a Labour Government could do so because of alleged misconduct.
He also confirmed the appropriate plans to appoint employees on the board of companies and to set up Inclusive Ownership Funds to transfer 10% of the equity of private companies to employees who collect annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy express themselves in the newsmagazine "60 Minutes", whether the FBI's investigation in the Kavanaugh case could change their mind
The FBI investigation on the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed a final vote on his appointment as Judge at the Supreme Court by at least one week and raises the question of whether the results of the Authority could influence Republican senators in order to gain their support.
In an interview on Sunday, 60-minute correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could show something that could eventually change their mind.
Kennedy seemed to be more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
“I announced in the trial that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after that, this claim was made, and asked if he did it.
He was determined, determined and unmistakable."
Graham's voice, however, seems to be chiseled in stone.
"My opinion is clear about Brett Kavanaugh, and it would have to burst a bomb," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know the following: Brett has fought this vehemently," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she mentioned couldn't confirm it."
It's now 36 years.
And I can't find any changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has contributed to reducing poverty as part of this festival?
On this Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival will be held in New York, to combat poverty in the world, an annual music festival with an impressive lineup of stars and an equally impressive mission.
Tens of thousands will visit the Global Citizen Festival, which will take place for the 7th time this year, not only to experience the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the actual goal of the event: to combat extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which took place for the first time in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project. Within the framework of this project, an international interest group is trying to fight poverty by motivating more and more people to actively participate in the fight against poverty.
To get a free ticket for the event (the other option would be to buy a VIP ticket), you need to complete a number of tasks, including actions such as volunteering, communication with a leading politician worldwide (by e-mail or telephone) or similar measures to raise awareness of the goal of combating poverty.
How successful is the project, considering that Global Citizens remain 12 years to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of looking at a cool free concert, a useful way to convince others that it is time to act, or just another case of so-called clicktivism – if you think you are changing something by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen announced that since 2011, the project has been able to record more than 19 million actions by its supporters and achieve various goals.
These actions should have helped to encourage world leaders to announce commitments and strategies worth more than 37 billion dollars, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group quoted 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, of which at least 10 billion dollars have already been paid out or recruited by fundraising.
According to the Group's estimates, the secured funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Among the most important commitments is the project The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and implementations based in the United Kingdom that have committed themselves to supporting children in their optimal development, and which have promised to help Rwanda with $35 million to combat malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 Tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," said the Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The Group also announced that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve the nutrition situation of mothers and children, the government announced the funding of the The Power of Nutrition project, which aims to reach 5 million women and children and provides food interventions.
In answer to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, namely the question of why global citizens can combat extreme poverty,
they replied: “It will be a long and strenuous path with heights and depths.
But similar to the major civil and anti-apartheid movements in front of us, we will succeed, as we are together stronger and more influential.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists who will be present at this year’s New York event, including Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman as presenters.
The US could use the Navy for blockade purposes to hinder Russian energy exports – Ministry of the Interior
According to Washington Examine, if necessary, Washington can use the Navy so that energy from Russia does not reach the markets including the Middle East, said US Minister of Interior Ryan Zinke.
Zinc claimed that Russia’s use in Syria is an excuse to explore new energy markets. Russia is currently operating in these areas at the invitation of the legitimate government.
"I think the real reason for Russia's use in the Middle East is the negotiation of new markets in the field of energy, just like in Eastern Europe," he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this.
"The United States, together with the Navy, can ensure that the seaways remain open and, if necessary, block them in order to ensure that the energy from Russia does not reach the market," he said.
Zinc turned to the participants of the Consumer Energy Alliance event, a non-profit group that is understood as a "voice of electricity consumers" in the USA.
He drew a comparison between Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran and found that they were practically identical.
"The use and replacement of fuels is more or less the economic option in Iran and Russia," he said, while he called Russia "one trick pony" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements were made when the Trump government was in the process of expanding the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe and thus replacing Russia, the far cheaper option for consumers in Europe.
To this end, government officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "unreasonable" pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which, according to Trump Berlin, became a "prisoner" Moscow.
Moscow has stressed several times that the North Stream 2 pipeline is worth 11 billion US dollars, which is to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, an exclusively economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's massive resistance to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we all believe that energy should not be used as a means of exerting pressure, and that consumers can choose the suppliers themselves," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US has received counterwinds from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organisation, the German Federation of Industry (BDI), has invited the USA to stay out of EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"It is a major problem for a third country to interfere in our energy supply," says BDI Dieter Kempf's board after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren wants to "check exactly" a presidency candidate 2020, says the Senator for Massachusetts
The Senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would "check exactly" a presidential candidate after the interim elections.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering a candidate.
According to The Hill, Warren said it would be time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and that includes women at the top.
Warren plans to 'check' a presidential candidate after 6 November.
Warren said during the meeting that President Trump is heading this country in the wrong direction.
"I am extremely concerned about how Donald Trump deals with our democracy," she said.
Warren did not speak out in her criticism of Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, she announced that an FBI investigation would of course be necessary before the vote.
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that the majority of the Warren voters do not believe that they should be candidates for 2020.
According to the survey conducted by the Suffolk University Political Research Center and Boston Globe, 58 percent of potential voters in Massachusetts reported that the senator should not be able.
32 percent of voters supported such a candidate.
The survey showed more support for a candidate for former Governor Deval Patrick; with 38 percent who support a potential candidate, and 48 percent who are opposed.
Among the further names of prominent democrats who are eligible for a potential candidate for 2020 are former Vice-President Joe Biden and the Senator of Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
According to Associated Press, Biden announced that he would make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin expresses his post-traumatic stress disorder at Donald Trump-Ralley, under which track Palin suffers
Track Palin, 26, was in Iraq for a year.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"What my son is going through, what he is going through when he comes back, all this can be seen by other families who feel the effects of PTBS and some of the wounds that our soldiers return with," she told the audience at a ralley for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described his arrest as "Elefant in Space" and said about her son and other war veterans that they would come back changed, that they would return more brutely, that they would come back and ask themselves if there was this respect for what other soldiers and pilots and any other member of the military had given the country.
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was charged with domestic violence against a woman, says Dan Bennett, a spokesperson of the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and D.C. support a legal remedy to the new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support an appeal to the new US policy that refuses to grant asylum to victims of gang activities or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the district submitted a court expert statement on Friday in Washington to support an asylum applicant who is questioning politics, reported NBC News.
The full name of the applicant in the Grace-began-sessions-complaint filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal politics has not been announced.
She said that her partner 'and his violent gang sons' abused them, but US officials refused their asylum application on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
The prosecutors who support Grace referred to El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where many people apply for asylum in the United States, as nations that have to struggle with major problems with criminal gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy lifted a 2014 Board of Immigrant Appeals decision that allowed illegal immigrants on the run from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The Federal Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of legislation at state, state and international level”.
"The Federal Act requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the application and that this court infringes this principle", was stated in the Court's expert statement.
Furthermore, the lawyers argued in the statement that the policies that immigrants refuse to access the country have an adverse effect on the US economy, as immigrants could be more active than entrepreneurs and provide the necessary labour force.
Federal Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered in June that immigration judges no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and the violence of criminal gangs.
"Asyl exists for all those who leave their homeland because they are persecuted or because of fear due to race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political conviction," said Sessions in its announcement of the politics of 11 June.
It was never the plan to defuse all the problems by granting asylum, even all the serious problems with which people have to fight worldwide every day.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palu, as the number of deaths in the race doubles with time
For the survivors, the situation became increasingly worse.
"It's all very tense," says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, calming her little feverish son in a rescue center in the destroyed downtown of Palu.
“Every minute a new ambulance comes with dead people.
Clean drinking water is scarce."
Residents returned to their destroyed houses to collect their wet and well-being and to store everything they could find.
Hundreds were injured, and the staff of the hospitals damaged by the 7.5-strength earthquake were completely overloaded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered vortex and a broken shoulder, remained outside the military hospital of Palu, where patients were treated in the outdoor area because of the persistent severe aftershocks.
With tears in his eyes, he told how the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“Everything went too fast.
I think I was stuck under the invading walls," he told the Associated Press, adding that the reason for staying in the city was a wedding.
“I heard my wife’s calls for help, but then there was peace.
I don't know what happened to my wife and my child.
I can only hope they're in a safe place."
U.S. ambassador sues China of tyranny with "propaganda ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page ad in an American newspaper that announced the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of exploiting the American press for propaganda purposes.
USA Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to the paid supplement of China Daily in the Des Moines Register, the best-selling magazine in Iowa, after accusing China of interfering in the US Congress elections on 6 November, an indictment that contests China.
Trump's accusations that Beijing has tried to interfere in the US elections correspond to the U.S. officials' announcement to Reuters; a new phase of an escalating campaign launched by Washington to exert pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to place advertisements for promoting the economy, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an expansive trade war, with customs duties on imports for both countries.
The Chinese retribution duties at the beginning of the trade war should meet exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of Trump, said Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador to China and former long-standing Governor of Iowa, who exports agricultural products to China to a large extent, reported that Beijing has damaged workers, farmers and businesses.
China, according to Branstad in a opinion in Des Moines Register of Sunday, is now doubling this tyranny by switching propaganda ads in the US's own free press.
"With the spread of its propaganda, the Chinese government is claiming the tradition of freedom of expression and the independent press proven in America by switching the country's paid advertising to the Des Moines Register," wrote Branstad.
"In contrast, you will only find a limited number of votes against the newspaper skis here in Beijing and will not really reflect the different opinions that the Chinese might have on the disturbing economic development of China, given that the media are firmly in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that one of the most famous newspapers in China did not accept the offer to publish its article, but he did not mention the name of the newspaper.
Republicans beat voters before the interim elections with the debacle around Kavanaugh, warn observers
Since many of the most influential Republicans support and defend the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, in the face of several accusations for sexual violence, observers have warned of a counter-reaction during the forthcoming interim elections, which could be based in particular on women.
The mood in this context was extremely tense, and most Republicans have already stated that they are continuing with a vote.
"One cannot undo such things," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that the last minute advance of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation was sufficient to calm down angry voters.
"Women don't forget what was yesterday, they don't forget it tomorrow or in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, first consultant and national spokesperson for the progressive MoveOn group, the daily newspaper in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, protesters in the corridor of the “November Is Coming” Senate called when the Republicans, controlling the Justice Committee, decided to hold on to the nomination of Kavanaughs, despite the statement of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported Mic.
Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are an extremely important topic, said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political observer on the news page.
“People say it’s already high, that’s true.
But it could be higher, especially among voters in the suburbs and among younger voters, people between 18 and 29, who, although they do not like the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public statement, in which its accusations of the sexual attack against the candidates of the Supreme Court are listed in detail, observers indicated that a counter-reaction could be the result of the Republicans' progress in confirming.
"This situation is a messy mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of the last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not only about the vote of the committee, about the final vote or about the review of Kavanaughs; it is also about the way the Republicans have dealt with it and how they have dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, Director at Priorities USA, a group that supports the election of democrats, to the news channel.
The Americans, however, seem to disagree with whom they should believe because of the statements of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a slightly larger share standing on the side of the latter.
A new survey by YouGov showed that 41% of respondents were definitely or probably convinced of Ford's statement, while 35% stated that they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh.
Furthermore, 38 % claimed that they considered that Kavanaugh was probably or definitely lying to his statement, while 30 % said the same about Ford.
After the pressure of Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least another applicant, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford made an affidavit in front of the Senate Justice Committee last week that she was attacked by the drunk Kavanaugh at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court had exposed his genitals to her when they were at a party during their studies in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to counter Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is currently launching a startup with the aim of establishing a competition for Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee's open-source platform Solid.
With Solid, users can choose where their data is stored and who gets access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee gave the best idea that the intention behind Inrupt was the "world domination".
"We must now become active," he said on startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology so users can create their own personal online data storage or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, task lists, a calendar, a music library, as well as other tools for the private and corporate sector.
Similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all content is available in one browser and at the same time.
The special feature of the personal online data storage is that the user can decide by himself who can access which data.
The Company refers to this concept as personal strengthening and development through data.
According to the CEO of the company John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company uses resources, processes and related capabilities so that Solid is available to everyone.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, some developers who have been hired to work on this project, as well as a community of voluntary programmers. Furthermore, a security platform acquired by IBM is used.
From the beginning of this week, technology developers worldwide can create their own decentralised apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee announced that he and his team will not exchange with Facebook and Google on whether a comprehensive change is to be made, in which their entire business models will be completely remodelled overnight.
"We do not ask for their permission."
In a paper on medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt has the task of providing commercial energy generation and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new, solid-based web.
In 1994, Berners-Lee redesigned the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past few months Berners-Lee has played a major role in the debate on net neutrality.
Even with the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely confident about this new era of the web," he added.
Priest Bernard Vann, carrier of the Victoria Cross in World War I, was honored
The only clergyman of the Church of England, who was awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I, was honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Priest Bernard Vann won the award due to his commitment to attacking Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper and never learned that he had won the highest British war award.
His two grandchildren revealed a memorial stone on Sunday at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of the grandsons, Michael Vann, said that this act is full of symbolic power, as the memorial stone was revealed exactly 100 years after the heroic act for which his grandfather was awarded.
According to The London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on September 29, 1918, through dense fog and violent fires of field guns and machine guns.
Later he pushed forward to the fire line and led the line forward with the "greatest bravery" before he rushed ahead with a field weapon in the single entrance and shut down three of the military units.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was shot by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the actions of his grandfather were something he could never do, and at the same time something that makes you humble.
Together with his brother, Dr. James Vann, he laid down a wreath after the parade under the direction of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann stated that he felt very honored to be able to participate in the parade, adding that the bravery of a real hero became visible especially through the support of many people.
MMA fans stayed awake all night to watch Bellator 206, instead there were Peppa Pig
Imagine you stayed awake all night to watch an exciting Bellator 206, and then you can't watch the main event.
The bill of San Jose contained 13 fights, including 6 on the main map, and was broadcast live all night in the United Kingdom to channel 5.
At 6 p.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for their fight, the audience in the United Kingdom was not surprised when Peppa Pig was suddenly on display.
Some remained untouched after they remained awake until the early hours of the morning to see the fight especially.
A fan described on Twitter the change to the cartoon character as a kind of bad joke.
"Thanks to a government regulation, this content is not considered youth-free, so that it had to be switched to a child's mission at 6 p.m.," said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President in the field of marketing and communication at Bellator when he was questioned about the transmission.
"Peppa, the pig, exactly."
Bellator's CEO, Scott Coker, announced that the company will work on the schedule to take account of viewers from the UK in the future.
“I think the problem could have been solved during the repetition game,” he said.
"But it's 6:00 a.m. on a Sunday with the UK audience, and we won't solve the incident until Sunday our time, Monday local time there.
But we'll stick to it.
When the change was made, there was quite a lot of communication. It was pretty messed up and it wasn't always nice.
We have tried to solve the problem and assumed that it is a technical disorder.
What was not the case was a problem on the part of the government.
I promise it won't happen again.
We will reduce the whole to 5 instead of 6 fights, as in the normal case, and we have tried to offer the fans the best possible experiences.
The whole situation is rather regrettable."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels like she's "underlying" on the subject of sexuality
Tom Daley, who participated in various Olympic games as a water jumper, says that he grew up feeling that he was inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality, but this feeling had motivated him to be so successful.
The 24-year-old said that he had only realized at the secondary school that he was different from others.
In the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne he said that he has spoken out on the subject of gay rights to encourage others.
He also said that since he became a father, the victories at the Olympic Games are not so important to him anymore.
The actual presenter of the long-term show, Kirsty Young, pauses due to illness for a few months.
In Laverne's first show, he said that he had previously considered himself inferior compared to others, since the love for boys and girls was socially totally unacceptable.
He said: "Until today, it is feeling to be inferior and different from others, reason for my power and strength and ultimately for my success."
He wanted to prove that he is a very special personality to disappoint no one when his sexual orientation became known.
The double bronze medal winner at the Olympic Games is today a prominent LGBT activist and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to promote the decriminalisation of homosexuality in other countries.
He said that he had expressed himself on this issue, because fortunately he could live without restrictions and without discrimination and would like to encourage others.
The three-time world champion fell in love with the US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013. The realization of falling in love with a man was an absolute surprise for him.
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner in the previous year, but he shared that the age difference had never been a topic.
He thinks that if you had to go through so much as a child and a youth – he took part in the Olympic Games at the age of 14 for the first time and his father died of cancer three years later, it is difficult to find someone of the same age with similar experiences.
Since June, the couple has a son who bears the name Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley thinks that his whole view has changed since then.
Last year, he had all about gold medals.
But for him there is now more important than Olympic gold medals.
His son Robbie is now his main winner.
He bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 years after the diagnosis of brain tumor.
Daley said that his father did not accept the approaching death, and one of the last things he asked for were the London 2012 tickets, as he wanted to be in front of him.
"I couldn't tell him he wouldn't be there any more," he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only after that did I finally realize that he was not invincible,” he continued.
The following year, Daley won the bronze medal at the 2012 Olympic Games.
“I only knew that it was always my dream to dive in front of local audiences at Olympic games – that was the madness,” he said.
His first selection of songs – Proud by Heather Small – was also influenced by it. He heard the song in the run-up to the Olympic Games and still provided geese skin.

Mickelson, who is currently not in shape, sits at the Ryder Cup on Saturday on the replacement bench
The American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday at his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he has to make a great effort so that the whole thing doesn't become a debacle.
Mickelson, who plays for the 12th time at the event, was sent to the replacement bank by Captain Jim Furyk for the Fourballs and Foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the centre of the event as usual, the five-fold major winner spent his day firing up others and working on his game, hoping to solve the problems that burden him.
Even at the height of his career, 48-year-old Mikkelson was never the most direct golfer and therefore no ideal occupation for the tight Le Golf National Golf Course, where misguided balls are regularly punished.
And as if the place itself would not be disheartening enough, Mikkelson meets the perfectionist British Open Champion Francesco Molinari in the ninth game on Sunday, who joined Tommy Fleetwood, newbie in these tournaments to win all four games this week.
If the Americans with four points behind in the 12 single games have a hot start, Mickelson's game could prove to be absolutely decisive.
Furyk was confident of Mickelson and could not add much.
“He was perfectly aware of his role today, gave me a clap on my back and put his arm around me and said he was ready for tomorrow,” said Furyk.
“He has a lot of self-confidence.
He is one of the world's famous personalities and he has done so much for these teams in the past and also this week.
I didn't think he was at two games.
I had imagined more, but that's how it went, and that's what we expected.
He wants to be there like everyone else."
Mickelson will reach the Nick Faldos record for most of the Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
It could mean the end of a Ryder Cup runway that never completely corresponded to the highlights of his personal record.
Mickelson can record 18 victories, had to put in 20 defeats and reached seven half-times, although Furyk announced that his presence alone enriched the team.
"He's funny and sarcastic, original and likes to have some fun, and he's a great person who's popular with the whole team," he said.
“I think the younger players were happy to meet him a little closer this week. It was fun watching them.
He is a really interesting person who gives many impulses."
Captain Thomas Bjørn knows that it can soon be over with the lead
Thomas Bjørn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a great advantage that leads to the last single games in the Ryder Cup can quickly become an unpleasant situation.
The Danish debuted in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a lead of five points over the Americans, but only slightly over the finish line and headed with the smallest possible lead, winning a victory of 141⁄2–131⁄2.
“The idea remains that we had a great advantage in Valderrama, we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but that was only limited,” said Bjørn (pictured in the photo) after seeing the victory 5–3 of the Class of 2018 both on Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
Experience shows me and all the team members that it's not over.
Tomorrow we'll be fine.
Put yourself in the stuff and do exactly the right thing.
The whole thing is only over when the points are on the display board.
We have a goal, we want to win this trophy, and that's exactly where our focus lies.
I've always said I'm focused on the 12 players on our side, but we're completely aware of what's opposite us: the best players in the world."
Rejoice at the performance his players achieved on a difficult golf course, Bjorn continued: “I would never overturn that.
Tomorrow will be another caliber.
Tomorrow, individual benefits are in the foreground and this is a completely different thing.
It's great to work with a partner when things are going well, but if you're out there alone, you'll be tested as golfers up to the limits of your skills.
You have to make that clear to the players: get the best out of you tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he also has to get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent Jim Furyk will be careful to make sure that his players cut out better than in the team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself stood on both sides of that big turnaround on the last day of the tournament. He was standing on the winner's side in Brookline before standing on the side of the losers after Europe's "Wunderer of Medinah".
"I remember every damn word," he answered the question as Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, motivated his players before the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you would like to take off the quick start you saw in Brookline and Medinah.
When the momentum hits in one direction, it puts the middle games under a lot of pressure.
We set up our team accordingly and send out our boys the way we feel, you know, we're trying to spell tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned the task of getting a counter-beat, he had to compete in the top game against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as other Europeans in the top half of the ranking.
"I chose the boys in this order, since I think it covers everything," says Bjorn about his selection for the individual meetings.
Germany's new warship delayed again
The latest frigates of the German Navy should have been put into service in 2014 to replace the years of warships from the time of the Cold War. However, according to local media, due to faulty systems and rapid growing costs, it will not be delivered until the earliest of next year.
The commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the leading ship of the brand new frigates of the "Baden-Württemberg" class, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the time called for a military speaker.
The ship should have been put into service as early as 2014, but the ambitious project was plagued by disturbing problems after delivery.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class, already ordered by the Navy in 2007, are to replace the old frigates of the Bremen class.
They should include a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft missiles and sea target missiles, as well as tar technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic reflection.
Another important feature are longer maintenance periods. It should be possible that the latest frigates do not have to return to their home ports for up to two years.
However, the continuing delays can cause the state-of-the-art warships that Germany is supposed to represent as maritime power to be obsolete at the time of their commissioning, says Die Zeit.
The Fregatte F125, persecuted by the accident, got into the headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship to the yard after its delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media mentioned a number of significant "software and hardware errors" that would have made the new ship useless in a battle situation.
Software problems are particularly serious, since ships of the Baden-Württemberg class are operated by a crew of only 120 sailors, only about half as many as on the older frigates of the Bremen class.
It has also been known that the ship is far too heavy, which results in performance losses and prevents the Navy from carrying out upgrades in the future.
The 7000-tonne Rhineland-Palatinate was apparently twice as heavy as ships with a similar class used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project, including the training costs of the crew, has also become a problem.
It seems that costs rose to €3.1 billion, compared to the €2.2 billion originally planned.
The problems with the latest frigates are particularly significant in view of the recent warnings that Germany's maritime power is shrinking.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, military officer of the German Bundestag, confirmed that the Navy is "going out of the capable ships".
Bartels said that the problem grew over time, since old ships were taken out of service but no replacement ships had been provided.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could be removed from the Navy.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
In a property in the Scottish Highlands, new research is being carried out to show how bats use the landscape in their food search.
It is hoped that the results will provide further insights into the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future nature conservation activities.
The study conducted by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will search for dwarf and mosquito bats as well as the brown long ear and water bats in Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices are placed at key positions on the property to record the activities of bats throughout the season.
Employees of the NHS and volunteers will also conduct mobile investigations with portable detectors.
In a noise analysis of all recordings by experts, the frequency of bat calls is determined and determines which species does what.
A map and a habitat report will then be prepared to provide a detailed picture of their behaviour at the landscape level.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor for the NTS, hopes that the results will show which areas of the habitat are the most important for bats and how these are used by each species.
These data will help to determine the benefits of the habitat management measures, such as the creation of meadows, and to show how to obtain forest areas for bats and other related species.
The bat stocks in Scotland and the whole of the United Kingdom have declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that impact on sleeping places and lead to the loss of habitat.
Windwheels and lighting can also pose a risk, as can fly-catchers and chemical treatment of building materials or attacks by domestic cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echoing to detect insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout Scotland, takes the theme of bats very seriously.
It has 10 trained experts who regularly carry out inspections, inspections of sleeping places and sometimes rescue measures.
The organization has even set up Scotland's first and only bat reserve in Threeave in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's 10 species of bats.
Agent David Thompson explains that the property is the ideal habitat for them.
"Here in Threeave we have a great area for bats," he explains.
“We have the old buildings, many old trees and an excellent habitat.
But there is much that we do not yet know about bats, so here and at other goods we are doing these works that will help us learn more about what bats need to feel comfortable."
He stressed the importance of excluding the presence of bats before maintenance work in the goods, since it was possible that the involuntary destruction of a single nesting site could kill up to 400 females and young animals and eliminate the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or destroy them or their nesting sites.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the people to help.
She explains: "We still have a lot to learn about bats and with many of our species we do not know what their populations are like."
Ronaldo disputes rape accusations while his lawyers want to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo referred to rape charges against him as "fake news" and said that people want to "be famous" by using his name.
His lawyers plan to sue the news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The storm of the National Team of Portugal and Juventus Turin was accused of having raped an American named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is said that he then paid her $375,000 to buy her silence to the incident, says Der Spiegel on Friday.
In an Instagram live video about his 142 million followers, 33-year-old Ronaldo mentioned the reports only hours after their release as "Fake News."
‘No, no, no, no, no.
What they reported today: Fake News," said the five-time winner of the balloon d’Or in the camera.
“They want to profile themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
You want to become famous with my name, but that's part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything is good," the player added smilingly.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue the mirror on the basis of the accusations they have referred to as "unauthorised reporting on suspicions in the area of privacy".
Lawyers Christian Schertz said that the player claimed compensation for "moral damage at a level equivalent to the severity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in 2009 in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After getting to know each other in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went to the player's room, where, according to documents filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada, he allegedly raped them anal.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo went to her knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was too "99 percent a good guy who had killed the "one percent".
In the documents it is claimed that Ronaldo confirms that the two had sex, but say that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had photographed her injuries in a hospital, but later admitted to an extrajudicial agreement because she had "fear of retribution" and worried about being "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old said that she is now trying to cancel the agreement, since she is still traumatized due to the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to switch from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged incident, and this summer he moved to the Italian giant Juve in a 100 million euros deal.
Brexit: The United Kingdom would “eternally regret” the loss of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would "everlastingly regret it" if, after Brexit, it lost its status as a world-leading manufacturer of cars, said Minister of Economic Affairs Greg Clark.
He continued to say that it was "anxious" that Toyota UK told the BBC that it would temporarily interrupt production at the plant in Burnaston near Derby if Britain left the EU.
"We need a deal," says Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer indicated that the influence of border delays on a no-deal Brexit could lead to job loss.
The plant in Burnaston, where Toyota's Auris and Avensis product lines are produced last year produced almost 150,000 vehicles, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I am convinced that we will experience production stops in our plant at an uncontrolled Brexit at the end of March," says Marvin Cooke, Toyota's Managing Director in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also raised fears about a tough EU exit without agreement and its influence on cross-border trade.
BMW says, for example, that it will close his mini plant in Oxford after Brexit for a month.
According to car manufacturers, the main concerns are related to risks within the supply chain in the case of a hard Brexit.
Toyota's manufacturing plant is operated on a "just-in-time" basis, which means that the parts are delivered every 37 minutes by suppliers both from the UK and the EU to manufacture the cars on order.
Should the United Kingdom leave the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be interruptions at the borders which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and bottlenecks in the parts.
It is impossible for Toyota to hold a stock of warehouses at Derbyshire plant that lasts more than a day, the company explained why production should be interrupted.
Clark stated that Theresa May's Chequers Plan on the future relationship with the EU "is precisely designed to avoid such border controls".
"We need a deal. We want the best deal, which, as I have already said, allows us not only to enjoy the current success, but also to take this opportunity," he explained in BBC Radio 4's broadcast Today.
"The findings not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers show that we must be able to continue the very successful supply chains so far."
Toyota could not indicate how long production would have to be interrupted, but warned long-term that additional costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is the highest functionary of the Unite Union, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, these jobs will never return once they have left.
One government spokesman said: 'We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.'
Trump's planned meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again according to the White House
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein could be postponed "for another week", while the fight for the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, continues, it was said on Sunday from the White House.
Rosenstein has supervised the work of Special Agent Robert Mueller, who examines the electoral interference by Russia, links between Trump's advisers and Russia, and possible judicial disability by the President.
The question of whether Trump would fire the Deputy Justice Minister and thus endanger the independence of Mueller has been the subject of rumors in Washington for months.
At the beginning of the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein addressed the possibility of secretly recording his talks with Trump and the President's office with the help of the 25th Constitutional Supplement.
Rosenstein demented the report.
However, he went to the White House last Monday, while new reports of his alleged resignation became known.
Instead, a meeting with Trump at the UN General Assembly in New York was announced for the coming Thursday,
Trump said he would prefer not to release Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid colliding with the hearing before the U.S. Senate Justice Committee, in which both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, said.
On Friday Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of the charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the full vote of the Senate.
Trump's press spokesperson Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
She answered a question about the meeting with Rosenstein: “A date has not yet been set for this, but I can also imagine that it will be postponed by another week, given all the things that are happening with the Supreme Court.
But I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some reporters would probably contradict this claim: Sanders has no longer held a White House press conference since September 10.
Moderator Chris Wallace asked her about the reason.
Sanders explained that the low frequency of the press conferences did not give rise to an aversion to the TV reporter's "effect-hazarding" but admitted: "I would not deny that they are having an effect-hazard."
She then claimed that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
The President made more questions and answers rounds than any president before him," she said, without any precise evidence, 'we have looked at these figures.'
There will still be press conferences, Sanders said, but if the press has the opportunity to ask directly questions to the President of the United States, it is far better than talking to me.
We are trying to do this often and you have seen that we have done so often in the last few weeks, which will take the place of the press conference if you can speak to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York, the president may have demonstrated why this is so when he made a bizarre appearance in front of assembled reporters.
Minister of Health writes to EU workers of the Scottish NHS because of Brexit's concerns
The Minister of Health addresses people from the EU who work in Scotland’s National Health Service (NHS) to express the country’s gratitude and to express the wish that they remain in the country even after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the United Kingdom left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already agreed to bear the costs of applying for residence permits for EU citizens working in Scotland's decentralised public service.
In your letter, Freeman wrote: “In the course of the summer, the UK-EU withdrawal negotiations were continued and decisions are expected this autumn.
However, the British Government has also strengthened the preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I am aware of the disturbing times this must be for all of you.
That is why I wanted to express once again how much I value the contribution of each and every employee, regardless of nationality.
Ladies and gentlemen from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and thus benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is full of your home and we would be very happy if you stayed here."
Christion Abercrombie was subjected to an emergency operation after a head injury
According to information from Mike Organ of Tennessee State, the Tennessee State Tigers Christion Abercrombie suffered an emergency operation on Saturday at the 31-27 defeat against the Vanderbilt Commodore.
Rod Reed, the head coach of Tennessee State, explained that the injury occurred shortly before the mid-term break.
"He came to the sideline and simply collapsed there," says Reed.
Trainers and medical personnel supplied Abercrombie with oxygen on the sideline before being placed on a carrier and transported for further examinations.
A speaker from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had left the opera at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "no details are known about the nature or extent of the injury" and Tennessee State tries to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a so-called red-shirt, plays with Tennessee State in his first season after he moved from Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he recorded a total of 5 tackles, increasing his total number to 18 tackles in the season.
Foreign investors will have to pay higher stamp tax for real estate purchases in the United Kingdom
In the future, investors from abroad will have to pay a higher stamp tax for the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom, and the additional income will benefit from the new plans of the Conservative Party.
This step should reduce the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign for young voters
The increase in the stamp fee will affect all those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance expects an increase of up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people
Theresa May will announce today that foreign investors will have to pay a higher stamp fee if you buy real estate in the United Kingdom, with the additional income to benefit homeless.
This step represents an attempt to limit Jeremy Corbyn's success with young voters, who promises to provide more affordable living space and to target top earners.
The increase in the stamp tax will be levied on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and additional income will be added to the government campaign against homelessness.
In addition to the current stamp tax and including the two-year increase on second dwellings and real estate left for rent, the surcharge could be up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects an increase of up to 120 million pounds per year by the step.
Estimated 13 percent of newly built properties in London are purchased by investors who are not resident in the United Kingdom. This increases prices and makes it more difficult for first-time buyers to take a foothold in the real estate business.
Many wealthy areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become 'spirit cities' because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the United Kingdom.
The new strategy follows only a few weeks after Boris Johnson has called for a reduction in the stamp tax to enable more young people to become the first home home.
He accused construction companies of raising real estate prices by buying up land without using it, and urged Theresa May to give up quotas on affordable dwellings to end Britain's "living room damage."
Opposition leader Corbyn announced a striking number of proposals for housing reforms ranging from renting up to bans on spaces without good reason.
He would also like to grant councillors more powers in the construction of new apartments.
May said: “Last year I said that I would devote my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream, according to which life should be better from generation to generation.
And that means repairing our broken housing market.
Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live and work here and build up a life.
However, it may not be right for people who do not live in the UK, as well as for companies based abroad, to buy real estate as well as for hard-working British citizens.
The dream of home has become too distant for too many people, and the indignity of homelessness remains too big a problem."
Jack Ross: ‘My biggest goal is to manage Scotland’
Jack Ross, head of Sunderland, says that it is his ‘largest goal’ to become the manager of the Scottish team at some point.
The 42-year-old shot enjoys the challenge of bringing the club out of the north-east of England into new life, which is currently in third place in the League One and lacks the three points at the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St. Mirren back to the first Scottish League in the last season.
“I wanted to play as a player for my country.
I made it to the bank and that’s it,” Ross told the show Sportsound of BBC Scotland.
“But as a child I have often seen Scotland playing in Hampden with my father and that’s something that always pulls me back.
However, this option would only come if I were successful in club management."
Ross predecessors in the role as manager of Sunderland include Dock Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa athletic stated that he was not afraid to enter the footsteps of such an established name after he had previously rejected Barnsley's and Ipswich Town's offers.
The success will be measured at the moment by whether I can trace the club back to the Premier League.
In view of the structure and possibilities in this association, he is no doubt part of the Premier League," he explained.
"It's not an easy task to get him there, but I'd probably only estimate my time here as a success if I brought the club back there."
Ross can show a first three-year management career, after a phase as Deputy Chief at Dumbarton and a 15-month coaching job in Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa to recover from the relegation into the third league and helped St. Mirren from the margin of the relegation to win the championship in the following season.
Ross says he feels better now than ever before in his player career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"That must have been a way out," he recalls when he took over the responsibility of Alloa.
“I really believe that management was the right thing for me, more than games.
It sounds funny, as I didn't get bad, could live well from it and experienced some very pleasant high-phases.
But playing can be hard.
There are many things you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through this with regard to the stress and pressure in my job, but management feels right.
I have always wanted to manage and now I do it. I have never felt so comfortable in my skin all my life as an adult."

The perfect time for a glass of beer is at 17:30 on Saturday, so a study
The heat wave in summer missed the revenue of UK crisscrossing pubs, while restaurant chains were under greater pressure.
Public and bar companies recorded sales growth of 2.7 percent in July. However, according to statistics, revenue from restaurants decreased by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the CGA, which compiled the figures, said: “Keeping sunshine and England’s longer than expected participation in the World Cup meant that July followed a pattern similar to the previous June, where pubs recorded sales increases of 2.8 percent. However, restaurant hit it even harder.
The decline of 1.8 percent recorded by the restaurant industry in June continued to increase in July.
Pubs and bars with a focus on beverages showed by far the best performance, with an area-adjusted sales development that increased higher than it dropped at the restaurants.
Pubs with a focus on food also suffered in the sun, but not as drastic as the restaurant operators.
It seems people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In managed pubs and bars, beverage sales increased by 6.6% per month, while food sales fell by three percent."
Paul Newman, from the analysts for the leisure and hospitality industry RSM, said: “These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and influence of important social or sporting events remain the biggest factors for sales in the out-of-home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to face problems, but sales losses of 4.8 percent will be particularly painful compared to the previous year in addition to the continuing cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come for operators of companies with a focus on food at a worse time and it remains to be seen whether the more temperate temperatures in August will provide the urgently needed breathing break."
Overall sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including reopenings, was 2.7 percent in July and reflected the decline in brand rollouts.
The branch sales monitor Case Peach Tracker for the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the United Kingdom collects and analyzes performance data from 47 active companies with combined sales of over 9 billion pounds and is the recognized industry benchmark.
One of five children has secret social media accounts that hide it from his parents
A study shows that every fifth child, some just 11 years old, has secret institutions on social media that keep it secret from parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 students in secondary schools has seen an increase in so-called fake insta sites
The message fires fears that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of the students reported having a "main account" to show it to their parents
One of five children, some just 11 years old, creates accounts on social media that it can keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students in secondary schools showed a rapid increase in so-called fake insta accounts, a reference to the photo-sharing website Instagram.
The message fires fears that sexual content will be shared.
Twenty percent of the students reported having a clean "main account" that they can show to their parents, but that they also own private accounts.
A mother who came across the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who asked others to "rape me."
The study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC) of the independent schools found that 40 percent of 11-18 year olds had two profiles, half of which admitted to own private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, Chairman of the HMC, said: "It is disturbing that so many teenagers are being tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle becomes 'voice of athletes' in the Scottish sports council
Eilidh Doyle was elected as a non-executive member to the Council of Scottish athletics roofing association Scottish athletics at his annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most excellent athlete and Chairman Ian Beattie described the choice as a great opportunity for sports officials to benefit from their extensive international experience over the last decade.
"Eilidh is respected in the athletics community of Scotland, Great Britain and the world, and we are sure that the athletics in Scotland would benefit greatly from their choice to the Council," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I am looking forward to acting as the voice of the athletes, hoping that I can make a real contribution and lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200 and 400 metres distance at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, called a total of four Olympic gold medals his own and today often appeared as a BBC expert, could no longer run after a transient bleeding disorder.
He wrote on Twitter: “One month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk anymore.
Doctors say no one can tell if or how far I'm going to heal.
It was hard work, but I have recovered completely, have learned to run again and do mobility exercises today!
Thank you for the encouraging news!"
An advertisement for milk pumps comparing mothers with cows provides excitement in the net
A producer of milk pumps provided excitement in the network with an advertising clip comparing breastfeeding mothers with the milking of cows.
The manufacturer of consumer technology Elvie has published a music video to mark the freedom of the pump to breast-feeding mothers for the launch of the 'world's first low-noise portable milk pump'.
Four real mothers dance in a barn filled with hay with cows in the background to a song that contains lines like: "Yes, I milk, but you don't see a tail" or "if you haven't noticed it, these are not udders but my breasts."
In the chorus it continues: "Pump it out, pump it out, I feed the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies."
However, the advertising published on the company's Facebook page has triggered a controversy in the web.
With 77,000 accesses and hundreds of comments, the video found mixed reactions among the audiences, many of whom say that the "fears" of the dairy industry are outrageous.
"It was a very bad decision to apply this product with cows.
Just as we do, they must become pregnant and give birth to a calf to produce milk, with the difference that their boys will be taken away within a few days of birth," said a comment.
Elvie's milk pump fits discreetly into a still bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment was: “Intelligible traumatic for mother and baby.
But hey, why don't we use them to apply for a milk pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Another person added: 'Such a non-reality advertising'.
Others defended the advertising, and a woman admitted that she found the song "urcomy".
“I think that is a brilliant idea.
I would have bought one if I were still breastfeeding.
When pumping down, I felt just like a cow.
The clip is a little crazy, but I'm not trying to overinterpret it.
This is a brilliant product," wrote one person.
Another person commented: “This is a funny advertisement addressed to mothers who use milk pumps (often at work or on toilets) and feel like cows.
This is not advertising for or against the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the group reveals to women that all danced with the discreet pumps in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the realization that many women using milk pumps indicate how dairy cows feel.
However, Elvie's pump is completely noiseless, has no wires or hoses and fits discreetly into a still bra, giving women the freedom to move, keep their babies or even go out during the pumping process.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, said: “Elvie’s pump is such a revolutionary product that it earned a bold and provocative market launch.
By comparing breast-feeding mothers with dairy cows, we wanted to focus on milk pumps and all the associated challenges and at the same time, in an entertaining and comprehensible way, to present the incredible feeling of freedom that the new pump allows.
This is not the first time Elvie's pump has gotten into the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, designer Marta Jakubowski appeared a two-time mother on the Catwalk while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were brought silently and quietly to a tent town on the Texan border
The number of interned migrant children is as high as never before, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively equal, among other things as increased rhetoric and measures by the Trump government have made it more difficult to accommodate children with caregivers.
Traditionally, most of the caregivers themselves were illegal immigrants and are now afraid to become a target for a expulsion themselves when they report to take in a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential maintainers and other adult members of their household would have to print out their fingerprints and share these data with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albumnce, a high official of the Customs Authority Immigration and Customs Enforcement, announced before Congress that the authority had arrested dozens of people who had applied for the care of unaccompanied minors.
The authority later confirmed that 70 percent of the prisoners had no previous entries in the criminal register.
“Almost 80 percent of persons who are either self-responsors or members of a household of a caregiver stay illegally in the country, and a large proportion of them are punishable foreigners.
That's why we're going to continue tracking these people," said Albumnce.
In order to be able to handle the cases of children more quickly, officials introduced new rules, which, according to some children’s staff, require that they appear in court within one month instead of 60 days after the arrest, which was the standard before.
Many will appear by video and not by personal means to intervene before an immigration judge for their legal status.
In case of negative decisions, the person is quickly deported.
The longer these children remain in custody, the more likely it is, according to the accommodation staff, as well as reports from the system during the last month, that they are scared and depressed, which can lead to violent outbreaks or outbreaks.
Defenders say that these concerns are reinforced in a larger facility such as Tornillo, as there signs that a child has problems are more easily overlooked due to the size.
They also explained that it could reinforce trauma, which many of the children already suffer, if they were brought to a tent city without emotional preparation or sufficient time to say goodbye to friends.
Syria calls on American, French and Turkish ‘occupied forces’ to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home even though the civil war in the country is now in the eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, stated that the foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil and are "treated accordingly" with the pretext of the fight against terrorism.
"You must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the Assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more people have been expelled from their homes.
He said that Damascus "will continue to fight this sacred battle until all Syrian territories are cleaned" by both terrorist groups and "every illegal foreign presence".
The United States has stationed around 2000 soldiers in Syria, who mainly train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are recruited against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1000 ground troops in the war-ridden country.
With regard to the refugees, Moualem stated that the conditions for their return were given and he accused "some Western countries" of "dispersing irrational fears" that prevent refugees from going home.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to enable return home," he said.
"They are politicizing a purely humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union warned that no building aid would be granted to Syria as long as there was no political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
Diplomats from the UN stated that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on a buffer zone in the last major rebel holster Idlib represents the opportunity to advance political discussions.
The deal between Russia and Turkey turned a broad-based offensive of the Syrian forces supported by Russia towards the province where three million people live.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement had 'clear deadlines' and expressed his hope that military action against jihadists, including fighters, would be carried out by the Nusra Front, allied with Al-Qaeda, which will be 'exterminated'.
UN representative Staffan de Mistura hopes to be able to convene soon the first meeting of a new committee consisting of government and opposition members to design a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem mentioned the Syrian Government's conditions for participation in the Committee and stated that its work should be limited to "the revision of the articles of the current Constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win His Reelection
With this logic Trump would win his re-election in 2020, should not, as many liberal spectators probably hope, end an office withdrawal or a scandal his presidency prematurely.
This would undoubtedly be 'the most dramatic finale of a presidency of all time'.
So far, there are no signs that the viewers would be satisfied.
Since 2014, CNN has more than doubled its power consumption rates to 1.05 million and is almost tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News reaches an average of 2.4 million spectators at the best time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago. MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” led the turn-on rates with 3.5 million viewers on evenings with important news.
"It's like a fire that attracts people magically, because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Bear, show runner of the TV station ABC drama series "Designed Survivor" about a cabinet member who becomes president after an attack destroys the capitol.
Nell Scovell, an old-fashioned comedy writer and author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club" has a different theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the election in 2016.
The driver told her he was going to pick Trump.
She asked him the reason.
“He said, ‘because he makes me laugh’,” Scovell told me.
The chaos is worth entertainment.
Of course, in contrast to everything that can be found on television, the stories from Washington can determine the future of the principle decision on abortions Roe v. Wade, the possible integration of families and the health of the global economy.
Switching off is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
And yet it goes beyond being an informed citizen when one becomes aware of having watched six hours of an expert round, using sources from the so-called "deep background" for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 expensive bomb jacket made of ostrich leather (according to Washington Post a "cloth rich in self-overestimation") or discussing the effects of Stormy Daniel's captivating description of Trumps, ehm, anatomy.
I'll never be able to see Super Mario with the same eyes again for my part.
"A part of what he does can feel like a reality show that he performs every evening," says Brent Montgomery, Chief Manager of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the series "The Three of the House of Trust", about Trump's rotating occupation and daily action (a dispute with the Football League NFL breaking off the fence, Kim Jong-un praises).

When I reached the river this week, it was sunny 27 degrees off his house on the north coast of the Hawaiian island of Kauai, but he hid inside and looked at MSNBC while at the same time recording CNN.
He simply couldn't get away from the screen, not when Judge Brett Kavanaugh was about to testify to the Senate's judicial committee and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
“I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows at the time and people said, ‘This is the beginning of Western civilization’,” Fleiss told me.
"I thought that was kind of a joke, but it turned out they were right."

Donations funds flooded the narrowest races for seats in Congress in the intermediate elections
It is hardly surprising that the 17th election district of Pennsylvania is flooded with donations, thanks to the newly drawn borders of the constituencies, which led to two officials standing in the race around the same seat.
The recently newly drawn suburban district in Pittsburg has the Democratic Conor Lamb joining, who won his seat in another district in the course of a special election in the spring.
Lamb opposes another official, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which strongly overlaps with the new 17th district.
The cards were newly drawn after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old districts were violated and manipulated in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district triggered an exchange of votes between the major financial weapons of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a close victory in a highly respected special election in March around the 18th election district of the state.
This seat was held by a Republican for over a decade and Trump won the lead there with 20 percentage points.
Political experts give the Democrats an easy lead.
The US examined El Salvador's punishment for its support for China, but then returned
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing without encountering great resistance from Washington.
Trump held a friendly meeting with the President of Panama Juan Carlos Valero in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partner threw out the management team of the Trump Organization.
Officials of the US Department of Foreign Affairs have decided to withdraw the heads of all American foreign representations from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of 'the recent decisions to cease to recognise Taiwan', says Heather Nauert, spokesperson of the Ministry in an opinion at the beginning of the month.
However, only in the case of El Salvador have sanctions been considered, which in 2017 received an estimated $140 million in American aid, including for drug controls, development and economic aid.
The proposed penalties, including reductions in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
While internal meetings continued, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which was to follow a similar meeting last year and was a step forward in the efforts to prevent migrants from moving toward the USA.
In mid-September, however, senior government officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place and so effectively ended the consideration of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now scheduled as a spokesperson at the conference scheduled for mid-October in order to provide a sign, according to diplomat information, of the importance that the government of the Assembly gives.
The three American diplomatic representatives are silent and silently returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without any new harsh communications or sanctions from Washington.
A spokesperson of John Bolton rejected an opinion on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to comment on the internal meetings on the condition of anonymity.
Their comments were confirmed by an external analyst close to the government, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Learn from history
The next major surprise could be the report by Special Agent Robert Mueller on Trump's possible judicial disability, for which there is now sufficient evidence in public.
Mueller now allegedly also investigates whether Trump's campaign team has condensed with Russia in its attack on the American elections.
Should the Congress majority change, Trump sees himself confronted with an organ that forces him to account, precisely at the time when he is passing by to step back before the voters; and possibly before a jury of jury.
That is a lot of ‘ifs’ and I do not want to say that the case of Donald Trump, or that of his European counterparts, is inevitable.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we have to make decisions that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were willing to make a coup against Hitler if only the West had resisted him and had supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We have failed and missed a chance to avoid the years of barbarism that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and the incessant march of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are facing several such turning points.
What do we do when Trump fires Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein, that is, the man who decides on the future of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in Teufel's kitchen since this newspaper last year reported that he suggested that the president be secretly recorded and speculated about whether he was inappropriate for the office.
Rosenstein dements the representation of the New York Times.
"How will we answer if the newly ordered FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair or he is confirmed in office despite credible accusations of sexual abuse and false statement?
And above all, will we vote in the intermediate elections for a congress that forces Trump to account?
If we fail in these trials, a long winter awaits us.
But I do not think we will fail because of what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same regime that once occupied my home.
She survived, immigrated to America and sent me 60 years later to light Sabbath candles on the table with the hook cross.
How can I not be optimistic about this legacy?"

Graham Dorrans from the Rangers optimistically before the match against Vienna
The Rangers receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the knowledge that a victory against the Austrians after the impressive remis against Villareal in Spain will put it in a good position at the beginning of the month for the qualification of the Group G of the Europe League.
Because of a knee injury Graham Dorrans could not appear up to the 2-2 level against Villareal, but he believes that the Rangers can use this result as a springboard for bigger.
"That was an important point for us, since Villareal is very good," said the 31-year-old.
We went into the game with the conviction that we could do something about it and we went home with a point.
Perhaps we could still have won in the end, but overall, a decision was probably a fair result.
They probably dominated in the first half, but we did our best in the second half and then we were the better team.
Thursday will be another great European evening.
Hopefully we get three points, but this will be a tough game as they have achieved a good result in the last game. But I am sure that we can get through with the audience behind us and achieve a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult, with everything that happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is some kind of well-being factor.
The team is good and the boys are really good at it; the training is good.
Hopefully we can look forward now, leave the last season behind and be successful."
Fear of retirement benefits leads to sleepless nights in women.
Although the participants in the survey knew exactly how to care for them, few talked to their family members about it.
About half of the participants in the Nationalwide study reported talking to your spouses about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent reported talking to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but don't take the necessary steps to hold the conversation," says Holly Snyder, Vice President of the National Life Insurance Division.
You should start with this.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not express your wishes in good time.
Work with your consultant and family to discuss where and how you want to be cared for, as these decisions can be an important factor in determining the costs.
Bring your financial advisor on board: Your advisor can also help you find a way to finance these expenses.
Your financial decisions for long-term care can include a traditional care insurance, a hybrid capital-forming life insurance to help cover these costs or self-insurance with your own assets - as long as they own the money.
Work out your legal documents: Avert disputes at the last minute.
Set up a precautionary authority so that you instruct a trusted person to monitor your medical care and ensure that the health professionals meet your wishes, you should be unable to express them yourself.
Consider also an authority for your finances.
You select a trusted person who makes financial decisions for you and ensures that your invoices are paid, you should not be able to do so.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your older parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about drug intake or allergies?
Write down these details in a written plan so that you are ready.
"Not only the financial issues play a role. Who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What is the medical treatment?"
Who cares for the dog?

Man in Ilfracombe shot several times with air gun
A man was shot several times with an air rifle when he went home after a job with friends.
The victim, a man in the Forties, was in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, belly and hand.
Officials described the shots that took place around 02:30 British times as 'random action'.
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His injuries were not life threatening, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a strong earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, the authorities say. The number of dead is likely to increase.
Because of the outrageous communication systems, relief workers were unable to obtain information from the government district of Donggala, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with the strength 7.5.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a county in the island of Sulawesi, in the north-west of the island of Sulawesi.
In 2017, an estimated 299,200 people lived in the government district, an administrative unit below the province.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of revenue of the Central Sulawesis economy, in particular the Donggala coastal region.
Nickelabbau is also important in the province, but it focuses mainly on Moravali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesis.
Palu and Donggala have been victims of earthquakes and tsunamis over the last 100 years, according to Indonesia's Civil Protection Authority.
In 1938, over 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
West Donggala was hit in 1996 by a tsunami in which nine people died.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific fire ring, and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in the north of Sumatra triggered a tsunami on December 26 that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people in the coastal areas of the Indian Ocean, almost half of them in Aceh.
2005: A number of severe earthquakes shook the west coast of Sumatra between the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people died on the Nias Islands off the coast of Sumatras.
2006: An earthquake with the strength 6.8 shook the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island and triggered a tsunami that hit the south coast and claimed nearly 700 deaths.
2009: An earthquake with the strength 7.6 hit the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
Over 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake with the strength 7.5 shook one of the Mentawai islands off Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozen villages and claimed about 300 people's lives.
2016: A slight earthquake shook the district of Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time no tsunami was triggered, but over 100 people died from a crashing building.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit the Indonesian island of Lombok, popular among tourists, and claimed more than 500 deaths on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded on the island.
Sarah Palin's son arrested for allegations of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and former candidates for the vice-president's office, was arrested for allegations of physical injury.
The 29-year-old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on the suspicion of domestic violence, the disability of the report of domestic violence and the resistance to state violence, according to a report published on Saturday by Alaskan police.
According to the police report, he took a friend's phone when he wanted to contact the police.
According to KTUU, Palin is in detention in the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and a security deposit of 500 dollars has been raised.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where, when he was asked for his plea, he replied with "Not guilty, quite sure", according to the network.
Palin is accused of having committed three class A violations, which can be punished with up to a year in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also charged with a class B violation, which can be punished with a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
It is not the first time that Palin has been charged with criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently being negotiated before the Veteran’s Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, disability of reporting a crime and possession of weapons under the influence of drugs in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of having beaten her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran organizations in 2016 after returning her son's behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder due to his time in Iraq.
Tsunami after earthquakes in Indonesia: hundreds dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake that shook the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake with a strength of 7.5 triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and communication networks are interrupted and the number of deaths is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just off the coast of Central Sulawesis, located northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
On the social networks, videos circulate from the time the wave hit the country.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami met on the coast.
Federal Prosecutor's Office requires rare death penalty for suspects in New York terrorist attacks
The New York Federal Prosecutor's Office calls for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the accused in the terrorist attack of New York City, who cost eight people's lives. This is a rare punishment that has not been imposed in the state since 1953 for a federal crime.
The 30-year-old Saipov is accused of having used a rented pick-up of the Home Depot DIY chain for a terrorist attack, during which he ran on a bicycle path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October, crossing pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov "targeted" the eight of them and "consciously" committed serious physical injuries, as stated in the Memorandum of Understanding for the claim for the death penalty filed in the southern district of New York.
Both charges could be punished with death, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a Federal Criminal Court of Saipov filed an indictment in 22 points involving eight charges of the murder against the background of the organised crime normally used by state lawyers in cases of organised crime, as well as an indictment of the violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack requires "basic planning and intent", according to the prosecutors who described the way in which Saipov carried out the act as "disgusting, cruel and corrupt".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov added to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erly, Hernán Ferruchi, Hernán Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco damage, pain and losses," explains the statement.
Five victims were Argentine tourists.
For over a decade, the southern district of New York has no longer pursued a case with the aim of demanding the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers and finally sentenced to a life sentence in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in New York during a federal offence was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who had been convicted of committing espionage for the Soviet Union two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed with the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, bore witness in the days and months after the attack of a lack of repentance, according to court records.
He told investigators to feel good about what he did, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to do so after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, according to the indictment.
According to police, he also called for the flag of ISIS to be hung in his hospital room.
He declared himself not guilty in all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the public defenders representing Saipov, said that they were "of course disappointed" by the decision of the prosecutor.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty rather than a confession of guilt in exchange for a life sentence without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma that all parties are suffering," says Patton.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the charge not to demand the death penalty.
A Conservative Party MP calls for NIGEL FARAGE to transfer the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage swore today to mobilise "the power of the people" during a protest action in the context of the Tories Conference.
The former head of the party of Ukip stated that politicians must "feel the pressure" of the Eurosceptics, while a member of Theresa May's party suggested that Farage should lead the negotiations with the EU.
The conservative back-bench Peter Bone told the protestors in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would be "ready out" if Farage Brexit were Minister.
The challenge facing May in the reconciliation of its deeply disputed parties was reinforced by the fact that members of your party, who are for a stay in the EU, participated in a separate demonstration against Brexit, which took place in the city.
The Prime Minister has problems keeping her Chequers compromise plan on track despite attacks by Brexit supporters, Brexit opponents and the EU.
Allys insisted that, despite the counter-reactions, they should continue to try to negotiate a deal with Brussels, forcing Eurosceptics and the opposition Labour Party to decide between their package and the 'chaos'.
Bone explained at the Leave Means Leave demonstration in Solihull that ‘Chequers belong to the garbage’.
He suggested that Farage should have been named a peer and entrusted with responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were responsible, we would already be outside," he said.
Wellingborough’s delegate added: ‘I’ll stand up for Brexit, but Chequers is on the garbage.’
He stressed his opposition to the EU: ‘We have not fought in World Wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone rejected allegations that public opinion has changed since the 2016 referendum: ‘The idea that the British people have changed their opinion and now want to remain in the EU is completely wrong.’
The Brexit proponent of Conservative Andrea Jenkyns was also at the demonstration and said to reporters: ‘I’m just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The compromise is unpopular in the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular in our own party and with our activists who actually walk through the streets and make sure that we are elected.
Please give up Chequers and start listening.”
In a pointed message to May, she continued: ‘Prime Minister will keep her jobs if you keep her promises.’
Farage stated in a speech that politicians must feel ‘the pressure’, they should just be cheating on the decision of the 2016 referendum.
‘This is now a question of trust between us, the people, and our political class’, says Farage.
‘They are trying to cheat on Brexit and that is why we are here today to say to them, ‘that you do not get away with it’.
In front of a enthusiastic crowd, he continued: ‘I want you to feel pressure from our political class, which is just before betraying Brexit.
“We mobilise the power of the people of this country, which helped us to victory in the referendum and will never come to rest as long as we are not an independent, self-management, proud United Kingdom.”
At the same time, Brexit opponents marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A few activists waved banners of the Tories Against Brexit group, a group of Brexit opponents within May's party, which was launched on the weekend.
Lord Adonis, peer of the Labour Party, made fun of the Tories who had security problems with a party app at the opening of the conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can ensure that the IT systems, as well as all the technology for Canada Plus, are present for the smooth border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” said Adonis.
"This is a farce.
There’s just no good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to “check exactly” the candidate for the presidency
The U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren stated that after the November elections, she would "check the presidential candidates closely".
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts democrat spoke about her future at a meeting with voters in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a pronounced critic of President Donald Trump, is currently in the race for re-election for the Senate against the Republican MP in the Massachusetts Geoff Diehl Parliament, who was Vice-Chairman of Trump's election campaign team in Massachusetts in 2016.
It was the focus of speculation that could challenge Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke has been her 36th meeting with voters in the so-called Town Hall format since Trump took office.
One of the people present asked her if you would like to run for the presidency.
Warren replied that it would be time for women “to go to Washington and repair our broken government and that includes women at the top.”
Arrest after death shots on LSU player Sims
Baton Rouge police, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect had been arrested on Friday's LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
At a press conference, the Baton Rouge Police Department announced that it had arrested 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11 a.m. Eastern Time.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help with the identification of the man to be seen on the recordings.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot on Friday morning near the Southern University campus.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot injury and died as a result of this injury," according to the sports media portal 247, Police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday.
Wayde wanted to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to have been at the crime scene and owned a weapon and to have shot at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without further incidents and arrested in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The two-metre Sims grew up in Baton Rouge and played in 32 games with 10 starting positions in the last season and could have an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prize of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the World Championship title after his team has left him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the time Valtteri Botta landed in qualifying before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that Stallorder of Mercedes would play a major role in the race.
From the pole position Bottas managed a good start and it was almost as if he showed Hamilton when he defended his position in the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his teammates.
Vettel first went into the box and let Hamilton get into traffic at the end of the driver's field, a decision that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went a round later in the box and landed behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtook him after a tight wheel-on-wheel maneuver, in which the Ferrari pilot reluctantly released the inside side to endure with the risk of two movements to defend the third curve.
Max Verstappen began in one of the rear squares of the field and was in seventh place on his 21st birthday after the end of the first round.
He was then the fastest for most of the race as he held on to his tires to quickly finish and overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He finally went in the 44th round in the box and failed to take a step in the remaining eight laps, while Raikkonen finished fourth.
It was a difficult day because Valtteri has been doing an excellent job all weekend and how a real gentleman acted when he was supposed to let me pass.
The team has done excellent work to achieve a double victory," said Hamilton.
A case of really bad body language
President Donald Trump laughed at a Saturday election event about Senator Dianne Feinstein, who insisted on not having passed on the letter from Christine Blasey Ford to the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh's sexual abuse to the press.
At the event in West Virginia, President Ford’s statement to the Senate’s judicial committee was not directly addressed, but commented that the events in the Senate show that people are “common, evil and dishonest”.
"The thing that could happen and the wonderful thing that has happened in the Senate in the last few days is when you see the anger when you see people who are angry and mean and evil and dishonest," said the President.
“When you look at the Leaks and say, “Oh, that wasn’t me.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, were you responsible for the leak?
Think of your answer... Published the document - “Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't publish it."
Okay, just a moment.
Did we... no, we didn't publish it," he added by imitating the Senator's voice.
Feinstein was charged with Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh in July and he was released in early September. However, Feinstein argues that the leak comes from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't publish your story," Feinstein told the Committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep the letter secret, and I have agreed to her request for secrecy."
Your dementi did not seem to get well with the president, who said on Saturday evening at the election campaign event: “I tell you one thing, that was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
In his continuous defense of the judge candidate accused of sexual assault by three women, the Democrats claimed that the charges would be used for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by all means.
You see the common sense, the evil, they don't care who they hurt when they get under the wheels to gain power and control," the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made the victory again on Friday in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants through a 5:3 victory in the backplay in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants led by two goals, after hits by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie made up for the home team before Dwyer restored the Giants leadership.
Francois Bouchard was like Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen won with two goals.
This was unexpected for the men of Adam Keefe, who struck Dundee on Friday evening 2-1 in Belfast, the third defeat in the Elite League in the season.
This was the fourth season of the season between the two teams, with the Giant winning the three previous games.
Dwyer's opening gate took place in the fourth minute after 3:35 minutes after a presentation by Kendall McFaull. Four minutes later, David Rutherford delivered the template when Beauvillier expanded the leadership.
In this exciting opening phase, Sullivan brought home the home team back to play after 13:10 minutes before Matt Marquardt Cownie helped out with his compensation goal after 15:16 minutes.
Dwyer ensured the Giants' leadership before the mid-term break when he reached his second goal of the evening shortly before the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped again and Bouchard was reunited with a power-play hit in the 28th minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game late in the second half. Nielsen then secured his team the victory with a fifth goal after almost half of the second half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will be playing at Milton Keynes Stadium the next Friday.
Air traffic controller died after he was sure that hundreds of people in an aircraft would escape the earthquake
A flight ticket in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero after he finds death to safely launch an airplane with hundreds of people on board.
Over 800 people died and many are missing after the island of Sulawesi was shaken on Friday by a devastating earthquake that triggered a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks are still felt in the region and many people are trapped in ruins in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gwamaan Agung refused to leave his post in the heavily fluctuating control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained to make sure that the flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was on the runway at the time, could safely take off.
He jumped out of the tower when he thought he was crashing.
Agung later died in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesman for the Indonesian Air Safety Service, explained that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, says Australia's ABC News.
“We have provided a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to bring him a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
We are deeply affected by this message," he added.
At the same time, the authorities fear that the number of deaths could rise to several thousand. The country’s civil protection authority stated that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number is expected to increase, as many bodies are still under the ruins, while others cannot be reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the Authority.
Waves up to 6 meters high have devastated Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring relief and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute a new ambulance comes with dead people.
Clean drinking water is scarce.
Supermarkets are looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, CNN stated: “The Indonesian Red Cross is hurrying to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get even worse."
Indonesia’s President Yoko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said in a speech before the country’s military: “I ask you to work all day and night to carry out all the tasks associated with the evacuation.
Since you ready?" said CNN.
This year, Indonesia was already shaken by earthquakes in Lombok, where over 550 people died.
Aeroplane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports a missing plane crash in Lagoon
The airline operating the flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia is now reporting a missing person after claiming that all 47 passengers and the crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini stated in a notice that they can't say anything about the stay of a passenger by Saturday afternoon.
The airline indicated that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew members after the plane crashed into the water during the attempt to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials announced that seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline stated that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, but were in a stable state.
The cause and the exact course of the accident remained unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both explained that the plane landed in the lagoon shortly before the runway.
Some witnesses thought that the plane flew out of the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane flew very flat.
"That's a very good thing," says Jaynes.
Jaynes explained that he and others were able to wade through deep water to the emergency exits on the sides of the sinking plane.
He said that the flight attendants panicked and screamed and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy indicated that sailors working close to improving a mooring were rushing to help with an inflatable boat to bring people to the coast before the plane sank in about 30 metres (100 feet) of deep water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network data, 111 people died in crashes of airlines registered in Papua New Guinea, but none of them concerned Air Niugini.
Analyst reconstructs the end of the night in which a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the indictment concluded its evidence in the retrial of a case in which a man is accused of banishing a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst of the U.S. Department of Justice Paul Rowlett said for hours as an expert in the field of information evaluation.
He explained to the jury how he reconstructed the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on their death night.
Rowlett said to have received position data from different mobile phones that showed that Tellico was together with Chambers in the evening of her death. This contradicts his previous statements, says the newspaper Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers during the period when he said he had been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford joined the stand on Saturday and said that he had not been in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis had said the truth when he said he had been to Sanford's pick-up that night, Sandford said that he had lied, "because my pick-up was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellico stated that he had known Chambers for two weeks at her time of death.
But cell phone records indicated that they knew each other for a week.
Rowlett explained that for some time after Chamber's death, Tellis loosened their messages, calls, and contact information from his cell phone.
"He has removed them from his life," says Hale.
Defense is expected to begin its pleas on Sunday.
The judge assumes that the trial will then take place before the jury that day.

Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently experienced a renaissance in the United Kingdom by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
New York nanny sued couple for a release after "racist" SMS
A New York nanny sues a couple for a discriminatory release after receiving a misguided message from the mother who complained that she was still a black man.
The couple argued to be racist and compared the dispute with a ' blackmail'.
The two-time mother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed her dismay when she found out that the new daymother, Giselle Maurice, was black when she started her first working day in 2016.
"NOEEEAEAEAEEEIN, NOT A SWARZE," Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
Instead of sending them to her husband, she sent the message to Maurice twice.
After recognizing her fauxpas, the "painfully touched" Plasco-Flaxman Maurice dismissed and claimed that the imprisoned African-American daymother had done some bad work and expected a Philippines woman instead, says the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for her workday and then sent home with a Uber.
Now Maurice sues the couple for compensation for the dismissal and asserts a claim to compensation for the 350 dollars a day which she would have taken over six months to pay for the job she had originally booked without a contract and for which she would have lived with the couple.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do that," the paper explained on Friday, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple rejected the charges of racism, and argued that the release of the reasonable step was because they feared Maurice, after they insulted them, could no longer be trusted.
“My wife sent her something that she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," said husband Joel Plasco of the post.
“But would you entrust your children to a person who was rude to them, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Plasco compared the dispute with a " blackmail" and stated that his wife was expecting a baby in just two months and was "in a difficult situation".
“You want such a person’s interests?
That's not very nice," added the investment banker.
As the dispute continues, the couple were quickly condemned in the public and denounced on the social media, where they were criticized for their behaviour and logic.
The publishers of Paddington feared that readers would not identify with a speaking bear, revealed a new letter
Karen Jankel, daughter of the author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It is hard to translate into someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
Today it is very funny with our knowledge of Paddington's enormous success."
She said that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired by a small toy bear to write the children's book, had had no problem with it, had his work been rejected and added that the 60th anniversary of the publication was "bitter sweet" after his death last year.
She explained that her father was secretly proud of the success of Paddington, which she described as "very important family member".
"He was a very quiet man and didn't boast," Jankel said.
“Because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who did something special: you’re proud, even if it wasn’t really your own performance.
I think he's seen Paddington's success this way.
Although he invented and created him, he always gave Paddington his own responsibility for his success."
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After the landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that it really looks bad and that the doctors gave her little chance," said Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I received the call from Nad, where he told me that she would die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I told her, "Tashi, I love you so much, my dear."
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that the doctors gave her to keep her heart on the pump sounded slowly and left her body.
She had died just before, and this was the moment when everything went down.
I couldn't do anything but wait while I knew what was going on.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and other people.
I really had to tear myself up."
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who was now grieving for the loss of her daughter, went along with the other passengers who didn't know what she was going through on board the plane.
"No one knew," she said.
I had lowered my head, and tears ran through my cheeks all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight when I felt this overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Mourning women hang up cards to prevent suicide on bridges
Two women who have lost family members to a suicide are trying to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelley Humphreys hung on a bridge in Wales maps with inspiring messages and telephone numbers for consulting stations.
Davis's son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and was just 18 when he committed suicide.
“I don’t want parents to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
The 45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lydney, explained that her son had a promising career as a cook and had an infectious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
Everyone said that his smile could brighten a room."
However, he quit his job before his death because he was "in a really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's body was found after suicide by his then 11-year-old brother.
Davis said, "I'm always afraid that this could have a follow-up effect."
Davis designed the cards “to show people that there are people to go to and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don't keep quiet: you have to talk about it."
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost her partner Mark, with whom she was 15 years old, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt down or depressed," she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas day he was at the bottom. When the children unpacked their gifts, he didn't see them in the eyes or anything."
She said that his death was a great trauma for her, but that it had to: “It rips a huge hole into the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we all have to move on and fight."

Board Kavanaugh's future in the float while the FBI starts investigating
"I thought if we could actually get such a thing that he asked for, i.e. a time-limited investigation, then maybe we could get a little agreement," Flake said on Saturday. He fears that the Committee would "break up" in the party political standstill.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want to investigate the FBI?
Her reluctance can be traced back to timing alone.
The intermediate elections on November 6 are only five weeks away. If the Republicans cut off badly as expected, they would be significantly weakened in their attempts to elect their husband in the highest court of the country.
George W. Bush took the phone listener to call Senators and convince them to support Kavanaugh, who had worked in the White House for Bush and met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There is a vote in the Senate in which 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can unite at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the Vice-President, to decide on equality of vote and to confirm him to the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean flooders “sinks” under Kim
The number of North Korean invaders to South Korea has fallen into power since Kim Jong-un seven years ago, such as a South Korean politician.
Park Byeong-seug, who relies on data from the South Korean reunification ministry, stated that last year 1127 flooders were registered, compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park called stricter border controls between North Korea and China as well as higher prices of human smugglers as key factors.
Pyongyang did not express himself publicly.
The vast majority of the flooders from the north are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul states that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, over 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border.
Most flee over China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the strongly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states.
China regards the flooders as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often leads them back by force.
The relations between the North and the South, which are still in the state of war technically, have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the two heads of state met in Pyongyang to talk about the cease-to-be denuclearization negotiations.
This was the result of the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, with which they agreed to work on a denuklearized Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the American sanctions for the lack of progress.
"Without being able to rely on the USA, we have no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to disarm ourselves one-sided first," said Mir Ri in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says that he is not appropriate for the Office at the Supreme Court
The minority leader at the Nancy Pelosi House of Representatives called Judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterically" and said that he was in character inappropriate for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I could not deny the impression that a woman who had acted like this would have been called ‘hysterical’,” Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh’s statement to the Senate’s judicial committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh was emotionally dementing all accusations that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both were teenagers.
During his opening speech Kavanaugh was very emotional. Sometimes he almost screamed and was in tears just before when he spoke of his family and his high-school time.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the Committee and called the accusations against him a "grand and co-ordinated professional murder" organised by Liberals who were angry at Hillary Clinton's lost presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said that she believed Kavanaugh's statement proves that he could not serve at the Supreme Court, as she showed that he was biased against democrats.
"I believe that with these statements and the way in which he came down with the Clintons and the Democrats, he himself declared himself improbable," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to withdraw Kavanaugh from the office, he should be confirmed and the Democrats should win the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say so much: if he does not tell the Congress or the FBI the truth, then he is not only unfit for the Supreme Court, but also for his current judge's post," says Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi further said that as a democrat, she was concerned about possible decisions by Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or the abortion principle decision Roe v. Wade, as he is estimated to be a conservative judge.
In his hearings, Kavanaugh raised questions as to whether he would review certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“We don’t need a hysterical, biased person who goes to this Court of Justice and expects us to say, ‘Oh, that’s not wonderful,’ Pelosi says.
Women have to use it as a weapon.
It's a sincere hate speech, months and years of overcooking anger, and she doesn't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's rare, do you?"
She continued: “I was helped a lot by a woman who was a manager somewhere and said that she was also crying when she got angry, but developed a technique. When she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she said, “They may think that she’s sad because I cry.
I'm angry."
And then she'll just talk.
I thought this was brilliant."
Tears are allowed as a valve for anger, partly because they are completely misunderstandingd.
One of my clearest memories is of a former job, in an office dominated by men, where one day I cried because of an indescribable rage and was packed by an older woman, an undercooled manager, from whom I was always a little scared, on the collar and pulled into a staircase.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"You don't know you're stinky.
They believe that you are sad and will be satisfied with themselves, since they believe they have gone to you with the substance."
Patricia Schroeder, then a congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidates.
In 1987, when Hart was caught aboard a ship named Monkey Business in an extramarital affair and then withdrawn his candidacy, the deeply frustrated Schroeder considered that there was no reason not to consider the idea of the presidency's own presidency.
"That was not a well-thought-out decision," she told me with a laugh 30 years later.
There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the situation ‘Snow White and the Seven Dwarves’.
Since the election campaign was already advanced, it was at the back of the funding, and it vowed not to run if it wasn't going to get $2 million.
It was an inconceivable fight.
She found out that some of her supporters, who donated $1,000 to men, only supported her campaign with $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she asked.
In the speech she announced not to launch an official campaign, she was so concerned about her emotions, gratitude for her supporters, frustration about the system that made the creation and direct addressing of the voters so difficult instead of the delegates, as well as the anger over sexism, so overwhelming that she was close to tears.
"One could have assumed that I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls the press reactions.
“You could have believed that the handkerchief manufacturer Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember wondering what they might write on my tombstone.
"She was crying?"
Why Beijing Could Benefit From the Trade War between the USA and China
The opening anoints of the trade war between the USA and China were deafening. Although the battle is far from over, Beijing could benefit from a long-term pit between the countries, my experts.
Donald Trump, the U.S. president, fired the first warning shot at the beginning of the year when he charged tariffs for important Chinese export goods, including solar cells, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new tariffs on goods worth $200 billion, effectively affecting half of all goods imported from China to the US.
Beijing used to strike back in the same way every time and recently raised criminal duties of five to ten percent on American goods worth 60 billion dollars.
China has sworn to answer any US action and it is unlikely that the world's second largest economic power will soon stumble.
Moving Washington down would mean giving in. However, a public intrusion to the US would be far too disgraceful for China’s President Xi Jinping.
Nevertheless, experts believe that if Beijing plays out its cards well, China will benefit from the effects of the trade war in the long term by reducing the mutual dependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision could create the conditions for economic turmoil in both countries in Washington or Beijing is actually much more dangerous than many observers have seen before," says Abigail Grace, a scientific assistant who focuses on Asia at the Denkfabrik Center for New American Security.
Syria is 'ready' for the return of refugees, says the Foreign Minister
Syria says that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help for the reconstruction of the country devastated by the war that continues for seven years.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem stated that the situation in the country was improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government is rebuilding the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
All conditions have now been met for the voluntary return of refugees to the country, which they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and living conditions.
The UN estimates that over 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government welcomed help to rebuild the devastated country.
However, he stressed that it would not accept conditional aid from countries that had supported the uprising.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europa won the Ryder Cup 2018 and defeated Team USA with a final position of 16.5 to 10.5 in the Le Golf National near Paris.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the crown back after the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points it needed to defeat the USA.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had a lot of problems with the tournament, sank his turn at the 16th train (Par 3) in the water and lost to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was able to shine in all his laps and became one of four players who scored a 5-0-0 since the tournament started in its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was beaten 5:4 by the player with the lowest ranking in the team Europe, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The player with the world's best ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 against the Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spaniard Sergio Garcia, veteran from eight Ryder Cups, became the best European Ryder Cup player ever with 25.5 career points.
“ Normally I don’t cry, but today I couldn’t hold back.
It was a difficult year.
I'm so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm so infinitely happy to win the cup back.
It's about the team and I'm glad to have made a contribution," said the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He passed the torch further to his countryman John Rahm, who won against American golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday 2:1 in the individual meetings.
I am so incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods that I have been watching on television since I was a child," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all his four games in France and now has a Ryder Cup balance of 13-21-3.
A strange statistics for one of the biggest players of all time who won 14 important titles and is only surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
The team USA had problems finding the fairways all weekend, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have achieved high-quality performance throughout the tournament.
US captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance of his team: “I am proud of the boys, they have fought.
There was a time this morning when we put Europe under pressure.
We didn't do anything out of it.
Guard for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players had a good performance.
We'll regroup, I'll talk to the PGA America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll look forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to pull the hat.
We were defeated."
