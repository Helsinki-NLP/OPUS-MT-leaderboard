Members of Welsh Assembly worry they're going to look like stupid.
There are consternations among some members of the meeting about the proposal that their title should be changed from AM'e to MWP'e (for Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This was caused by plans to change the name of the meeting to the Welsh Parliament.
Members from all over the political spectrum are afraid it might provoke a mockery.
One member of the Workers' Party says his group is concerned because "it's with Twp and Pwp rhym."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means feces.
A member of the meeting of the Plaid Cymru party says the group as a whole is "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party says his group is "receptive" about the name change, but has noticed that it is a short speech leap from MWP to Muppet, the British equivalent of fool or fool.
In this context, the Welsh letter w like the Yorkshire-English pronunciation of the letter u is pronounced.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing legislation to introduce the name changes, said: "The final decision on any descriptions of what members of the Assembly are called, of course, will be a matter for the members themselves."
The Law on the Government of Wales 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public consultation on the proposals which received broad support to call the meeting a Welsh Parliament.
As for the AM'e's title, the Commission preferred Welsh Parliament Members of WMP's, but the MWP option received most approval in a consultation with the public.
AM'e seems to be proposing alternatives, but the struggle to get consensus can be a headache to the chairman, Elin Jones, who must present a bill on the changes within weeks.
The reform legislation will also include other changes to the meeting's working methods, including rules on disqualification of AM's and the design of the committee system.
AM'e will get the last say in the question of what they should be called when they debate the legislation.
Macedonians vote in referendum on change of country’s name
voters will vote on Sunday to change their country's name to the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The popular voice was arranged in an attempt to resolve a decade-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which itself has a called Macedonia.
Athens has for a long time already demanded that the name of his neighbor in the north represent a claim in his area and has repeatedly objected to his applications for membership in the EU and NATO.
The president of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the popular vote on the change of name, said that he would ignore the mood.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of Saint Martin's become quiet because churches in Harlem are struggling
'Historically,' said the old people I spoke to, 'there was a bar and a church at every corner,' said Mr. Adams.
"Neither of the two are there today."
He says that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People are socializing in other ways these days," he said.
"Crowds are no longer neighborhoods' family rooms where people go regularly."
As for churches, he is worried that the money from sales of assets will not last as long as leaders expect, "and sooner or later they are back exactly where they started."
Churches, he adds, can be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums full of the types of people who will not help the neighborhood’s remaining refuges.
"The vast majority of people who buy units in these buildings will be white," he said, "and will therefore bring the day which these churches completely shut even closer, for most of the people who move into these condominiums will probably not become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis - Metropolitan Community in 1870, Saint Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved away in the 1930s.
A black congregation that worshiped nearby took over the building's title.
Saint Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by Eerw. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers in 125th street, a main street for shopping in Harlem, who did not want to appoint or promote black people.
A fire in 1939 badly damaged the building, but while Father Johnson's members made plans to rebuild it, they ordered the carillon.
Rev. David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor to Saint Martin's, proudly called the karilion "the poor people's bells".
The expert who played the karilion in July called it something else: "A treasure of culture" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noticed that it was the first karilion in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved 18 years ago to the larger karilion at the Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather says St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What has played at Saint Martin's in the past few months is a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought in by the lay leaders of the church, others by the Episcopal diocese.
The church council, the congregation's governing body, which consists of lay leaders--written in July to the diocese with concern that the diocese "will attempt to pass the cost on" to the church council, although the church council was not involved in the appointment of the architects and contractors who sent the diocese.
Some parishioners complain of a lack of transparency from the diocese's side.
Shark injures 13-year-old on lobster dive in California
A shark attacked a 13-year-old boy on Saturday and injured when he dived for lobster on the first day of the lobster season in California, officials say.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then rowing a group closer to help him pull him out of the water.
Hammel said he first thought it was just the excitement of a first lobster catch, but then he realized "that he cried out, 'I'm bitten!
I am bitten!'
His whole keybone was torn open," saw Hammel when he came to the boy.
'I've called out that everyone should come out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'' added Hammel.
The boy was flown to the Rady Children’s Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is described as critical.
It is not known which species of shark is responsible for the attack.
Larry Giles said at a media counseling session that a shark was noticed in the area a few weeks ago, but it was determined it wasn't a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries at the upper part of his upper body.
Officials closed beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles notes that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plan extension to UK beauty market
Sainsbury's says Boots, Superdrug, and Debenhams fight with department store-like beauty walks manned by specialist assistants.
As part of a major expansion in the UK's £2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow as sales of fashion and household goods fall, the larger beauty walks in 11 shops across the country will be tested and if it is a success taken to more shops next year.
The investment in beauty takes place as supermarkets search for ways to fill shelves once used for TVs, microwaves, and homeware.
Sainsbury's says that it will double the size of his available cosmetics to 3,000 products, which for the first time will include trade names such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman, and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing series of L'Oreal, Maybellline and Burt's Bees will also find more space with brand-specific areas similar to those seen in shops such as Boots.
The supermarket also launches its Boutique makeup series again so that the majority of products are vegan-friendly -- something on which even more younger buyers insist.
In addition, the perfume retailer, The Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon in South London last week and a second that will open later this year in Selly Oak in Birmingham.
Internet shopping and a move to smaller quantities of food purchased daily at local convenience shops means that supermarkets need to do more to persuade people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, the chief executive officer of Sainsbury's, said that the stores are going to look like department stores more when the supermarket chain tries to fight back with more services and non-food products against the discount stores Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's placed Argos sales outlets in hundreds of stores and also introduced a number of Habitat sales outlets since it bought both these chains two years ago, which according to their groceries sales strengthened and made the purchases more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to renew its beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000's, but the relationship was ended after an argument about how the profit from the pharmacies should be divided within his shops.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's three years ago sold his 281 store pharmacy for £125m to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy Chain.
It says that Lloyds will play a role in the plan by offering an extensive range of luxury skin care products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We have transformed the appearance and feeling of our beauty walks to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invested in special-trained colleagues who would be on hand to provide advice.
Our series of trade names are designed to meet every need and the attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now a compelling beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'anger' after Holly Willoughby withdraws £11 million agreement
Dragons Den-star Peter Jones ran away 'angering' after TV provider Holly Willoughby had withdrawn her from a £11 million agreement with his lifestyle brand business to focus on her contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home clothes and accessories trade name, True.
The couple's business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop trade name.
The This Morning Provider, 37, announced on Instagram that she was withdrawing.
Holly Willoughby had left Dragons Den-ster Peter Jones angry by withdrawing from their lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last moment - to focus on her own giant contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Bronne says that Jones was "enraged" when TV's golden girl announced Tuesday at a tense meeting in the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new opportunities - worth up to £1.5 million - meant that she could no longer spend enough time on their home clothing-and-access business name, True.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop trade name and would have doubled according to initiated Willoughby's estimated £11 million fortune.
While Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving True, Jones climbed on a jet and traded Britain for one of his holiday homes.
A source says, "Truly was Holly's greatest priority by far.
It would be her long - term future that would carry her over the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw her is absolutely stupid.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, it was so close to the introduction.
There is a warehouse full of goods at the Marlow headquarters that is ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the This Morning Provider, one of Britain's stars that makes most money flow in, the firm can chase millions out of the bag as a result of the huge investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothes and home clothes, and the possibility that its introduction may encounter even more delays.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
In 2016, Willoughby prepared True with Capp, and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couples are on vacation together and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will be a trademark ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as a provider of ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We won't comment on his business."
Hard words 'and then we fall in love'
He mocked at criticism of what he was going to get from the news media because he made a remark that some would consider "unprecisional" and because he was so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his kamma "newreader voice".
"I have given up nothing."
He mentioned that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump described their first meeting in June in Singapore as a big step towards the nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
However, negotiations on nuclear disarmament burned down.
North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, said Saturday, more than three months after the June leadership assembly in Singapore, to leaders at the UN General Assembly that the North did not see a "corresponding reaction" of the US to North Korea's early disarmament activities.
Instead, he noted, the U.S. continues with sanctions aimed at maintaining the pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic impact in his convention talk.
"We're making excellent progress with North Korea," he said."
"We were on our way to begin a war with North Korea.
Millions would have died.
Now we have this wonderful relationship."
He says that his efforts to improve relationships with Kim produced positive results - ending rocket tests, helping to free hostages, and bringing back the remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his unusual approach to descriptions of relationships with Kim.
"It's so easy to be presidential, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to come into this crowded arena, we would have nearly 200 people standing right there," Trump said as he pointed to the crowd right in front of him.
Tidal Gulf and Earthquake in Indonesia Destroyed Island, Killed Hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were said not to be needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been uprooted, no national disaster has been announced, a prerequisite for catalizing international aid.
"In many cases they were unfortunately very clear that they did not ask international help, which made it a bit difficult," said Sumbung.
Although Save the Children are putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is not certain whether foreign personnel can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said that Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies will be allowed to contribute to the assistance effort.
Given the constant earthquake that Indonesia endures, the country is saddened to remain poorly prepared for the wrath of nature.
While tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, it is not a common sight on other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu probably contributed to the loss of life, although a warning of strength.
It is at best challenging to travel between Indonesia’s many islands.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on their way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Yoko Widodo has made the improvement of Indonesia's refined infrastructure a central point of his election campaign and has been squandering money on roads and railways.
However, Mr. Yoko’s administration is plagued by funding shortages as he faces reelection next year.
Mr. Yoko also faces the pressure of sluggish sectarian tension in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have taken on a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced as Christian and Muslim gangs fought with machetes, arrows and bows, and other primitive weapons on the street.
Watch: Liverpool’s Daniel Sturridge kicks good equalizer against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London from a Premier League loss against Chelsea for a purpose in the 89th minute.
Xherdan Shaqiri reported to Sturridge when he was about 30 years away from the Chelsea target and his team 1-0 behind.
He typed the ball to the left before kicking far to the goal pole.
The effort sailed high over the frame as it floated to the upper right corner of the net.
Finally the ball tumbled over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"It was just to try to get into that position, to come on the ball, and players like Shaq always play forward as far as possible, so I just tried to create as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw edge coming and once ticking and not thinking too much about it and just kicking."
Chelsea was 1-0 by half before after the Belgian star Eden Hazard recorded a purpose in the 25th minute.
The Blues' goalcopper played back to Mateo Kovavic in that play area with a rear head before rolling near the middle of the field and nailing into the Liverpool half.
Kovavic quickly received and reported in the middle field.
With a beautiful forward-headed head, he then led him into the frame for Hazard.
Hazard crossed the defense and ended with a left foot-shead past Liverpool's Alisson Becker in the farthest target.
Liverpool fights Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at Stadium San Paolo in Naples, Italy, at 3 p.m. on Wednesday.
Chelsea faces Videoton at 3 p.m. in London in the UEFA Europa League.
Death count rises to 832 after Indonesian tsunami
The death toll in Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami climbed to 832, the country’s disaster agency said early on Sunday.
It has been reported that many people have been trapped under the garbage of buildings which have caused the earthquake, which struck a magnitude of 7.5 on Friday, to collapse, and burners of up to 20 feet, the agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said to a news conference.
The city of Palu, with its more than 380,000 people, was sown with the ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest man, 32, under suspicion of murder after wife's death
A murder investigation was launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7.55 a.m. in Grayson Mews on John Street with knife sticks, and a 32-year-old man was arrested under suspicion of murder.
The police urged people in the area who heard or saw anything to move forward.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: 'The investigation is at an early stage but I appeal to anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who had seen or heard anything suspicious, to contact us.
I also appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught anything on Dashcam film material, to contact us as they may have information that could be indispensable to our investigation.'
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and that she had been found within a property.
This afternoon friends who are said to know the woman came to the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations continue since the police said they were in the process of informing the victim’s close relatives.
A taxi driver who lived in Grayson Mews just tried to return to his apartment but was told by the police that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
Residents are now said to take hours before they are reintroduced.
It was heard that a police officer told one man that the whole area was now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared on the scene in tears.
She repeatedly said ‘It’s so horrible. ’
At 2 nm there were two police cars inside the cordon with another wagon just outside.
A number of officials are left inside the cordon to monitor the block apartments.
Any information is asked to link @MerPolCC to DM, 101 or Crime Stoppers anonymously by 0800 555 111 to log 247 of September 30 as reference.
Parliament's Statute of Cromwell becomes the latest commemorative hit with 'rewriting history' strife
His exile will be poetic justice for his Talibanlike destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious art objects carried out by his fanatic Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Association described Mr. Crick's proposal as "goodness" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Association, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate about removing statues that Oliver Cromwell's form outside the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The imagery of the English civil wars was still ordered by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his forefather Thomas in the past century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent portrayal of Cromwell is evidence of 19th century opinion and part of the history of a figure that many believe is still memorable.
Mr. Goldsmith related The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is viewed by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether it is a completely accurate portrayal is the subject of continued historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century gave form to the later development of our nation, and that Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure representing one side of that separation.
His success as Protector is also worthy of celebration and commemoration."
Killer Cracked Chinese Farmer
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwest China.
The man, identified only by his of, "Yuan", was found dead with a torn-off arteries covered with blood near a cage at the market in Liupanshui in the Guizhou province, reported the South China Morning Post Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer prepares to inject pigs with vaccines at a pig farm in Xining of Qinghai Province, China.
He traveled Wednesday with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and found a door open to a neighboring pig's loft.
He said there was a great male pig in the cage with blood on his mouth.
A forensic investigation reportedly confirmed that the 550-pound pig had bitten the farmer to death.
"My cousin's legs were bleeding and torn," said the cousin, who was called on his of, "Wu," saying, the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera film material showed how Yuan entered the market Thursday at 4.40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man does not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening New that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking someone else, while the police collected evidence on the scene.
Yuan’s family and market authorities are said to negotiate compensation for his death.
Although strange, cases of pigs attacking people have been reported before.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with critical injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 650 pound pig tied a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife scared the animal off.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBS News that pigs are not normally aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as "faster".
"They're not playful.
They're very curious... they're not about to hurt you.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect," he said.
Res of Hurricane Rosa will bring widespread heavy rains to southwest U.S.A.
As foretold, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves over the cooler waters of the north coast of Mexico.
Rosa, however, will bring flood rains all over northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S. over the coming days.
Rosa had winds from 85 p.m. on Sunday from 5 a.m. on, a category 1 hurricane, and was placed 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trick across the Pacific begins to take shape and move eastward to the west coast of the U.S. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to drive heavy tropical humidity northwards to the southwestern U.S.
Rosa will bring rain from up to 10 inches in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical humidity will bring widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest in response to the approaching trick over the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous instant floods, waste flow, and possibly landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical humidity will cause place-place rainfall rates of up to 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As many as 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially over most of Arizona.
Quick floods may be with rapidly worsening conditions because of the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It would be most unwise to venture it into the desert on foot with the danger of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rain can cause deep creeks to affect rivers and thunderstorms will bring severe local winds and dust clouds.
The approaching trough will bring some local heavy rain to parts of the coastline of southern California.
Rainfall totals of more than half an inch are possible, which can cause small waste flow and smooth lanes.
This will be the region’s first rainfall of the wet season.
A few scattered tropical showers will begin in late Sunday and early Monday before the rain becomes more widespread in late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
October can see intense temperature fluctuations throughout the U.S. as the Arctic cools, but the tropics remain quite warm.
This sometimes leads to dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
A good example of dramatic temperature differences across the central U.S. is on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, slow summer heat will try to rise and expand again.
It is expected that much of the central and eastern U.S. October will start warm, with widespread 80s from the Southern Low Plain to parts of the Northeast.
New York City can reach 80 degrees [80 ° C.] on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees [10 ° C.] above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a higher risk of above-average temperatures for the eastern US for the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watch Brett Kavanaugh trial
Over 20 million people watched Thursday on six television networks the stirring testimony of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christians Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that was reportedly taking place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political dead end continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular programs for Friday's on-the-flash turn: an agreement made by Arizona senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to carry out a week-long investigation.
Ford told the Senate-judgment committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh put her in drunkenness and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate testimony, said he was 100 percent sure that it had not happened.
It’s likely that more than 20.4 million people looked at it on Friday, Nielsen reported.
The company counted average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
Numbers were not immediately available to other networks that showed them, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen sometimes finds it difficult to measure people looking in offices.
To put it in perspective, it's an audience the size of one for a decisive football match or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was all the networks ahead with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day's trial, said Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, said Nielsen.
Interest was still high after the trial.
Flakes were the central figure in Friday’s drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he was going to vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was arrested on CNN and CBS Friday morning where opponents shouted at him as he tried to take a elevator to a judicial committee.
He stood with his eyes struck down for a few minutes as CNN vividly pictured himself being mispronounced.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?
He was told, "You have power while so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and before the elevator door had gone to say that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcasting networks all covered later living hours when the Legal Committee would vote to promote Kavanaugh's appointment to the full Senate for a voice.
But Flake said that he would do this only with the understanding that the FBI would look at the charges against the candidate for the next week, as requested by the Democrat minority.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Democrat Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake’s choice was powerful, for it was obvious that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump launched an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British EM May accuses critics of 'political game' about Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union, accused of "power play" with Britain's future and subverting national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
Britain’s Prime Minister Theresa May arrives on 29 September 2018 for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain.
In another interview next to her with her on the cover of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said that a proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other's rates was "very ridiculous."
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest suspicious Dyteon Simpson in LSU player's death
The police arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and arrested on a second-grade murder charge, said the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said Sims had lost his glasses during the struggle.
The police found the glasses on the scene and said that they had found Simpson's DNA on it, reports CBS-affiled WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he admitted that he had shot Wayde.
His bail was set at $350,000, the lawyer reported.
On Friday a preliminary report was issued by East Baton Rouge Parish's court investigation office saying that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head at the neck.
The department praises the Louisiana State Police's runaway task force, the state police crime laboratory, Southern University police and citizens of the territory for their help with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanks territory law enforcement for its "zealousness and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The six-foot-six predictor grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played for LSU basketball.
His average past season was 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps per game.
Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team in "striked" and "in shock" about Wayde's death.
"This is what you are constantly worried about," said Wayde.
Volcano spitting as on Mexico City
Ash spitting from the Popocatepeti volcano reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans Saturday to stay away from the volcano after taking up activity in the crater and registering 183 gas and ash releases in 24 hours.
The center monitored multiple roars and tremors.
Images on social media showed how thin low gas covers car windscreens near Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicians have noted an increase in volcano activity, which has been sitting 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.1 central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police clashes with Catalan separatists before commemoration of independence voice
Six people were arrested in Barcelona Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, and thousands joined in protests to commemorate the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarizing voice for formation.
A group of masked pro-separatists who had been held back by riot police attacked them with eggs and threw powder paint that caused dark clouds of dust in streets that usually teem with tourists.
A fighting also broke out later in the day, and the police had to use their clubs to control the fighting.
In several hours pro-independence groups sang in one tone "No forget, no forgiveness" in confrontation with the unionists' cries of "Long Life Spain".
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries suffered in the processions, the local press reported.
The tension still runs high in the independent region a year after the referendum of 1 October was considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatis Catalans.
voters voted overwhelmingly to become independent, but the participation was low, with those against formation who largely boycotted the voice.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried violent collisions to prevent the voting at the polls from continuing throughout the region.
Pro-independence groups camped overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist demonstration with his wife, said he was no longer hopeful for the prospect that Catalonia would gain independence.
"Last year we went through one of the best moments.
I saw my parents cry for joy because they could vote but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite a vital but sniper victory in regional elections last December, Catalonian pro-independence parties struggled to maintain momentum this year, with many of their best-known leaders either in self-imposed exile or in custody for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the demonstration in support of the police on his phone, says the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"It gets more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catholic leaders in pre-trial detention since late last year, announced that he would be standing in European Parliament elections next year.
"Standing as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to disapprove of the decline in democratic values and the oppression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonerry: Men arrested after car locks into the house

A crossbow may also have been shot at one point after the car.
Menga goal gives Livingston 1-0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga’s first purpose for Livingston ensures victory
Advanced Livigston astounded Rangers to transfer Steven Gerrard to just his second defeat in 18 matches as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga’s purpose was evidence of the difference when Gary Holt’s team moved to second with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team stayed this season in the Premiership without a wink and next week faces the forerunners Heart, who have their eight points ahead.
Rangers are first host to Rapid Vienna in the Europaliga on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston expanded their unconquered run in the division to six games, with chief coach Holt who had still not tasted a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston loses chances against bot visitors
Holt's team must have run ahead long before they had recorded a purpose, with their round bristle which Rangers had brought on all kinds of problems.
SR broke through but stood in front of the target, then AL was able to play wide after he approached and met CH’s headhold across the target.
The hosts were content to have Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could get the visitors with deadlock moments.
And thus came the decisive purpose.
Rangers lost a freehead and Livingston created an opportunity, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson, who together gave Menga the chance to kick and record a purpose from the middle of the frame.
By then Rangers had dominated but could not penetrate home defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely unconcerned.
That pattern was continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced a blow of Kelly.
Scott Pittman was denied by the feet of Rangers-targeted Allan McGregor and Lithgow had far typed to avoid still open game of Livingston.
Cross crossings repeatedly reached Livingston’s frame and repeatedly blocked it, while two punishments – after Halkett’s challenge of substitute Glenn Middleton and one for handball - were rejected.
'Fenomenal' of Livingston – Analysis
BBC Scotland’s Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal game and results for Livingston.
Until the last man was excellent; they still exceed expectations on this upward course.
Their game style and manhood have been almost unchanged since their return to first class, but much honor comes to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Hackett was huge with his magnificent defense arrangement while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes all the time.
Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
As good as they could at times under Gerrard, they could not maintain those standards.
Their final ball was missing and only once could they penetrate the home team, which was somewhat of a wake-up call for Rangers, who found them in middle division.
Erdogan gets mixed reception in Cologne
On Saturday (29 September) there were smiles and blue air when leaders from Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which had to restore relations between NATO allies.
They had a failure on issues involving human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then closed Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city houses the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police quoted security reasons to prevent the 25,000-strong crowd from gathering before the mosque, but many supporters arrived to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters – many of their Kurds – also made their voices thick, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him in the country.
The warring demonstrations reflect the disunity of a visitor whom some German Turks greet as hero and are exclaimed by others as autocrats.
Deptford Road Accident: Bicycler die in engine collision
A cyclist died in a collision in London where a car was involved.
The collision took place about 10:15 BST near the connection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped, and paramedics were present, but the man died on the scene.
The collision came months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-step on Childers Street, about a mile from where Saturday's accident occurred.
The Metropolitan Police said officials were working to identify the man and inform his close relatives.
Road closures and bus tours were recommended instead, and motorists were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Keepers Injured in Rebellion
Six guards were injured in a riot at a high security man's prison, said the prison office.
Rebellion broke out about 09:30 BST on Sunday and is still going on at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire.
Specialist "Tornado Guards" were called to handle the riot, including eight prisoners and limited to one wing.
The guards were treated on the scene for minor facial injuries.
A police spokesman said: "Specially trained prison staff have been engaged to pay attention to an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and make it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and will be able to stay behind bars longer."
HMP Long Martin houses more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous offenders.
In June, it was reported that after being attacked by a prisoner, the prison principal had received hospital treatment.
And in October last year, riot officials were called to pay attention to serious disorder in which billiard - ball personnel were attacked.
Hurricane Rosa Dreg Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Quick Floods (Dreogde Zones Trek Mayk Advantage)
It's unusual that a tropical low pressure hit Arizona but that's exactly what could happen early next week if Hurricane Rosa's remaining energy moves across the southwest desert and brings immediate flood risks.
The National Weather Service has already issued instant flood watches for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will take a direct route across Phoenix on Tuesday, and will approach late on Monday with rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service noted in a tweet that only ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status since 1950 within 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border."
The National Hurricane Center models predict 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in the Mogollon edge of Arizona.
Other parts of the U.S. southwest, including the central Rockies and the Great Com, are likely to get 1 to 2 inches, with isolated totals of possibly up to 4 inches.
For those out of quick flood risk, Rosa's rain will probably be a blessing as the region is plagued by drought.
Although floods are a very serious issue, this rainfall is likely to be beneficial since the southwest is currently experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, only over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second highest category," reportedweather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa’s road leads to the approach of land across the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still at Hurricane Sunday morning, with a maximum of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm encounters cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean, so its strength is waning.
So it is expected that on Monday in the afternoon or evening, at tropical storms in Mexico, she will reach the country.
Rainfall over parts of Mexico can be heavy and pose a significant flood risk.
"Rainfall totals from 3 to 6 inches are expected from Baja California to Northwest Sonora, with up to 10 inches possible,"weather.com reported.
Rosa will then move north over Mexico as a tropical storm before it reaches the Arizona border Tuesday in the early hours of the morning as a tropical depression and will then move through Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday evening.
"The greatest danger expected from Rosa is very severe rainfall in Baja California, Northwest Sonora and the US southwest," said the National Hurricane Center.
These rains are expected to cause life - threatening quick floods and ruins in the deserts and landslides in the mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys A 20-year-old man was arrested under suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old with stab wounds was found in Somerset.
The injured teenage boy was found at about 04:00 BST on Saturday in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to the hospital where he was still in a "stable" state.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset said police.
Officials called on anyone who might have any cell phone footage of what happened to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh that 'suffered under the meanness, the anger' of the Democratic Party.
"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to reject the merciless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party," said Trump at a convention in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had "lyed under the meanness, the anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh witnessed Thursday before Congress and fervently and emotionally denied a claim by Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also witnessed her claim during the trial.
The president said Saturday the Americans saw that day "the brilliant and quality and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"A voice to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to confirm one of the most competent legal spirits of our time, a jurisprudence with a pure record of public service," he told the crowd West Virginia supporters.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the importance of Republican attendance at the mid-term elections.
"Five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
I'm not standing, but actually I'm standing," he said.
That's why I fight for these candidates everywhere."
Trump argued that the Democrats were on a mission to "resist and hinder."
The first important procedural voice on the Senate floor about Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place not later than Friday, a senior GOP leadership assistant told CNN.
Hundreds of deaths from Indonesian tremor, tsunami, with numbers still rising
At least 384 people were dead and many washed away when huge waves broke on beaches when a great earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered in the city of Palu on the beach on Friday for a festival on the beach when surfers up to six meters (18 feet) high at sundown broke on the beach, many washed away after their death, and destroyed everything that was in the way.
The tsunami followed after a 7.5-scale earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still busy doing their activities on the beach and did not run immediately and they became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster relief agency BNPB during an information session in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come on its own, it dragged cars, logs, houses together, it hit everything on the ground," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had moved across the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h (497 m/h) before it hit the coast.
Some people climbed into trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air pictures released by the disaster agency show many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges distorted and collapsed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks still shook the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's agency for the evaluations and application of technology (BPPT) stated in a statement that the energy released by Friday's giant occupation was about 200 times the power of the atom bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which sat at the end of a long, narrow bay, could have worsened the size of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "significant" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had collapsed.
Bodies of some victims were found trapped under the ruins of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the accidents and damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala that is closer to the earthquake earth.
Communication "is completely impaired with no information" by Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are over 300,000 people living there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a disaster, but it can get much worse," they said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not telling that a tsunami hit Palu, although officials said that the waves had come at the time the warning was issued.
In amateur imagery shared on social media, it can be heard how a man on the upper floor of a building shouts desperate warnings about the coming tsunami to the people at the bottom of the street.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the beach, and drags buildings and cars with it.
Reuters could not explain the image material immediately.
The tremor and tsunami caused major power breaks that cut off communication around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, said authorities, but experienced ones still need food and other basic necessities.
The city’s airport was reopened only for assistance efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Yoko Widodo was to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia-tsunami mortality rates rise above 800.
It is very bad.
Although World Vision’s Donggala staff arrived safely in Palu City, where employees in deck shelters were hiding in their office courtyards, they drove by scenes of devastation, said Mr. Doseba.
They told me they saw many houses destroyed," he said.
It is very bad.
Even as aid groups begin the horrible task of starting the disaster relief task, some have complained that with much experience, foreign assistance workers are prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian guidelines, funds, supplies, and personnel from overseas can only be launched after the area of the disaster has been declared a national disaster area.
This has not yet happened.
"It is still a disaster at provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says, "All right, it's a national disaster," we can open it for international assistance, but it doesn't have a status yet."
With the arrival of the second evening on Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and relatives of those who are still missing are hoping that their loved ones will be the miracles that will bring relief to the sad story line of natural disasters.
Saturday a little boy was taken out of a sewer.
Sunday rescuers rescued a woman for two days under rubble was pressed with her mother's corpse next to her.
Gendon Subandano, the coach of the Indonesian national parachute team, trained two of the missing parachute weavers for the Asian Games that had ended in Indonesia earlier this month.
Among those trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"If a senior in the parachute field I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon relates how, in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel on social media circulated under the paragliding society, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu participants participating in the beach festival.
His messages, however, were answered only with one gray mark, rather than two blue marks.
"I think that means the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 while refilling OTM by Newport on the Livee
Thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's worker on Friday morning who had refilled an OTM at Newport on the Livee, according to a news statement from the Newport Police Station.
The car driver was emptying an ATM in an entertainment complex and preparing to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, another man " came running from behind the Brink's employee" and stole the bag of money that had to be delivered.
According to the release, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing from the scene, but the police did not specify the number involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapid changes his name to Ye
Rapid Kanye West will change his name – to Ye
With the announcement of the change on Twitter Saturday, he wrote: "The essence formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, had been nicknamed Ye for some time and used the nickname as the title for his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to introduce his new all Yandhi.
He replaced Ariana Grande on the program that canceled for "emotional reasons", said the program's manufacturer.
Besides being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has said in the past that the word has a significant meaning for him.
"I believe 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year when he discussed his album title with radio-supplier Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye – just the reflection of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
He's one of a number of well-known rappers who changed their names.
Sean Combs has been known, among other things, as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy of Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West employee, JAY-Z, also got along with or without a link sign and capital letters.
Mexico’s AMLO promises not to use military force against civilians
Mexican newly elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised, in the run-up to the country's 50th anniversary of a bloody retribution against students, never to use military power against civilians.
Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza Saturday never to use the military to control the Mexican people."
Soldiers shot at a peaceful demonstration in the plaza on October 2, 1968, where up to 300 people were killed at a time when left-wing student movements took root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to those studying and opening up more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training opportunities drew youth to gangs.
US should double AI funding
With China becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount it spends on research in that field, investor and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The remarks come after several parts of the U.S. government made AI announcements, even if the U.S. is short a complete formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, last year China announced its plan: to be the No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
"Double the AI research budget will be a good start, given that all the other countries are so far behind the U.S. and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI," said Lee.
The doubling of funding can double the chances that the next major AI performance will be achieved in the U.S., said Lee vandesweek in an interview to CNBC.
Lee, whose book "Al Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the HUB of Synovation Ventures, which invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980's at Carnegie Mellon University he worked on an AI system that knocked the highest rated American Othello player and later he was a executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's robotics challenge, and asked when the next one was going to be, to help identify the next visionary.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win government seats, said Lee.
"It's not China that takes away the academic leaders; it's the corporates," said Lee.
In recent years Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have appointed influential persons from other universities to work on AI.
Lee says immigration policy changes can also help to promote US AI efforts.
"I think green cards must be presented automatically to PhD's in AI," he said.
In July 2017, China’s State Council issued its Next Generation Development Plan for Artificial Intelligence.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people at academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint center for artificial intelligence designed to involve partners from the industry and the academic world, and the White House announced the formation of a Selection Committee on artificial intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not been under fire for months.
Macedonians vote in election or country name must change
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on whether their name should be changed to "Republic of Northern Macedonia", action which would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that blocked its membership bots for the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, insists that their northern neighbor's name represents a claim in the area and has refused their admission to NATO and the EU.
The two governments entered into an agreement in June, based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents reasoned that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign was sowing doubts as to whether the attendance would meet the minimum 50 percent needed for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum letter read: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argued that it was a price that could be paid to pursue admission for Macedonia, one of the countries that came from the collapse of Yugoslavia, to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live free under the umbrella of the European Union, for it means safer lives for all of us, Olivera Georgijevska, 79, said in Skopje.
Although this is not legally binding, enough parliamentarians have said that they will accept the outcome of the vote to decide.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The state election commission said that by 1 p.m., there were no reports of irregularities.
But the attendance was only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of the registered voters voted.
"I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gyose Tanevski, 62, a voters in the capital Skopje.
Macedonia’s EM, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica, and his son Dushko cast their votes for the referendum in Macedonia on the change in the country’s name that will pave the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small uprising and drew chairs near in front of tents set up by those going to the referendum boycott.
"We are in favor of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not through the back door." said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia to become part of the Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring to Macedonia much needed investment, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe the great majority will be in favour of it, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," said Zaev after he cast out his voice.
He said a "yes" result would be "confirmation of our future".
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonia Institute for Policy Research said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum – less than the required amount.
Another recording, conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, found that 57 percent of respondents were planning to vote Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said that they would vote yes.
For the referendum to succeed, attendance must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A setback in the referendum will be the first serious setback for the policies of a pro-western government since the government took over last May.
Watch: Manchester City’s Sergio Aguero navigates through Brighton defense for purpose
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling eliminated the Brighton defense in Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it ridiculously easy to look at his goal in the 65th minute.
At the beginning of the series, the Argentine target cup received an indication at the middle field.
He pursued between three Brighton-defenders before he struck the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed past one defender before passing several others on the edge of the Brighton-tuck.
He then pushed a report to the left, where he found Sterling.
The English foreteller used his first touch in the cage to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to knock the Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a kick to the right of the net.
"Aguero struggles with problems with his feet," City manager Pep Guardiola told journalists.
"We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That is what happened.
We are happy that he has recorded a purpose at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League struggle.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
At that game Aguero received the ball deep in the Brighton area.
He sent a beautiful ball along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane had a few contacts before he led Sterling to the far end.
The Sky Blues prophesied that the ball was kicking in the net just before it was across the backline.
City beats Hoffenheim in Champion's League Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. by Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play the spoiler against Rockies
With the Nationals out of play, there's not much reason to force another start.
But the ever-competing Scherzer wants to take on the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there are still play implications for the Rockies, who have a one-game advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies got at least a promoter lockout with a 5-2 win over the National Friday night, but still wants to tie their first division title.
"Although we are playing for nothing, we can at least play the game knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team will probably be playing at the highest level of any point I will face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to take part in it?"
The Nationals still have to announce their starting player for Sunday, but is reportedly favorable to have Scherzer thrown into such a situation.
Scherzer, who will have his 34th start, had a throw-practice session on Thursday and will play on his normal rest Sunday.
Washington's right-handed is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 halls in 220 2/3 seconds this season.
Trump holds conventions in West Virginia
The president referred indirectly to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court choice Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of Republican attendance at the mid - term elections.
"All we have done is at stake in November.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lifetimes.
It's one of the big, big ones – I'm not standing, but I'm actually standing and that's why I fight for these candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued, 'You see this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, one sees it happening now.
And they are now determined to take the power back by using any possible way, one sees the meanness, the genius.
They don't care who hurts them, about whom they have to walk to gain power and control, which is what they want, power and power, we won't give it to them."
Democrats, he said, were on a mission to "resist and hinder."
"And one sees it over the past four days," he said, calling the democrats "evil and mean and geniusy and false."
He referred to the name Senate’s judicial committee high - ranking Dianne Feinstein, who received a lot of attention from the audience.
"Remember her answer?
Have you leaked the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, I'm waiting for one – it was really poor body language – the weakest body language I've ever seen."
Workers' party is no longer a broad church.
It is intolerant to those who say what they think
When Momentum's activists voted in my local party to put me under censorship, it was not much of a surprise.
After all, I'm the last person in a string of Workers' Party LP's to whom it was said we're not welcome – all because we said what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatments because she fearlessly stood up against anti-Semitism.
In my case the motion of censorship criticized me for being different from Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically enough similar issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous differences.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labor Party meeting Friday said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as the local Labor Party LP, that was exactly what Friday's AR meetings were.
Unfortunately, it is not the tone of many meetings today and the promise of "friendlyer, more gracious" politics has long been forgotten, if it has ever begun.
It has become increasingly evident that different views are not tolerated within the Workers ’ Party, and each opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party’s leadership.
It began shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom I thought I had previously shared similar political views, began to expect me to make a U-turn and take positions that I would never otherwise have agreed with – whether on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public – and it doesn't really matter what I say – there's a tyrade of abusive speech on social media asking me not to be re-elected, disapproval of politics from the core, and telling me not to be in the Workers' Party.
And that's not just my experience.
Actually, I’m happier than some of my colleagues because the remarks that are aimed at me tend to be political.
I have a lot of respect for professionalism and determination for those colleagues who face a flood of sexist or racist insults every day, but never shy away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the levels of insult have normalized.
Last week Jeremy Corbyn claimed that the Labor Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church and with every "mosie of distrust" or change of rules the party becomes narrower.
For the past two years, I have had a lot of advice that encourages me to stay under the radar, not to be so outspoken, and then I'll be "ouky."
But I did not enter politics to do so.
Since joining the Labor Party 32 years ago as a student, encouraged by the Thatcher government neglect that literally left my state high school school falsified, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need it most – whether as a local councillor or government minister.
I never hid my politics, including at the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been confused at all about my political positions and areas where I differ from the present leadership.
To those who advocated the motion on Friday, I can only say that with the country that is heading for a Brexit that will harm all households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader the Workers' Party.
But the one message I actually have is not to Nottingham Momentum, it's to my voters, whether they're members of the Labor Party or not: I'm proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of threats of not being re-elected or political advantage will prevent me from doing what I believe is in the best interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unconquered Ayr above
Two late threes may have broken the final result slightly, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to prevail in this wonderful-desirable Tennent's Premiership contest of the day.
They are now at the top of the scoreboard, the only unconquered team of the ten.
In the end, it was their excellent defense, as well as their better chance, that carried the home team, and coach Peter Murchie has every right to be content.
"We've been tested in our matches so far, and we're still unconquered, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Honor Ayr, they have taken their chances better than we have."
Grant Anderson's three in the 14th minute, which was intended by Frazier Climo, made Ayr ahead, but a yellow card for Scotland player Rory Hughes, who was made available for the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to count the numbers and Jason Baggot recorded an unexpected three.
Climo enlarged Ayr's advantage with a punitive head, just before he, just before rest, meant a solo three to make it rest period 17-5 for Ayr.
But Melrose began the second half well, and Patrick Anderson’s three, meant by Baggot, reduced the backwardness to five points.
There was a long stay for a serious injury at Ruaridh Knott that was carried off on a portable, and from the restart Ayr enlarged the advantage with a Stafford McDowall three, purposed by Climo.
Ayr's acting captain Blair Macpherson then got a yellow card and once again Melrose took advantage of the extra player with an unexpected three by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a lot of printing game.
The home team made a return, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card because he had taken to death for Climo without the ball, and from the penal line MacPherson had pushed the ball to death after the incoming Ayr-loose.
Climo meant that, just as he had almost done from the reboot, after Kyle Rowe had got David Armstrong's goal and had sent away along Gregor Henry for the home team's fifth three.
Still Game-star looks like he's going to start new career in the restaurant business.
Still Game-star seems to be moving to the hospitality industry after it has been discovered that he has been designated as the director of a company of licensed restaurants.
The 56-year-old is playing Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC program, which he writes and plays along with old comet partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the coming ninth season would be the program’s last, and Kining seems to be getting ready for life to Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor didn't want to comment, although a source suggested by the Scottish Sun that Kirenning would get involved in Glasgow's "flourishing restaurant industry."
'The sea is ours': country-rounded Bolivia hope court will reopen away to Pacific Ocean
Sailor patrol a mash-covered naval quarters in La Paz.
Public buildings fly a sea blue flag.
Fleet bases from Titicaca Lake to the Amazon are embroidered with the slogan: "The sea is to right ours.
It's a duty to get it back."
Throughout the rural Bolivia, the reminder of the coastline they lost in a bloody resource conflict in Chile in the 19th century is still fresh – just like the need to sail the Pacific again.
That hope is probably the highest it was in decades, while Bolivia is awaiting a ruling by the international court on October 1, after 5 years of talks.
"Bolivia took the momentum, the spirit of unity and peace, and naturally expected the outcome with a positive attitude." said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the ICH ruling on large screens across the country, hoping that the Tribunal in The Hague will find in favor of Bolivia's claim that – after decades of sporadic negotiations – Chile is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia a sovereign passage to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president – who next year faces a controversial struggle for reelection – also has many that depend on Monday’s verdict.
"We are close to returning to the Pacific," he promised in late August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in Bolivia’s favor – and that little will change if it does.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to assign Chilean territory, and has established that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the IRH's ruling came only six months after the last one, shows that the matter was "not complicated," says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And rather than helping Bolivia’s case, it may have slowed down over the past four years.
"The issue of access to the sea was captivated by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morales ’ aggressive rhetoric captivated any remaining Chilean kindness, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to discuss again at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold nadious talks.
The two countries last exchanged ambassadors in 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision was extraordinarily rapid.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relationships with Chile" and a chance to "stop 139 years of differences with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America's most popular presidents – uses the maritime issue as a political crutch.
Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific," he added.
"The pronunciation is an opportunity to see what we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't come unless they can trust U.S.A.
North Korea’s Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, said his country would never first disarm their nuclear weapons if they could not trust Washington.
Ri was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to live up to the promises made during a meeting in Singapore between the rival countries' leaders.
His remarks followed US State Secretary Mike Pompeo evidently on the brink of rebooting nuclear diplomacy, which had reached a dead end, more than three months after the Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's a dream image that continued sanctions and U.S. capsy to a statement that the Korean War has ended will also bring the North on its knees.
Washington is careful to agree to the statement without Pyongyang taking significant steps to disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is widespread skepticism about whether Pyongyang is serious about relinquishing an arsenal that the country considers the only way to guarantee their safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim Trump meeting.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest series of large head coverings on the way to the shops near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or turn completely away from the sun, you don’t have to look further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne introduced a series of blatantly large head coverings to their SS19 collection on the walkway that enchanted the style at Paris Fashionweek.
Extremely impractical hats passed through Instagram this summer, and these designers paraded their stupendous creations on the walkway.
The excelling by Valentino was an oversized beige hat with a feathery wide edge that swallowed the models' heads.
Other great additions included watermelons decorated with jewelry, a sorcerer hat and even a pineapple – but it was not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also introduced a series of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had wrapped lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation looked like scuba equipment, including snorkel and diving glasses, while another looked like a melted ice cream horn.
And if you continue the great fashions, it is your happy day.
Style viewers predict that the huge hats may be on their way to the shops near you.
The oversized hats follow briefly on the heels of 'La Bomba', the straw hat with a two-foot-wide edge that was seen on everyone's heads, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the extremely impractical hat that was spread about socially sent another great creation across the walkway – a straw-beach bag almost as large as the swimwear model it wore.
The roasted orange raffia bag, finished with raffia fragrants and finished a white leather handle at the top, stood out at Jacquemus' La Riviera's SS19 collection at Paris Fashionweek.
Known stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: 'I expect to see big hats and beach bags appearing in shops for next summer – since the designer has made such a big impact that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized additional ones.'
John Edward: Language skills essential for world citizens
Scotland's independent schools have a zipper of academic excellence, and it continued in 2018 with another set of excellent exam results, which were reinforced only by individual and collective successes in sports, art, music and other community enterprises.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Board of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen career, and their position as world citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a custom school curriculum, we see that world languages continue as a popular and desirable choice of subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to someone in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart."
It's a powerful reminder that we can't rely on English only when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s recent exam results, we can see that languages are at the top of the league tables with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received a higher grade A.
The data, collected from SCIS's 74 membership schools showed that 72 percent of students obtained a higher grade A in Mandarins, while 72 percent of those studying German, 69 of those studying French and 63 of those studying Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young adults will no doubt need in the future.
Languages now have the same reputation as the STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools' curriculum and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Commission on Professions and Skills found in 2014 that some of the reasons employees provide why they are struggling to fill posts, 17 percent are attributed to a lack of language skills.
Hence, language skills are becoming more and more important to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more likely jobs requiring languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Whatever career a person chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future with such a lifelong skill.
To be able to communicate directly with people from other countries, a multilingual person will automatically be placed above the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation and French was the only language spoken by a double-digit referenced, 15 percent.
That is why investing in today’s children’s language education is now so important.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developing economies, will equip children with a better chance of finding meaningful work.
In Scotland, each school will differ in the languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other languages will teach what is considered essential to the UK when looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare and equip children with the skills needed to succeed, regardless of what the future holds.
It cannot be denied at this stage, in a global business environment, that languages are still enormously important to the country's future, and therefore it must be reflected in education.
Truly, modern languages should really be considered "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity, and excellence to Scotland’s young people.
Il fat bee le faire.

LeBron will make a debut for San Diego Lakers on Sunday
The guard is almost over for adherents to see LeSource James make his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in San Diego in the pre-season opening match against the Denver Nuggets.
But just how many minutes he will play remains to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably play a limited amount of time.
After a practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six games in the pre-season program.
"I don't need to get ready at this point in my career pre-season contests," he said.
Trump's West Virginia convention time, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a wave of elections in Wheeling, West Virginia tonight.
It's Trump's first of five scheduled conventions the following week, including stopping in friendly places including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the now held confirmation vote for his choice to fill the vacancies in the Supreme Court, Trump aims to build support for the forthcoming interelection because the Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress when voting in November.
What time is Trump's meeting in West Virginia tonight and how do you look at it online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, was scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can look below at Trump's contraction in West Virginia by living current.
Trump will probably pay attention to this week's hearings for the appointed Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who became tense about accusations of sexual misconduct with an expected affirmative voice held back for up to a week while the FBI investigates.
But the main point of this excess is to help the Republicans facing difficult elections in November.
President Trump's campaign thus said that in the following week these five conventions were aimed at "visiting volunteers and supporters while Republicans tried to protect and enlarge the majority they had in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Control over Congress is so critical of his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible when we reach the busy campaign season," a spokesman for the Trump campaign, who refused to mention his name, told Reuters.
Tonight's contraction, arranged for the Westbanco arena in Wheeling, can move supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and can be covered by the media in Pittsburgh," according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the West Virginia Republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind according to the voting patterns.
"It's not a good sign to Morrisey that the president should come to give him a boost at the voting box," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Riderbeker 2018: The U.S. team shows that they have courage for the struggle to keep the hope alive when they enter Sunday’s single game
After three one - sided sessions, the four - game teams of Saturday afternoon may have been just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging sling of momentum is an all-invented sports concept but one in which players believe wholeheartedly, and certainly in competitions like this.
Where, then, would they say that the momentum is now?
"They went ahead with six points and now it's four, so we carry it as a little momentum, I reckon," said Jordan Spieth as he ran away at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage, four points before and another twelve being played.
The Americans feel, however, as Spieth says, that they have so little wind in their sails and that there are many to encourage them, not the least the class of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long and each recorded three points out of four.
Spieth was deadly from the base to the cleanfield and guided by his example.
Those scurry celebration cries became louder as his round progressed and he sank a critical set to win four completely equal while he and Thomas were behind two rounds with two.
His setting which won the match at 15 for them was greeted with a similar scream, the kind that one tells one that he believes the American team has another chance.
"You really just have to take everything out and worry about your own game," said Spieth.
That is all those players now have left.
18 pussies to stamp them off.
The only players who have more points over the past two days than Spieth and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe’s couple but charming couples have obtained four out of four and can do nothing wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't record one on Saturday afternoon on track numbers, but they also kept one on Saturday morning on both avoiding track numbers and during the last nine Friday morning.
That run, and the way their energy seems to flow to and from this boisterous crowd, confirms that they are the players to be knocked on Sunday, and there will be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari who can sound a potential European victory when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Prefer both at the same time or at different spots.
However, it is still too early to speak of European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short measurements with Sergio Garcia, the morning’s four - ball hero, when he played with Alex Noren.
One is about grade, and two doubles on the front nine the Spaniard and the Swed ended up in a hole from which they could not even come.
On Sunday, however, there is no one to help you out of your hole.
The four-ball and four-game teams are so exciting to watch from close up because of the interaction between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way a strategy can turn into an instant.
Europe has so far always played better as a team and has taken the lead significantly on the last day, but this four-game session has also shown that the team of the U.S. has the courage for the struggle some, especially at home, doubted.
Europe runs 10-6 during the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a healthy advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after they have come out of Saturday's four-ball and four-game games with a lead of 10-6.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two victories over a struggling Tiger Woods to take their score so far at Le Golf National to four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who tried to retain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team that had been unmatched in the morning's four-balls, so that they won the 3-1 series.
The U.S. has offered more resistance in the four - game games and won two games, but they do not shrink behind.
Jim Fureich’s team needed eight points from Sunday’s 12 single - game games to maintain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, who are called "Moliwood" after a sensational weekend, are just the second few in the history of the Ryder Cup, who recorded four points after their first four matches.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-balls, they played excellent together to win a Dad Woods and American newcomer Bryson Dechambreau with an even more convincing 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, sometimes showed flashes of brilliance, but he now lost 19 of his 29 games in four balls and four games and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning's four-balls, came back to play with Henrik Stenson in the four-games to a 2&1 low for Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka--which is first and third on the world rankings.
On a pleasant day with a windy southwest of Paris, however, Europe did not always get their way.
Jordan Spieth who won three times a big tournament and Justin Thomas set the mark for the Americans on Saturday with two points.
They recorded a difficult 2&1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 3&4 in the four-games after losing the first two pieces.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team repair of a four-point behind when they enter the single game, even though Fureich's team just has to play equal to keep the trophy because they already hold it.
After being second best for two days, however, it does not seem that they will manage a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says they'll definitely 'unsure' unilaterally disarmed without confidence.
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued reductions are aggravating their distrust of the United States and that the country will certainly not give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally without such qualities.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that in the past year North Korea has taken "significant benevolence measures", such as halting nuclear and missile tests, breaking down the nuclear test site and promising not to increase nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We see, however, no corresponding response from the U.S.," he said.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances, we will certainly not disarm ourselves one-sidedly first."
While Ri repeated known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to the removal of nuclear weapons by which North Korea would be rewarded if it took gradual action, his words seemed significant in that it did not unconditionally reject unilateral removal of nuclear weapons as Pjongjang did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong-Oen and Donald Trump at the very first summit between a U.S. president and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore when Kim made a commitment to work for the "destruction of nuclear weapons in the Korean Peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea wants a formal end to the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pjongjang must first give up his nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted requests to slow down severe international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US insists on the "destruction of nuclear weapons first" and exerts more pressure by intensifying the level of the sanctions to achieve their goal in a compelling way, and even objecting to the 'declaration of the end of the war," said Ri.
"The perception that sanctions can force us on our knees is a dream of the people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions add to our distrust."
Ri said nothing about plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump on which the US leader at the United Nations turned attention earlier in the week.
Rather, the minister drew attention to three meetings during the past five months between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in and added: "If the party in this issue on the destruction of nuclear weapons were South Korea and not the US, the destruction of nuclear weapons in the Korean Peninsula would not have reached such a dead end."
The tone of Ri's speech was still dramaticly different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korea's rockets would be directed to the U.S. land mass after "Mr. Bose President" Trump called Kim a "shipman" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to destroy North Korea "fully," praised Kim abundantly for his courage for taking steps to disarm, but he said that much work still needs to be done and that sanctions should remain there until North Korea destroys nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday Trump said he didn't have a time frame for this, and said, "It doesn't matter whether it takes two years, three years, or five months."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pjongang for the steps they have taken.
But, U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, told the UN Security Council Thursday: "Application of sanctions by the Security Council must continue with zeal and without letup until we realize the full, final, confirmed destruction of nuclear weapons."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously intensified sanctions against North Korea in an effort to dry up funding for Pjongjang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the outskirts of the UN General Assembly and afterward said that he would visit Pjongjang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo had already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip there had not gone well.
He left Pjongang in July and said that progress had been made, but North Korea accused him just hours later of making " gang-like demands".
North Korea has promised in a meeting with Moon to break down a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States takes "corresponding measures".
He said that Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" he wanted to see are security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore as well as steps towards normalizing his relationship with Washington.
Harvard students take a course about enough rest.
A new course at Harvard University this year lets all its pre-graduate students get more sleep in an effort to counteract the growing macho culture of studying by caffeinated 'full-night sessions'.
An academic found that students at the world's top university are often ignorant when it comes to the basic principles of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleeping medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of his kind in the U.S.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the effect of sleep deprivation on learning.
'At the end of it, one girl approached me and said, 'Why do they tell me now, in my senior year?'
She said that no one had told her how important sleep was--that surprised me,' he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was first presented this year, explains to students the basic principles of how good sleep habits help academically and athletically, as well as how it improves their general well - being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said that after students were found to be seriously deprived of sleep during the week, the university decided to introduce the course.
The hour-long course involves some interactive tasks.
In one department there is a picture of a dormitory, where students should click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise shoes and books to be told about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is influenced by sleep deficiency and the importance of a bedtime routine.
In another department, participants are told how long-term sleep withdrawal can increase risks of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
'We know it won't change students' behavior immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know--just as you have the right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes,' Prof. Czeisler added.
The culture of pride to 'study all night' still exists, he said, and added that modern technology and ever increasing pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
To make sure that you get enough sleep of good quality, a student's 'secret weapon' should be to avoid stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said--even to avoid putting on weight, because sleep deprivation puts the brain in a starvation mode, which makes you feel hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californiar who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after he walked one of his classes last year, during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to work for a campus-wide course.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the institution where people compete with one another.
Prof. Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm for when to go to sleep, as well as for when to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of 'blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can disrupt your circadian rhythm and may cause you to struggle to touch the sheep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Goal of Menga conquers Gerrard's men
Rangers experienced another sarsie of day-to-day sore when Dolly Menga's target-head Steven Gerrard's incorruptible team got a defeat of 1-0.
The Ibrox team wanted to win their first win as visitors since February's 4-1-seg at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team had just given Gerrard his second defeat in 18 games as driver so that his team was eight points behind Hearts, which ran loose in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga struck seven minutes before rest time, and it didn't seem like a Rangers-team would seem to play without much inspiration.
As Rangers now fall to the sixth position, Livingston climbs to the third and is on purpose only behind Hibernian.
And there could be further trouble for Rangers after border judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after an object was apparently thrown off the roadside.
Gerrand made eight changes to the team that rushed past Ayr after the final match of the Betfred cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same Livi-11 that took a point of Hearts last week and he would have been in his nooks with the way his well-trained team suffocated their opponents at each turn.
Rangers may have dominated ball - holding, but Livingston did more when they had the ball.
Actually, they should have made points after just two minutes when Menga's first deposit, Scott Pittman, passed on to Allan McGregor's goal, but the middle field player had gotten his big chance.
After that, a deep freehead by Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defender Alan Lithgow could only kick miss at the rear goal pole.
Rangers took control, but there seemed to be more hope than conviction over their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos felt that he should have been given a criminal purpose at the quarter point when he and Steven Lawless collided, but the referee Steven Thomson turned away the Colombian's requests.
Rangers managed to get only two shots to the target during the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly bothered by Lassana Coulibaly's headshot and a tame target of Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi’s opener at the 34th minute may have been against the direction of play, no one can deny that they deserved it, even if it is only for their hard work.
Rangers once again didn't handle a deep set of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained cold-headed and sent it to Menga for a simple round.
Gerrard acted at the break when he exchanged Coulbaly for Ryan Kent and the exchange had an almost immediate impact when the wing sent to Morelos but the impressive Kelly chased from his line to the block.
But Livingston continued to force the visitors to play exactly the kind of game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett who had long ball in after long ball.
Holt’s team could have increased their lead in the final stages, but McGregor stood up well to stop Jacobs before Lithgow could enter far from the corner.
Rangers' substitute Glenn Middleton had another late demand for a criminal head when he got mixed up with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanac: Geigerteller’s inventor
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" almanac: 30 September 1882, today 136 years ago, and OUR TEL VERY OUR ... the day on which future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called the Geiger counter.
Since then the Geiger counter has been a pillar of science, and it has also become a pillar in pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bels of Coronado," in which those two unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played:
Man: "What on earth is this?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can even hear the effect of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals.
Evans: 'Good, it's cracking about now!'
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention bearing his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" robber cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to 'see' and kill robber cells
Vaccine teaches immune system to identify robber cells as part of treatment
Method involves withdrawal of immune cells from a patient, changing them into a laboratory
They can then see a protein 'which is common to many cancers and then inject it again.
A test chemical shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
One woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to identify predatory cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves withdrawing immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein that occurs in many cancers and is called HER2, and then injecting the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "is driving the growth of several types of cancers," including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach to removing immune cells from patients and "teaching" them how to attack cancer cells has worked to beat a kind of leukemia.
Kanye West, after acting on SNL, began a pro-Trump speech, wearing a MAGA hat.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was out in the studio during a Saturday Night Live after an extended act in which he praised the U.S. President Donald Trump and said that he would make himself elected in 2020.
After singing his third third of the evening, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a Make America Great-pet, he sailed against the Democrats and repeated his support of Trump.
"I speak so often to a white man and they're saying, "How can you like Trump, he's a race?"
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocked with Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's judicial committee about accusations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though it was not broadcast, the imagery of West was loaded on social media by the comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock tried to ridicule West by placing it.
West also complained to the audience that it was being made difficult for him behind the platform about what he was wearing on his head.
"They bullied me behind the platform.
They said, 'don't go out with that hat on.'
They bullied me!
And then they say I'm in a low place," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went ahead: "Do you want to see the low place?" and said that he would put on his "superman robe, because that means you can't tell me what I should do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love."
His comment provoked at least twice a sounding to the audience and members of the SNL roll division looked embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person there who said to the publication: "The whole studio has become silent."
West was introduced as a late substitute for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, the rhyme dresser Mac Miller had died a few days earlier.
West was very surprised with a performance of the song I Love it, dressed like a Perrier-bottle.
West was supported by the head of TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU THANK TO THE SCAR."
But chat programme hostess Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply "who he was and it's absolutely wonderful."
"But I have chosen not to reward someone (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his "art") who I believe accept and proclaim an ideology that endangers my community.
He's free.
We too," she added.
Before the show, the rhyme on Twitter announced that he had changed his name and said that he was now "the essence once known as Kanye West."
Not being the first artist to change his name, he follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
Fellow rhyme, Snoop Dogg, had the name Snoop Lion and, of course, late musical legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist who was once known as Prince.

The charge will be reviewed by the public indictment service.
Game of Thrones-star Kit Harington criticizes toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword - swinging role as Jon Snow in HBO’s violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, criticized the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such roles on the screen often mean that young boys often feel that they have to be tough to be respected.
Kit spoke to The Sunday Times Culture and said he said 'Something went wrong' and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo-era.
Kit, who recently married his companion from Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he felt 'reasonably strong' about working on this issue.
'I personally feel quite strong about it right now--where did we go wrong with masculinity?' he said.
'What have our men learned as they grow up with regard to the problem we see now?'
Kit believes that television may well be responsible for the growth in toxic masculinity because of its extremely male characters.
He continued: "What is inborn and what has been taught?
What is taught on TV and in the streets that makes young boys feel that they should have this certain aspect of being a man?
I think it's really one of the big questions in our time-- how do we change it?
Because something apparently went wrong with our young men.'
in the interview he also admitted that he would not take part in any of the Game of Thrones tracking and tracking documents when the series came to an end next summer, for he said he was 'ready with battlefields and horses'.
From November on, Kit will play in a new version of Sam Shephard's True West, which is the story of a movie producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he felt that the best thing that came from Game of Thrones was to meet his wife Rose.
'I met my wife on this program, so that way it gave me my future family, and my life from here on,' he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-conquered fantasy series.
In June 2018, the couple married on the site of Leslie’s family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced that there is a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country are affected, health officials.
Some 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted by sex, which represents a change of the past.
Traditionally, HIV is rapidly spreading through some parts of China because of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who contracted HIV in this way was reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan Province.
Year after year, the number of people living in China with HIV and AIDS increased by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission by sex is a critical matter in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still very common.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men would eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the diseases come from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, China's government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an attempt to make the matter work.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member leaked GOP senators' data, condemns 'hazardous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'.
U.S. Republican Maxine Waters set out on Saturday against claims that a member of her staff had placed the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the legislators' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the charges were driven by "ultra-right" experts and Web sites.
"Liars, lies and still detestable lies," said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The leaked information reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers for U.S. Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Karolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, placed by an unknown person on the Capitol Hill during the Senate Panel trial on the claims of sexual misconduct against the appointed for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred sometime after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Poundit and RedStates reported that the IP address identifying the source of the sites was related to Waters' office and disclosed the information of a member of Waters' staff, reported the Hill.
"This unfounded claim is totally untrue and an absolute lie," continued Waters.
"The member of my staff--whose identity, personal information, and security were put at risk as a result of this deceptive and false claim--was by no means responsible for the leak of this information.
This unfounded claim is totally untrue and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly aroused online criticism, including former Whitehouse press representative Ari Fleischer.
"This denial testifies to anger," wrote Fleischer.
"It suggests that she has no temperament to be a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of not doing something he should not be angry.
He should not be challenging.
He should not question the motives of the prosecutor.
He must be calm and calm."
Fleischer apparently compared Waters ’ reaction to the Democrats ’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of seeming to be too angry during Thursday’s trial.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate trying to lift Waters from the pillows in the interim election, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great if it is true," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had informed "the appropriate authorities and law enforcement entities of these deceptive claims.
"We shall make sure that the stewards are exposed," she continued, "and that they will be legally accountable for everything they do that is destructive and dangerous for every member of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Again review - faint Rowan Atkinson spy mockery
It is now traditional to look for Brexit meaning in any new movie with a British impact and it seems to apply to this revival of the Johnny English action comedy mockery ranch - which started with Johnny English in 2003 and continued to struggle with Johnny English Reborn in 2011.
Will tongue-in-select even on the subject of how obvious power we are the nation's new export event?
At any rate, the clumsy Johnny English with his pods and rubber face had his license to waste everything for the second time renewed--and his name was a clearer indication than anything else that he was a great comic creation for non-English-speaking film audiences.
He is, of course, the ridiculous secret agent who, despite his bitar pretension to sophisticated elegance a bit from Clouseau, a piece of Mr. Bean and a good shot of that guy who contributed a single note to the Chariots or Fire theme song at the opening ceremony of the London Olympic Games in 2012.
He was also originally based on the traveler and international man of puzzles, who left chaos behind him, which Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard advertisements.
There are one or two nice moments in this latest version of JE.
I liked Johnny English who came to a helicopter while he was dressed in a medieval armor robe and short-cut the screw blades against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is displayed but the humor feels quite faint and strangely superfluous, especially when the "serious" movie brands like 007 and Mission Impossible now use self-confidence as an ingredient.
Humour seems to be aimed at children rather than adults, and for me, Johnny English’s adversity is not as original and focused as Atkinson’s silent jokes in the persona of Bean.
The eternal thematic assumption is now that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A cybercracker infiltrated Britain's supersecret network of spies and revealed the identity of all of Britain's agents in the field, to the dismay of the agent serving--a deplorable little roll for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for a prime minister who is an inflated and besieged character, who is already experiencing a total collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thomspson is doing her utmost with this quasi-Teresa May character but there is little in the text to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that since every active spy has been put at risk, she must call someone out of retirement.
And that means the struggling Johnny English himself, now in service as a teacher at some fine institution, but from the record gives lessons about how to be a secret agent, there are some cute jokes here when English offers a School of Rock-type spy school.
English is called back to Whitehall for an emergency order and is reunited with his former long-suffering companion Bough, reinterpreted by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, married to a submarine commander, an allamaptic-roll in which too little is expected of Vicki Pepperdine.
Thus, the Batman and Robin have been completely abandoned in Her Majesty’s secret service and come upon Olga Kurylenko’s beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister ends up under the perilous spell of charismatic technology billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems: the mysterious Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey of ridiculous escapades: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant, they cause chaos when they smuggle themselves aboard Volta's luxury yacht; and English break free pure anarchy when he tries to use a headpiece for virtual reality to become familiar with the inside of Volta's house.
For that last scene nothing is spared, but as cute and exuberant as it may be, the whole affair is quite a bit like children's TV.
Reasonably mediocre.
And like the other Johnny English movies, I couldn't stop thinking: can't the British give Rowan Atkinson a role that really makes his talent come to justice?
To deny that it's a plan for Britons to work a four-day week but to be paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labor Party must consider a drastic plan that will cause British to work a four-day week--but be paid for five days.
The party is said to want company-based savings caused by the artificial intelligence revolution to be transferred to workers by giving them extra day.
It'll make workers enjoy a three-day weekend--but they'll still take the same payment home.
Bronne says that it will 'fit' the party's economic agenda and plans to establish the country in favor of the workers.
To change to a four-day week was endorsed by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to exploit the changing economy.
A senior worker party source told The Sunday Times: A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'It won't happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is an ambition that fits into the party's approach to rebalance the economy in favor of the worker as well as to the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Workers' Party will not be the first to endorse such an idea, with the Green Party which, during its campaign for the general election in 2017, promised a four-day work week.
At present, however, the ambition is not supported by the entire Workers ’ Party.
A spokesman for the Workers' Party said: 'A four-day work week is not party policy and is not considered by the party.'
Shadow Minister John McDonnell used last week's Workers' Conference to elaborate on his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from 'visitless directors' and 'winners' at service companies.
The shadow minister's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not get their entire investment back because a workers' government can make 'deductions' on the grounds of alleged wrongdoing.
He also confirmed plans to place workers on directors of companies and create inclusive ownership funds to give 10 percent of equity in private - sector enterprises to employees, who can obtain annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tells "60 Minutes" or the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh can make them change their mind
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh had a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court with at least a week delayed and raised the question whether the Bureau's findings could convince any Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In a Sunday interview, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican sens. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could dig up anything that could make them change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more receptive than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said at the beginning of the trial, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it had happened, that accusation came out, and said, 'Did you do this?
He was determined, certainly, unambiguous."
Graham’s voice, however, appears to be unchangeable.
"I formed my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and it would require an accusation of dynamite," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it: Brett zealously denied it," Graham continued, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she called couldn't confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see anything new changed."
What is the World Civil Festival and has done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday New York will host the World Citizen's Festival, an annual musical event that has a particularly impressive group of stars that act and have an equally impressive purpose; the end of poverty in the world.
The World Civil Festival is now in its seventh year, and during the festival, tens of thousands of people will flock to Central Park’s Great Lawn to enjoy not only actions by Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes but also to create awareness of the opportunity’s real purpose of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizen's Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the World Poverty Project, an international interlocutory group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
To get a free ticket to the occasion (unless you are willing to pay for a GDP card), concertgoers had to perform a series of tasks, or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or any other meaningful way to create awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But just how successful was World Citizen with 12 years of age who remained to achieve his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert, a good way to convince people to demand a call for action, or is it just another case of so-called "clickivism"--people who feel that they make a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Worldburger has been saying that it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters, supporting a multitude of different goals.
It says that these actions have helped to encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies equal to over $37 billion that will potentially affect the lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its actions, at least $10 billion of which had already been paid out or collected.
The group estimates that the confirmed money has so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the most important commitments include the Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers committed to "helping children reach their full potential", and pledges to give $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after having received more than 4,700 tweets from World Citizens.
"With the support of the government of the UK, donors, government governments and world citizens just like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," the Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that, after more than 5,000 actions taken to approach the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the common questions on his website that asks, "What makes you think that our extreme poverty can end?"
Worldburger replied, "It will be a long and hard road-- sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements in front of us, we will succeed, because we have more power together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe is among the artists who perform at this year's event in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. can use fleet for "blockade" to prevent Russian energy exports - Minister of the Interior
"If necessary" Washington may leave him on his fleet to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, the U.S. Secretary of Interior Ryan Zinke, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zincs claimed Russia's involvement in Syria - especially where it works at the invitation of the legal government - is a pretext to investigate new energy markets.
"I believe the reason why they are in the Middle East is because they want to act as brokers for energy just as in Eastern Europe, the south of Europe," he said.
And according to an officer, there are ways and means to deal with them.
"The United States has the ability, with our Fleet, to ensure that the seaways are open, and if necessary, to block, to make sure their energy does not end up on the market," he said.
Zincs addressed the attenders of an occasion offered by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group without profit that considers itself the "voice of the energy consumer" in the U.S.
He continued to compare Washington’s approaches to the handling of Russia and Iran and noticed that it was practically the same.
"The economic option on Iran and Russia is, more or less, to finance and replace fuel," he said as he referred to Russia as a "single-talent" with an economy dependent on fossil fuel.
The statements come as Trump administration was on a mission to boost the export of their liquid natural gas to Europe to replace Russia, by far the cheaper option for European consumers.
For that reason, Trump administration’s officials, including America’s President Donald Trump himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "unfit" Nord Stream 2-pipeline project, which, according to Trump Berlin, makes Moscow’s "prisoner."
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2-pipeline, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fiery opposition to the project is merely driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of implementing pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," said Russian Minister of Energy, Alexander Novak, after a meeting with America's Secretary of Energy, Rick Perry, in Moscow in September.
The U.S. view provoked counter - reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the U.S. to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a major problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "think seriously" to stand as president in 2020, said the Senator of Massachusetts
Massachusetts's senator, Elizabeth Warren, said Saturday she would "seriously consider it" to stand as president to the mid-term elections.
At a village meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts confirmed Warren that she would consider standing.
"It is time for women to go to Washington and correct our broken government and it includes a woman on the highest sports," she said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November I will seriously consider standing for president."
Warren gave her opinion about President Donald Trump during the village meeting and said, "Take the country in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was very expressive in her criticism of Trump and his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
In a tweet Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before our voice."
A survey released Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own voters did not think she should stand in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "probably" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not stand, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe survey.
Thirty-two percent supported the idea that she should stand.
The survey showed more support for the idea of former Governor Deval Patrick standing, with 38 percent who supported the idea of having to stand potential, and 48 against it.
Other high-profile democratic names discussed to possibly stand in 2020 include former vice president Joe Biden and and Vermont's Senator Bernie Sanders.
Praying said he would officially decide in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin calls Track Palin's PTSV at Donald Trump convention
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining in September.
He was arrested Monday night and charged with an incident of domestic violence.
"What my own son goes through, what he has been through since he came back, I have sympathized with other families that sense the consequences of PTSD and the wound with which our soldiers return," she told an audience at an assembly for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of her son and other war veterans, "They come back a little differently, they come back hard, they come back and wonder if there is the respect for what they and their fellow soldiers and airmen and every other member of the army have given to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence, assaulting a woman, interfering with a complaint of domestic violence, and possession of a gun while he was under the influence, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Station.
18 states, D.C. supports challenge of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the county of Columbia support a legal challenge of a new US policy that refuses asylum to victims who flee from gang or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the county filed a friend of the court-law in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker and challenge the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the claimant in the Grace v. Sessions dispute filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy in August was not made public.
She said her mate "and his violent gang members," mistreated her, but U.S. officials refused her request for asylum on July 20.
She was held in Texas.
The state attorneys who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, who produce a large number of applicants for U.S. asylum, as nations facing profound problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new US policy on asylum reversed in 2014 a decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals (Council of Immigrant Appeals) that allowed immigrants to apply for asylum without the necessary documents that had fled from domestic violence.
District Columbia's attorney-general Karl Racine said Friday in a statement that the new policy "ignores decades' state, federal and international laws."
"Federal laws require that all asylum applications will be decided on the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such lawyer violates that policy," said the friend-of-the-court court order.
Advocates have further argued in the legal proceedings that the policies that immigrants refuse to access are damaging the US economy and say that it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and will provide "necessary labor."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to cease granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic and gang violence.
"Asiel is available to those who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership to a particular social group or political opinion," said Sessions in his announcement of the policy on June 11.
Asiel was never meant to alleviate all problems — even all serious problems — that people face all over the world every day.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu while death tolls double in race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is increasingly nagging.
"It feels very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma while consoling her frail baby boy at an evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
"minute minute brings an ambulance body.
Clean water is scarce."
Residents have been seen returning to their devastated homes, searching through drenched possessions, trying to save anything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5-size tremor, were overwhelmed.
Of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who contracted a broken back and shoulder, rest outside Palu's military hospital where patients are treated outside because of constant strong aftershocks.
Tears fill his eyes as he tells of the violent earthquake which shook the fifth-story hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pressed into the walls' rubble, I think," Haris told Associated Press and added that he and his family were in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife crying for help, but then silence.
I don’t know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of bullying with 'propaganda advertisement'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in an American daily that offered the mutual benefits of U.S. China trade, the U.S. ambassador accused China Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to the China Daily’s paid entry in the Des Moines Register – the state of Iowa’s newspaper with the most sales – after accusing China of interfering in the US congress elections of November 6, a complaint that China denys.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. elections, noted what U.S. officials had told Reuters, a new phase in a growing campaign through Washington was to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently caught up in an escalating trade war that has led to their tariff rounds leveling on each other's imports.
China’s reprisals early in the trade war aimed to beat exporters in such states as Iowa that supported Trump’s Republican Party, said Chinese and U.S. experts.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. Ambassador to China and former Governor of Iowa for a long time, a great exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion paper in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "now annoys the bullying by publishing propaganda advertisements in our own free press."
"By spreading their propaganda, the Chinese government seized America's cherished tradition of free speech and a free press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at the newspaper kiosk in the street here in Beijing, one will find very limited aberrant voices and will not see any true reflection of the diverse opinions the Chinese people have about China's alarming economic trajectory, giving that media is under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers has shyed away from the offer to publish his article", although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans alienate women's voters for intermediate elections with Kavanaugh debakel, warn analysts
While many top Republicans stand at Supreme Court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh and defend him in the face of various claims of sexual assault, analysts warned that they would see counter-reaction during the upcoming interim elections, especially of women.
The emotions on this are enormously high, and most Republicans are on record to indicate that they already want to continue the mood.
Those things cannot be reversed," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School for The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted whether Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s incentive for an FBI investigation on the minute would be enough to appease harsh voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
Friday morning protesters "November is on the way!" roaring as they argued in the entrance hall of the Senate while the Republicans who had chosen the Judicial Committee to continue Kavanaugh's appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be very high," Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, said to the news yard.
"People say it was already high; it's true.
But it can be higher, especially among voice-female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18- to 29-year-olds, who don't often vote because they don't like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony that set out the details of her charge of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominated, analysts said a counter-reaction could follow if Republicans continued with the confirmation.
"It became a mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not about the committee's vote or the final vote and whether Kavanaugh is put on the court, it's also about the way the Republicans handled it and how they treated her," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, pointed out to the news channel a group that helps to elect democrats.
But Americans seem slightly divided about who to believe after Ford and Kavanaugh’s testimony, with slightly more taking the latter’s side.
A new recording of YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents certainly or probably believe Ford's testimony, while 35 say they certainly or probably believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought Kavanaugh was likely or definitely jogging during his witnessing, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake’s instigation, the FBI is currently investigating the charges made by Ford, as well as at least one other complainer, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Last week Ford, under oath before the Senate’s Legal Committee, testified that at the age of 17, Kavanaugh had assaulted her while he was drunk.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court-nominated his genitals to her while attending a party during their student years at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the global web plans to start a new Internet to tell Google and Facebook the battle
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the global web, launches an initial business that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology legend's latest project, Inrupt, is a company building on Berners-Lee's open source platform, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people are allowed access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee mocked that the idea of Inrupt was "world domination."
"We must do it now," he said of the project.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data storage" or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, do lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available at the same time and on one browser.
What is unique to the personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to the user who can access that type of information.
The company calls it "personal authorization through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company’s HUB John Bruce, is for the company to bring resources, processes, and relevant skills to help make Solid available to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, developers on the personnel contracted to work on the project and a community of volunteer encoders.
From this week on, technology developers from all over the world can create their own decentralized applications by using the tools available on the Inrupt Web site.
Berners-Lee says he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about introducing a complete change whether or not, where all their business models are completely reversed overnight.
"We don't ask their permission."
In a positioning on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to supply commercial energy as well as an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994 Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the Global Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has had an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even as he launches Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the Global Web consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about this next era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: WW1 Victoriacross-spiritual celebration
The only clergyman of the Church of England who won the Victoria Cross as a warrior during World War I was honored 100 years later in his hometown.
Lt.kol Reverend Bernard Vann acquired the award on September 29, 1918, in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But four days later he was killed by a sniper and never knew that he had gained the highest British military honor.
A memorial stone was revealed Saturday by his two grandsons at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliant symbolic" that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning achievement.
According to the London Gazette, St. Col. Vann led his battalion over the Saint-Quentin Channel on 29 September 1918 "through very dense fog and under heavy fire from the field and machine guns."
He rushed to the fireline later and with the "greatest bravery" led the line forward before he stormed a field gun alone and knocked out three of the division.
Lt.kol Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions are "something I know I can never live up to, but something that is humiliating."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a cliff to the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said he "feel ere to play a role in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the support given by a lot of people."
MMA supporters stay awake all night to watch Bellator 206, but get Peppa Pig
Imagine, you stay awake all night to watch the compact Bellator 206, just not to be able to watch the main event.
The program of San Jose contained 13 battles, including six on the main program that would be broadcast directly by night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were on their way to tell each other the battle, viewers in the UK were left stunned as the coverage changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were unimpressed after staying awake especially for the battle until the early hours.
One supporter described on Twitter the switch to the children's cartoon as "some kind of sick joke."
"It is government regulations that the content at 6 p.m. was not appropriate and therefore they had to switch to children's programmes," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator vice president of marketing and communication, when he was questioned about the broadcast.
""Peppa the pig," yes."
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they would work on their scheduling to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think that when I think of the recast, I think we can probably figure something out," said Coker.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning on a Sunday there and we won't be able to sort it out until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we are working on it.
Believe me, when it switched over, there were many text messages sent back and forth, and it wasn't all friendly.
We tried to correct it, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I can promise you that this will not happen next time.
We will limit it to five fights instead of six – as we normally do – and we have tried to offer more to our adherents and just over our time.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'minor' about sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior about his sexuality – but it gave him the motivation to be a success.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize before he went to high school that "not all are like me."
When he spoke on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs offered by Lauren Laverne, he said he had aired his feelings about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that becoming a parent had made him less concerned about winning at the Olympics.
The regular provider of the long program, Kirsty Young, took a few months because of illness.
When he appeared as a abandonment on Laverne's first program, Daley said he had "less" than everyone felt when he was growing up, for "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said, "To this day, those feelings are less than, and different, the real things that gave me the strength and energy to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so that he would not disappoint anyone when they would finally find out about his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze medalist has become a high profile LGBT fighter and has used his appearance at this year's League Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He says he has aired his feelings because he is so happy to be able to live openly without consequences and wants to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said that to fall in love with a man – U.S. filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – "he caught away."
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than he is, but says the age difference has never been a matter.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" – he went to his first Olympic Games at the age of 14, and his father died three years later from cancer – he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar heights and lows.
The couple became parents in June of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley says his "whole perspective" has changed.
"If you asked me last year, everything was about 'I must win a gold medal'," he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40, after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley says his father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked if they had tickets for London 2012 — because he wanted to be in the front row.
'I couldn't tell him 'You're not going to be here to be in the front row, Dad,' he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it was only after he stopped breathing and was dead that I finally admitted that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that it was what I had dreamed about my life all my life – to dive in front of my home crowd at an Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first choice of song — Proud by Heather Small — who also resonated with him in building up to the Olympics and still gave him chicken meat.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson does not drift and withdraws from Saturday’s Rider Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Rider Cup match, but he will have to manage his shape to prevent it from being an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who plays for a record-12th time in the biennial event, was withdrawn from the game by Captain Jim Furich for Saturday's four-ball games and four-digits.
Instead of being the centerpiece of the action, as he has often been to the United States, the five-time major winner will divide his day in between being a rabies leader and working on the drill on his game hoping to correct what matters.
Even at the height of his career he was never the most straight driver and therefore the 48-year-old is not the ideal person for the narrow Le Golf National course where the long roughfield always punishes the wandering blows.
And as if the course on its own was not challenging enough, Mikkelson faced the exact British Ope champion Francesco Molinari in his ninth match on Sunday, who teamed up with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind, start the 12 single - game games well, Mickelson’s match can be absolutely essential.
Fureich expressed confidence in his husband, not that he could say much else.
"He fully understood his role today, gave me a knock on the back and put his arm around me and said he'll be right tomorrow," said Furich.
"He has much confidence in himself.
He is in the Heroes ’ Hall, and he has contributed so much to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn’t think he would play two games.
I had more in store, but that’s how things worked out and that’s what we thought we should do.
He wants to be there on the track, just like anyone else."
Mickelson will surpass the record of Sunday Nick Faldo for the player who played most of the Riderbeker matches.
This can mark the end of a Rider Cup career that never really corresponded to the highlights of its individual achievements.
Mickelson had 18 berths, 20 defeats, and seven halfs, although Furijk said that his presence contributed unto the team untolerable aspects.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, taken, likes to shave, and he's a wonderful guy to have in the teamroom," he explained.
"I think the younger players also enjoyed shaving with him crazy, which was fun to see.
He offers so much more than just spell."
Europe Captain Thomas Bjorn knows great advantage can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a considerable advantage before the last day's single game in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable experience.
The Danish made its debut in the 1997 Valderrama competition, where the team under the direction of Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead, but only won the sledge with 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"One keeps reminding oneself that we had a great advantage at Valderrama; we had a great advantage at Brookline, where we had lost, and at Valderrama, where we won nailscrap," said Bjorn, in the photograph, after he watched how the Class of 2018 won 5-3 and yesterday 10-6 before Le Golf National.
So, history will show me and everyone on the team that it is not over.
You're going to be full tomorrow.
Go out and do all the right things.
It is not over until you have the points on the board.
We have a purpose, and it's to try to win the trophy, and it's where the focus stays.
I say all the time, I focus on the 12 players on our team, but we're also well aware of who's on the other side – the best players in the world."
Rejoicing at how his players sailed on the difficult golf course, Bjorn adds: "I'll never go ahead with this.
Tomorrow is a horse of a different color.
Tomorrow it's the individual participation that's taking place, and it's a horse of a different color.
It's wonderful to be out there with a mate when things are going well, but when you're there individually, you're being tested to your full capacity as a golfer.
That's the message you need to pass on to players, making the most of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your mate behind and he must also draw the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furich will want his players to perform better individually than they did as matchmates, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furich himself had been reversed on both sides of that great last-day, where he was part of the winning team at Brookline before he had ended as loser when Europe achieved the "miracle of Medinah".
"I remember every covert word of it," he said in reply when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999 had bragged his players on his way to that last day.
"We had 12 important matches tomorrow, but one would like to start well, as Brookline was seen, as was seen at Medinah.
When that momentum begins in one direction, it puts a lot of stress on those middle games.
We have set up our team accordingly, and have divided the men whom we have felt, you know, to bring us tomorrow something magical."
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the counterattack and faced the main contest against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter, who are the other Europeans in the upper half of the division.
"I've chosen this group of guys in this order, because I think it covers it to the end," said Bjorn about his single game options.
Germany’s New Warship Rescheduled
The German army’s latest frigate would have been put into service in 2014 to replace the old warships from the Cold War era, but it will not be there until at least next year, due to faulty systems and growing costs, reports local media.
The launch of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the brand-new Baden-Wuerttemberg-Class frigates has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to The Zeit-Kurant, who quotes a military spokesman.
This vessel must have joined the Navy in 2014, but the troubling postal delivery issues plagued this ambitious project's fate.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels ordered by the Fleet in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-Class frigates.
It is understood that they will have a powerful cannon, a battle of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as several secret technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – it should be possible to develop the latest frigates for up to two years away from home ports.
However, constant delays mean that the advanced warships – which will evidently enable Germany to project power overseas - will already be out of date by the time they enter into service, called Die Zeit.
Last year, the disastrous F125 frigate struck when the German Navy officially refused to hire the vessel and sent it back to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has sent a ship back to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media mentioned that a number of essential "software and hardware defects" make the ship useless if it is unfolded in a campaign.
Software defects are particularly important since the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels will be handled by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half the manpower on older Bremen-class frigates.
It also revealed that the ship is drastically overweight, reducing performance and reducing the Fleet’s ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000 tons "Rheinland-Pfalz" are thought to be twice as heavy as ships of similar classes used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the price tag for the whole project – including the training of the crew – also affected a matter.
It evidently reached an incredible €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) – more than the initial €2.2 billion.
Problems that the new frigates have bitten become particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the power of Germany’s fleet is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's defence committee, admitted that the Fleet's "ships that can be unfolded are going on."
The official said that the issue had worsened over time, for old ships were put out of service, but no substitute vessels were provided.
He lamented that none of Baden-Wuerttemberg's class could join the Navy.
National Trust Listens to Bats ’ Secret Life
New research is carried out on a estate in the Scottish Highlands that aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow both the common and soprano bats, as well as the brown long-eared and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special recorders will be placed on the property in important locations to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also make mobile recordings using hand indicators.
Expert clans of all recordings will check the regularity of the bat calls and determine which species to do.
A habitat map and report will then be compiled to create a detailed landscape scale image of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a conservation consultant for NTS hopes the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important to bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management such as pasture creation and how to best manage forest lands for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects sleeping places and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lightning can also pose a risk, as well as fliers and some chemical treatment of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not really blind.
But because of their nocturnal hunting activities, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated ego-oriented technique to identify bugs and obstacles on their flight route.
The NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 acres [76,000 ha] of land throughout the country, is very serious about bats.
It has ten trained experts who regularly perform surveys and dormitory inspections and sometimes perform rescues.
The organization even set up Scotland’s first and only dedicated bat reserve at Three estates in Dumfries and Galloway that is home to eight of Scotland’s ten species of bats.
The estate manager David Thompson says that the estate is the ideal site for them.
"Here at Threeave we have a wonderful area for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many veteran trees and all the good habitat.
But there is so much about bats that are still unknown, so the work we do here and on other properties helps us to understand better what they need to thrive."
He emphasizes the necessity of looking for bats before conservation in properties is done because it is possible that unwitting destruction from a single birthplace can mean up to 400 females and young children's death and can exterminate an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, disturb, or prevent them or destroy their sleeping places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to jump in to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and to many of our species we don't know how their populations do."
Ronaldo kills rape claims while lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo put rape claims against him as "false news" and said that people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are ready to sue German newsmagazine, Der Spiegel, that published the claims.
The Portugal and Juventus forerunners were accused of raped an American woman, named Kathryn Mayorga, at a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He reportedly paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, reported Der Spiegel Friday.
In an Instagram live video in which he addressed his 142 million followers, hours after the claims were published, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the reports as "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," said the five-time Ballon d'Or winner to the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
This is normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but that's part of the whole thing.
I'm a happy man and everything's right," the player added smilingly.
Ronaldo's attorney is preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the claim, which, according to Reuters, they called "unallowable reporting of suspicion in the field of privacy".
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player will claim compensation for "moral damages for any amount corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident reportedly took place in June 2009 at a suite at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a night's meeting, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went to the player's room, where he reportedly raped her anal, according to documents filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell down on his knees at the alleged incident and said he was "99 percent" an "good guy" who was abandoned by the "one percent."
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claimed that she had gone to the police and had taken pictures of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to a settlement outside the court because she was "feared for reprisals" and worried about being "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old says she wants to reverse the settlement now because she was still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged assault and moved this summer, in a $100 million agreement to the Italian giants, Juve.
Brexit: UK will lose it forever if their car manufacturers lose it
The UK 'will forever repent' if they lose their status as world leader in car manufacturing to Brexit, said Company Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "disquieting" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily have to stop production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese vehicle manufacturer said that the impact of border delays in the case of a gene agreement-Brexit could cost posts.
Last year, the Burnaston plant – which manufactures Toyota’s Auris and Avensisensis – produced nearly 150,000 cars, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production stopped in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, feared to leave the EU without an agreement and how cross-border trade will function.
BMW, for example, said that they would shut down their Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what car manufacturers say supply chain risks are in the case of a Brexit without an agreement.
Toyota's production line runs on a "just in time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars made on order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be disruption on the border that the industry says can lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's supply at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and therefore production would be stopped.
Mr. Clark says Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU was "calibrated precisely to avoid those controls at the border."
"We need an agreement. We want the best agreement that, as I say, will allow not only to enjoy the current success but to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The indications of not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers, are that we absolutely need to continue with what was a very successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production will be stopped but warned that added costs in the long term could reduce the plant’s competitiveness and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite Union's convoy at the plant, says his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, when these posts disappear, they never come back again.
A government spokesman said, "We have proposed a precise and acceptable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, says Withuis
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could "be postponed by another week" while the fight over nominees continued to the high court Brett Kavanaugh, the Whitehouse said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special legal adviser Robert Mueller, who examines the Russian election interference, links between Trump helpers and Russia, and possible cross-bombing of justice by the president.
Whether Trump is going to fire the deputy attorney general or not, threatening Mueller's independence has been fueling Washington's gossip for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of carrying a recorder to take up conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president via the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the account.
But last Monday he went to the White House, amid reports that he was on his way to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "chosen not to give up" for Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a collision with the Senate Court trial in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both witnessed.
On Friday Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of claims against Kavanaugh and further postponed the full Senate vote.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When she was asked about the Rosenstein meeting she said: "A date for it has not yet been determined, it can be this week, I can see that it will be postponed with another week with all the other things going on with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some journalists will disagree with that statement: Sanders has not held a Whitehouse press information session since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the scarcity of information sessions is not because of a reluctance for TV journalists who are "effect hunting", although she said, "I won't argue with the fact that they're having an effect hunt."
She suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president holds more V&A sessions than any president before him," she said, adding without quoting evidence: "We looked at the numbers."
Information sessions will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, it is infinitely better than talking to me.
We try a lot and you've seen us do it a lot in the past few weeks and it's going to take the place of a press information session when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press statements with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press statements are scarce.
In New York last week, the president might have demonstrated why, by making an unconnected and at times, bi-barrel appearance before journalists gathered there.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland about Brexit fears
The Secretary of Health wrote to EU staff working in Scotland’s NHS to show the country’s gratitude and to express the wish that they would stay on to Brexit.
Jeanne Freeman MSP sent a letter with less than six months left before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to cover costs of completed status applications for EU citizens working in the delegated public services.
In her letter I. Freeman wrote: "During the summer negotiations between the UK and EU on withdrawal continued, on the way to anticipated decisions this fall.
But the UK government has also intensified their preparations for a possible non-agreement scenario.
I know this is a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I would like to repeat how much I put at the expense of each staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health service’s work, benefiting the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home, and we would like you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers' liner Christion Abercrombie had an emergency operation after he contracted a major injury in Saturday's 31-27 defeat against the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee team's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State’s chief coach Rod Reed told journalists that the injury had taken place shortly before rest time.
"He came to the margin and sort of just collapsed there," Reed said.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen along the margin before he was placed on a portable and was taken back for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was out of the theater at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there are "no details yet about the type/size of the injury" and Tennessee is still trying to detect when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, an academic second year, was in his first season at Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He had taken to death on Saturday five times before he left the game, bringing his total for the season to 18 barrels.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp taxes when they buy property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp taxes when they buy a property in the UK and the extra cash will be used to help the homeless, according to the new Tory plans
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn's attempt to draw young voters
The stamp tax will be levied on those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasure expects to raise up to £120 million a year – to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp taxes when they buy property in the UK – with the extra cash that will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The action will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's attempt to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and target high earners.
The stamp tax increase will be levied on individuals and firms that do not pay taxes in the UK, with the extra money that will help the government’s plans to counter homelessness.
The extra tax – which is beyond the current seal tax, including the higher levels imposed two years ago on second houses and houses purchased for rent - can be as much as three percent.
The Treasure expects this move to bring in up to £120 million a year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built London subscriptions are purchased by non-UK citizens who boost the prices and make it more difficult for first buyers to get a foot in the housing door.
Many affluent areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become ghost towns because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a stamp tax reduction to help more young people own their first home.
He accused large construction firms of keeping property prices high by picking up land, but not using it, and encouraged Mrs. May to surrender quotaes on affordable homes to repair Britain's "domestic disaster".
Mr. Corbyn announced a striking series of proposed housing improvements, including rent management and an end to "no error expulsions".
He also wants to give advice to greater powers to build new houses.
Mrs. May said: "Last year I said I would devote my prime ministership to restoring the British dream – that life must be better for every new generation.
And that means repairing our broken home market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and build a life.
However, it cannot be right for individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign - based companies to buy houses, to be as easy for hardworking British residents.
For too many people the dream of homeownership has become a dream far off, and the humiliation of homelessness has become too great a reality."
Jack Ross: "My greatest ambition is to drive Scotland."
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "largest ambition" is to become Scotland's manager at one time.
The Scots, 42, enjoys the challenge of blowing new life into the North East team, which is currently in third place in League One, three points below the tops.
This summer he moved to the stadium of Light after leading back to the Scottish Premiership last season of St Mirren.
"I wanted to play as a player for my country.
I got the second team, but it was all," Ross told BBC Scotland's sports sound.
"But as a child, I often looked with my father for Scotland at Hampden and that's something that pulls me back.
The opportunity can only come, however, if I am successful with club management."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa athletic boss said he felt no fear of following such established names at such a large club, after he had previously turned down presentations by Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At the moment, success will be measured for me by ''Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?'
Because of the structure and facilities at this club, it certainly belongs in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to get it there, but I'll probably consider myself successful only if I can get the club out of there again."
Ross's career in the management is only three years, after a period as assistant boss at Dumbarton and a 15-month period at Hearts' train crew.
He then helped Alloa return from relegation to the third league and St. Mirren from on the edge of relegation to winners of the Championship title in the next season.
And Ross says he now feels more comfortable than he ever felt during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a true crossroads," he said when he recalled how he had taken over Alloa's lead.
"I really believed the management was the right place for me, even more than to play.
It sounds bizarre, for I have done well enough, made a reasonable living out of it, and experienced reasonable highlights.
But the game can be difficult.
There are many things to come through weekly.
I’m still going through it with regard to the stress and pressure of the work, but driving just feels right.
I always wanted to drive and now I do it, it feels the most comfortable I have been in my own skin throughout my adult life."
On Sunday, September 30, you can listen to the full interview on Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 BST
The perfect time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday, found recording
The summer heat wave improved Britain’s struggling bars ’ income but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Drinking places and bar groups saw sales rise 2.7% in July, but restaurants received 4.8 percent, showing figures.
Peter Martin, of the business consulting firm CGA, who compiled the figures, says: "Continued sunshine and England's longer than expected participation in the World Cup meant that Julie followed a pattern similar to that of the previous month, June, when drinking places were up with 2.8 percent, except that restaurants were hit even heavier.
The decline of 1.8 percent in restaurant trade in June only worsened in July.
Drink-led drinking places and bars have done far better, and have risen more than restaurants have come down.
Food-led drinking places also suffered in the sun, but not as bad as restaurant operators
It seems people just wanted to go out for a drink.
All over driving bars and drinking places sales rose 6.6 percent for the month, with food being down by three percent."
Paul Newman, of recreation and hospitality analysts RSM, said: "These results continue the tendency we have seen since the end of April.
Again and the impact of major social or sports events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the out-of-the-house market.
It comes as no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a drop in sales of 4.8 percent years per year will be particularly difficult above and beyond constant cost pressure.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food-led operators and only the time will show whether the more temperate temperatures we have experienced since August will bring needed relief."
Total growth in sales across drinking places and restaurants, including new places that opened, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowing down in brand notices.

One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
One out of five children – some as young as 11 – have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers, exposing a recording
Enrollment of 20,000 high school students has revealed an increase in false Insta pages
The news raised fears that sexual content would be placed
Twenty percent of students say they have a "main account" to show parents.
One in five children – some as young as 11 – create social media accounts that keep them secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed rapid growth in "false Insta accounts" – a reference to the photo gallery Instagram.
The news raised fears of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they had a clean "main account" to show parents, but also had private accounts.
One mother who came across her 13-year-old daughter's secret yard found a teenager who urged others to "rape".
The research, at Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-olds have two profiles, with half of them admitting that they have private accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said, "It's disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eiligh Doyle will be "voice for athletes" on Scottish athletics council.
Eiligh Doyle was elected to the Board of Scottish athletics as a non-executive director at the governing body's general annual meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track-and-field athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the step as a wonderful opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from her far-reaching experience at international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh has great respect throughout the Scottish, UK and world athletic society and we are sure athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from what she brings to the council," said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I am eager to act as a voice for athletes and hope I can really contribute and help to lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who had the 200 meters and 400 meters at the 1996 Games in Atlanta under his four gold Olympic medals, is now a regular BBC expert, could not walk after having had a short-term ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today a month ago I had a stroke.
I could not walk.
Doctors said that only time would tell whether I would recover and to what extent.
It was exhausting work, but it fully recovered, reedied how to walk, and is doing dexterity exercises today!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!"
Breast pump advertising comparing mothers to cows divide opinions online
A breast pump company shared opinions online with an advertisement comparing breast-feeding mothers to cows being milked.
In celebration of the launch of what is called the "world's first silent portable breast pump," consumer technology company Elvie released a tongue-in-the-pick music video-inspired advertisement to show the freedom that the pump gives to mothers who milk out.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of straw and cows to the measure of a song that includes lyrics like: "Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see a tail" and "In case you haven't seen, it's not udders, it's my breasts."
The choir section reads: "Pump it out, pump it out, I carry the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies."
But the advertisement published on the company's Facebook page has caused contention online.
With 77,000 eyes and hundreds of remarks, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying that it underplays the "grotes" of the dairy industry.
"Very weak decision to use cows to advertise this product.
We need to get them pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies are often stolen from them within days of giving birth," wrote one.
The Elvie breast pump fits discreetly in a nutritional bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another person remarked: " Understandably traumatic for mother and baby.
But yes, why does it not use to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added, "The advertisement is so out of touch."
Others defended the advertisement, with one woman who admitted that the song was for her "screams."
"I think it's a genius idea.
I would have had one if I had still breast - fed.
To milk out made me feel just like a cow.
The advertisement is a little crazy, but I accepted it for what it is.
It's an ingenious product," wrote one.
Another noticed: "It's a nice advertisement aimed at mothers who feel milk (often in their workplaces or toilets) and like "cows".
It's not an advertisement praising or judging the dairy industry.
At the end of the video the women show that they all danced with the discreet pump in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who milk out say that they feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, however, is silent, has no wires or tubes, and fits discreetly into a nutritional bra that gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out while they are milking.
Ana Balarin, partner and UKD at Mother commented: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a big and provocative introduction.
By drawing a parallel between women who are milking and dairy cows, we wanted to put the milking process and all its challenges in the spotlight, while in an entertaining way we find the wonderful sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This isn't the first time the Elvie pump's got the news.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the walkway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has risen sharply, although monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, partly because of fierce rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration that make it more difficult to place children at sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors were also undocumented immigrants and feared that their own ability to stay in the country would be put at risk by moving forward to claim a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that possible sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to file their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albumnce, a senior official at Immigration and customs enforcement before Congress, testified that the agency had arrested thousands of people who had applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have previous criminal records.
"Nearly 80 percent of the individuals who are sponsors or household members of sponsors are illegal here in the country and a large number of them are criminal foreigners.
That's why we're continuing to persecute those individuals," said Mr. Albumnce.
In an effort to speed up the process, officials set new rules that would require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to shelter workers.
Many will appear through video conference call, rather than in person, to plead their case for legal status at an immigration judge.
Those who are unfit for relief will quickly be deported.
The longer the children remain in custody, the more likely they will be to become anxious or depressed, resulting in violent eruptions or escape attempts, according to shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Advocates say those concerns are raised at a larger facility like Tornillo, where signs that a child is more difficult to miss because of the size.
They added that to move the children to the tent town without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally to say good - bye to friends, the trauma that many are already struggling can worsen.
Syria tells US, French and Turkish 'occupied forces' to withdraw immediately
When he addressed the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to come home, even though the country's war is in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, said the foreign forces are illegal on Syrian grounds, under the pretext of fighting terrorism and will be "treated accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he said to the meeting.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with millions more displaced, "almost over".
He said that Damascus would continue "to wage this sacred battle until we have cleared all Syrian territories" of both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, who mostly train and advise Kurdish forces as well as Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France with over 1,000 troops on the ground in the war - torn country.
On the question of refugees Moualem said that the conditions were in order for them to return, and he blamed "some Western countries" for spreading "irrational fears that encourage refugees to stay away.
"We have appealed to the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They're politicizing something that should simply be a humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats said a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in the last major Idlib rebel fortress, provided an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action would target jihadists, including warriors from the Al-Qaeda-connected Nusra Front who would be "cut off".
UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to establish a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem prescribed conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee and said that the panel's work should be limited to "inspecting the articles of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump will win the reelection in 2020, unless, as many liberals probably hope, a state of accusation and scandals will end his presidency early.
In what no doubt "the most dramatic finale of a presidency will ever be!"
To date, there are no signs of viewer fatigue.
Since 2014, peak-time viewing rates have more than doubled to 1.05 million at CCN and almost triple to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million peak time viewers, on 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSN's "The Rachel Maddow Show" tops cable viewing rates with as many as 3.5 million viewers on big news evenings.
"It's a fire that people are attracted to, because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, program manager of the ABC drama "Designed Survivor" about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Congress building.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", had another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The manager told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, "For he makes me laugh," Scovell told me.
There is entertainment in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the story lines coming from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, or immigrant families, and reunite the health of the world economy.
Disabling is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond being just an informed citizen when you're in the sixth hour of watching a panel of experts debate about Bob Woodward's use of "deep background" from his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich leather flight jacket ("a garment thick from the hybrid," said The Washington Post), and the implications of Stormy Daniels' shocking descriptions of Mr. Trump's, um, anatomy.
For example, I would never look at Super Mario in the same way again.
"In part he does what makes it feel like a reality program, is that he feeds you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, head of business of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars," about the Trump program's varying role distribution and daily shiverings in the plot (such as looking for quarrels with N.F.L., Kim Jong-un to praise).
You can't afford to miss one episode, otherwise you'll be left behind.
This week when I arrived for Mr. Fleiss, it was 80 degrees outside his home on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was looking inside at MSNBC while he was recording CNN.
He could not tear himself away, not with Brett Kavanaugh was on his way to appear before the Senate’s Court of Justice and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the scales.
"I remember when we did all that crazy programs back then and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was kind of a joke, but it seemed now they were right."

Outside money streams to most exciting mid-term election races in Home
It's not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th saw a flow of money, due to a shift of congress districts that two officials now ended up in a race for the same seat.
The recently changed suburban Pittsburg district lets Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb – which won his seat in another district in a special election last spring – measure forces.
Lamb stands against another officer, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which is heavily overlapping with the new 17th.
The cards were withdrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January decreed that the old districts were unconstitutionally delineated in the Republicans ’ favor.
The race in the new 17th took off with a campaign finance competition between the major parties' financial legs, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a nailscrew win in a widely-looked special election in March for Pennsylvania's 18th Congress district.
The seat was held for more than a decade by a Republican, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
U.S. thought of criminalizing El Salvador, rather than supporting China, but then turned back
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already acknowledged Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners disfellowshipped the Trump Organization's management team.
Officials of the government departments decided to recall the U.S. heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the "recent decisions not to acknowledge Taiwan any more," said Heather Nauert, the spokesperson of the Department, earlier this month in a statement.
But fines were considered only against El Salvador who received an estimated $140 million in American aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic assistance.
The proposed fines, including reduction in financial assistance and targeting visa restrictions, would be difficult for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, only North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level congress and focused on security and economic progress to follow a similar convention last year that was considered a step forward in an attempt to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
But by mid-September, top-administrative officials made it clear that they wanted the congress to continue effectively bringing an end to any consideration of fines for El Salvador.
Deputy President Mike Pence is now destined to address the congress, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the seriousness of the convention for the administration, the diplomats said.
And the three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic with no new angry messages or strenghts from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton did not want to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal discussion on condition of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an outside analyst who was close to the administration and also spoke about the condition of anonymity.
Study History
The next thing that may happen can be the special discussion of Robert Mueller’s report on Mr. Trump’s possible cross - bombing of the court, of which there is now much evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller is also thought to focus on whether Mr. Trump’s campaign cooperated with Russia in the country’s attack on our elections.
If Congress were to pass into other hands, Mr. Trump would have to face accountability in that body, just when he was preparing to go before the voters again, and perhaps finally before a jury of his peer group.
It's a lot of axes, and I don't want to imply that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable – nor is that of his counterparts in Europe.
There are decisions to be made on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how much the battle can be extended.
In 1938, German officials were ready to execute a coup against Hitler, if only the West opposed him and supported the Czechoslovakia at Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and democracy’s unrelenting course is hastened or delayed.
Americans now face several such spins.
What would we do if Mr. Trump's deputy attorney-general Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation, quit?
Rosenstein had been in hot water since this newspaper reported that last year he had suggested that the president be taken up in secret and speculated about whether he was qualified for his office.
Mr. Rosenstein says The Times’ report is inaccurate.
"How will we react if the newly requested FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court in spite of credible charges of sexual assault and dishonest evidence?
And above all, will we vote in the election for an assembly that will hold Mr. Trump responsible?
If we watch those tests, there's a long winter ahead of democracy.
But I believe we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who had been deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime who at one time lived in my ambassador's house.
She survived, emigrated to America, and, 60 years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles on that table carrying the swastika.
With it as my origin, how can I not be an optimizing about our future?"

Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimistics for Rapid Vienna match
Rangers play Thursday hosts for Rapid Vienna knowing that victory over the Austrians, after the impressive equal result in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europe League.
A knee injury prevented middlefield player Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season to the 2-2-equency against Villarreal, but he is said Rangers could use this outcome as a place of departure for bigger things.
"It was a good point for us, for Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game with the conviction that we could get something and walked away with a point.
Maybe we could have won it at the end, but a equal score is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, and we came out in the second half and were the better team.
Thursday is another big European evening.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's going to be a difficult game, because they've had a good result in their last match, but with the crowd on our side, I'm sure we can push through and get a positive result.
Last year was certainly difficult, with everything that happened to my injuries and the changes at the club, but there is now a sense of well-being-factor in the place.
The group is good and the men really enjoy it; the training is good.
Hopefully we can now push through, sit behind us in the past season and succeed."
Women lose sleep over this retirement - money fear
Despite the fact that recording participants have a clear idea of how they want to be cared for, few people talk to their relatives about it.
About half the individuals in the Nationwide study said they were talking to their husbands about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a relative to take care of them, but they don't take the steps to have the conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
Here is where to start.
Talk to your husband and the children: You cannot prepare your family for care if you do not express your wishes long in advance.
Work with your consultant and your family to determine where and how to receive care, as those options can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Bring in your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you come up with a way to pay for those expenses.
Your long-term insurance funding decisions may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid cash-value life insurance policy to help cover these expenses or self-insurance with your own abilities – as long as you have the money.
Work out your legal documents: Cut legal battles to fit.
Get a health care proxy instead of so that you appoint a trusted individual to oversee your medical care and ensure that experts meet your wishes if you cannot communicate.
Consider, too, your finances by proxy.
You must choose someone you trust to make financial decisions for you and to ensure that your bills are paid if you are unfit.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medication and allergies?
Play those details in a written plan so you are ready.
"It's not just the financial issues that are in question, but who's the doctors?" asked Martin.
What Is the Medication?
Who Will Care for the Dog?
Make sure that plan is in place."
Man shot several times in Ilfracombe with windbucks
A man was shot several times with a wind box when he walked home after an evening out.
The victim, in his 40's, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach, and hand.
Officials described the shooting, which took place at about 02:30 BST, as an "random act".
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries are not life - threatening, and the police asked for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed because of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu Friday, officers said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
With communication out of action, relief officers could not get any information from Donggala regentship, an area north of Palu closer to the center of the 7.5-size tremor.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were brought to safety after the disaster struck.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province, located at the point of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency stretching along more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline to the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The regentship, an administrative region under a province, had an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the pillars of the Central Sulawesi province's economy, especially the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province but is mostly concentrated in Moravali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit several times during the past 100 years by tsunamis, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938 a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck west Donggala in 1996 and caused nine deaths.
Indonesia sits on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is hit regularly by earthquakes.
Here are some of the great earthquakes and tsunamis of the past few years:
2004: A great tremor along the western coast of Indonesian Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 which led to a tsunami that struck 14 countries has led to 226,000 deaths along the coast of the Indian Ocean, with more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong tremors hit the western coast of Sumatra late in March and early in April.
Hundreds died in Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 size hit the south of Java, Indonesia was most populated island, which led to a tsunami that struck the southern coast and caused nearly 700 deaths.
2009: A 7.6-size tremor struck near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
Over 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-size tremor struck one of the Mentawai islands, near Sumatra, which led to a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozen villages and led to about 300 deaths.
2016: A flat tremor struck the Pidie Jaya regentship in Aceh and led to destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly shaking and tsunami in 2004.
It didn't lead to a tsunami this time, but more than 100 were killed because of buildings that crashed,
2018: Great tremors strike Indonesia's tourist island Lombok, with more than 500 deaths, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The tremor destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin’s eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Governor of Alaska and vice-president Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested under suspicion of domestic violence, interference with a report of domestic violence, and resistance to arrest, according to a report issued by Alaska State Police on Saturday.
According to the police report, he took a female acquaintance's phone from her when she called the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is in detention at Mat-Su's trial facility and is held on a $500 unsecured deposit, reports KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, declaring "innocent, certainly" when asked what he was pleading, reported the network.
Palin staring at three class A offences in the face, which means he could be imprisoned for up to a year and $250,000 fined.
He is also charged with a class B offense, punishable with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time criminal complaints have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the alleged attack.
The case is now before Alaska’s Veteran Court.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic violence, interference with the report of a crime of domestic violence, and possession of a gun while he was drunk, in connection with the incident.
His girl claimed that he had boxed her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after linking her son’s conduct to PTSD as a result of his military service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake tsunami: hundreds died
At least 384 people died after an earthquake on Friday struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
The 7.5-size earthquake led to a tsunami that destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and communications networks have been out of action with mortality rates expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just outside central Sulawesi, which is northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulate on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered together for a beach feast in the city of Palu, when the tsunami struck the beach.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death sentence for suspects in NYC terror attack
Federal prosecutors in New York seek the death sentence for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people – a rare punishment that has not yet been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bicycle path along the West Side highway in Laer Manhattan to reap pedestrians and a cyclist in his path in October.
In order to justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "willfully" killed the eight victims and "consciously" administered serious physical injuries, according to the notice of intention to ask for the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both of those charges bear possible death penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal great jury beat Saipov with 22 charges, which included eight charges of murder for the benefit of extortion, typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "momentous planning and premeditation," said prosecutors, describing the way Saipov carried it out as "disgusting, cruel and perverted."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erleij, Hernán Ferruchi, Hernán Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," stated the intentional notice.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since the Southern District of New York judicially prosecuted a death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to the murder of two drug providers but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been killed after being sentenced for a plot to spy on the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
Both Rosenberges were restored with the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no repentance in the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He mentioned to detectives that he felt good about what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after he had watched ISIS videos on his phone, according to the charges.
He also requested to show the ISIS flag in his hospital room, the police said.
He pleaded innocently on the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal pro Deo lawyers representing Saipov, said that they were "of course disappointed" with the persecution's decision.
"We think that the decision to desire the death penalty rather than accept a admission to life imprisonment with no possible release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all concerned." said Patton.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked persecutors not to desire the death penalty.
Tory LP says NIGEL FARAGE should be placed in control of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage made a vow today to mobilize "the people's army" during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians should feel the "heat" of Eurosceptics – since one of Theresa May's own LP's suggested he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative back banker Peter Bone told the march in Birmingham that the UK was by now "should be out" if Mr. Farage Brexit was secretary.
But the challenge Mrs. May faces is to unite her deeply divided officers by pro-Rome Tories, by joining a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister struggles to keep her Chequers compromise plan on track amid attacks by Brexiters, Remainers and the EU.
Alliances insisted that she would press door in her attempt to enter into an agreement with Brussels despite the deadlock – and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and 'chaos'.
Mr. Bone told the Loop Means Loop-Conference in Solihull that he wanted to eject "Chequers".
He suggested that Mr. Farage should have been made a nobleman and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
'If he had been in control, we'd have been out by now,' he said.
The Wellingborough-LP added: 'I'll stand up for Brexit, but we must eject Chequers.'
He set out his opposition to the EU and said: "We have not fought world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.'
Mr. Bone rejected the fact that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: 'The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is totally untrue.'
Tory Brexite Andrea Jenkyns was also at the march and told reporters: ‘ I’m just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
‘Chequers are unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is unpopular with our party and our activists who bombard the streets and make sure that we are selected in the first place.
Please let Chequers go and start listening.'
In a direct message to Mrs. May, she added: 'First ministers must keep their work when they keep their promises.'
Mr. Farge told us that the convention politicians had to feel the "heat" when they were on the threshold to want to violate the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
'It's now about a matter of trust between us--the people--and our political class,' he said.
'They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them, 'we won't let you get away with it.'
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: ‘ I want you to make our political class, who is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.
'We mobilize the people's army of this country that gave us victory in Brexit and will not rest until we are an independent, self-government, proud United Kingdom.'
Meanwhile, Remainers marched through Birmingham before holding a convention for two hours in downtown.
Some activists waved Tories against Brexit banners after the introduction of the group this weekend.
Labour noble Lord Adonis mocked the conservatives for the security issues they had endured with a party application such as the conference opened.
'It's the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus instead, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,' he added.
'It's a total wisdom.
There's no such thing as a good Brexit,' he added.
Warren plans to 'look hard at it' to stand for president
U.S. Sen Elizabeth Warren says she will "look hard at it to stand for president" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a city hall meeting in western Massachusetts Saturday.
Warren, a regular criticism of President Donald Trump, stands for reelection in November against GOP by Rep Geoff Diehl, co-chairman of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She has been in the middle of speculation that she may challenge Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon’s event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with constituents using the city hall format since Trump was in power.
A stranger asked her if she was planning to stand for president.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, and it includes a woman at the top."
Arrested in Shoot Death of LSU’s Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, LA., announced Saturday that a suspect had been arrested in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayne Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. ET News Conference.
They released a video of the shooting event on Friday and asked for help to identify a man who was seen in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near Southern University campus early Friday.
"Waite Sims suffered a gunshot wound in the head and was finally killed as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media as far as 247 sports Saturday.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was on the scene, owned a weapon, and admitted that he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and arrested at East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 youth who grew up in Baton Rouge played Sims in 32 matches with 10 firsts last season and maintained an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 seconds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton resonates world title after team orders gave him his victory over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified Saturday before Lewis Hamilton when Mercedes team orders would play a major role in the races.
From pole position, Bottas had a good start and almost won Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel first entered the wells and left Hamilton to drive into traffic at the back of the bundle, something that must have been decisive.
The Mercedes put a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went forward to wheel-on-wheel action which the Ferrari driver reluctantly risk-free saw left the inside at risk of stamina to a double-movement to defend at the third corner.
Max Verstappen began from the back row of the jumping schedule and was seventh toward the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led for much of the race, as he held on to his tires to quickly finish and to pass Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He may have come into the wells on the 44th round but could not accelerate his pace in the remaining eight rounds, since Raikkonen took fourth place.
It was said that it was a difficult day, because Valtteri did fantastically all weekend and was a true sir.
The team did extraordinary work to have a one-two," said Hamilton.
It had been grossly bad body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a convention Saturday for her insistence that she did not leak Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which his Supreme Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh accused of sexual assault.
The president spoke at a convention in West Virginia and did not directly address the testimony given by Ford before the Senate Law Committee. Instead, he commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "congregation and rude and liars."
"The one thing that can happen and the lovely thing that has gone on in the Senate over the past few days, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and liars," he said.
"When you look at statements and leakages and then they say "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember her answer... you licked the document--"Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't lick it."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we lick it...no, we didn't lick it," he added, in an act of the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter setting out the charges back in July against Kavanaugh by Ford, and it was leaked earlier in September, but Feinstein denied that the leakage had come from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations. I didn't leak her story," Feinstein told the committee, reported The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked."
But the president didn't consider her denial good and commented during Saturday evening's convention: "I tell you what. It was grossly bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president continued to defend the Supreme Court nominated accused by three women of sexual misconduct and suggested that the democrat use the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back with any necessary means.
You see the meanness, the rudeness, they don't care who hurt them, who must drive them to get power and control," Mediate reported the president said.

Air traffic controller dies to make sure hundreds on plane can escape earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is considered a hero after he died when he made sure that a plane that carried hundreds of people took off safely.
More than 800 people were dead and more were missing after a great earthquake on Friday struck the island of Sulawesi, and caused a tsunami.
There are still strong aftershocks in the area, and many are caught in demolitions in the city of Palu.
In spite of his colleagues who had fled for their lives, however, 21-year-old Anthonius Gwaman Agung refused to leave his position in the control tower, which had waved badly at the Mutiara SIS Al-Jufri airport in Palu.
He remained unmovable to make sure that the Batik Air flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, was able to climb safely.
He then jumped off the traffic - control tower when he dayd that it tumbled together.
He later died in the hospital.
Spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, says that the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reported Australia’s ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts break to hear of this," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll can reach the thousands with the country’s disaster -respect agency saying that access to the towns of Donggala, Sigi, and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that the death toll is still increasing as many corpses are still under the construction traps while many cannot yet be reached," said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves that reached up to three feet [6 m] have jerked Palu who will be holding a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial planes bring in help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance brings in bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
The minimark is looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is chasing to help survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
Indonesia’s president Yoko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the country’s military service: “I ask almaI of you to work day and night to complete every task related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia aircraft accident: Air Niugini says one man is missing after lagoon aircraft accident
The airline that handled a flight that crashed in a Pacific beach lake in Micronesia now says that one man was missing after they had previously said that all 47 passengers and crew safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they couldn't account for a male passenger.
The airline said that they work with local authorities, hospitals, and detectives to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said Friday that seven people were taken to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday, and that all of them were in a stable state.
The cause of the collapse and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.
The airline and the U.S. fleet both said that the plane landed near the runway in the lagoon.
Some witnesses thought that the plane had gone past the runway.
US passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane came in very low.
"It is a very good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and the others were able to walk through medium - depth water to the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said that the airmen panicked and screamed and that he had suffered a small head injury.
The U.S. fleet said that ships working close to improving a wharf also helped with an inflatable boat with the rescue to get people back and forth ashore before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Air Safety Network indicates that 111 people have been killed in PNG registered airlines in the last two decades, but Air Niugini had been involved in one.
Analysts set out timeline of evening that woman was burned alive
The state closed his case on Saturday in the retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice Analyst Paul Rowlett witnessed for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone records to assemble the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night that he died.
Rowlett said that he received location data from different cell phones showing that Tellico was together Chambers the night of her death, which contradicted his previous claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers during the period he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford witnessed Saturday that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's move that night, Sanford said he "jok, because my move was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency is that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile records indicated that they knew each other just for a week.
Rowlett said that a while after Chambers' death, Tellico Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information were deleted from his phone.
"He certainly made her out of his life," said Hale.
The defense was scheduled to begin his closing pleas on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative outlook of the genres by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, of Bristol, claims that hip-hop moved away from its origin of political messages and the approach to social issues.
They want to go back to the foundations and make conscious hip-hop again popular.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have seen a recent rise in the UK by artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
NY-nanny-naughter challenges couple because she has been fired to "racist" text
A New York nanny sued a couple for discriminatory dismissal after she received a misaddressed message from the mother who complained that she was another black person.
The couple deny that they are racist and compare the suit with " blackmail."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, aired her distress when she found out that the new child caregiver, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived for her first workday in 2016.
"NEEEEAEE NEVER A SWART PERSON," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it to me Maurice twice.
After she discovered her error, an "uneasy" Plasco-Flaxman fired me Maurice and said that their outgoing nanny who was African-American did bad work and that she had rather expected a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for one day's work and then sent home with a Uber.
Now Maurice sues the couple for damages over the dismissal and seeks his damages up to the amount of $350 a day for the six months, resident work for which she was initially appointed, although it was without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you're not doing such good," she told the Post on Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple looked back on the claims that they were racist and said that it was the reasonable thing to end Maurice’s employment and feared that they would not be able to trust her after they insulted her.
"My wife sent her something that she did not mean to say.
She's not a race.
We're not racist people," man Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would you put your children in the hands of someone with whom you were rude, even if it had been by outside?
Your newborn?
Come on."
Plasco compared the case to "epressive" and said that his wife would have had a baby in two months' time and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are you going to pursue such a person?
It's not a very nice thing to do," the investment banker added.
While the legal case continued, the court of public opinion had been quick to bring the couple to social media and to hack them for their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared that a talking bear would not link readers
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who first reads it before it was published.
It is very entertaining that we know about Paddington's great success."
She said that her father would have been ardent if his work had been rejected. He was a BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write the children's book about the little toy bear. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication after his death was last year's "bittersweet".
About Paddington, who she described as a "very important member of our family", she added that her father was silently proud of his ultimate success.
"He was quite a quiet man and he wasn't an appley man," she said.
"But because Paddington was genuine to him, it was almost as if one had a child who had accomplished something: you are proud of them, even though it is not your job.
I think he viewed Paddington’s success kind of that way.
Even though it was his creation and imagination, he always gave the credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say hello over the phone.
When she landed, her daughter was chased to Nice’s Louis Pasteur 2-hospital where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that it was really bad, that they didn't expect her to make it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got the call from Nad to say that she would die within the next two minutes and that I should have greeted her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, heart lamb.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medication the doctors gave her to keep her heart beating was slowly getting out and leaving her system.
She was a while before it died and the body was shutting down.
I just had to sit there waiting, knowing that it was unfolding.
I couldn't scream or scream or cry, because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to keep it together."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who by then was hurt for the loss of her daughter, accompanied the other passengers on board the plane--unconscious of the trial she had gone away.
"No one knew," she said.
"I had lowered my head and tears fell all the time.
It's hard to explain, but I got an overwhelming sympathy for Nad on the run.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Mourning Women Post Maps to Prevent Suicides on Bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide work to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey have been mailing cards for a while on a Welsh Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Me Davis’s son Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and killed himself at age 18.
"I want no parent to feel the way I do every day," she said.
Me Davis, 45, lived in Lydney and said that her son was a promising shef with an infectious smile.
"All knew him for his smile.
They always said that his smile had brightened any room."
However, he gave up work before he died, because he was "in a very dark place".
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11 years old, found his brother after taking his own life.
Me Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that there'll be a domino effect."
Me Davis designed the cards, "to let people know that there are people out there to whom you can go and to whom you can talk, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit in silence--you must talk."
Me Humphreys, who has been a friend of Me Davies for years, lost Mark, her husband of 15 years, not long after the death of his mother.
"He didn't say he felt sick or depressed or anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his attitude.
He reached the lowest point on Christmas--when the children opened their gifts, he did not make eye contact or anything with them."
She said his death was very traumatic to them, but that they had to work through it: "It ripped a hole through the family.
It rips us apart.
But we must all go on and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh’s future is still unshakable as FBI investigation begins
"I thought if we could actually get something like what he had asked for--a timeless investigation that had no scope--we could perhaps bring a little unity," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee was "falling apart" under entrenched partisan accumulation.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI investigating?
Their reluctance is all because of timing.
The intermediate elections are only weeks away, on November 6, if, as expected, the Republicans are doing badly, they will be greatly weakened in their efforts to get the man they prefer to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush calls senators to influence them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House and who met his wife Ashley and was Mr. Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI has produced his report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It's not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can reach at least 50 votes on the Senate floor that Mike Pence, the vice president, will allow to break a draw and confirm himself to the Supreme Court.
North Korea overflows numbers down under Kim
The number of North Korean flooders to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, said a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-zeug quoted data from the South's Unification Cabinet and said that last year there were 1,127 overlaps--compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that stricter border control between North Korea and China and higher rates requested by human smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang made no public comment.
The vast majority of floods from the North are finally offered South Korea civil rights.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most flights through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the highly protective demilitarized zone (DMS) between the two Koreans.
Shina considers the flooders to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often repatriates them with violence.
Relations between the North and the South who are still technically at war with each other have improved dramatically in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met for conversations that centered around the cease - and - fail negotiations on the removal of nuclear weapons.
It came to the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore when they agreed in broad terms to cooperate for the nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.
But North Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions on Saturday for the lack of progress since then.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way that we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first," said Mr. Ri in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "history," says he is incompetent to serve at the Supreme Court.
House minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh "history" and said that he was temperamentally incompetent to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comment on Saturday in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman ever acted like this, they would say 'Histerically'," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate-law committee Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied that he had attacked sexual Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional and at the time almost screamed and choking as he discussed his family and his high school years.
He also expressly disapproved of the committee and called the claims against him a "disgusting and coordinated character assassination", organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because it showed that he was prejudiced against democrats.
"I think he made himself unfit with those statements and the way he went behind the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to accuse Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if democrats won the majority in the House of Commons.
"I'll say it -- if he doesn't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, then he's not qualified to be in the Supreme Court, but to be in court on which he is currently," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the D.C. Ummegang Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that she was concerned as a Democrat about potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Act on Costly Care of Roe v. Wade since he was considered a conservative right.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh passed questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not time for a hysterical, prejudiced person to go to court and expect us to say, 'Isn't it wonderful,' said Pelosi.
And women must handle it.
It's a righteous diatribe, months and years' anger that boils over, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She continued, "I was very helped by a woman who was an executive official somewhere, who also said that she cried when she got angry, but developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started to cry, she would say to the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just went on.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are permissible as a partial exit for bridle because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my sharpest memories of an early job in a male-dominated office is where I once found myself crying with nameless anger and being grabbed by an older woman's neck - a cold driver I was a little afraid of - who dragged me into a stratagem.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think that you are sad and will be happy because they have had an effect on you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colourado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an illegitimate relationship on a boat called Monkey Business and he had to leave the race, I Schroeder, very frustrated, realized that there was no reason why she could not investigate the idea that she could run for president.
"I didn't think well about the decision," she said to me laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another.
Someone called it "Snowy and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because it was late in the campaign, she was behind with findings, so she made a vow that she would not enter the race unless she had collected $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters who had given $1,000 to men would give her only $250.
"Do they think I get discount?" she wondered.
When she gave her speech and announced that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was overwhelmed by emotions--thankful for the people who supported her, frustrated with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and to target voters rather than parts, and angry at sexism--that she had choking.
You would have thought I had a nervous breakdown," recalled Schroeder about how the press had responded to her.
"You would have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my tombstone?
"She cried?"
How the US China Trade War may be good for Beijing
The opening salvo of the trade war between the U.S. and China had been deafening and while the struggle was far from over, a dispute between the countries might have been beneficial to Beijing in the long term, say experts.
Donald Trump, the U.S. president, fired the first warning earlier this year by taxing important Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
This week the most important escalation has rolled in with new rates that affect $200 trillion (£150 trillion) items and effectively tax half of the goods coming into the U.S. from China.
Beijing used to retaliate in goods each time, and recently, rates of five to ten percent have clapped on $60 trillion of U.S. goods.
China has promised to match the US lap-by-shoot and the world's largest economy is not going to move soon.
To get Washington to stand back means to surrender to requests, but to publicly comply with the U.S. requests would be too much of a embarrassment to Xi Jinping, China's president.
Experts continue to say that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, pressure on US trade war over the long-term Shina can positively support by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create the conditions that an economic toll flight can begin in any of the countries is actually much more dangerous than spectators have previously confessed," said Abigail Grace, a research assistant who focuses on Asia in the middle of New American Security, a thinker.
Syria 'ready' for refugees to return, says Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild the land that has been destroyed by a war for more than seven years.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Affairs Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country were improving.
"Today the situation at ground level is more stable and secure due to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists to normal.
All conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country to leave because of terrorism and the one - sided economic measures aimed at their daily lives and their existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
A further six million people still living in the country need philanthropic assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the flattened land.
However, he stressed that it would not accept conditional assistance or help from countries that had guaranteed the invasion.
Europe Seals Ryder Cup Victory in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup and won Span U.S.A. with a final point of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn’s team won the 14.5 points they needed to win the United States.
US star Phil Mickelson, who struggled for most of the tournament, had his T-Hold plowed in the water at the par-3 16th hole and admitted his match to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golf player Molinari flashed in all his rounds and became one of the 1-of-4 players to ever go 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
U.S. Jordan Spieth was blown out 5&4 by the lowest - ranking player on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The player with the world's highest rank, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to land Poulter from England who might have played in his final Ryder cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, has become the tournament's European winner of all times with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It was a rough year.
So grateful to Thomas who chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to get the cup back.
It's about the team and I'm glad I could help," said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He handed the torch to his compatriot John Ram, who had won US golfing Tiger Woods 2&1 in single game.
The incredible pride I feel, to conquer Tiger Woods, I grew up and looked at that guy," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 career Ryder Cup record.
A strange statistics by one of the biggest players of all time and he won 14 big titles second to just Jack Nicklaus.
Spain had difficulty finding the field all weekend, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who played high-caliber golf throughout the tournament.
US captain Jim Furich spoke after a disappointing performance on behalf of his team: "I'm proud of these guys.
There was time this morning when we put some heat on Europe.
We deleted.
Guard against Thomas.
He's a wonderful captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we'll move forward.
I love these 12 guys, and I am proud to serve as their captain.
Keep your hat slanted.
We're superior."
