Obama receives Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not very friendly.
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and about Tehran's destabilising measures in the Middle East.
The meeting should also include the conflict with the Palestinians and the two-state solution discussed.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been exciting for years.
Washington criticises Israel's ongoing settlement building and accuses Netanyahu of lack of will in the peace process.
Through the deal advertised by Obama for the Iranian nuclear program, the relationship between the two continued to deteriorate.
In March, at the invitation of the Republicans, Netanyahu gave a controversial speech to the U.S. Congress, which was partly considered an affront against Obama.
The speech had not been agreed with Obama, but a meeting had rejected him with reference to the election in Israel that was about to take place.
In an emergency call, Professor admits to have shot his girlfriend
In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb told the police with a somewhat shaky voice that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house.
Lamb was important to emphasize that his "sweet dog" was still alive and probably excited, and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone.
Within the house, the officials found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note that was critched on a white block: "I'm so sorry, I wanted to reverse it, I loved Amy and she was the only woman who ever loved me". According to the authorities, this was in the letter, and he was signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds where, according to the police, he shot and killed a popular music professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said that university staff heard the shooting at 10:18.
He said Lamb made the devastating emergency call someday after that.
Until the end of the day, there was another death: Lamb took his life when the police clasped him.
One day after the shooting at the university, which forced students and teachers to hide behind closed doors, the authorities are still trying to get a picture of what motivated lamb.
The details published by the investigators at both ends of the state, as well as what students and employees who knew him said, helped to draw an image of a talented but possibly difficult teacher.
Students said they were looking forward to his teaching.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or a criminal history.
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him, in which he mentioned the "wonderful people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, whose teaching bodies comprised 17 members, and many students attended courses of both.
At the same time, there were some tendencies about problematic behaviors.
A student, Brandon Beavers, who praised Lamb, said that he also seemed a little excited and nervous, "as if something were wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb had told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for a health leave and said that he had some health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university's employment policy meant that the doctorate, for which Lamb had worked so hard, would not guarantee him an automatic way to become an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr. Lamb's idea."
These are questions that Lamb can no longer answer.
After the flight from the campus, the police later found Lambs Spur when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38 caliber gun in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parent house on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson.
His car was still in the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, but Johnson said she believed he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started his work at the university in 2009, which has 3,500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and education.
He received his doctorate in pedagogy in spring.
One of the longtime friends of Lambs called him intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her the guitar game for a few years.
He was the woman's swarm at the time.
All the girls melted there when he was there," said Hairston, now 40 and living in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously together for some time.
In the emergency call Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there was no certificate of a marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in the brick house adjacent to a Bayou in Gautier.
The police said the dog was okay.
The ex-husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said that they had been divorced 15 years ago, but had remained friends and had a daughter who was now 19 years old.
"She was totally destroyed on the ground," said O'Steen about his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he had heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both appeared on a summer fair three years ago.
Later they played some gig together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked online for various companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a weakly illuminated bar near Gautier, said that he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night at night 5 September for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmonica play in front of a sparse audience.
There were no signs that something was wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were cleaning up and joked each other.
I mean, they both had a good sense of joke.
Schmidt, the dead professor, led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American natives and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his Brotherhood and the Student Committee.
On the Delta State Campus in Cleveland, some 900 people attended a candlelight commemorative celebration on Tuesday evening, including lecturers, staff, students and members of the community.
Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the Mahnwacht, while the university choir "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace" sang.
The lessons will be resumed on Wednesday.
"We're trying to move our students to return," said LaForge.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press Authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story was corrected to reflect that the police are now saying that Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt, and that in his emergency call, Lamb called Prentiss as his wife, but there is no indication that the two have ever married.
Toys R Us plans to recruit less workers for Christmas time
Toys R Us says it won't hire as many Christmas season employees as last year, but the toy and baby product dealer says he will give the currently employed employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company said it was planning to recruit 40,000 people in stores and sales centers throughout the country. In the 2014 Christmas season, 45,000 workers were still employed.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said that it will start this month with interviewing and the number of employees will rise from October to December.
While the holidays are still months away, Christmas business is approaching, and companies are preparing to stop time workers to provide stores with employees selling, shipping and delivery products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a great moment for Michael J. Fox.
She was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We sat in the theater waiting for the Royals, and I notice that the seat next to me is empty, and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me," he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary "Back in Time".
The film starts, and it comes to my mind that I am a simulated yawning and an arm's length away from being with the princess of Wales on a date.
"Back in Time", a documentary about "Back to the Future", presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" premiered 30 years ago.
"It's really for me," Spielberg said, "indisputably the biggest time travel film ever filmed."
"Back in Time" will be shown on VOD, DVD and selected cinemas in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon says his response to Russia's increased military support for Syria is: "There is no military solution" of the nearly five years of conflict, and more weapons will only worsen violence and misery for millions of people.
The UN Chief once again calls on all parties, including the shared UN Security Council, to unite and support integrative negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told a press conference on Wednesday that he was planning to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA, Russia, China, Great Britain and France - at the edge of the ministerial meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and regional powers "make this situation insoluble."
Ban urged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran.
8 polls showing that Donald Trump is to be taken seriously.
Some have tried to brand him as a flop.
Others took him as a joke.
And some are waiting for a collapse.
But no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump down from the upper ranks in surveys, it has (yet) not worked.
Ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Trump leading in the double-digit area, and some start to ask seriously what it means for the chances of nomination of the real estate mogul.
Of course, it is still too early in the election period.
No one claims that Trump will probably win the Republican nomination.
Experts emphasize that Rick Perry's leadership was handed over to the ascending Herman Cain at that time in 2011, none of whom won only one state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general choice.
But outside groups like Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognize Trump's endurance and begin to let their dollars flow to crash it.
Here are some current polls that indicate that the real estate mogul is not just a temporary phase:
Trump's popularity values have turned around 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University survey showed that only two out of ten Republicans saw the real estate Mogul positively.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
And these figures are held in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as candidates.
In a survey by CNN/ORC last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" if Trump were nominated.
Only two out of ten say they'd be "angred" if he were the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates about the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they are "enthusiastic" vs. 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
The next one about enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say that they would be "unsatisfied" or "angred" if Jeb Bush, the favorite of establishment, would be the candidate.
A majority of Republicans don't see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticised for his bombastic and insulting statements, 52 percent of Irish voters who tend to be Republicans believe that the real estate Mogul has the right temperament for a president, says ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
The same number applies in the nation's first election state, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality for a chief commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Nevertheless, 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to carry out his duties effectively, and nearly six out of 10 independent people say that his temperament does not fit into the White House, says ABC/Post.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When they put on their scholarly hat, Republican voters think Trump is real.
If they are asked who most likely wins the GOP nomination, after a survey by CNN/ORC last week, four out of ten say Trump is the best bet.
This is a change since the date four out of ten put their money on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Complete disclosure: GOP voters did not have the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At that time in the last cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry would win the nomination compared to just 28% for the final candidate Mitt Romney.
Nevertheless, it appears that a variety of GOP voters consider Trump's campaign to be plausible.
Even if the Republicans gathered around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to Trump's leadership, while anti-Trump support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates.
But a survey of the Monmouth University at the beginning of September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump reaps majority support.
He has 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina, before Marco Rubio 14 points, before Walker 15 points, before Jeb Bush 19 points and finally in front of Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points.
It's a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to beat him?
Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race.
A small majority of Donald Trump fans say they have formed their opinion.
A new poll by CBS/NYT on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters who support Trump say they have given their votes firmly.
Of course, much can happen to change that, and no one can really say never to change their mind.
46 percent said they left the door open to switch to other candidates.
Nevertheless, Trump's strongest competition is at the moment of the other outsiders, the neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say that they have formed their opinion are twice as common to Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump, in his election speech two months ago, called immigrants from Mexico "rapists", immigration was a turning point in the public discourse about 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's bombastic expression will keep hispanic Americans away from the Republican Party and damage the reorientation efforts.
But after the new ABC/Post survey of Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump seems to be doing it.
Frustration over the government climbs to new peaks.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now account for about half of the support of Republican voters, especially through their outsider status.
Six out of 10 Republicans say in ABC/Post's new Monday survey that they want a political outsider rather than someone with government experience.
And they're also angry at Washington.
A survey by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago showed that three out of four Iowa Republicans were frustrated by the Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent "unsatisfied" and 21 percent "nothing."
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residential areas of Germany
Here in the Hobookenweg there is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea Watt.
In the street a square meter of a canopy house costs an average of 73,300 euros.
"The offer of objects is naturally limited to Sylt," says the study - therefore the high price.
A new study shows which special locations cost a square metre the most.
Of course, 18.70 euros per square meter for a student shop in Munich are not really little.
Unlike Germany's top living places, however, the price seems like Peanuts.
The real estate service provider Engel & Völkers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meter prices in dizzying heights.
There are several tens of thousands of euros - per square metre, well-marked.
But good, who can afford it...
By the way: Munich is not at the top here for the time being.
Champions League: Bavaria Dream Start Thanks to Müller and Götze
Two-way goalkeepers in Piraeus: Bavaria-Star Thomas Müller just has a run.
A happy hit by Thomas Müller paved the way for FC Bayern to a deserved 3:0 at Olympiakos Piraeus - then it ran.
A sovereign start of the Champions League season.
The world champions Thomas Müller and Mario Götze gave the FC Bayern a dream start in the "Mission Milan" in the witch boiler of Piraeus.
The team of coach Pep Guardiola won their opening match in the Champions League with the Greek record champion Olympiakos in a hot atmosphere thanks to Müller's double pack (52.90.+2) and Götzes's match (89.) earned at 3:0 (0:0).
The twelfth start in series is to be the first step towards finale on 28 May 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola finally wants to get the Henkelpott to Munich in the third run.
At his 28th match in the Champions League, Müller received a fine hand with the help of Olympiako's torwart Roberto, who had a shot by the world champion as a flank.
"We will not underestimate them," Bayern captain Philipp Lahm had promised before the game in the Karaiskakis stadium before 31,688 hot-blooded fans - and the Munichers kept their word.
They showed a concentrated and committed idea without shining.
Piraeus won his most recent six home matches in the King's Class, including against well-known clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid or Juventus Turin.
Borussia Dortmund (1:3) was also stumbled here in 2011.
But the Bavaria, undefeated in seven Eurocup duels with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They were courageous, but often too inconvenient to work in their offensive efforts.
The attacks were too often launched by game shift on left-wing Douglas Costa, who rarely came through against the former Braunschweiger Omar Elabdellaoui.
Müller had more luck from the right than his flank from the right half field in the top left tore.
In the 67th minute, the world champion gave the possible 2:0.
Robert Lewandowski had the best opportunities in half one.
First, when Olympiakos storm Ideye Brown hit the headball of Poland from the line (26.).
Then by direct acceptance, the goalkeeper Roberto paired with the knee (35.).
Although the Bayern used to pick up their dominant game, Piraeus was able to put needlesticks.
But at goalkeeper Manuel Neuer was left.
For example, when he led a shot of ideye over the latte (56.).
In front of the new, Guardiola had a four-chained chain with David Alaba in the center next to Jerome Boateng, which made it good.
Mario Götze, after muscle problems back in the cadre, was sitting outside at first.
The World Cup hero had only given green light after the graduation training, sports director Matthias Sammer said at "Sky": "Whoever wants to make something else out of it is evil."
At the first change, Guardiola also decided against him when he brought Kingsley Coman for Lewandowski (59).
Götze came late for Arturo Vidal (76.) and made everything clear 13 minutes later, per cumeter Müller put another on it.
Before the game, there had been scratches in the stadium.
After a smaller group of partially disguised Bayern fans in their spectator block apparently provoked the followers of host Piraeus with words and gestures, the security forces intervened and took action against the Munich trailers with batons.
At least a Bayern fan was transported out of the stadium injured.
Smoking has a higher risk of losing teeth
Those who smoke harm not only the lungs, but also the teeth - this suggests a Potsdam long-term study.
The good news: In case of renunciation, the risk decreases quickly.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is reflected in the long-term study of an international research team, including several employees of the German Institute for Nutritional Research (DifE) in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smokers, smokers were at risk of losing their teeth early in order to increase the 2.5 to 3.6 times.
The scientists had observed more than 23,300 participants.
The main causes of tooth failure are caries and inflammation of the gum, emphasizes the DifE.
For this periodontitis smoking is a risk factor, the authors emphasize.
The relationship between smoking and tooth loss is therefore due to more frequent gum inflammation in smokers.
It is not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk for caries.
However, people who quit smoking could reduce their risk within a short time, the researchers write in the "Journal of Dental Research".
However, it may take more than ten years for the threat to fall back to the level of non-smoking, explained first author Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham.
One has to convince people to become non-smokers, said study director Heiner Boeing from the DIfE: "Smoking shortens the lifetime."
Not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and, according to our findings, also leads to good dental health up to old age.
In Germany more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 are affected by toothlessness, the DifE reported.
Previous studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth failure.
The new long-term study supports the findings.
Archaeologists find remains from the late antiquities in Cologneer Rheinufer
Archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the time being.
Near the construction site for the new Rheinboulevard, archaeologists from the Roman-German Museum have dug skeletons and remains of historical buildings, said museum manager Marcus Trier on Tuesday.
Since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine, historians have been looking for so-called ground monuments.
In all construction projects in the district of Cologne, the museum is always added as an archeological monument care department.
The archaeologists were now found in the third section of the Rheinboulevard.
Trier explained from textual documents that there was a fortress in the place of the 4th century and a church in the 8th century.
In addition to remains of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with about 350 graves was discovered, which probably belonged to the church.
Young woman captured from freight train
After a young woman has failed at the station in Geilenkirchen-Lindern, the Federal Police are asking for assistance from the population.
On the early Wednesday morning around 1.40 a.m., the woman crossed the tracks from the station building at the end of the platform and was captured by a freight train coming from the direction of Mönchengladbach.
By recording the train, according to the Federal Police, it suffered serious injuries.
She was treated for emergency medical purposes on the spot and taken to a hospital by rescue workers.
There is no evidence of the reason for the nightly crossing of the young woman.
The incident may have been observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic perceptions.
There are residents or passersby from Linderner Bahn, Ziegelbäckerweg, Thomashofstraße and Leiffarther Straße (L364).
Information about the cause of the accident can be provided under 24 hours and free hotline of the Federal Police under phone 0800/6888000 or any other police station.
EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over TTIP
The EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system in order to alleviate the dispute over the planned TTIP Transatlantic Free Trade Agreement.
The disputed private conciliation bodies for disputes between corporations and states are therefore to be replaced by a more transparent system, which in its functioning corresponds to much more traditional courts.
"We want to set up a system to which the citizens trust," said the responsible EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström at the presentation.
The Swedish woman is planning to bring the proposal into the free trade talks with the USA as a European negotiating position.
The German government announced its support.
TTIP will create the largest free trade area in the world with 800 million people.
The plans for reforming the current arbitration procedures specifically provide that the EU and the US jointly select independent judges for a new investment court.
They are intended to come equally from the EU, the USA and third countries.
For the first time, a second instance is foreseen.
It would allow it to object to judgments.
So far, the parties to the proceedings have agreed between themselves on arbitrators, and there has not been a possibility of opposition to their judgments.
In the discussion over the past few months, it has become clear that citizens did not trust the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice, said Malmström.
In the long term, it intends to work at an International Investment Court, according to its own information.
For example, disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could be resolved there.
The main reasons for the strong resistance in Europe against TTIP are the investor-state-schattering procedures (ISDS) required by large corporations in particular.
The traditional arbitration courts are criticised by opponents as a kind of parallel justice that allows companies to contest damages to taxpayers, eliminate national laws or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards.
In first opinions, anti-TTIP organisations such as Campact considered the EU Commission's proposals insufficient.
It was above all criticized that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (Ceta).
On the other hand, the German State Secretary Matthias Machnig (SPD) described the plans as great progress.
The Commission took into account in the reform essential points drawn up by Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel in spring with other EU trade ministers.
The old system of private arbitration courts is from the table.
The French government also welcomed the plans of Malmström.
The European Business Europe Association warned against restricting the scope for action of the economy through too many new rules.
Small and medium-sized enterprises could be disadvantaged, it said.
When the discussions on the TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) can be concluded, it remained unclear on Wednesday.
Negotiations have been under way since mid-2013.
However, the issue of investor protection has not been discussed with the USA.
Originally, a framework for the agreement should already be in place at the end of this year.
This date shall be deemed to be non-sustainable.
Delicate folk by Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
Eleven years ago, Sufjan Stevens sat on stage at the Cologne Prime Club (today: Luxor).
Next to him is a flipchart on which the shy folk singer recorded the picturesque US state of Michigan with felt pen.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost taken by Steven's lecture.
He tells from various places that he repeatedly records on the map, about which his minute and delicately arranged songs report.
Where they came from and what it looks like there, in his home country.
Since then Stevens has proved to be a wonderfully creative fool.
With the third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State" released in 2003, these songs appear cleverly composed, which can be harmoniously close to American folks of the late 60s, but at any time to the great opulent drift.
The rumor arises that "Michigan" would be the first part of a far-reaching series: each of the 50 states of the United States should be sung in succession.
But already in 2004 and near the Rhine, "Seven Swans" has already appeared and breaks certain expectations.
Reduced performance of Stevens.
He's live enough guitar and banjo.
A year later, the musician living in New York returns to the show.
With "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinoise") a widely celebrated masterpiece will be released in 2005.
Overboarding ideas and stylistic finesse.
The album goes into the American Billboard Charts and is not missing in any year's best list of influential music media.
After extremely productive experiments Stevens then uses "The Age of Adz" (2010) very extensive electronic offset pieces.
This sixth orderly studio album is still widely orchestrated, but worn by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and hall.
A long way from the smaller clubs, the stage shows here become the colorful spectacle of neon-headbands and large fluorescent stage decoration.
Sufjan Stevens is currently touring Germany as part of a five-member band.
In the darkly kept lake of Hamburg!
He mainly presents the "Carrie & Lowell" available since March.
Although nearly 2,000 guests are now in their seats here, Stevens has become more mature and returns to the intimacy and the folks.
Without a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians plays through the widely enriched album.
From the audience one hears: The lecture is more "opulent" and one can thereby throw away the "platte basically".
Only to add to it will Steven's modest thanks, acoustically plays few older songs and finally bows down with a ton of applause.
Jeremy Corbyn's debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn's debut has been eagerly awaited at the Prime Minister's Question Time
The new Labour President Jeremy Corbyn is supposed to make his debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time and make his debut with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr. Corbyn will speak up to ask the first of his six predetermined questions shortly after noon, where his performance is likely to be tested by the media and the Labour delegates from nearby.
He demanded "less theatre and more facts" at this weekly event.
He also said that he could skip some meetings to leave them with colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary exam for Mr. Corbyn's leadership, because after his appointment she will be a member of the Shadow Cabinet and after his speech at the TUC Annual Meeting on Tuesday.
In the meantime, the decision of the Labour President, during the singing of the national anthem during a commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in Stillness, has provoked criticism of a number of Tory MPs and is at the centre of several front-page stories in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
A spokesperson from Mr. Corbyn said he had "standed in respectful silence" and he recognized the "hero of the Royal Air Force in the air battle around England".
But a member of Mr. Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two Newsnight program that he had advised the Labour chairman to sing the national anthem "independently" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Almost a dozen of Shadow Ministers have refused to serve in Mr. Corbyn's top team, calling for differences in the economy, defence and foreign policy, while less than a sixth of the Parliamentary Party originally supported him as a leader.
The political correspondent of the BBC Robin Brant says that political differences also "crowd" within Labour, according to Mr. Corbyn's statements on the position of the European Union and the limit on profits.
Mr. Corbyn told the TUC conference that Labour was making changes to remove the whole idea of a total limitation.
Hours later, Mr Smith, the shadow-work and pension minister, said that the party was "very clear" that it was only against government plans to reduce the limit of £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour President to face David Cameron, who has been Tory Chief for the past decade over the Dispatch Box in Parliament.
The Labour President, who has promised a different policy approach, says that he has "crowd-sourced" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and has given him more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP has said that the Prime Minister's question hour is too confrontational, and that he will not be able to "slaught" and fight with recklessness and has undertaken to focus on serious problems such as poverty, inequality and the challenges for young people.
Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the shadow of economic minister, would represent him if he did not participate - for example, when Mr Cameron is on his way abroad.
He also raised the idea that other colleagues would occasionally take the floor, and that he had addressed John Bercow, the spokesperson of the House of Commons, to discuss the problem.
When he became a leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a "Kasperle theater", which is often associated with the Prime Minister's question hour, but a few years later he admitted that he had failed in it.
Since it was first broadcast on television in 1990, Question Time with the Prime Minister was regarded as the most important barometer of a leader's judgment and leadership in the House of Commons and his position among his colleagues, although critics argued that it had become a cartoon and needed far-reaching reforms.
'Gössen in Joburg': homeless young people trained as photographers
The city center of Johannesburg is a tough place if you are homeless.
But a group of former street children have found a way to learn a skill and thus earn a living.
"I was shot in Joburg" (I was shot in Joburg) is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless young people how to take photos of their surroundings and gain a profit from it.
BBC News has met one of the first graduates of the project.

Pounds rise due to accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
In parallel, FTSE 100 was increased by the SABMiller bid target, according to data showing an increase in UK wage growth.
Between May and July, earnings without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.9% compared with the same period of the previous year.
This percentage has been the fastest since 2009 and has been making estimates of the time of an increase in interest rates.
The pound rose by more than 1% compared to the dollar to $1,5505 and was raised to 0,84% compared to the euro to €1,3730.
The FTSE 100 Index closed with an increase of 1.49% to 6.229.21.
SABMiller was the outstanding share on the market and made a 20% jump after the takeover offer of Rival AB InBev had received.
A transaction would combine the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher after encouraging news from the Competition Group for Luxury Goods Richemont.
Richemont's latest sales figures hit all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Burberry - are again showing growth.
Glencore's shares increased by 5% after the mining giant said that he had taken $2.5 billion by selling shares as part of his debt reduction strategy.
The shares of the packaging and paper group Mondi were the biggest losers on the index, with a decrease of 4.3%, after Goldman Sachs had set his estimate for the company rating to "sold".
JD Sports increased by 3.1% after the sports clothing company reported a pre-tax profit of 46.6 million for the half-year.
The boss of JD Sports says that higher wages endanger the expansion.
The Managing Director of JD Sports Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum wage for UK employees could mean "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers".
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will offset the higher labour costs of his company, he says.
The costs could meet the expansion plans of JD Sports, he added, and this could mean that there are fewer additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital: On Bieber expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
Running 21 years old, a hemp with a fancy hair.
The guy with the platinum-blonde hair is 100 million euros heavy.
More than that.
Monsieur Bieber is currently in Berlin.
And the generation U17 is going through.
Like Wiktoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name "Ritz Carlton".
Not bad.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
Among them Ewa and Viktoria from Poland.
Since 7:00 in the morning, however, the Polin has been sitting on the cold stone plates of the Berlin luxury hotel at Potsdamer Platz.
The Bieber-Building: Here you live idol whose poster hangs in Stettin, since Monday night.
The suite in which the Canadian singer lives costs just as much a day as her mom Ewa earns in half a year.
If at all.
She says, "In fact, my Wiktoria would have to sit in the tenth grade in the gymnasium."
"I'm fulfilling her a dream."
Obligation?
Who's itching?
The fans don't.
Not even Bieber himself.
He took care of it anyway.
For the advertising in the commercial break of the superbowl he cashed three million, a two-year deal with an anti-pickel company washed many, many dollars on the beaver account.
And with every doll that looks like it and goes over the counter, Bieber also cashes.
When Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, one surprises at the window pane.
More than 100 million are said to have been so exploited.
Some say the hype goes too far.
Others emphasize that Bieber is finally in the USA and Great Britain with his new single "What do you mean?" in place 1.
Bieber himself, whose fourth album will follow in November, is not interested in the many zeros at first.
At least he does.
Pegida Plakat brings Lebanese on potato-done Idea
Potatoes or donners?
It's both going to be in the potato dune, which Oldenburger snack owner Hani Alhay developed.
Inspired by the saying "potato rather than doner" on a poster of the Pegida movement, Alhay put potato and meat together on a spear.
On the idea, a poster brought him to a pegida demonstration with the inscription "Cartoffeln rather than Doner", which he had happened to see on television.
Since then, in his shop, there has been a barbeque filled with meat and potatoes.
"This is multikulti for the stomach," says Alhay.
The idea has now been registered with the Patent Office in Munich.
According to the Authority, it has recently been protected as a utility model.
Therefore, Alhay does not want to betray the amount of meat and the amount of potatoes the spout contains.
Only so much: "It tastes even better together," he finds.
The culinary understanding of the people is also well received by its customers.
Metcash launches ground resistance campaign to combat Aldi invasion
Metcash tries to protect the IGA branches from an Aldi march in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food retailer Metcash has launched a ground-standing campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run-up to a $700 million Aldi invasion.
While Aldi is preparing for the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and build the IGA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing through social media, as well as through events such as Adelaide show.
IGA dealers and suppliers jump aboard, with brands such as ice cream manufacturer Simmo from Dunsborough, who distributes samples in IGA stores and shop owners selling discounted tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers.
It is expected that Metcash will publish further details of its defence strategy on 29 September when the wholesaler for food, alcohol and appliances will conduct its annual investor strategy day.
It is at stake, as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Metcash's IGA retail stores and generate higher profit margins than Metcash's IGA network in the Eastern states.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notary provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the Eastern states.
However, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that 12 months after the opening of its first markets, Aldi will take away around five percent of the food market in these two countries and will take away sales from all existing actors, but mainly leading retailers.
According to a report published this week, Morgan Stanley's analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million per year and Metcash lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that next year Aldi will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA and generate sales of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss in food and food business and in the quantities on Metcash's high fixed cost base could cost Metcash about $13 million before interest and taxes, said Mr. Kierath.
At the same time, Metcash loses market shares in the Eastern states, mainly Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley assumes that Metcash's sales in the food and food business will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and will reduce the market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, the leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of the Magellan Financial Group, told at a business dinner in Melbourne that Metcash would probably disappear within a decade. Metcash would disappear.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to Mr Douglas's comments.
But it is expected that a member of Metcash's board has contacted Mr Douglas's last week.
Since 2010, IGA's market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent, and revenue from Metcash's food and food trade, which supplies approximately 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting operating debt reduction at the same time pressure on sales and margins.
However, the wholesaler resists and invests more than $150 million in order to align sales prices with Coles and Woolworths with hundreds of products each week and improve IGA retailers in improving their stores through faster-growing fresh foods and providing a better choice of private label foods.
Metcash's Chief Executive Officer Ian Morrice says that the price adjustments and shop refurbishment programs will increase to Elan and hopes that the wholesaler will return to profit growth for the first time in four years in 2017.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more praise than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damage" in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and, according to the president of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy, deserves more praise than criticism for his own behavior.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo, which is repeatedly referred to as "Special Ks", was hit by the infamous confrontation of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fiery qualification game in Cincinnati soon thereafter, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the arbitrator, with Harrison crying out: "Wawrinka should have beat Kyrgios, and I should beat the child."
While he was last seen smashing a tennis racket, after a seizure was defeating a potential U.S. open victory by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was steadfastly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, in competition with Sam Groth for second place in single behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semifinals against Great Britain.
"What I'm quite jealous about is the fact that, in my opinion, Thanasi was pulled a little into the dispute," said Healy.
He broke a racket when he lost to the U.S. Open because of a seizure, but he's not the first player to break a beater out of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know he's not proud of it.
But, really, he has behaved extremely well in the US open, even under the fairly provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of recognition.
He's got a great team around him, he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little too strict.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits into the team and so on, he has never had a problem with the other players, he is respected in the changing area, he is training hard, he is good in shape, he is a very stable and mature young guy, and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision not to take Kyrgios into account in the important preliminary ruling that begins on Friday, and he describes the "joint decision" as the right thing for everyone, but he assures the Canberra man to return to the team as a long-term solid part."
"First of all, we want the team to focus completely on the competition and not on all the controversy all around [Kyrgios]," said Healy.
And I believe that Nick made the climb very quickly, which people like Federer and Murray pointed out. He rises in the public's eyes, and he made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we try to support him, we try to make him understand the consequences of his action. Some time outside the spotlight in which he can only think about it, I think I'm appropriate, and it's best for the team and it's the best for him.
Europe's refugee crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes the border, restrains refugees
Hungary declared the emergency and locked the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held everyone trying to enter the country illegally, all with the aim of stopping the influx of migrants.
Chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in a no-one's country and responded with outrage to Serbian officials.
The people who had fled from violence were stuck in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there for an unknown time.
But frustrations increased.
When a police helicopter floated over them, the migrants scanned "Open the border!" and shouted insults against the Hungarian standby police.
Some rejected food and water out of protest.
Serbia's Foreign Minister stated that it was "unacceptable" to send migrants back from Hungary, while more and more arrived from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not a collateral damage.
Talks with Brussels and other countries must be held in the coming days," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The turbulences at the Hungarian-Serbian border could not agree on a common immigration policy one day after the 28-nation block at a disputed meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed, however, to share the responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in Italy and Greece, and expressed their hope that an agreement would finally be reached - next month or until the end of the year - that the EU countries would take up another 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special European Union summit on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent.
However, Hungary did not base its hopes on an early action by Brussels or its neighbours.
The emergency in two southern regions announced on Tuesday gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis so that they could block roads and speed up asylum procedures.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szyjarto said that his country also planned the construction of a barbed wire fence along his border with Romania to stop the influx of migrants through the country - after it ended a fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison inmates were used in the race to create the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a significant bottleneck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and a point of entry into the European Union.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban insisted that most of the incoming economic refugees are in search of a better life, and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is very much in conflict with other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force in Hungary at midnight, make crossing the border or damaging the 4-metre (13 feet) high fence built by the government along the southern border to Serbia a crime. These laws also establish higher prison sentences for convicted traffickers.
"Because of the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government explains the state of emergency," said government spokesperson Zoltan Kovac's reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We say it very clearly: Illegal crossing is a crime.
Parliament still has to agree to the use of the military, which is expected for next week, but Associated Press reporters have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border for days.
Gyorgy Bacondi, State Security Advisor for Orban, said that authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border, 15 others had already penetrated the country deeper.
They come over by damaging the fence, they are now in police custody and are accused of committing crimes under the new laws.
Authorities are in the process of quickly repairing the fence.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train wagon with barbed wire to close the borders had arrived.
Chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and pressed a crowd into it.
About 20 managed to get in, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main motorway link between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead ahead of Bernie Sanders halved in national survey
Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the democratic race for nomination at national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins her on the ground.
Clinton now supports 47 percent of the democratic voters in the elections (58 percent earlier), while Sanders is second, with 27 percent (up by 17 percent).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is candidate for the presidential office, receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the elections.
More than five months before the elections begin, most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is determined which candidates they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are more stable in their choice than those of the other candidates.
Since the CBS news survey Clinton has lost some of the demographic groups in a series, while Sanders has made some profits.
Clinton has a great advantage in women and moderates, but these advances have been reduced.
Their support for men has fallen significantly, and Sanders is only 5 points behind.
Clinton's advantage in democratic voters under 50 years of age has fled, and they and Sanders are now at the same level.
However, Clinton still has a big advantage for the older voters.
Last month, Clinton was in front of Sanders with two-digit advantage with the Liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point advantage in this group.
About half of the democratic voters of the national elections say that if they were nominated by the party, they would support Clinton with enthusiasm.
A quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support her because she is the candidate.
Six percent would not support them.
Maybe it's not surprising that Clinton's current supporters are especially enthusiastic about her.
The views are more mixed with those who currently do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would support them enthusiastically.
While 48 percent of the democratic voters say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm, fewer Republican voters say this about their top candidate Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton's supporters are asked in an open question why they want her to be the candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it is time for a woman to become president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton's supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Consent to dealing with the problems and the choice is also quoted.
As the vice-president casts a potential for the presidential office into the scale, 57 percent of the democratic voters of the elections want to see him in the race - although a third believes he shouldn't.
When democratic voters of the elections are asked who would be their second choice for the party, Biden is is at the top.
Of Clinton's followers, more than half say that Biden would be their second choice far from Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the nomination of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton's lead over Sanders, from 20 points to 30 points in the race without him in the race.
Fifty-five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election, but this number of 78 percent fell last month.
Biden is by far a second in this measurement, but the percentage that sees him as the most "selectable" has increased.
Nevertheless, when it comes to the question of what is more important for a candidate, democratic voters raise questions about the electability.
Similarly to last month, no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters is considered unacceptable.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates achieve good results on some important features in voters of their party's elections.
Majorities consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities.
Biden best cuts off with honesty among the three candidates, while Clinton's strength is the lead.
Thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say that about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent do not share his opinion.
Democratic voters generally also see Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically in line with their views.
With all these measurements, about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
Since questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal e-mail address and a server are still being asked as a foreign minister during the term of office, most democratic voters of the elections are satisfied with their declaration of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions overall.
But it's another story in the American public as a whole.
Half of the Americans are now dissatisfied with their statement, while only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion on this was split in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said that the e-mail controversy had no effect on Clinton's general opinion, although 36 percent said that her opinion had worsened.
It is mainly Republicans, more than six out of 10, who say that their views of Clinton have become worse.
Although Clinton is considered honest and trustworthy by the voters of her party, this continues to be a problem for them among registered voters overall: only 32 percent see them as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than in the last month and 15 points less since May.
62 percent of the electorate does not think that they are an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55 percent of the electorate view Trump as not honest and not trustworthy throughout the country.
Clinton and Trump, however, receive good grades during guided tours.
Of the six tested candidates, Biden, Carson and Bush are best cut off in honesty.
A majority view Sanders as honest, but as with Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 democratic voters in the elections is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson goes up close behind Donald Trump in a country-wide survey
Ben Carson is in the latest survey of CBS News/New York Times close behind Donald Trump
The two candidates now account for half of the voter support in the new survey, and others are losing dramatically.
Republican voters continue to support Trump in large numbers throughout the country. Support grew by 23% in the last CBS survey conducted before Fox News debate last month, by 27% in the Tuesday survey.
But Carson shot from 6% to 23% in the same period.
The survey also showed that Carson is well received by demographic groups and that Trump is outnumbered by Republican voters with higher education.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, has been beaten off with Wisconsin's Governor Scott Walker, who fell most deeply, from 10% support last month to 2% now.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee, and Florida Senator Marco Rubio, are in third place with 6%.
The margin of error for the sample of 376 people from Republican voters in this latest survey is Plus or minus 6% and was carried out in September.
The latest CNN/ORC survey published last week shows that Carson is rising in the polls - it lands at 19% support from Republicans, behind Trump with 32% support.
The latest survey of ABC News/Washington Post also showed Trump clearly in front of Carson.
In view of a carson rising last week, Trump found some side-lifts for the former neurosurgeon, even after Carson apologized for challenging Trump's faith.
"We need energy," said Trump last Saturday during a campaign appearance in Iowa.
Pleasant bathing temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm.
Even if peaks are measured only in a distance, a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for holidaymakers to find warm water.
A bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees.
Some do not go to the sea anymore: Maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic Sea this week, the German Weather Service (DWD) reports.
Bathing temperatures, on the other hand, continue to offer the Mediterranean: in the east, they even reach up to 29 degrees.
In the Adriatic it is at the top 25 degrees, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees.
Five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Baruch college newbie
Almost two years after a student died during a difficult ritual of a student relationship in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, five people are killed.
Members of the New York Baruch College Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an introduction ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital, which contributed to his death, told the police.
Officials said he had been loaded with a 30-pound backpack full of sand, and repeatedly attacked while he tried to go to a destination via a frozen field.
Mr. Deng finally complained about headaches, then he fell unconscious.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Deng fainted and supposedly waited an hour before they took him to a hospital, the police said.
However, they had the time to change Deng's clothes, to Google his symptoms, and to contact Andy Meng, the national president of the Brotherhood to seek advice, said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide utensils and put the good of the brotherhood over that of Michael Deng," said police chief Wagner.
He could not be revived, and the next morning he died of his injuries.
After an autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly injured with dull force in the head, torso and thighs.
"Too many families have been destroyed by the shocks of the Brotherhood. At least one student has been dying each year since 1970 from the Schikanes," said Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family in a statement.
Brotherhood and its members must be held accountable, and this step by authorities is very important.
A County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended a third grade murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two members of the Brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, are also charged with scandalous attacks and the formation of a criminal association.
"We do not only want to blame those involved, but if there is an organization that has sanctioned - officially or unofficially - this, we will also take these to account," said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College has banned the brotherhood, and the national brotherhood has withdrawn its membership with the local group.
This will happen when the Fed increases interest rates
An interest rate increase is coming, and the houses are going to waver, returns on bonds are going to rise, and the economy is going to slide into recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long it will take and how long it will last.
In particular, history provides little guidance for the economy.
A recession came within only 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often, if not always, a factor in how the economy and financial investments react.
Therefore, representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on when they begin to increase interest rates, but rather on the period needed for normalization.
In fact, several variables play a role.
In the end, however, market participants could conclude that the whole excitement may have been exaggerated due to an increase in interest rates.
"The first increase in the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the "cheap money" era," said Julian Jessop, Chief Economist at Capital Economics, in a communication to customers.
In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of the US interest rates to normal heights, but still too low to lead to the seismic shock that many seem to fear.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no effects.
Here is a historical view of how some areas of the economy could react:
As the market saw last month, the anticipation of interest rates can make things volatile for a while.
As soon as the increase occurs, the influence is not so dramatic.
"There seems to be a tendency for capital gains to be strangled 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy again," said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happens after interest increases of the Fed.
More precisely, in the past 35 years, the market has mostly been on the way to an increase in interest rates in the past 14 percent, rather flat in the 250 days after (average profit of 2.6 percent), then back to normal after 500 days, with an average yield in the past six past cycles of 14.4 percent according to a current analysis published by Bob Doll, Chief Investment Strategy at Nuveen Asset Management, at Barron's.
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tends to occur later in the increase cycle and the return begins to decrease.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but interest increases often promote them.
In the current case, the Fed is confronted with some conditions that did not exist before and which could accelerate a recession.
It is very remarkable that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point at an interest rate increase of the Fed.
According to Deutsche Bank, the 118 increases in interest rates since 1950 were only twice the nominal GDP below 4.5 percent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Interest rates on such a fragile economic setting could be risky and raised the question, "whether it's different this time," said Deutsche Bank.
Market participants have taken a year-round interest rate increase of the Fed, and all eyes were focused on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this meeting, the Futures trade only indicates a 25 percent probability.
"In our study, all the increase cycles from 1950 to today took place in a super cycle with an increasing momentum in GDP and put pre-recession heights in the shade very quickly after the start of recovery," the report says.
In contrast, this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase.
The current cycle is by far the longest that the Fed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and this is 74 months so far.
The fixed income was also volatile, as the market is forecasting an interest rate increase, and the pattern is quite similar to that on the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than on shares when they change their strategic price.
In the case of bonds, yields seem to change direction as soon as the first increase/reduction takes place in the cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, the loan returns fell immediately, said Deutsche Bank.
Charles Schwab's strategists believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to yields between longer and shorter bonds coming closer together and leading to a flattening of the curve.
High interest-rate bonds often bring better yields in such a climate, although "we are still careful to expect higher revenues," said Kathy Jones, fixed income analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.
It is interesting, says Jones, that the markets have already adapted to Fed's strategy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of stricter monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have increased, the yield curve is flatter, credit margins have widened and volatility has increased - all the characteristics of the market if the Fed strengthens its strategy.
On the whole, companies that handle the greater part of their business in the US will benefit if interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational high-indebted companies are getting worse, as a rising dollar is making their products more expensive on the global market and also financing their debts.
"The story shows that "quality" shares tend to respond very positively three months after an initial interest rate increase," said Goldman Sachs analysts in a customer report.
Companies with a strong balance sheet have exceeded, on average, 5 percentage points after each of the interest rates in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital returns and low volatility in their shares also exceeded their low-quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).
Debt will be a big problem.
Businesses with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose most, said Goldman.
Outside the pure stock games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savings could see profits through higher yields, even if experts differ in their opinion how fast this will take place.

BBC Radio 3 "changes" to Classic FM, claims a leading parliamentarian and increases new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something that private stations do not do.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC bosses that the public-law radio station was "stupid" and increasingly not to be distinguished from its commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word "fucking" - but it seems to be turning to Classic FM," he said.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards, which started last December.
The BBC Music Awards that started last year seem to be under a different name.
So, if you're trying to do something else -- these are two spontaneous examples where you're actually just imitating what's already on the market," said Mr. Bingham.
BBC General Director rejected the allegations and argued that BBC Radio 3 lies far ahead of his commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public education.
What I'm learning from Radio 3, I'm not going to learn about classical music anywhere else.
And there is a commitment to live music and music that is really unsurpassed.
"And finding the commitment of Radio 3, new music and commissioning new works, I really consider it important," he said.
At the beginning of this year, BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Davey argued that it had to work harder to get the audience involved than it did in the past, because the British are less informed about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production, which, during the hearing in the Committee on the Selection of Culture, Media and Sport, was under fire to face commercial rivals.
The Tory deputy Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the musical talent show of the BBC, purchased by Dutch producer Talpa Media at an estimated cost of £22 million.
Do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as judge - was produced "in special BBC way".
He added that he wanted the company to "find a hit from our own stable" next time a series of entertainment starts.
However, he refused to exclude the ordering of further series of The Voice in the future or to spend money on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales rose most slowly in August and Black Friday can be responsible for this
In the first three months of 2015, there was seven percent increase in online sales.
Last month, there was the lowest result since the start of the 2000 records.
Online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
Experts believe that Black Friday slowed down the issues in November
For over a decade, virtual shopping has boomed, and many of the UK's main shopping streets have turned into ghost cities.
However, experts say that there are now signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
Total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the 2000 records with only five percent increase compared to the previous year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the previous year's growth rates and go back to 2000, this has always developed over time," said Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMG sales index to the Guardian.
He explained that the online sales increased three years ago, when buyers began to make purchases with their mobile phones.
It meant that more people could shop online and that people could do so in different environments, e.g. at home on the sofa.
But now this is commuting, and we may experience that growth is decreasing.
The Black Friday phenomenon, imported from America, is cited as a reason for lower sales.
Experts believe that buyers hold back their purchases before this event, which takes place on the last Friday in November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers around their computers to make their bets, and some dealer websites crashed.
Experts believe that Black Friday, where buyers fought for bargains, could prevent buyers from making purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that a little more than £1 billion was spent on online by 5 pounds.
For some products such as TVs and washing machines, more than a third of the purchases are now made via web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inner cities.
Muslims bury the killed in Mecca in the crane accident - Bin Laden's family is sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims at the first funerals in Mecca through the streets
Saudi Arabia places the collapse in part of the huge Saudi bin-load group to the load
The Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were injured after the crane crashed
Hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane collapsed at Mecca’s great mosque.
Mourning filled, largely dressed in white, the route to pay their respects when the first of the dead entered their last journey to the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The mourning procession passed at the Holy Place, where only days earlier a crane of construction crashed through the ceiling of the mosque and then on the prayers.
The bodies were released for the funeral when the Saudi king imposed a sanction on the construction company of the Bin Laden family because of the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 betters killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Mosque of Mecca, were carried through the streets.
Among the dead were Qasim Akram of Bolton, Greater Manchester, father of four children who were on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed.
Mr. Akram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual Hadj in the Great Mosque.
Saudi officers have already pledged that the Hadj to Mecca will continue with thousands who will continue to come to the city.
Today, King Salman said that the Bin-Laden group should not have left the arm of the crane when it was not used.
An Arab version of the decree, published by the State Saudi Press Agency, said that the Bin-Laden Group is co-responsible for the collapse.
The news agency's language service did not report this detail, but said that the company's management was prohibited from travelling abroad.
At the beginning of this week Salman vowed to reveal what caused the fall of the crane, which plunged into an inner courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the Hadj that later this month.
The Bin-Laden Group did not issue any statements on the collapse of the cranes and its representatives were not available for an opinion.
The Royal Decree also blamed the group for not taking current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteorologists.
Dozens of cranes surround Mecca's large mosque as part of the massive construction project led by the Bin-Laden Group.
The Bin Laden family has been associated with Saudi Arabia's ruling family for decades and takes over larger construction projects.
The late leader of Al Qaida, Osama bin Laden, was an apostate son who was expropriated by the family in the 1990s.
The crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain, just a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage, which is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim.
Officials said 158 people were staying in the hospital.
Government representatives ordered 1 million Rial (£174,000) to be paid to the members of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured.
Other injured persons receive half of this amount.
B&Q Boss says that the time of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
British employ increasingly craftsmen, says Veronique Laury
The number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has increased
This leads to the opening of 200 more screwfix stores targeting craftsmen
At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B&Q sales outlets nationally
By Rupert Steiner, City Chief Correspondent of the Daily Mail
It is claimed that Britons deposit their hammers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen who carry out the work in their home.
If you can use a hammer or brush to paint walls, you seem to belong to a minority these days.
Because British people are increasingly employed by craftsmen to do homework jobs in their homes, says the head of the company behind B&Q.
Véronique Laury, new managing director of Kingfisher, who owns the DIY chain, said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe who have been offering low-price services has now been overtaken.
Therefore, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more screwfix shops, which are aimed at craftsmen and close 60 sales outlets of B&Q.
Mrs. Laury said she wanted to employ more women in B & Q stores, because eight out of ten purchase decisions in the store are made by women.
At the moment, the men prevail with the employees.
She said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households that are making more renovations than in the past.
Mrs. Laury said, "It still works a majority of men in our branches.
We need to shift this to a balance.
In principle, half of our customers are women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs. Laury, who is one of only five women at the top of a British leading company listed in the FTSE100 index, has also restructured her top team to reflect a similar number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has exactly 50 percent of the team occupied with women, including its management and CFO.
Mrs. Laury said, "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board.
Kingfisher reported a decline in half-yearly profits and revenues after the group had shuddered the cost of closing the shops.
Because of the trend, Kingfisher, who has screwfix and B&Q, will open 200 new branches.
Officers of Aich/Dob for Infidelity in court
On Wednesday, at the Landesgericht Klagenfurt, two officials of the Austrian volleyball vice-master Aich/Dob had to answer for infidelity and tax evasion.
The defendants did not confess guilty.
One of them had also been charged with abuse of office.
He was legally acquitted of this accusation in May.
The current process has been postponed.
According to Chief Prosecutor Robert Riffel, in the preliminary investigation, it had been crystallized that the defendants used funds from club accounts that they were allowed to deposit in their functions for private purposes in the years 2006 to 2011.
The damage is estimated at around 400,000 euros.
The sports officials are also charged with financial crimes.
This is the fact that the chairman of the Schöfensenat, Judge Michaela Sanin, resigned.
It will be negotiated at a later date.
In order to reject the infidelity, the defence stated that the association had at no time created a disadvantage of wealth.
The sports officials would only have paid compensation for their expenses and put out of debt the sports club for which they worked from 1982 to 2011 and in which they invested a lot of time and money - the liabilities amounted to around 600,000 Schilling in 2001 (about 44,000 euros).
"At that time we were faced with the situation: Do we continue the club or do we lock it up?", one of the accused, in the bread profession, told large company auditors of the financial office.
He then decided to take on this task with his colleagues and fellow defendants.
With all the risks.
"We've advanceed money, deposited our life insurance as a security with the bank," he said at the time of the agreement.
The association has been agreed: you can manage the money freely, there can only be no debt.
In addition, the payment of compensation was decided retroactively until 1991, with financial success.
Therefore, some of the expenses incurred had not been paid out until years later, namely from 2003, when a plus had been on the account.
Therefore, both package and non-detail debits appeared, the former Obmann explained the transactions.
The accounts and savings books managed the two defendants together, said the second defendant.
The judge asked why the payments had not been made to the club in detail.
The association had not been interested in the details of the financial event, that only the freedom of debt was important, the answer said.
When a functional investigation for abuse of office began in 2011, an amount of EUR 120,000 was transferred to the club account.
The defendants explained that this had been a setback.
This security account ran on the name of the second defendant and was not known to the association according to his statement.
"Why?" the judge wanted to know.
For a long time, the respondent knew no answer.
Then he finally said that he believed that this was the best thing for the club.
If anything had happened to him, no one would have known anything about this money, the prosecutor put it in the room.
The defendant had been informed, the officer justified himself.
This transfer was formulated as a "damage compensation".
Why compensation for damages?, Judge and Public Prosecutor wanted to know.
The first accused said that he did not agree to this formulation because the association had never suffered any harm.
But what should I do when the lawyer says, "With this you're all out of the tailor."
"Am I a legal representative?" he asked.
In addition, the officer said he had never paid a cent, he only charged miles of money and diets.
At diets he charged the club 1,000 euros per month, but the actual effort was much higher, he added.
The defendants were unable to provide accurate documents for the early years.
These had no longer been kept after an operating test, in which everything had been judged to be correct, they explained.
The second defendant was also charged with kilometre money.
All settlements had to be made in cash, and he had to drive from his place of residence to the bank in Bleiburg, he explained in his statement.
The main proceedings will continue with the survey of witnesses on 23 September.
Hewlett-Packard clears another 30,000 jobs
In addition to the personnel reduction that has been underway for three years, the computer giant will reduce further jobs in the division of the company.
The bullets at the US-computer giant Hewlett-Packard (HP) will not end.
As part of its restructuring, the US Technology Group plans to reduce the number of jobs in its corporate customer sector from 25,000 to 30,000.
This is intended to reduce costs of 2.7 billion dollars (2.4 billion euros), the company announced on Tuesday.
The step would lead to a special burden of around 2.7 billion dollars, which would occur from the fourth quarter onwards.
The reduction of 55,000 jobs, which has been ongoing for three years, has not yet been completed.
At the end of the 2013/14 financial year, HP still employed around 302,000 people.
Later, the Hewlett Packard share fell to 2.3 percent.
The Group of printers from Palo Alto, California, is currently splitting up: this is how the computer and printer business is to be bundled into a new company this year - separate from the more future-looking areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services.
Both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange.
A re-disappointing PC sales and a weaker demand from corporate customers for its services have recently increased the world's second-largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo.
In the third quarter at the end of July, sales of PC and printers fell by 11.5 percent.
Sales fell 8 percent to just under 25.4 billion dollars.
As a result, revenues decreased in 15 out of 16 quarters.
HP responds with a split and massive dashes to change in the industry.
The 76-year-old company led by Meg Whitman only responded late that customers buy more smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and do more and more business online.
Whitman's restructuring plans provide a total of about 55,000 jobs.
Conflicts: majority support the anti-IS training mission
However, a direct involvement of German soldiers in military operations in Iraq would be largely opposed to rejection: 54 percent opposed, 35 percent agreed.
The fact that other states are flying air raids against ISIS in Iraq and Syria is positive for 61 percent.
24 percent are against intervention in the conflict.
A collaboration with the Syrian powerholder Bashar al-Assad rejects 51 percent of the respondents' opinion that 20 percent would be in favour.
29 percent could not decide.
Car: Second Press Day at the 66th IAA
The exhibition focuses on connected, self-driving cars and electric mobility until 27 September.
After two press days, Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Motor Show under the motto "Mobility Connects" on Thursday.
The general public can visit the IAA from Saturday.
The organizers of the VDA car association expect about 900 000 visitors two years ago.
Röszke: Violent outbreak at Serbian-Hungarian border
On the Serbian border with Röszke, the Hungarian police have used tear gas and waterthrowers against several hundred refugees.
Euronews correspondent Dániel Bozsik has experienced the outbreak of violence at the border control point.
He reported by phone:
A group of refugees broke the border.
A police line had formed behind it, and behind the police there was a waterthrower.
40 to 50 refugees began to throw stones, sticks and plastic bottles at the officials.
The officials initially used continuously pepper spray.
After that, the police used tear gas.
A lot of tear gas was sprayed in the direction of the refugees.
This disbanded the group.
The refugees are now awaiting a retreat.
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried out of the zone.
Children who had inhaled the tear gas screamed.
Other refugees collapsed and suffered from a lack of breath.
The Serbian police press spokespersons also suffered injuries due to the use of tear gas and pepper spray.
Time of decision on interest rates for the U.S. notes bank
The world observes when the U.S. notes bank meets on two days, Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision whether to raise interest for the first time in almost a decade or not.
A survey of 80 economists surveyed by Reuters found that a little more than half who still last week believed that the Fed would do this, now thinks that the Fed will last a little longer and keep the interest rates on the current level of 0 - 0.25 percent.
It's a historic event because it's been seven years since the Fed set interest on zero.
"For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normalizing interest rates," said Angel Ubide, senior employee at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is at a relatively good level of performance, trillions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy outlook on global conditions.
It has warned the markets to look forward to an increase, but the signs indicate that the chances against such a step are good.
The decision will be announced at 8 a.m. on Thursday
Death guards at Delta State University left apologies
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleagues later the day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that he was "pitying" at the first murder and wanted to "he could do it without shame," public authorities announced on Tuesday.
The police in Gautier, Mississippi, said that Lamb, lecturer for geography and social science education at Delta State University, called the emergency number around 10:00 on Monday morning
He said he shot someone and killed someone.
Lamb told the emergency center staff that the police had to send police to his home.
He said, "I shot my wife last night," and he also mentioned that a "sweet dog" is in the house, but he will not be "disturbed" but will probably be excited.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he didn't give him.
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots.
When police shot the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, which said, "I'm so sorry, I wanted to make it back.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me."
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before finally taking his own life on Monday evening when police surrounded him.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr. Lamb's idea."
Despite reports on Monday that Lamb supposedly believed that Prentiss also had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities said on Tuesday that there was "no information, no evidence" for a "triangle relationship".
Prentiss was described as a "good man" by Shawn O'Steen, who said they were about seven years married.
The two were divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen said that he and Prentiss had a daughter who was 19 and she was "destructed on the ground."
He said that Prentiss was her daughter "absolutely best friends".
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, who was identified by Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who owned a dog called Lightning, has met with lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help other people," said Knowles
The police said Lamb called relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them, "He's not going to jail."
When policemen later picked him up on Highway 1 near Greenville that night, Lamb drove his car aside, fled on foot, ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot.
Lamb received a doctorate from Delta State University in the spring of 2015, as indicated by his lukewarm on the university's website.
Stars who lost their lucky charm
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001, he fought leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his longtime partner, Farrah Fawcett, to cancer.
The actor is also alleged to have to fight drugs, and in 2008 he was sentenced for possession of drugs.
All this certainly demands his tribute.
Eurowings: Lufthansa remodels the Group
Lufthansa is planning a major corporate conversion.
The Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organization.
150 of the around 1000 executives worldwide will cost the company remodelling the workplace.
The pilot trade union is now negotiating.
Lufthansa rebuilds its corporate structure and enhances the cheap daughter Eurowings.
The aim of the realignment was to contribute around EUR 500 million a year from cost and revenue synergies, the airline announced on Wednesday.
Among other things, Lufthansa will no longer have any board of directors for the passenger business.
The Eurowings low-cost airline should be developed as independently as possible.
In future, Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings on the Executive Board team of Chief Carsten Spohr.
With the reassessment, Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings, with which the Group intends to compete against Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
So far, the organization of the 120 000 employees has been complex.
The airlines operated under the umbrella of the Passage Airline Group, which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros.
New negotiations with the pilots
In the tariff conflict with the Pilot Association Cockpit (VC), negotiations are to be resumed after the ceasefire on this Thursday.
That's what the union told us.
The topic of the talks should be the retirement scheme for pilots.
Cockpit wants to achieve "sustainable results in a year with a forecast record result" as soon as possible.
The conflict between union and airline has led to several strikes in recent months.
In addition to the transitional supply of pilots, the background is the savings concept "Wings".
It provides for Lufthansa to outsource its own Eurowings cheap line in the fight against competitive routes.
Paintings by Leena Krüger in the Künstlerhaus can be seen under the title "Morgenzug to the South".

Luke Shaw of Manchester United can't play for months because of double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg at the Manchester Champions League defeat at PSV Eindhoven.
While this led the left defender to cry and will exclude him from playing for at least six months, Louis van Gaal does not give up the hope that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury was caused by a ruthless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw had broken into the PSV area.
He was treated on the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double leg fracture and lies in the hospital."
He'll be moved tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operate in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United at the age of 18, has it very hard and then plays fantastic, and then it happens.
In the dressing cabin he had an oxygen mask on.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it'll take six months, and he won't play in the group phase.
I hope he can play this season again.
Moreno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the hanging of an elves meter.
Nicola Rizzoli, the arbitrator, did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian arbitrator was wrong.
You can judge for yourself if I say that an elves meter and a red card were due.
It was a very bad attack with both legs.
A Tweet on Shaw's account said: "I thank you all for your messages. Words cannot describe how broken I am, my path to recovery starts now, I return more."
To this end, Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Shaw in defeating the PSV
With the European Championship in France, the United Kingdom defender has an additional incentive to recover by next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV trainer, said, "It's a very bad injury."
If a player leaves the place with this kind of injury, everyone is very sad about it.
It is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent.
Moreno suffered a legbreak when Mexico played against Van Gaals Holland team at the 2014 World Cup.
"He does very hard because it wasn't his intention to hurt the opponent, and if you hear that it's a very bad injury, that's not good," said Cocu.
It was not possible for me to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was going in another direction, so it looked as if he [Moreno] had touched him, but I couldn't see the attack on Luke.
In conversation with SBS6, Moreno said, "I know what it feels like, I know how difficult this can be.
I feel very bad about it. I'm so sorry.
The PSV player Andrés Guardado was also brought to the hospital - after a feature game by Chris Smalling.
I'm sure David Cameron knows the Lorax better?
It's one thing all parents will soon learn: if your child loves a book, it won't take long for you to know it almost externally.
Unless you're perhaps David Cameron.
When asked by a provider of childcare systems to name his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister decided for The Lorax, the environmental fable by Dr. Seuss, which appeared in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, writes Cameron in a message on the SuperCamps website, and continues: "Leaning, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it is a book I like to read to my children, because there always seems to be a picture or a message that we have missed so far."
Everything nice and good, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron supposedly describes the action of the book, instead displays a content specification of the 2012 film version, adding new characters and details to extend the rather short original text.
"In the midst of the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to gain the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree," reads one. A love interest was Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss hostage and who died in 1991 but completely unknown.
As if this were not suspicious enough yet: The text presented by Cameron reads in part like the summary of the Lorax film, which is presented on the Internet Movie Database website and thus begins: "In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted, hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams."
Although he admits to being a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the work of the book. Here, an unnamed boy, like the local environment, hears the money-rich, tree-falling, thneed-stretching Once-ler despite the protests of the name-giving Lorax, a hustling, snoring being "which speaks in the name of the trees".
Most likely, such a relatively low PR task was delegated to a helper who did not read The Lorax 20 times in a row to a child.
A Downing Street spokesperson said that the text probably came from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron's employees, but did not give any more immediate comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England's team, but it is still difficult
To find Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but if you see the cadre that England has chosen for the tour, a repeat of the 3-0 test-series defeat is not on my map.
I wouldn't rule out a victory.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than that three years ago, but there are good spin players in the batting set up, and the community spirit is strong; they won't wear scars from 2012, just a youthful-positive attitude.
With the ball, Moeen Ali develops as a spin bowler and Adil Rashid, even if it represents an unknown size on test, is an option for the attack.
Related message: Adam Lyth quits the England Test Framework and is replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to miss Adam Lyth is, of course, difficult to analyze as his head coach in Yorkshire.
In his seven tests, there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that cricket players are focused on results.
There were no question marks at Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination, since - and I said this earlier - players are their own best pickers.
A long time ago, the course of Lyth was extended, but he had control over his own fate.
I hope if he beats out more runs for Yorkshire, there's another chance.
The English trainer Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even though he did not perform so well, and I am not surprised; he is mainly a team-man.
The question of how much time a test beater gets to set his mark is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play home and away.
The only accusation one can make was that England first used Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - when Lyth was in the highest form - but this lost opportunity is now in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he's a hitman I highly value.
He is an X-factor cricket player, which we saw at Yorkshire early this season when he reached 236 against us on a Trent Bridge place, which hit us very much.
He must have at least the same opportunities as those before him, but this of course depends on the team's position in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of having Moeen beat next to Cook, which would produce an extra spin bowler and receive four quicks, appeared, and I have nothing against it.
I don't see why a hitman can't beat there, and this left-handed guy has already shown that he's a devil's son of a cricket player.
Moeen may not have done his job for his County Worcestershire, but he's a number 3 for her, and there's no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests on the first drop before performing as an opener in 2001.
He made three hundred runs immediately and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the cadre as a backup spinner, and in my limited dealings with him he impressed me very much as a young man.
People may look at his statistics - an average of 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it's a point, but there's no large number of backup spinners that raise their hands and the trainers have opted for youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Apart from the team, England has made some clever additions to the coach staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Batsman from Sri Lanka, as an advisor to the test games could be a master coup.
He is one of the nicest guys in the game who will bring a wealth of experience as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use into the setup.
I always felt that he was created for the international cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela he has insights that we can benefit from.
Sometimes new voices in the dressing cabin can bring fresh wind, even if the messages are in line with the previously spoken.
Colly's teammate at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not used at the One-Dayers, Root got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part.
Some will not agree, but coaches and team creators will not determine the schedule.
And you have to remember that as with the players, their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not made easily at heart.
The Brexit Store (Brexit = exit from the EU) could gain momentum if the economy gets in a mess by the year 2017
David Cameron's unscathed renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is becoming more difficult every day, even without the choice of the ingenious Jeremy "Is it Yes or No?" Corbyn's leader of Labour or the TUC, who strongly disputed because of Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat friend said the other day that some Member States, as deeply ensnared in various crises as the EU is now and not always on their own account, are satisfied with the agenda of the United Kingdom itself, divided concessions and disturbing changes in the Treaty which they do not want.
In Brighton, the TUC decided at its annual meeting that it would not like them if they threatened social protection.
We could also call it Dave and George's Selfie Agenda.
Prime Minister and Finance Ministers climb at summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then come home and say that they win allies for reforms.
It's always about me.
My European friend, who wants an outward looking UK inside the EU tent - "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - and lets us see that more and more shortsighted ministers and officials in some capitals have come to the point where they don't care if we stay or go.
Germany's carefully funded Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she's been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her, as has been the case with the exaggerated long endurances like Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France's François Hollande looks at his reelection or his replacement in 2017.
He is also a fading force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right government, Spain a left.
It's hard to imagine they're going to rip a leg to help the selfie-brites whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland's exit from the UK - something they don't want, because most of them have similar separatist tendencies.
Therefore, some such ministers may even deliberately not plan helpful remarks, quite in the SNP style, while UK referendum campaign 2017 to accelerate the Brexit process, my friend suspects.
"The renegotiation was a fidelity" and "United Kingdom won nothing of value from the renegotiation."
The Europeans know how predatory Fleet Street can be at their expense and what EU skeptics are the oligarchy of the press barons, as they were during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2:1.
You can hardly remember Boris Johnson, the ore euro opportunists, who made a name for themselves as an "EU-Earth Banana" Brussels correspondent in the early 90s.
With all his craziness, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
This included the Medley of tax-fearing villains, telephone-hacking foreigners and the pseudo non-residents who own most of our major newspapers.
Actually, Tony Blair thought similar about her, but found that if you sit in a cage with a hot gorilla, you better distribute bananas to distract him instead of becoming lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairian than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron's referendum swirl, because Blair had set the principle of the EU's undecided constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which opened a back door to him.
The press never forgave him.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly slap on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he no longer needed time for me - seems in danger of repeating Neil Kinnock's boykott Murdoch's 80s strategy, a mistake back then and today.
It may take a while, but he has to develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is in development - I would like to express it kindly.
He says we should stay in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside Ukips' traditional blue dye trend and the wilder areas of Tory's small-englanism can say yes to that.
It's what Hilary said "A Benn, but no Bennite" Benn on the radio and on television this week, when the pathfinder fought in him, didn't admit that Corbyn's appointment of provocative John McDonnell as a shadow Chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 1970s when his old father was on television trying to beilloyal to his Labour Cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilary's fight was even more attractive.
But to fight to remain "in all circumstances" - Benn's expression - was not what McDonnell said, nor what JC told his colleagues and delegates about all the reports at their closing session on Monday evening.
Whatever the touchy bottom-up image of Corbyn wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the strudel of the social media, a breeding ground of Paranoia and treason.
It is right not to give Cameron a free card for Europe, which allows him to take Labour's support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins must think so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's fundamental ambiguities about EU membership - in line with their Bennite siege economy, their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a question of esoteric debate among leftist dissidents, for whom the narcissism of the small difference is a central principle of dogmatic disputes.
As with his ambiguities about NATO - Tom Watson is firmly convinced that JC does not start a campaign to quit - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find in all things a sense for their superiors at home.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have mistrustful voters - to make concessions to the British if all of this can be pointless?
The US is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost reduction in the Tory government's power, which I was reminded of at the start on Monday of something called British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticise Public Health England's report on e-cigarettes
Claims of a state-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people, partly with connections to the tobacco industry, said researchers.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet by criticising the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the "basic report" last month and described it as a "consuming review of the evidence".
However, some researchers questioned the loadability of the data and pointed out the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "extraordinary windy basis" on which PHE based its most important conclusion.
Two more researchers write in BMJ and asked if the claims "found on stone or sand".
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They said that the public expects the claim of PHE that "the best current estimate is that e-cigarettes are approximately 95% less harmful than smoking" to be based on a detailed review of the evidence and modelling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people called to develop a multi-criteria decision-analysis (MCDA) model to produce a synthesis of their opinions on damage to various nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting were summarised in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose managing director was supposed to have previously received funds from British American Tobacco (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed the references of BAT to public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants at the meeting said that they would receive funds from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding he was supposed to receive from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, according to reports.
The reasons for the selection of the members of the panel are not provided, but these include several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of which also indicate industry financing in the paper.
Some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know-how in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the PHE tobacco management.
The research of the group "constitutes significantly" that there is a lack of "hard evidence of the damage of most products to most criteria", wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that the claims of PHE that "there is no evidence so far that e-cigarettes were premature as a way of smoking for children or non-smoking".
Prof Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and Well-being at PHE, said that BMJ's claims had already been responded to.
He said, "E-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking."
Every second life-long smoker dies of his addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are small in comparison, but that we continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence proves and what not, especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people die every year from a smoking-related disease, and smoking costs the national health system £2 billion a year.
By clearly presenting up-to-date evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but are only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking, we fulfil our national competence.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says former head of Channel 4
The former chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said the BBC should stop sending programs like EastEnders and The Voice. He said that commercial rivals would "give their right arm" for hit shows like the Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not broadcast by other UK stations.
He criticized the BBC for placing public-law programs, which are likely seen by a smaller audience, in hard-to-discuss time windows against the most popular shows of their rivals and from stations such as BBC4.
After the BBC General Director, Tony Hall, said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that for six years in his time at Channel 4, he had tried without success to get in touch with the BBC.
"I have problems with the idea that BBC is commissioning or sending programs that would also be clearly demonstrated by non-subsidized rivals," Johnson told the Upper House Communication Committee as part of his investigation into the future of the BBC.
If you want to keep the broadcasting fee, which I do not think is a good idea in the medium or long term, you should at least put your production on programmes that others do not make or commission.
They send The Voice in a first-class window because they want to achieve the widest possible support for their future.
The idea that no one else would show this is a joke, it's ridiculous, of course it's nonsense.
Johnson said, "I don't see why a regressive tax programme is financed, which could also be financed without subsidies.
The Voice is such a program, EastEnders is another, admittedly both own productions.
Honestly, other channels would give their right arm for it.
I try to see how this should be public television.
I don't think this would reduce the BBC at all.
Johnson, an entrepreneur for series, who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC is guilty of hunting for ratings "because of the ambitions of the people working there, and because they believe this is the best way to secure long-term support."
His comments on BBC's most popular shows reflect what the former director of Sky, Tony Ball, suggested in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows should sell like EastEnders.
Johnson said that the rather public-law niche programs "should go to BBC4, where you can't measure the audience, but they do their tasks, and they can argue when they go on their hypocritical missions to justify 4 billion pounds of broadcasting fees, "Well, of course, we've created all these obscure programs that no one has seen."
They put them in a window where no one ever wanted to see them.
As regards the broadcasting fee, Johnson told the Committee: "I urge you to find a more regressive system in terms of conditions that can get the best value from it.
Of course you all think, we all think that you get a great value here for 150 pounds a year, but for people who are a lot of money for the 150 pounds, ask me if that's true, because they don't consume much from the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 Chief David Elstein, who also said before the Committee on Tuesday, called for the BBC to review its Reithian mission to "informed, formed and entertained".
He said that little of BBC production would now officially be classified as education - he said that it is 1% of TV production and 0.1% of radio - and she should take an example of this change in "informed, informed and entertained" to public television stations in Australia and Canada.
On the question of partnerships, Elstein said that the BBC should do more in areas such as the Proms, of which he said that only a handful will be shown on television, and with commercial channels alliances to make everything available online.
'Sonogenics' can control brain cells by sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change the direction in the moment they are irradiated with sound impulses.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by outbreaks of sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change the direction in the moment they are irradiated with sound impulses that have too high frequencies for human hearing to be heard.
The impulses work by enabling motoneuron cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves.
Further on this topic: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said the worms showed the power of a new procedure called Sonogenics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Srekanth Chalasani, researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that one day the procedure could replace the deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that sends electrical impulses into the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.
Featherworms usually do not react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found out, reinforce the ultrasound waves, which then penetrate the worms.
The reinforced ultrasound waves affect structures called TRP-4 ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worm cells.
The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned, says a Nature Communications report.
In order to create ultrasound-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically modified worms so that some of her motoneurons carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When it applies ultrasound to the modified creatures, the sound waves are amplified by the microblowers and transferred to the worms where they turn on the modified motoneurons.
The process has some similarities with optogenics, a groundbreaking tool that enables scientists to turn on and off neurons with impulses of light.
But Chalasani said that Sonogenics could have some advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which has to be sent down to the desired location in the brain at an optical fiber, low-frequency ultrasonic waves can pass tissue unhindered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the targeted human neurons temporarily susceptible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," said Chalasani.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture devices - right in front of your doorstep!
The ads are ashamed of Great Britain's arms trade
Watch Amnesty International Anti-Waffen Trade Fair Video.
Terrible killer drones!
Foot joint crushing leg shackles!
Scatter bombs!
And electric shock bars that cause agonizing pain, but don't leave any trace!
The cheerful voice and cartoon images leave no doubt that this ad for the world's largest arms trade fair is a warring parody produced by Amnesty International to bring to light the British government's willingness to destroy weapons to repressive regimes about the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign also leads to many posters that can be seen at bus stops and in subway trains and that require a second look.
"Important announcement: From September 15th to 18th with DLR?" (Docklands Light Railway) you can read in the typefaces of the London Underground and the DLR line's trademark, which turns into a picture of a tank.
In September, a swarm of arms dealers will travel with DLR ... customers are asked to help with the stop of the arms trade fair.
The 300 posters are by artists who have exhibited their work at the Museum for Cruel Designs in Banksys Dismaland.
A collective named Special Patrol Group helped distribute in London using "Ad Space Hack Packs", a £6 pack of inbus keys, which is said to gain "access to about a third of the bus stop advertising areas on the planet."
Transport for London doesn't find this poster "Vandalism" funny.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists become more critical and try to bring political works to the audience outside galleries.
Many artists work with activists within protest movements and notice that they have to go outside into the real world so that their art has an influence on society.
Another of the anti-weapon trade posters greets the commuters on the subway.
The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP, which works non-profitably with the graphic artist and voiceover artist, who also works for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around advertising for the arms fair - through an empty space of the ExCel calendar - and thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They played with the invention of a more realistic, bleak corporate advertising, but "by bloating with bright colors and animation, it remains more liable."
"They have done a fantastic job by helping us to raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair," says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we need now is intervention by the British Government and the guarantee that torture devices are not being illegally traded at our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art around the arms fair comes from the area within ExCeL, where exhibitors ruin fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab reveals an order from the US Army about "the AT4CS RS shot off by the shoulder."
This includes a "uniquely shaped battlehead that delivers outstanding post-effect effects within the target."

Eight golden rules for life in student homes
11 years ago, as a self-forgetten 19-year-old, I moved to a student's home, still in faith in Beret's and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the tense smiles of those I've offended - and the numerous, long-lasting complaints about others.
Most of what I have learned can be distilled in eight simple rules.
The entry into student residence ranges from slightly nervous to absolutely terrifying.
It's tempting to blacken: people tell you where you came from, whether and where you've taken Sabbath year, where you stand in relation to Corbyn and why you're "not really loving or hating Marmite, because seriously, boys, it's just a yeast extract HAHAHA, I'm in my room."
Breathe through.
And help others do the same - ask questions and show interest.
It guides the conversation and helps you to find the people you like in contrast to those you would not talk to, even if your eyelashes were on fire and these fire extinguishers.
Leave people alone.
The rooms of people often turn into beverage receptions, film-night venues and municipal meeting places, but they are also the places where people dress and put on their underwear.
To this end: don't remember to start at the university with a relationship
Introverted people receive a rough treatment at the university.
Your room should be a refuge, but many student homes form a room-to-room-busting culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.
This can be hell for someone who's trying to recover.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want our friendship to continue, but you have to leave so that I can get back the energy I used up for interaction with you."
Try to feel when a commilitone of social gathering is exhausted - and send him a text instead of knocking.
Speaking of knocking: do it.
A guy in my student residence had the idea that an unclosed door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Make friendship by baking.
Since you start the university at the highlight of the back-mania, knocking on the doors of people to imagine yourself with a plate full of brownies, less strange than the welcome of the 1950s "Welcome to the neighborhood, I've baked something to you. So, and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions."
Offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends.
Your roommates feel obliged to entertain themselves and will in the end perhaps associate your face with a delicious surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
Bad mixed blocks of flour, sugar and fat make people sleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student homes.
Of course, the clawing of chicken is a theft, but is it also taking a drop of milk for your tea?
Check with the dairy owner.
The chances are good that they say to use themselves, even if they cook inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it more balanced than my roommate who added a detergent to her milk to punish thieves.
She's in jail now.
You shouldn't make a noise that'll stop people from sleeping or from working.
It is not only about being a decent person, but that in the truest sense of the proverb you are among the people sitting in the glass house.
A girl on my hall asked her neighbors if they had anything to say to Drum & Bass a little bit quieter, because it was three in the morning, and she had an examination in the morning.
They responded with even louder music.
When they finally stopped at 5 p.m., she kindly let her neighbors sleep two hours before she left her own music, closed her door, and went to her three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic for your future spouse to move into the same student home by chance?
On the other hand, if you hold a roommate for your future mate, get involved in her, separate again, and then see her every day, and perhaps experience how she draws all her friends together?
Of course, the heart goes its own way - but if a hot roommate is definitely not your future spouse, try at least to tell your lower body a little reason.
In the exciting moment you notice that someone has left his key in his unsealed room, the boundary between a Ulk and mobming is finer than it seems.
A good strike is funny, but it only takes moments to become a boomerang.
By hiding a valuable and amusing lesson about safety - but never ruin anyone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock your door, and place your keys in a glass of water, which you then place in the freezer - but not more than twice you fix your belongings on the ceiling.
Terrace houses for refugees, single-parents, low-earners
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds terraced houses for people who don't have much money in the Central Franconian Eckental.
For example, for refugees - but also as a signal: "Not only refugees need housing, but also the alone mother and the low earner."
"I'm showing how you can still build cheaply and well today," says the 44-year-old in the interview
Thousands of refugees will be forced into the housing market.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes in knowing how quickly cheap housing can be created: he builds terraced houses for refugees in a project.
Mr Gildner, many refugees will be forced into the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: The mass accommodation in containers or gyms has no sustainability.
Because people stay here to a large extent.
In view of the refugee flow, we need enough housing in the coming decades.
A completely banal, three-storey terraced house is the solution.
Gildner: A terraced house needs the least space.
It facilitates integration.
This is different when people are housed in housing blocks.
Each of the six houses that are currently being built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each.
Each apartment has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room.
Many refugees may say it's peace again, I'm going back.
Then the houses can easily be converted according to the respective needs.
What are the costs?
Gildner: The price for 160 square meters of living space per house is 184 000 euros, without property.
That's manageable.
The construction took six months.
That is appropriate.
Did the building regulations complicate their plans?
Gildner: I did my project correctly under construction law.
Especially complicated, it always makes the threatening Damocles sword special construction and the pitch regulation.
It's creepy.
It is still assumed that if you create three apartments in a terraced house, you need at least three pitches.
Only in the cities the place is missing.
And refugees and asylum seekers don't have cars.
How did the residents react to their terraced-house project?
Gildner: There were some who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
Which definitely isn't right.
But don't you sharpen the competition for affordable apartments?
Gildner: It's true: We've had a building boom in Germany over the last five years, but luxury apartments have been built, which can hardly afford any more.
My project has the message, even the normal people need housing.
Not only refugees, but also the single mother or the low earner.
I'll show you how you can still build cheaply and well today.
That's what it's all about.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystem technology in Regensburg and initially studied environmental analyses.
iOS 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
The new operating system can be requested by going to the settings app, typing "General" and selecting "Software Update".
If it is ready, the phone will give you the option to download and then install.
Some have encountered problems after the installation, as they get an error message that tells that the "software update failed".
In order to avoid the problem, users are advised to wait either until the rush goes back or try to update via iTunes.
The phone itself will guide you through the rest of the process.
This may mean deleting apps to create space - but Apple has made it more unlikely by streamlining the update. Likewise, it will be easier to do so if you use a special tool to delete apps and then reinstall them as soon as the process is finished.
It is worth ensuring that your mobile phone is charged during the upgrade or is located near a charger, so that the battery is charged.
If the charge is too low, Apple does not allow the update to continue, as the phone may shut down halfway and this could lead to a termination of the update.

You should also make sure that you have looked through our checklist of all things before your download to prevent things from going wrong and protecting yourself if they do. iOS 9 brings new features, including a much wiser personal assistant and enormous new productivity features for the iPad, as well as changes that accelerate and repair the operating system.
Rosberg's single currency: Full attack
Nico Rosberg has only one motto in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula One against his clearly leading Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton: "Volle Attack".
The World Cup second emphasized before the start in the decisive seven overseas races, "that I have nothing more to lose".
53 points separate the vice-world champion before the night race in Singapore on this Sunday from title defender and double champion Hamilton.
The British has already won seven of the twelve previous season races and is also a favorite for the floodlight Grand Prix in the city state.
2009 and last year the 30-year-old British won the race.
Whether the current Smog in the city state will influence Singapore's Grand Prix is still unclear.
For days a thunder bell has been hanging over the city, triggered by fires on the neighboring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger Chess Club has a prominent member
The chess club "Schachfreunde Bad Kissingen" was founded three months ago and has joined another member in his ranks, increasing the number of members to 19 players.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player who stayed more than 40 times in Bad Kissingen to the spa.
Gauselmann is the carrier of the First Class Federal Cross of Merit and honorary citizen of the cities of Espelkamp and Lübbecke.
The chess club in Bad Kissingen supported Gauselmann with a donation that President Alfred Klein accepted.
This makes it possible to include chess players who cannot apply the membership fee.
Youth work and talent-search should also be promoted.
Gauselmann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact with the tennis club "Rot-Weiß" be seen as an expression of his connection with the spa city.
Quarter Office Seeks Direct Contact
Saludis and the Altenzentrum Antonistift have gathered under the coat of the Social Foundation and opened a new point of contact at the Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
In addition to consultations, you can also attend courses there.
The Social Foundation pulls it down from the mountain to the city center.
More specifically, at the Graf Stauffenberg Square.
A new quarter office was recently opened there.
Here, right next to the shopping market, elderly people and advice-seeking information on questions such as the care insurance or the health and care insurance services.
For years with our outpatient care service, we have noticed that often caregivers are left alone.
There are infinitely many questions.
"It is also not uncommon to use many cash benefits, because the complexity of insurance is hardly understood," explained Jutta Weigand, who is also responsible for the Antonistift and the Bürgerspital and for the outpatient service "Amadeus" as Head of the Altenhilfe department.
In addition to the consultations, the new quarter office also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
The Saludis was taken into the boat.
Therefore, additional offers such as fall prevention, memory training or physiotherapy can be used.
The offers from the Seniors' Centre and Saludis complement each other in an ideal way.
Saludis stands for prevention, prevention and rehabilitation.
Heike Riedel, Managing Director of Saludis, described "The Senior Care and Care Center".
The reason for the opening of the new headquarters office in the city centre is seen by both Managing Directors in particular in demographic change.
For this makes a good decentralised infrastructure in the individual districts of Bamberg indispensable in the future.
In addition, Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) underlined at the opening ceremony, the quarter office also dedicated itself to the unification of old age: "There are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite you to a regular social gathering."
This makes a big contribution to the social foundation that seniors can live as independently and as well in their familiar environment as possible.
The quarter office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m.
Eintracht Bamberg against Würzburger Kickers on 6 October
Now it is official: After the date for the match FC Eintracht Bamberg against the third league player Würzburg Kickers had not yet been set because of renovation work at the Fuchsparkstadion, the 6th of October was now set as an appointment.
The meeting of the FC Eintracht Bamberg in the eighth final of the Bavarian football Totopokal against the third league player FC Würzburger Kicker was now finally scheduled.
It will be played at the Bamberg Fuchsparkstadion on Tuesday, October 6, at 7 pm.
"We are glad that we now know when the game is going over the stage, now we have planning security," said FCE team manager Karlheinz Hümmer, who also points out the ticket presale that is now being started.
It's something special for our team to play against a third party.
We therefore hope for numerous spectators, and this is not without reason, because floodlight games have a special appeal.
In the round of the last 16 teams, the FC Eintracht Bamberg moved in 2010 through victories with the district league team 1. FC Oberhaid (3:1) and at home against the regional league player 1. FC Schweinfurt 05 (3:2).
The winner of the competition will receive 5000 euros and qualify for the first round of the 2016/2017 DFB Cup.
Title defender is third league climber SpVgg Unterhaching.
Wiener Architektor Karl Mang 92-year-old died
Karl Mang, one of the Doyens of Vienna architecture, is dead.
He died on September 5 at the age of 92, as the Künstlerhaus announced on Tuesday.
With Mang, the Künstlerhaus lost an honorary member and at the same time "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna", as it was called in the broadcast.
Born 1922 in Vienna, Mang studied architecture at the Vienna University of Technology under Friedrich Lehmann during and after World War II.
Since 1952 he worked as a freelance architect, but also worked as a teacher, writer and institute director.
From 1972 to 1983 he was president of the Austrian Institute of Design.
In the 1980s he was commissioned to the Austrian Theatre Museum with the establishment of the treasure chamber in the Vienna Hofburg and the conversion of the Lobkowitz Palace.
Park Penalty: Tim Wiese recruits a policeman with money
Ex-footballer Tim Wiese has not noticed well in Bremen.
In the meantime Tim Wiese, ex-national goalkeeper in Germany and with Bremen and Hoffenheim, is engaged in football once, Wrestler.
According to his own statement, he wants to have grown 30 kilograms of muscle mass over the past two years.
Intellectually, however, he has not done so.
The meadow was cut in the city centre of Bremen when he saw a parking guard exhibiting a penalty for his white Chevrolet Camaro outside.
The meadow then stormed out of the business, insulted the officer and threw the due fine in front of her feet, as the "picture" newspaper reports.
At the city of Bremen one confirms the accusations, but is not yet clear about the consequences for the unusual incident.
"The matter is still under examination," says the city of Bremen.
Only after that will it be decided whether meadow is displayed, or not.
Panamanian authorities destroy 4500 marijuana plants
The fertile soil and the typical rainforest climate of the Isla del Rey are ideally suited for the prosperity of the marijuana plants.
For three days the authorities of Panama have been tearing out the 4,500 plants and burning them.
Men beat 17-year-old Afghans
The police are looking for witnesses for an incident in Bad Soden-Salmünster: On Friday evening, around 23:45, three young men were on foot from Bad Soden towards Salmünster.
One of the group, a 17-year-old Afghan, was following his two friends at a distance of about five metres, according to the police, and called them to wait for him.
At that time, the group was at the level of the bft gas station.
Three people also stayed on the site of the gas station.
One of these men now screamed at the young people and hit them in the face with his fist.
The victim suffered a broken nose and bleeding heavily out of his nose.
When his two friends hurryed up and talked in at the beater, he initially dropped off his sacrifice.
The injured young man was now brought home by his friends.
The perpetrator followed the group with a car up to their apartment and passed it on several occasions.
When the vehicle was no longer seen, the victim went in front of the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was attacked again by the bat and another male person.
With the help of a baton, the victim’s face and thighs were beaten.
The injured person had to be taken to a hospital for medical attention.
So far, there's only one vague culprit description.
One of the men was about 1,80 meters tall.
The second beater is said to have been about 1.65 meters tall and was clothed with a jeans and a brown-white shirt.
The police ask witnesses and policymakers to report on the phone number 06181/100-123.
Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice Felstehausen and invests 310000 Euro
Silvia Müller-Gongol and Frank Müller (from the left) take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen.
Samtgemeindekürgermeister Bernd Bormann, business promoter Uta Seim-Schwartz and Asendorf's mayor Heinfried Kabbert are also delighted.
Doctors - Asendorf, on the other hand, are missing in many places in the country: Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of Felstehausen on 1 October.
While Ursel Felstehausen is retired, her husband Karl-Heinrich is still standing by his successor with half a job in the coming months.
After a conversion phase Müller reopens the practice on 12 October, until then he invests 310000 euros in the premises on St.-Marcellusstraße 6.
It was sympathy at first sight when the Felstehausens met Frank Müller and his wife, Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongol, who is currently completing her specialist training at the Verden hospital and wants to enter the practice next year.
"We always had in mind that the Müllers would fit well into this practice," says Dr. Ursel Felstehausen and laughs.
"When it was time, I just called her."
The couple Müller liked the idea of running their own practice in Asendorf in the future.
"The proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us," says 39-year-old Müller.
"We want to get to know and accompany families over the years."
As an advantage, he also sees himself as his own boss soon.
And so they agreed, the Müllers bought the house with practice.
However, they will continue to live in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
There the two-time family father Frank Müller also grew up, his medical studies in Hanover followed stops in several medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He is currently a senior physician in Sulingen, and in 2009 he was appointed as a leading emergency doctor in Diepholz County and is volunteering in the DRK-Achievement Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
From 19 September, the practice will be prepared for the new boss.
While the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen works as a general physician, his wife Ursel (Internistin) specialized in gastroenterology.
The Müllers, both internists, want to settle down as a family doctor.
"This is why endoscopy comes out," says 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongoll.
After the conversion, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasound investigations as well as long-term and stress ECGs and need a more speech room.
In addition, the computer will be completely renewed.
The Müllers receive a total grant of 50000 euros as part of a funding programme from the district (25000 euros) as well as from the Samtgemeinde (12500 euros) and the municipality (12500 euros).
"This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice will continue," emphasizes Samtgemeinschaftbürgermeister Bernd Bormann.
According to Silvia Müller-Gongoll, about 2000 patients come into practice every quarter in Felstehausen, and in the North German average practice there are about 500.
There is another practice in Asendorf.
A positive side effect of the practical acquisition by Frank Müller: According to Ursel Felstehausen, the pharmacy remains in Asendorf.
If no successor had found her, she would have gone too.
By the way, those who visit Müller's conference hours continue to look in familiar faces: the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power of the Felstehausens take over.
Their farewell ends an era in Asendorf, after all, the physicians have practised there for 30 years.
"In the beginning, we had only two rooms," remembers Ursel Felstehausen smiling.
She feels a little pain after a long time.
"But we will continue to live in Hohenmoor and will certainly see many more patients," says the internist.
Her husband complements laughing: "We have a 6000 square meter piece."
"I've always pressed myself before gardening, now it could be different."
In addition, the couple has two grandsons and likes to travel.
Croatia: "We let the refugees through"
"Now border controls are also being lifted at our southern border," said Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner.
The controls at the Hungarian border remain in parallel.
It is still clear that anyone who wants to apply for asylum can do so "of course".
People's care and safety are in the foreground.
But it is also clear that "there is a need for clear signals," said the Minister.
People need to know that we do not accept boundless migration flows, even across the Austrian-Slovene border.
It needs a controlled approach.
Croatia is considering "Corridor" - Slovenia refuses to do so
The Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would also like to allow incoming refugees to travel to Austria and Germany and, in some cases, to build corridors for refugees.
However, this was not the case with Minister of Interior Vesna Györkös Znidar in Laibach.
The idea of corridors is "absolutely unacceptable", but Slovenia will step up the monitoring of the border, especially Hungary.
The border with Croatia, on the other hand, was already heavily controlled as the external border of the Schengen area.
However, as the Minister stressed, Slovenia does not want to lock its borders on refugees.
"Every EU member must fulfil its obligations, otherwise the system cannot function," said Györkös Znidar.
According to the Croatian government, the first refugees had already tried to pass the Tovarnik/Sid border in the night hours on Tuesday to avoid registration in Eastern Croatia.
The Croatian police were able to pick them up in the nearby corn fields.
According to local media, police vehicles are constantly arriving with new refugees in Tovarnik, Croatia.
It is mainly about Syrians and Afghans, including numerous women and children.
Rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use.
In the coming days, his country will count about 4,000 refugees, said Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
Furthermore, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had so far brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would be diverted to Croatia, reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday in agreement.
However, the Belgrade government disputed that it was to instruct people to take certain routes: "Neither can we, nor will we do so," it said.
According to the media reports, at least in the early days a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Sid, and further buses were expected in the course of the day.
About Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The inmates had been on their way all night from the approximately 500 kilometers away Macedonian border through Serbia.
"We heard that Hungary has closed, so the police told us to go here," said one of the refugees.
They wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria.
This could actually lead to the already predicted shift of the current Balkan route in Turkey-Greece-Serbia-Hungary, Turkey-Greece-Serbia-Hungary, to a slightly further west.
Croatia: Comprehensive possibilities for border control
Croatia's Interior Minister Ostojic had previously stressed that his country had prepared plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influx of refugees.
He did not mention details, but he pointed out that Croatia as a non-Schengen member had "comprehensive possibilities for border control".
Strict controls are being carried out to qualify for membership in the Schengen area.
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007, and the EU partners have always issued a good witness to the country in relation to the standard of border controls.
On the Serbian side there are still about 300 refugees behind the Hungarian border fence.
According to Belgrade media reports, they had spent the last night at the Horgos border crossing leading to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely blocked.
Whether the remaining refugees now want to continue to the Croatian border is still unclear.
Serbian Minister of Interior Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm down early on Wednesday at a local eyelight in Horgos: he considered the debates on alternative routes of refugees, after the Hungarian border is now closed, to be premature.
It would not at present be very high refugee numbers.
It is not yet possible to say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Helpers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugees have already started distributing to the refugees maps on which alternative routes through Croatia are marked.
However, the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless: in parts of the border area, even 20 years after the end of the Croatia war, there are still unspoiled minefields.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police announced that a team of miners in the border region had been sent.
Stock exchange hackers: Ukrainians pay 30 million dollars
Supranonok is said to have been part of a ring of cybercriminals who have been accused of having been able to gain an insight into unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire since 2010.
The information collected is intended to make insider transactions on the financial markets.
In this way, the investigators found that a total of over 100 million dollars were combined.
"Today's comparison shows that even those outside our borders will eventually be caught," says the SEC Communication.
The trials against 32 other defendants in the case continued.
Most of the defendants come from Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators are said to have acted in both the United States and Eastern Europe.
Ecumenical Hospice Aid Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years
Around Mannheimer Paradeplatz there is a lot of business.
People take care of their supplies, some of them fast steps, some cozy bubbling.
They control the two stations of the Mannheim car salon at Paradeplatz.
Stop the city railways.
Pulsating, pompous life with magnificent autumn sunshine and in the middle of four large plates each with the title "Before I die I want to die"....
The Ecumenical Hospice Aid drew attention to its 20th anniversary and sees itself faced with mixed reactions.
"It's about life, so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among the people," says Josefine Lammer.
The director of the Ecumenical Hospice Aid is available to passers-by as well as to the volunteer staff.
While some passers-by spontaneously reach out to the Cretaceous and can "read my life", "go through the USA with the camper", "stop the war" or "suffer not long", others stop for a short time, read, say sentences like "I'm not that far yet" and then go on.
Time and again, small discussions about the action itself, about life, about how to deal with dying develop on the margins.
Peter Hübinger is also on site.
"Only if I make it clear that the end of this world will come for me at some point will I be able to live responsibly," says the director of the Diaconian work Mannheim, which together with the Caritasverband is the carrier of the Ecumenical Hospice Aid.
Therefore, this public action for the 20-year-old is good.
That not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the tables, be understandable, but finally it is a very personal matter.
The issue of death and death is still with Tabus, according to the experience of Josefine Lammer, although the hospice movement in recent years has contributed a lot to the people's opening up.
An assessment that Angelika Godefroid shares.
The death and mourning companion is one of the volunteers of the first hour.
Faced with the subject of personal experience, she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in the death aid.
When the Ecumenical Hospice Aid sought voluntary help, she immediately reported and was present at the founding in 1995.
Godefroid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - who are accompanied by the affected and members of private households, hospitals, nursing homes and Hospice Saint Vincent.
They're all carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid can well deal with her task and the experiences and experiences she has gained.
"I see the life of another wait, consider it precious and estimate the moment," she says.
The offer of the ambulatory ecumenical hospice service is free and non-confessional.
The financial support of the health insurance companies and donations of family members and associations enables training and training and supervision of the death and mourning companions.
Every two years training courses for new employees are offered.
The tables described on Saturday are now on display in the House of the Evangelical Church (M1, 1a) and in the House of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
There, further personal wishes can also be recorded on postcards.
FedEx result mixed, financial prospects decreased for 2016
FedEx reports disappointing results for the last quarter, and the delivery giant reduced its profit outlook for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transport service.
The company also said she was planning to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the vacation.
At that time last year, FedEx announced that the company would like to employ 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
The stock fell over 2.5 percent in Premarket trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said to earn a profit between 10.40 $ and 10.90 $ in the financial year ending next May, 20 cents less than in the previous prediction.
Analysts expected a survey of FactSet $10.84.
The lower outlook comes despite the price increases, which average 4.9% and will be effective on 4 January, and despite higher increases in land transport charges for heavy and large parcels, which will be collected from November onwards.
The company said that it was still expected that the result would increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction, higher revenue and growth in online commerce.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "is producing solid income when considering the weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade".
The plans for holiday employment were announced one day later than those of the Rival UPS, which plans to recruit 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, about the same number as last year.
In the quarter ending on August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than in the previous year.
The result per share was $2.42 per share, just below $2.44 per share, which twelve investment research analysts surveyed by Zacks predicted.
Sales rose by 5 percent to 12.3 billion dollars.
Six Zacks surveyed analysts expected $12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has seen a decline in international priority shipping, which has led to a stagnation of sales in its unit Express shipping.
But the boom in online shopping has increased the results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, sales in ground transport increased by 29 percent, but operating profit was basically flat due to higher costs for larger parcels and self-insurance.
The Express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while the result decreased due to higher labour costs in the freight business.
In the premarket trade, about an hour before the opening, the FedEx shares dropped by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
On Tuesday she closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent under a record high on June 11.
At their most expected meeting in the year, Federal Reserve Stratists spend two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduras-Mahagoni table to decide whether it is time to raise the key interest for the first time in almost a decade.
Threatening about them at an end of the decorated, two-story meeting room is a mural of the United States.
The card is a reminder that Fed President Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation ahead of everything else.
The central bank has a double order from Congress: maximizing US employment and keeping prices stable here.
But since the great recession, the Fed leaders have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X-factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict. It is announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be weaned from the unprecedented incentive by the short-term interest rate close to zero since the end of 2008.
Although most of the economic data show that it is growing solidly, recent turbulences in global financial markets could make the already cautious Fed representatives afraid to increase this volatility by raising the interest rate on federal bonds - and even by only a quarter of a percentage point.
"Obviously, the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing they observe," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they were looking for a pretext not to increase the interest rate, the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue to wait," she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which is in itself uncertain of the financial market.
About half of the economists surveyed recently by Bloomberg predicted an interest rate increase this week.
However, the financial markets expect the Fed to wait, with a key indicator showing only a 30% chance of increasing.
This indicates a fall in the stock market if the Fed increases the rate unless the strategists mitigate the impact by promising that a further increase is far away.
On Tuesday the Dow Jones Industrial average jumped by 228.89 points or 1.4% to 16,599.85.
The action was triggered by expectations that the Fed policy will maintain the rate this week, said John Lonski, Chief Economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed would lift the sentences at that time," he said.
If she does, "she has to go a long way in her statement to calm down the financial markets so that she doesn't panic."
Other experts argued that an interest rate increase would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed on good track to increase the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow increase in the monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US.
Yellen had said in spring and early summer that this year despite the complaints of liberals that more economic progress would be needed, she was expecting an increase in the rate.
Although job creation slowed down in August, the improvement in the labour market was solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years and close to the level the Fed sees as full employment.
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.
And although inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2% of the central bank, the Fed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, Chief Economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But the financial markets around the world collapsed at the end of last month, after China had devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial average fell by more than 16% in May, when investors feared that a slowing of the Chinese economy would stifle global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, with the Dow now almost 10% below the May high.
For the Fed representatives, market turbulences influence the complex calculation when to increase interest rates.
"If the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks, they would attract the reins at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former U.S. staff member.
Now he predicts that she will wait for at least one month to better control the effects.
"There's a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be, and there's almost no reliable data describing developments in China," said Olner.
The health of the world economy is not one of the main concerns of the Fed, so it should not be technically involved in its decision-making.
But in the end, the Fed has become the monetary authority of the world.
The influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years.
The mere indication by Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "close" its monetary expansion caused confusion around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly interconnected, the Fed representatives can be expected not only to monitor developments elsewhere but also to consult with other central banks and experts to get a better understanding of the global economy.
Their decision-making is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy for asset management of Entvestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA., noted this month that "the Fed has a history of overreactions on financial market movements that are apparently not linked to the economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a member of the Federal Open Market Committee entitled to vote for an interest rate increase, cited decisions as an example in 1998/1999.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to lower its key interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three meetings "despite limited recognizable effects on growth in the USA", said Lacker.
A year later, the Fed representatives reversed these cuts.
The Fed should put aspects of financial stability first only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market collapse, said Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England's interest rate committee.
The latest turbulences do not come near this level, he said.
"She certainly does not want to get into the situation where she is afraid of an increase in interest rates because the markets are getting excited," said Posen, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that is changed, I do not believe that it should go ahead of time.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/camp was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C is often referred to as Thai Costco and is a Thai wholesale market that also sells to the general public.
Yeah, he's in Chinatown, not Thai Town.
The market/camp is a central point of contact and offers a confusing number of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and dishes, furniture, religious jewelry and Christmas decorations.
There is even a car department when you need engine oil.
The shop is huge, and it takes more than an hour to stroll through the corridors.
If the whole shopping shop makes you hungry, there is a meal for you in the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The kitchen (good and inexpensive) in this shop is close to the cash registers and has various take-away options.
What there is here: Do you need something - something - Thai?
LAX-C probably has it.
Products are inexpensive and a number of them are sold in large quantities.
Fresh products include Asian specialities and regional Thai herbs, fruit and much more.
The meat bar is extensive, as is the fish bar - the staff behind the counter will clean and fill the fish and even fry on request for you.
A good part of the shop belongs to the massive freezer department. Here you will find frozen curry sheets, bitter melon and gallows, whole ducks, fish, cattle blood and gall, pigs-natural intestine, fish balls, regional sausage, commercially prepared food and more.
Who buys here: restaurant owners and cooks, also individual families and individuals.
The wide corridors are suitable for shopping cars and forklifts.
You will find here: fresh Monthong Durian next to the cash desk.
Where it is located: The shop is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the outskirts of Chinatown and downtown - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot, along with other shops and restaurants.
Even if the shop is well visited, it is not difficult to find a parking space.
Hoyerswerda: Small life support for refugees
More and more refugees arrive in Germany these days.
To prepare you a warm welcome does not go without the commitment of countless volunteer helpers.
There are also a number of people in Hoyerswerda who support unprofitable asylum seekers in the city.
Among them are Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher with body and soul.
She still likes to teach with her 74 lenses.
Every Thursday, she does it in the asylum seekers' home on Dillinger Straße.
There she helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language.
Of course, this is quite different from a real school.
Brazil's paediatric society Rio Grande food nutrition for healthy breast-feeding
The Brazilian Paediatric Organization SPRS tries to alarm women in a shocking way about the importance of good nutrition during breastfeeding. It does this with the presentation of pictures of babies sucking on breasts painted with representations of unhealthy foods.
Mother's milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day.
However, new research suggests that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make.
A recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, Professor at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet of nutritional women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can adversely affect the immune system.
Exceptions to the new Bernrieder Sporthalle
The municipal councillor Bernried approved the construction proposal for the 2.3 million euro sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof may become flatter for solar system.
The plans for the long-awaited gym construction at the Bernrieder Sports Grounds are progressing step by step.In the recent municipal council meeting, the draft building proposal was unanimously cancelled without major discussions.
Before that, the body had decided, among other things, to apply for a "exception" of building law with respect to "liberation" from the valid construction plan.
The "exception" concerned the permission for a special shape regarding the roof construction.
According to this, a "sitted roof with non-middle first and roofing" is to be built.
The background of the planning is the planned use of the roof area for solar installations: "This brings together a wonderfully large south roof," explained Mayor Josef Steigenberger at the meeting.
The "liberation" was, in turn, about the roof inclination, which, for energetic reasons - unlike the building plan - should be less than ten degrees.
This significantly reduces the volume of the hall.
A "liberation" was therefore necessary, because the building plan does not allow "exceptions" regarding the roof inclination - with the Bernried municipal council generally more restrictively taking place when applying for exemption.
Turnhall construction, however, is not a recurring project: "We do not create a precedent with that," says Steigenberger.
Turnhallenbau am Sportzentrum is a joint project between the municipality and the SV Bernried.
Some 2.3 million euros are charged at cost.
Grants are expected from school and broadband promotion.
In the next stage of the process, the application for construction for the 18 x 36 meter hall is now submitted to the Landratsamt for examination.
Klinik Peißenberg moves to Schongau
Peißenbergenberg Hospital is expected to be closed earlier than planned - 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) becomes new medical director at the hospital Schongau.
The station and the majority of the staff move from Peißenbergenberg to Schongau.
This is provided for by the surprising plans of Hospital GmbH in the district, which Landratin Andrea Jochner-Weiß confirmed.
However, the Supervisory Board will make a decision on this, and will be meeting on Wednesday, September 23.
If the plans were implemented, all of the almost 50 employees at the hospital in Peißenbergenberg would continue to work.
The vast majority should move to Schongau with fishermen and the existing internal station.
The rooms are available.
In Weilheim, Jochner-Weiß, Jochner-Weiß, the employees who cannot go to Schongau are to be offered a job.
The staff were informed about the plans.
The change has triggered the termination of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has only been a medical director of the Schongauer Klinik since the beginning of the year and has now switched to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital.
According to Jochner-Weiß, the name "Fischer" came into play on the question of who should succeed, who agreed to take the lead from 1 October and to switch to Schongau with his team.
For the house in Schongau, this means in any case an "upgrading" and a broadening of the offer in the field of "Internal Medicine", Jochner-Weiß says.
Fischer is a specialist for pacemakers and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) specializes in gastroenterological diseases at the inner station.
For the next two years, fishermen with their team, if the Supervisory Board agrees, will lead both houses, until next year the former hospital of the Knappschaft, which still has 35 beds, is to be finally closed in Peißenbergenberg after almost 140 years.
So far, the district had planned this for 2018, when the ongoing renovation at the Weilheim Hospital has been completed.
Land Councillor Jochner-Weiß, who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board, has come across rumors that the house, which is owned by the German federal government, will be used as accommodation for asylum seekers in the future.
"I exclude that." As the property continues, Jochner-Weiß could not say, there are several considerations.
At present there is a short-term care of the Caritas and a day-old psychiatry.
"What better could not happen to us, such an opportunity will not come back," says Fischer about the quasi-movement to the Lech, which was "positive and very understanding" by the employees.
There was no real perspective for the house where fishermen have been working as chief physician for over 30 years.
He had been asked by Schongauer colleagues to take over the position of the medical director.
Peißenbergenberg Hospital (one hundred beds) has been repeatedly threatened with closure in the past decades, departments have been closed, for example surgery and obstetrics.
The handballers of the Rhein-Neckar Lions are required tonight (20.15 hrs) at the Bergische HC.
The leader of the Bundesliga is the clear favourite in Wuppertal, but there is no reason to boast.
In the past season, the Badeners had a painful defeat at the BHC and had something to do with it.
Hunting accident with two injured at Pratau
Two tractor drivers were severely injured by shootings during their corn harvest on Tuesday afternoon.
During the arbens on a corn field near Pratau (Landkreis Wittenberg) several hunters were in use, as the police reported.
After a gunshot, a 63- and a 22-year-old man suffered serious injuries and was taken to hospitals.
How exactly the accident could have occurred was initially unclear.
The criminal police have been determined.
Missing 16-year-old from Rhineland-victims victims of violent crime
A suspect led the police to the body of 16-year-olds missing from Rhineland-Palatinate since Saturday.
In the interrogation, the 20-year-old admitted to have killed the young people and thrown their bodies into a canal in Rockenhausen.
A 16-year-old missing from Rhineland-Palatinate since Saturday has been victims of a crime of violence.
The body of the young woman was found in Rockenhausen near Kaiserslautern on Tuesday evening, as the prosecutor's office and police announced on Wednesday.
A 20-year-old who was also arrested on Tuesday evening is considered to be suspected of action, who admitted the act and led the investigators to the location of the body.
The 16-year-old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after she had not come home as agreed on the eve of a visit to Rockenhausen.
In the search for the young woman, the investigators first encountered personal objects of the victim.
Finally, when polls were conducted in the circle of friends and acquaintances of the missing persons, a suspicion against the 20-year-olds emerged.
The alleged perpetrator then led the police to a canal in Rockenhausen, where the body was found.
According to the arrester, the authorities admitted in the police interrogation that they had killed the 16-year-old and put the body in the canal.
The 20-year-old was to be presented to the arrester on Wednesday, the investigators put him to death.
Further investigations are to be carried out on the further circumstances of the case.
Refugees need accommodation: Study warns against housing gap
The location on the German housing market is tense.
More and more refugees are also looking for an affordable stay.
Pressure on the housing market is growing.
Social housing is facing a challenge.
The distribution struggles on the German housing market have long begun.
With the arrival of refugees and jobseekers from the EU, more and more people are pushing into a market that is already overburdened in many major cities.
They compete with low-income citizens for the last affordable apartments.
To meet the demand for affordable housing, 400,000 new units would have to be built each year by 2020.
This is the result of a study on behalf of the Association Alliance "Social Housing".
For comparison: 260.000 units will be finished in Germany this year.
This lacks 140,000 apartments.
After the first three months of their stay, refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in a first reception accommodation.
Many then hit the housing market and join the long snakes in front of the rental apartments.
According to the Federal Statistical Office, less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent last year.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising numbers of refugees.
The study is also a significant failure in the housing policy of recent years.
Germany is moving ahead of a housing deficit, which is growing from year to year.
Currently, around 770.000 housing units were missing in the agglomerations, complains Matthias Günther, author of the study.
Therefore, many professionals lived in large cities in WG-rooms.
Young adults remained involuntarily longer at the "Hotel Mama" because of the flaw on the housing market.
In the major cities, the number of square meters per head has fallen again for the first time in recent years.
In order to solve the problem, the "social housing" alliance proposes a new start.
New incentives are to stimulate social housing.
For example, the land acquisition tax could be waived and the land tax on eligible dwellings suspended on a temporary basis.
Moreover, according to the Alliance attractive tax depreciation options are necessary.
The funding programme for refugee accommodation of the State Bank KfW is already well received by cities and municipalities.
A good week after the start had already been obtained on Monday evening with 184 million euros already more than half of the available around 300 million euros.
Now the project could even be increased.
Refugees have free guidance: Croatia and Slovenia set up corridors
After Hungary there is virtually no more passage, as more and more refugees choose the way through Croatia.
Zagreb announces that it will grant transit through Slovenia to the north without obstacles.
However, the route is dangerous.
Croatia wants to agree with the neighbouring country Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
"I have spoken to the Slovenian Interior Minister, and if necessary, we will organize a corridor," said Croatian Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone.
The EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
Following the closure of the Serbian-Hungarian border, hundreds of refugees have moved to Croatia to get to Western Europe from there.
500 people have come across the border with Tovarnik, reports the Croatian TV station RTL.
Hungary had closed its border with refugees the day before.
New laws that came into force on the same day also make ordinary asylum procedures in Hungary practically unnecessary.
Croatia wants the refugees to pass through.
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said, "You can travel through and we will prepare for this opportunity."
These people are there, they are women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
However, it was people who did not want to live in Croatia.
In the morning, the Croatian police took up the first refugees on Serbia's border with the EU's neighbouring country Croatia.
According to most media reports, they came from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They came both by bus and by tax to the Serbian border town of Sid.
Immediately after their arrival, they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia.
On the Croatian-Serbian border, refugees do not encounter border fences.
For this the border strip carries other dangers: there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav civil war in the 1990s.
Miners should now quickly create a safe passage.
However, after the closure of the border, hardly any refugees come to Hungary.
On Tuesday, the police counted 366 people.
Shortly before the closing of the gate on Monday it had been 9380.
The new Hungarian laws classify the overcoming and damage to the border fence as a crime.
In the southern Hungarian border town of Szeged, 35 criminal proceedings were initiated.
The convicted are in danger of imprisonment for up to five years and the deportation from the country.
According to the immigration authority, on Tuesday a total of 94 asylum applications were received in the new transitzons established at the border, of which almost all - 93 - were received at Röszke's most important transition.
Among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two older people.
On Wednesday morning, 40 refugees were still there.
In practice, however, no one has any more prospects of obtaining asylum in Hungary.
In Hungarian opinion, Serbia is a "safe third country".
The rejected asylum seekers are to be postponed there.
In front of the transit zone in Röszke, only a few hundred refugees were gathered.
In Röszke, workers began cleaning up.
They collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people had left on the roadside in recent weeks.
Lockers were dismantled and one of the reception camps in the border area was rebuilt.
No one wanted to comment on the objective of this conversion.
After the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary, Austria can reach only a few refugees.
The country has also strengthened its border controls.
However, some 20,000 migrants were still in the country according to government data.
In Salzburg, about 1400 people are waiting to continue their journey to Germany.
The train transport from there to Germany was stopped in the morning by order of German authorities.
In Freilassing, smaller groups of refugees arrived regularly on foot.
Mayor drove "Britishes" across the border
"We were busy cleaning up after the bridge festival on Sunday, when suddenly ten people with suitcases stood at the entrance of the tent," said Wernstein's mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted by train to Passau.
However, because Germany had surprisingly stopped rail transport with Austria on Sunday, it was for them in Wernstein," said Stadler, who immediately offered his help and the stranded, together with two other helpers and their cars, drove across the border to the Near Passau.
Before, we first tasted the unexpected guests, with jause and drinks.
We said we'd take her to Passau by car.
"That was of course for us," says Stadler in the OÖN conversation.
They were very grateful.
A man could not take it to hand over a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire department.
"That was very good for us," says Stadler.
The stranded train passengers had changed from a ICE to a regional train in Wels on Sunday evening towards Passau, to try the border after the short notice that the train traffic to Germany was stopped, but still across the border.
However, the regional train was stopped in front of the border in Wernstein am Inn.
In Wernstein the cross-border is generally high in the course.
The bridge festival connected with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday party, previously a two-bridge race sporty - organized by the Union Wernstein and Bavaria from Neukirchen.
The fact that Viktor Orbán now sends more tens of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypocritical policy:
Instead of helping in the Röszke camp immediately to build structures that guarantee humanity, our Chancellor has made the attitude of the Hungarian government highly official and public in the dark circle of National Socialism.
The sufferers of this policy are not just those Austrians who are now faced with chaotic conditions in the border regions.
The refugees will also have to find that the "promised land" that she has invited and welcomed is nothing but another refugee camp.
It will be a great challenge, given the continuing flows of refugees and the approaching winter, to create humane conditions for those seeking protection.
And it will be even bigger - to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad looking for 35,000 winter quarters
Konrad's got all his hands on the refugee home.
Christian Konrad is used to his word being weighty.
The government has used the former powerful Raiffeisen banker to set up quarters for the thousands of refugees.
The chaos in the first recording centre Traiskirchen has already been mastered by Konrad.
"We have no more homeless people in Traiskirchen," he reported on his first success.
The accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday also took place without a big whirl, said Konrad and praised the organizational "master performance".
The Ministry of the Interior, on the other hand, spoke of a "crisis situation".
In total, Konrad expects a need of 85,000 quarters in this year.
In order to fulfill the number, 35,000 more accommodation needs to be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 are to be provided to the countries, 15,000 of the federal government.
If it gets more refugees, we can make it.
"But it's not a barrel without a floor," said Konrad.
He has already had talks with the Heads of State or Government.
These would have assured him that he would also be able to create quarters for the coming refugees.
"It's going well in Upper Austria," said Ferry Maier.
The former VP-Mandater supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn, to explain how the Church will help.
The asylum coordinator also puts great expectations in the ORF action "Help Like Us".
On the platform, private persons can offer uncomplicated accommodation.
In addition, you hope for hotels that are empty in winter.
Konrad and Maier criticized yesterday the standards for accommodation as "very high".
In emergency times, it could not be that quarter givers have to comply with a certain height of the towel holders or the size of the headlights.
For a limited period of time, "not standards" should apply.
In contrast to the Ministry of the Interior, Konrad founded his experience.
I am an older gentleman, to whom one does not say the untruth in the face.
Persuasiveness is his most important weapon.
Konrad and Maier do not cause the Republic any costs, as they themselves explained.
They want to increase their number of employees to three to four.
Her own search for quarters has not yet been successful.
Konrad wanted to set up a container at Stephansplatz as an office.
However, there seem to be problems with approval.
Linz calls for a better division
For the time being, no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips Arena and Design Center for accommodation of refugees is planning the city of Linz.
This is not necessary at the moment, as the persons concerned can currently be accommodated without these measures, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
For the emergency, however, further locations are to be checked for their fitness.
Criticism is expressed by the head of the city about the division of refugees within the federal state.
Other districts also have to make their contribution here.
Seehofer: "Margins are not locked"
In a longer phone call with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), Landeshauptmann Josef Pühringer (VP) agreed on Monday to take further action on the refugee issue.
Seehofer assured me that the German borders will not be locked down.
The further journey of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany was still possible.
However, there are now the corresponding border controls.
Special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer be available.
However, those seeking protection would be brought to Germany by regular trains.
Of the other EU Member States, Pehringer once again called for greater solidarity on the refugee issue.
Austria's re-introduction of controls at its borders is "a logical consequence" for Pühringer from the actions of the Germans.
The next Runtastic is a question of time
The general renovation of the "New Shipyard" in the Linz industrial line is officially completed.
In four of the six floors of the office and production building, the listed IT group S&T has moved in and the rest (2700 square meters) is to be rented to young, innovative companies from the technology sector.
"In IT, the smart heads are our raw material - and we have to try to work for us," says S&T CEO Hannes Niederhauser.
He could imagine investing in startup companies of the New Shipyard and later also acquiring some.
From the very beginning, S&T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - of which Niederhauser promises a lot: "The next Runtastic is just a question of time".
1.7 million euros were invested by S&T in the site, 3.3 million euros from the Techcenter, each belonging to one third of the city of Linz, the State of Upper Austria and the Federal Government (FFG).
The building is leased from Linz AG for 60 years to S&T and Techcenter.
30 percent of the 2,700 square meters of remaining space in the building are already rented out, and for another 40 percent there are requests.
Lia-Peroni owner opened second business in the arcade
The new shop focuses on Furla handbags.
Actually, Jutta Breit wanted to raise a dog.
The 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni had to temporarily postpone this project in the dove market arcade: finally, she has now grown in the form of another business location.
In the Furla-Shop compared to the store in which she sells bags, suitcases, shoes and robes from different manufacturers, everything is now about women's handbags of the Furla brand, wallets are starting at 75 euros.
Larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
The new shop has been in operation since yesterday.
Several weeks ago, it was rebuilt.
"But I've been thinking about opening another store for a long time," says Breit.
The decision was crucial, among other things, that Furla producers, who are at home in Bologna, were also encouraged by the idea of their own location, where only their handbags are sold.
"We are the only ones in the large Linz area who sell this brand," says the mother of two daughters, who even has Italian roots.
Her fashion interest has been put wide by her mother in the cradle.
I'm most good when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices.
Why so many women are caught in the sight of a beautiful handbag, even the specialist can't answer with the last certainty.
Maybe it's because a beautiful bag enhances every outfit.
The Brulljesmacher from Kallstadt
The Palatines of Donald Trump came from a place whose inhabitants are called leaders.
This property also connects some with the billionaire who wants to become the U.S. president.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for insurgents.
Whether he is a foreigner, annoys journalists, or reveals knowledge gaps in international crisis policy, the candidate for the U.S. President's Office is robbing the election campaign.
And cut it off well.
This is also registered in the Palatinate city of Kallstadt, where the grandparents of the real estate billionaire come from.
The New Yorker with the hairfry is a term for many in the wine village on the Weinstraße.
Some people in the 1200-inhabitant town are related to it.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Palatinate: Donald Trump, here in election campaign mode.
The Kallstädter Simone Wendel filmed a film about Trump.
And what do the villagers think about his goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world?
"I think they find this to be some sort of exciting, but they are not so deeply impressed in their Kallstadt style," says Simone Wendel.
The native Kallstädterin has made an amusing documentary about the place and its famous Spüsslings, among which the Ketchup family Heinz also counts in addition to Trump.
Trump, who is not known for modesty, is also spoken in "Kings of Kallstadt" (2014) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he lived in Kallstadt.
To the King of Hearts he did not bring it there.
While there is respect for family performance, Trump's opinion is also tending to be "a bit of a grandma", says Wendel.
By chance, the nickname that Kallstadt had in the vicinity was "The Brulljesmacher" - to Hochdeutsch: the leaders, she says.
Trump comes from the village of the principal.
The Trump's success story began in 1885, when the later grandfather emigrated and opened a place for gold tombs in the USA.
The foundation stone of the real estate group was the first real estate purchase in New York.
But the life of the grandparents was not free from tragedy: their desire to return to their homeland on a permanent basis failed in the Bavarian state of which the Palatinate belonged at that time.
He had not taken Trump because he had once left without permission, the director of the Institute for Palatinate History and People's History, Roland Paul, had declared his film launch.
Trump is the grandson of an "illegal emigrant".
This is in contrast to the sometimes marked statements of the offspring.
He had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the U.S. and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.
"Just like the poltert, this is not so sympathetic," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative of Trump ("The Grandma was a born Trump, the grandfather was born Heinz").
The retired man sees the American rather distanced, "he's always so intoxicating."
Does he think Trump's coming?
"I can't imagine that," says the 72-year-old.
"He never took care of Kallstadt."
The pensioner Veronika Schramm mentions, like many Kallstadter, that a descendant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit, which was generally well received.
"I can't imagine that," says the 68-year-old.
They think it's better if he doesn't win the election, because "he has such radical views, I don't know if that's good".
If those who at the time of his grandfather in the U.S. had been saying it had been like him, "he would never have arrived there."
"There are more interesting topics than he is," says Winzerdaughter Sarah Bühler.
And as president?
"My president isn't," she says.
And: "The grapes will be ripe without President Trump."
Wendel’s film, for which Trump had been interviewed for a long time, has seen 12,000 cinematists, and the interest is also awakened in the United States.
The municipality of Ramsau near Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "mountain village".
The 1800-inhabitant village in the Berchtesgaden National Park on Wednesday received the award for gentle tourism from the Vice-President at the Deutsche Alpenverein, Ludwig Wucherpfennig.
In Austria there are already 20 "mountain villages".
In the neighbouring country, the Alpine Association is responsible for awarding the award.
A "mountain village" may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants.
At least one fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the reviews, despite the attempts of Nine to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson hurry to Canberra to report following the loss of leadership of the liberals, but it did not make any major shifts in the reviews for Today.
Nine's breakfast show was broadcast by the federal capital, when Malcolm Turnbull managed to overthrow Tony Abbott.
The Rival Sunrise, with the presenters David Koch and Samantha Army, was part of a one-week series of international television shows in London, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This disadvantage of the distance seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise averaged 397,000 spectators in the five capitals, compared with Today 339,000.
Today achieved a slight increase over the ratings for Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its number remained behind that of the last Thursday (343,000).
Today has closed the gap to Sunrise in recent months.
Today averaged 318,000 compared to the 330.000 of Sunrise in August.
At the beginning of the year, the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September Sunrise stands in an average of 349,000 spectators at 314,000 at Today.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change concern these mornings more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for the review!

The big news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial star of Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father, who decided to settle down with his two children on the coast of New Zealand, reached a very impressive number of 1,219 million spectators.
Critics had wondered if Thomson could wear a hit-show solo without the Rafters Star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night answered with a clear "yes".
The X-Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.136 million spectators and easily beat The Block (838,000) and TBL families (726,000).
Seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17:00 to 5.30) of the new quiz show, moderated by Andrew O'Keefe, averaged 446,000 spectators.
The second half hour (17:30 to 18:00) jumped to 623,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire's hot-seat (613,000).
On Monday evening, the first half hour of The Chase Australia reached 520,000 spectators and in the second half hour, 720,000 satisfied.
Hot-seat average 620,000.
The decline in the quotas for the second evening of The Chase Australia is expected to make Nine confident that Hot-Seat will finally prevail at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia is a substitute for a million dollar minute that failed to overwhelm the McGuires show.

The last three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
Secret revealed?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may not know who wins The Bachelor.
The woman, where Sam Wood finally ends up in The Bachelor, was wrapped in the greatest secrecy.
And none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons Fellows the day before three become two, you may have accidentally given an indication of who the winner will be.
Sam Wood holds his lips firmly sealed until the finale on Thursday
All three women have been lyrical about why Wood is the perfect man, calling his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner.
However, if the question is asked "If you don't, who should get Wood's last rose?", their answers might become to the game spoiler who won the heart of the bachelor.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski both quickly - except themselves - called Mackay the best partner for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day.
"From the moment I went into the house and noticed (Sarahs) and Sam's energies, I felt that they were quite compatible, and I thought that throughout the course of the show," said Jeavons Fellows.
"Sarah stands on earth with both feet, it is so much fun to be with her," added Markoski.
I saw them together, and they have the right chemistry.
They feel comfortable and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood are well suited as a couple.
From her point of view, Mackay said that last week the house visit made it clear to her that Wood could be "the One".
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and the family, it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now set to him without reservation," she said.
And when she was asked who to choose Wood, if not her, she was mysterious.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I love the remaining girls alike - it is a decision between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast on Ten on Wednesday at 19:30.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent inquiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a smart decision.
Some trainers would have banished Hayne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a range as the Aussie-Rugby-Liga-Convert did on his first point-return on Tuesday on the 20-3 victory against Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and gave Hayne the next opportunity to return to a point and also to the running game after an injury by Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the dressing cabin after the game.
Instead of grinding his rookies in front of the rest of the team through the mill, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly strengthened Hayne in his press conference after the game.
The 49er sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his lost catch and take care of the next game.
Jarryd Hayne fits at a point that was restored in the first quarter of the Minnesota Vikings
It was certainly not the start that Hayne and his massive Australian follow-up had hoped for for his NFL debut.
After the Fumble Hayne left the field and later told the Australian Radio Duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not imagine a worse start into his NFL career,
"That was a thing that happens now, you just take care of the next game, and that's it," said Hayne.
Hayne compared the Schnitzer with his original debut in 2007, when a pass in his own in-goal area led to a try for Queensland.
Overall, it was still a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne poses for a photo with fans and holds an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss the rights of gays
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man, was arrested on a Siberian field of arms force.
After openly challenging President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was sentenced, confiscated his oil company Yukos, and stopped his democratic efforts.
The free voters demand the recruitment of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high numbers of refugees.
Chief of Party and political groups Hubert Aiwanger warned at the beginning of the FW autumn clause in Großwallstadt against a severe crisis in Bavaria's schools if there are no corresponding new teachers for the many new students: "We need at least 1000 additional teachers to protect the schools from the collapse," said Aiwangerer.
"Other than that, we will be given faults in the Bavarian education system."
The Landtagsfraction der Freie Wahler meets until Friday in the Lower Franconian municipality.
In fact, very different main themes were planned.
But the record number of refugees now dominates the Free Election Meeting.
"Of course, the topic of asylum will be superimposed," said Aiwanger.
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria, as they did during the Yugoslavian wars in the 1990s.
"That's not how it goes, we have to deal with the causes," said the free electorate.
Rejected asylum seekers want to postpone free voters as soon as possible.
That's why Aiwanger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum cases: "We also need at least 50 new asylum judges," said Aiwanger.
The FW chief criticised that several federal states were not consistent: "We needed uniform national standards."
"Bavarn's moving away, not others."
"We need to become more capable of action."
However, national policy should not fall under the table in big wall city.
For many years a permanent burner will remain on the agenda: education policy.
For the new school year, Minister of Culture Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) started the pilot trial "Middle Plus" at 47 Gymnasia, in which an extension of the secondary gymnastic level is tested from three to four years - in the result it will take nine years again until high school.
But that doesn't go far enough for Aiwanger.
"The topic of G9 needs to be accelerated," said the FW chief.
We demand freedom of choice for all those who want it.
Free ride at the G9 wherever it is desired.
Harder Wall Street helps Dax jump on the jumps
The German stock market has closed down with profits after a long line of directionless and nervous trade.

In the USA, the Dow-Jones-Index recently recorded about 1 percent in the plus.
Many bankers expect that the markets will be on the spot this Friday until after the interest rate decision in the US and also for the big decline on the term stock exchanges.
The discussion about the loads from the nuclear exit pushed RWE's shares to a record low in the meantime and also left deep traces at Eon.
According to "spiegel", German energy companies may lack 30 billion euros of provisions.
The Federal Government demented the figures mentioned in the press.
The shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered something, but in the end they lost 3.31 percent (RWE) and 6.15 percent (Eon).
Infineon shares increased by an additional 3.22 percent at the Dax peak.
According to a dealer, a positive report from the US investor magazine "Barron's" from the weekend followed.
According to this, investors were currently paying too little attention to the German chip maker.
Investments in future-oriented wafer technologies and focus on the car market should pay off.
Car values were in demand: Even in the traditionally weak summer month of August, more cars were sold than in the previous year, as the Acea Industry Association announced at the start of the International Automotive Exhibition IAA in Frankfurt.
The papers of Autobauer Daimler and BMW increased by 1.34 percent, respectively, by 2.21 percent.

The dollar thus cost 0.8846 (0.8875) euros.
4 people killed after police shot rubber on demonstrators in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber in a crowd demonstrating against the proposed new constitution, said one officer on Wednesday.
The violence broke out on Tuesday evening in Rupandehi District, about 175 miles west of Kathmandu capital.
Bishnu Prasad Dhaka, Chief District Officer, said that more than 1,000 demonstrators had gathered outside a police station, some of them throwing stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhaka said the police had used tear gas and then shot it in the air before resorting to rubber shots.
20 police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the used rubber shots, known to be able to kill but traditionally used as less deadly alternative, apparently produced such a high death rate.
The debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal's southern levels, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say that new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence.
There were also protests in western Nepal by the ethnic group of the Tharus, who want their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been in violent conflict since the 10th century.
August, when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centrally governed for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008, but the legislators have accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
The legislators voted this week on certain clauses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu, and officials have said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday.
Construction area planned in the city
The property at the Emder Jugendzentrum Alte Post is to be rebuilt.
The city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000-square-metre area.
A mixture of trade, trade and housing is planned - but concrete offers are not yet available.
Emden - The city of Emden wants to market a plot of approximately 4,000 square meters in direct proximity to the youth centre Alte Post.
The preparations for this are under way.
It is planned to use the site for a mixture of trade, trade and housing.
You wait for such offers, it's called on the part of the city.
Which investor is in question is not yet clear.
Accordingly, contracts have not yet been concluded.
The city of Emden had already bought a part of the property located on the Ringstraße / corner of Große Straße and had the building on it torn down a few months ago.
Project Hieve: Details are on the table
The plans for the holiday home settlement at the Kleine Meer near Emden take shape.
For the first time, the investor presented public plans for the project.
Some people are still worried - they fear the sale of their leisure retreat
For months behind closed doors had been negotiated, grumbled, debated and drawn.
Now the plans for a new holiday home settlement near Emden are on the table.
The interested party, the medium-sized Emder company "System-Bau", presented its plans for the first time publicly on Monday evening in the Emder Council's Urban Development Committee.
This item was originally on the non-public part of the agenda.
Under pressure from the project critics and the FDP group who accused the investor and the administration of secrecy, Ralf Behrends went from the system building management to the offensive: "We don't have an answer to all questions yet," he said to the council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it's good to be able to meet all the rumors now.
The approximately EUR 10 to 12 million project has been under discussion for months.
Violent reactions among seamen who had come to the meeting prompted the pictures and new details of the desired hotel building.
Roberto Schulz, the owner of the sea and member of the board of directors in the representation of the residents, Pro Hieve, complains: "This will be a giant monastery, which will dominate all other buildings".
In addition, like many other project critics, he fears that traffic would increase significantly due to the intended size of the plant: "All bus loads must come to calculate this," says Schulz
However, what is happening exactly on the well a hectare area of the former restaurant is still open.
There is no operator yet.
"We must have had a coherent concept first," said Ralf Behrends.
Because this was still missing, the construction plans were also variable.
Gemini offspring at Gorillas in the Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo is delighted with young people at its Gorillas.
The 26-year-old Dian brought twins into the world yesterday.
Twin births are rare with Gorillas.
The last in a German zoo is almost 50 years ago and was also in Frankfurt in 1967, it is said by the zoo.
The genus of newborn gorilla twins is not yet established, as Mother Dian has kept them close to the body so far.
At first, the picture had reported.
NHC predicts 60 percent chance for cyclone south of Cape Verde Islands
On Tuesday, the US National Hurricane Center predicted a broad pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verden islands, which has a 60 percent chance to develop into a tropical whirlwind over the next 48 hours.
Another clearly defined low-pressure system, such as in the middle between the Cape Verde Islands and the Small Antilles, also has a 60 percent potential to form a tropical vortex in the next two days, added the weather experts stationed in Miami.
Google launches doubling donation campaign to collect $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL. O) announced a doubling donation campaign aimed at raising $11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have overrun the European nations as they flee from war torn and impoverished countries.
Google has an unusual personal approach to the announcement of the donation call on its blog.
Instead of letting a manager make the announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven years old, wrote about her personal experiences.
"Our journey included many dark train and bus rides, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But since the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe, many people like my family are desperately looking for help.
The donations go to four non-profit organizations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants: doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million will be doubled to $11 million on google.com/refugeer.
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has driven out more than 4 million people this year.
Many are also fleeing Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq, and Libya.

Weight loss surgery can be helpful for easily overweight diabetics.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years after a new study.
It is still too early to say whether easily overweight people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatments.
"Death data take a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on weight loss surgery, who wrote an editorial on the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss operations or obesity surgery, use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to feed.
Over the years, obesity surgery has proved to be efficient for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted in people who are obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a certain amount of weight in terms of size, is considered to be normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight and people with a BMI of over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, the researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital used data that they have collected in a study since 2007, comparing two types of obesity-chirurgy - gastric bypass and gastric tubing - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI among those undergoing this operation decreased from 31 to 24.5 to the end of the fifth year in this study.
Meanwhile, the BMI remained in those receiving non-surgical diabetes treatment approximately at 29.
Among those undergoing surgical surgery, 36% of the diabetes was completely and 28% partially resolved.
In the medical-treated group, diabetes was completely dissolved only at one percent and partly at only about two percent.
In addition, the results of the blood pressure controls, the triglycerides and the "bad" LDL cholesterol were "generally better in the 'surgical' group," the authors found out.
The researchers also monitored the patient blood level of haemoglobin A1c, which reflects the blood sugar levels over time.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.
After surgery, the average haemoglobin A1c level decreased from around 9 percent to around 6 percent.
In the medical treatment group, however, it remained stable at about 8 percent.
But this better "glycaemic control" - as you reflect in the improved haemoglobin level A1c - did not reduce mortality in five years, said Chief Researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the bypass-chirurgy group had lost more weight compared to the gas trektomy group (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), achieved greater decreases in BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and haemoglobin A1c (3.1 % vs. 2.1 %) and rather a complete overcoming of diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
While the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years, there are indications from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, it was about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years in obese people undergoing obesity - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patients, Blackstone said it was soothing for people with a BMI below 35 who were interested in the procedure.
"This is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group," she said, without an increased risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient with his BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long to get people to take this seriously," she said.
I think as soon as they have accumulated these genetic changes that have closely linked their bodies to obesity and diabetes, a reversal is really difficult."
Love Story Plays in Hunsrück
It is a topic that is currently increasingly being considered in Belletristics: a young woman, unpopular and unappreciative at school, meets the swarm of her youth after years, and this one falls in love with her.
This is also the case in Luisa Binder's recently published novel "Truly We Are Not So".
Beyond the history of love, the novel should be especially interesting for Hunsrück readers, because it plays in Borweiler and the surrounding villages.
The main professional author grew up in Langweiler and is pleased that she was able to set up a literary monument to her hometown.
"It is impossible for anyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT-News
Europe could not accept all refugees, said the Dalai Lama, adding that the real solution to the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to the violence in the refugees' homelands.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten-day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, dedicated to ethics studies.
He called for the interests of humanity to be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents under the given circumstances.
He also stressed that although the response of the Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admirable, the situation is not appropriate.
"It is impossible for anyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria’s efforts to deal with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"To take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you need to think about long-term solutions, such as real peace and real development, mainly through education, for these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Finally, we need to think about how killing is reduced in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of violence.
"The use of violence has never solved these problems," he added.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush's actions after the 11th September terrorist attack and revealed that the violent response of the US was a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 11 September, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to solving this problem lies in non-violence.
"I know his motives were good, but he used violence, and that caused unexpected consequences," said the Dalai Lama.
Fourfold increase in the intake of hand disinfectant by children over the last 4 years
Gift control centres in the USA report an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of 12 who swallow heavily alcoholic hand disinfectants, says the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, Director of the Georgia Poison Center, cases of revenue from hand disinfectant in children under 12 years of age reporting poison control centres increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children are increasingly coming to these products, and unfortunately a percentage of them are going to be in the emergency room," said Lopez CNN.
He said that some children deliberately drink disinfectants while some do it to impress their friends or because of a bold sample at the social media.
Videos on YouTube show how young people drink disinfectants only because of a cheap experience.
Youths are said to have mixed disinfectants with alcoholic mouth water to obtain a harder drink.
Younger children can be attracted by attractive fragrances of disinfectants.
"A child doesn't think this is bad for it," Lopez said.
Many of the more attractive (hand disinfectants) are those who are perfumed.
There are disinfectants with strawberry, grape and orange fragrance, which are very appealing to children.
Hand disinfectants contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in young children, few squirrels can lead to alcohol poisoning.
"It is highly concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Poison Emergency Call Centre at Kansas University Hospital, the Fox 4 transmitter in Kansas City.
So, you wouldn't let sip whisky stand around, but people leave these hand disinfectants in the reach of children, and when children get there, it's a quick way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six - year - old girl who had recently taken four squirrels of fragrant hand disinfectant in school, was brought to an emergency treatment.
Her blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice the threshold legally considered drunk in an adult, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency medical doctor who treated her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah listened to her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children's hospital for signs of brain trauma, as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and pushed her head, said Ritchey.
"That was very scary," said Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, CNN.
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez has recommended to parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or disinfectants and to store hand disinfectants outside the reach of the child.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants were associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women died in Ontario after swallowing hands disinfectants containing a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Health officials believe that the product contained methanol, a deadly solution, rather than ethyl alcohol, which was listed as an active substance.
In January, three students of the fourth class in New York State planned to poison their "common" teacher by explaining antibacterial products around the classroom," reports a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand disinfectant and banished her from her room.
The police considered the depraved plan to be a "stupid" and referred disciplinary measures to the school authority.
Villingen-Schwenningen: Three vehicles damaged
A 33-year-old driver was slightly injured in an accident on the cross span between Nordring and On Herden.
A 60-year-old truck driver drove on the transverse spandex towards the roundabout industrial area and observed too late that two pre-circuit vehicles had stopped at the roundabout.
As a result, he hit the rear of an Audi with his truck and pushed this vehicle to a Ford Fiesta in front of it.
In the case of the accident vehicles, the police informs us of material damage of about 10,000 euros.
The 33-year-old's Audi was no longer ready for driving and had to be dragged off.
Rumour kitchen: No disharmony at Celtic
Griffiths plays down the speech of Disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, Deila admits that the Hoops are in a bad place, but he will turn that over again.
Hearts will fight SFA for charges of Neilson and Warburton will be careful in January new commitments that could destroy the unity of the cadre
Dons increase leadership over Celtic to five points
ADAM Rooneys Elfmeter in the first half-time gave Aberdeen a short victory over Hamilton in Pittodrie, so that the Dons create a five-point gap between themselves and Celtic.
Griffiths Plays Talk about Disharmony
There are rumors about disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, which was spontaneously rejected by Griffiths, who insisted that he and his teammates are not under increased control as they prepare for confrontation with the Dutch table leader.
I don't think we feel under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
The lack of title competition in Scottish football bored Dutch - de Boer
The former Rangers middle field player and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic as there is no title race with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently an ambassador for Ajax, said, "In Holland they don't show any more highlights of Celtic games and why?"
It's because the Rangers aren't there.
People here are not just talking about the Rangers' return.
You're talking about the Old Firm.
They talk about both teams together and that's what interests them.
There's a lot of tension in the old company games, and it's not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games.
I'll turn things around, Deila swears.
RONNY Deila has accepted that Celtic must fight, but the Norwegian boss swore to turn things around.
After the defeat against Malmö and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League, the defeat against 10 men from Aberdeen followed, which now stand clearly at the top of the table with five points.
Deila said, "Celtic had bad times before, and we'll be back."
Now we want to get out of there as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what happens.
We feel that way - but we have to go on.
We really need the support of Celtic because that makes the players better.
It is so important to stand together now.
Warburton careful at January transfers
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago, which indicated that he was looking at some January transfers, Rangers-Boss Mark Warburton is careful when signing new entrants and insists that he does not want to disrupt the unity of the Ibrox cadre.
Brentford's ex-chief said, "The January Transfer Window is very different from the summer window."
The players coming in summer have this pre-season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic target Michu with withdrawal notice
Swansea storm Michu, with Celtic in conversation during the transfer period, indicated that he could withdraw when his contract with the Swans expires.
The 29-year-old has been plagued with a annoying ankle for two years and has not managed to finish this summer from Wales.
Hearts set on SFA battle for Neilson's comments
The Hearts led 2:1 when Paterson was sent out of the field and then lost 3:2, but the Red Map of the Defender was later lifted - the third Red Map of Collum, which was revoked in eight months.
Neilson sticks to what he said and insists, "I didn't question integrity, I didn't comment on any performance."
Griffiths swears to avoid Tynecastle
The incorruptible Hibee was reproved after he admitted to have sung a song with offensive lyrics about Ex-Heart's player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in a bar in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh in front of an Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a Derby, and it was the heat of the moment," said the stormer, adding, "It's safe to say that I won't return to Tynecastle if it doesn't play for Celtic Glasgow."
Tannadice Supervisory Board has confidence in Dundee-United Management
Simon Donnelly insists that Dundee United's board still has confidence in the management team to turn things around - but admits that the decline must end on the field.
I think Stephen Thompson has confidence in us.
We're going to get the boys back on their feet," said Donnelly.
McInnes glad to win "unbeautiful" against Hamilton.
Derek McInnes acknowledges that his team from Aberdeen had to fight Hamilton Accies in despair to see a seventh consecutive league victory, which brought them a lead of five points ahead of Celtic on the top of the table thanks to Adam Rooney's Elfmeter in the first half-time.
McInnes said, "There's no team that won everything, in cup games or leagues that haven't even won the games of this kind."
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while it is rising in the United Kingdom as a whole.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 164,000 between May and July, while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million in the same period.
Scotland's unemployment rate of 5.9% was above that of the UK of 5.5 percent, as the figures of the National Statistics Office (ONS) showed.
In the meantime, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 over the three months, with the number of employees now at 2.612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 percent over the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 73.5 percent.
Commenting on the latest figures, the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell said: "The government's long-term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy."
It is almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decrease in unemployment.
Drunk people interfered with the process
Since the security personnel could not provide the situation, the staff called the police.
Only with the use of pepper spray could the officials arrest the disruptors.
One breath alcohol test was 0.89 per mille in a 16-year-old.
The adult was picked up by his mother.
A 28-year-old had 2.15 per mille and was initially kept in custody.
Why I'm going to be a witness to an execution in Oklahoma
A little later today, except for a late legal intervention, I will see a man killed.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll sit in a spectator's gallery in the death chamber in Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by the poison syringe.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation already took place for the first time in January through his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day drew closer, I began to fear.
So why should I do it?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the US, and since more applications are often available than places, a macabre lottery takes place to decide who is elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to 5.
If you are selected, you will observe it without emotion.
I can't.
I'll sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friend, with whom I've developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hours visit.
I like that guy.
We often laugh a lot when we speak.
The prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of giving up my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner as he wants, and you get access.
I'm complaining to her.
She admitted that she "could have formulated it better," but she still thinks it's wrong what I do.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what I have to write, and I wouldn't, even if he did.
I told him he could remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be present to write there.
When he dies, he thinks that the public relations of the movement against the death penalty will help.
Kim Bellware, a reporter from the Huffington Post, will sit next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I've made.
I don't want to go back to all the details.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions following the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the act.
But I think there's a strong likelihood that he's not guilty of the murder.
I'm sure there's not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from this perspective, I'll see him die.
I cannot claim to be really objective.
There will be other reporters to whom you can contact.
What you'll get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death.
Man persuaded after wet police chase to get out of the Canning River
The Canning Vale police remained dry when he persuaded the man from the Canning River.
An attempt by a man from Perth to hang the police was unsuccessful when he found himself in shallow and swampy waters, only a few meters away from a police officer who tried "to gently persuade him to return to the shore."
The Canning Vale police were called to a house peace break incident in Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to escape them towards Canning River.
But he didn't get too far.
"He stood in the water and said, "I'm not coming out, come and get me," said Senior Sergeant Shandel Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too enthusiastic about wetting his uniform, so he applied a more reliable tactic - "A good police negotiation".
"Sometimes people do funny things to try and escape," said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Championship football player Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car in the trenches to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but inspired locals to the humorous planning of a Ben Cousin Biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that stewards tried to spy him out and threaten to stop racing
Peter Moody claims that stewards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his stables last year and threatened to end the race immediately.
He aimed at the stewards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they carried out a personal campaign against him with the late scratching of Lady Tatai for a racing day treatment, the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody said Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what's best for racing and found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cobalt tuft sample at Lidaris, which he can't explain.
He had held back for 18 months because of the espionage accusations and did not want it to "look like too high hanging grapes."
"I didn't want to say anything about it, and I've been sitting on it for a long time, but sometimes you're so frustrated that everything comes out at once," said Moody.
You know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'll go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to go around raised head, and I want my owners to think I'm trying my best for them.
If they start to think I'm not doing that, I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
I have to think about what I'm doing with my license.
Previously, Moody had raised the bomb in an interview with racing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy out his stable.
"Sitting eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I'll name when I'm asked - and offered him a job in my stables to provide information about what I'm doing inside my stables," said Moody on Racing.com.
You obviously believe I'm a fraud.
If that is the case, they should certainly touch their noses because they have failed in trying to grasp me.
Robert Roulston, former Chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, President of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of this at the time and are still present.
Should that make me think it's going to be personal?
Has the RVL acted cowardly and may make people outside of trainers responsible for what is going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I so bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think it's me.
Maybe they have to take my license and violate me, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying makes them think about it now.
But I have arrived at the point where I don't care, and that makes me sad.
That really saddens me.
I will put pressure on them and urge them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The trainer's frustration levels have developed with the long-lasting cobalt investigation at Lidari, and the late scratching led him to say that he was "throwing his license over the table."
Moody, best known for his preparation of the unbeatable master Black Caviar, called the race-day treatment rule "stupid" after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse's legs, which violates the rules.
"It is against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for this," he said.
"One of my employees mistakenly applied mud to the leg.
It could have been like that last night.
It could have been like that all day long yesterday, too.
But it had it on the day of the race.
Moody could be faced with a three-month disqualification for treatment with the pack on the race day. An investigation of this matter was opened.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules don't know anything about the horse.
"We all realize that we need rules, but here you've gone too far," said Moody.
Man Arrested for Driver Flight
The police arrested a man on the weekend after a collision with a cyclist and then a driver's flight in Cobram.
The cyclist was delivered to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on the Murray-Valley motorway on Saturday morning.
The police said the driver continued without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia stood up to the police in Shepparton.
It is expected to be charged for driving and for failing to provide assistance and for other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, stays in the hospital and is in a stable condition.
Melbourne-Storm-Trainer Craig Bellamy strikes back against rivals because of claims to ring fighting
Melbourne-Storm-Trainer Craig Bellamy has called criticism of the Tackling of his players "Agenda-Setting" by two Premier League favorites of the NRL.
Sydney Roosters Trainer Trent Robinson said that the referee allowed the storm players "ring fights" with his team during the high storm victory in the qualifying finale in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Bronco's coach Wayne Bennett made a hardly disguised comment on the Storm team after his team had won the final against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night. He called the game a "model example" of the Rugby League and said that the two from Queensland were not "too good" in the ring.
Bellamy defended the tacklimg of his team and said that they were only focused on their "contact" in the Tackling.
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading trainers on his team was confident because it meant that they were worried about being beaten by the storm team.
"This shows up again and again - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about ring fights when they beat us 24:2," said Bellamy on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything in our defensive system or techniques all year round, but in the last six weeks we have made our Tackles contact a real focus, and this has made the trend change for us.
Trent has been there for three years now, and he obviously has a great team to train. So he is probably not used to losing, so it was a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how this shows up again and again during this season.
Bellamy attacked Bennett's idea of "stressing football" and reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "a boring" football.
Wayne is talking about exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday night with ours on Friday night and how exciting her game was," said Bellamy.
I remember that in 2010 St George was criticized as a boring team, and Wayne said he'll take care of this shit.
But now he has a team that can play and that we consider exciting, especially his young players at their speed.
This is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of player.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants all his kind of football to play - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play like these.
I build more confidence because they say these things because they are a little concerned about having to play against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us when it was about the Big Games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm versus Roosters achieved a higher result than the game Broncos versus Cowboys.
The game of Broncos was probably a good game, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the result? 16 : 12 ?
Our game was 20:18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is that an exciting game?
Or are there breaks and no points that are exciting?
For me, it's the plans.
When they mention us, it means that we will meet them at one stage.
The Storm team is free this weekend because they have won the right to receive either North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks the next Saturday evening in the pre-final in the AAMI Park. Ticket sales will start next Tuesday morning.
Serbian with $200,000 Deposit after drug deposit
A man who may face a lifelong punishment for trying to get into possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled to Queensland was released for a security deposit of $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Solay, which came from South America via Vanuatu and laid in August in Coomera.
Maksimovic was observed meeting his fellow defendants in the marina during the morning and later at the Café Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilograms of drug in a Toyota echo.
Despite a potentially lifelong punishment for trying to own a commercial amount of cocaine, Maksimovic’s lawyer argued that there was no evidence that he was trying to own the whole amount and that in the café could have been for a harmless reason.
The judge at the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the risk of escape at Maksimovic.
He has clear relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he told the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal case, he lied to the police about his place of residence.
Maksimovic's mother and stepfather had offered a security deposit of $200,000 together to achieve his release.
"After reading the affidavits of the two persons, it is clear that the requirement of a security of $200,000 is a real financial burden," said Judge Flanagan.
But that alone will not be enough to stop him from appearing, he warned.
Maksimovic was released for bail, under the conditions that he would issue his Australian and Serbian passport, report to the police daily, and hold to an exit lockout from 18:00-06:00.
Accident on A5 near Karlsruhe: Führerhaus tears apart
A truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening in a three - truck accident on the 5th motorway near Karlsruhe.
Two of the three trucks involved had braked in front of a permanent construction site towards Basel.
The third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to elude left at the last moment, as the police told us.
The cabin of the accident causer was completely torn apart.
The driver was severely injured in a hospital.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe-Nord was completely blocked over six hours to 2 o'clock.
It resulted in a damage of 122,000 euros.
Stevan Hogg used phone of girls to lure pedophile to send pictures
One paedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to request images of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone when it was asleep, joined in an online messaging service, from which he received a number of improper pictures of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Hogg.
She saw it through, found the confusing messages, and immediately alerted her mother.
The police took care of it and saw the five pictures, then analyzed computers found under the address and discovered "respective" web searches that used terms for the search for improper pictures of children.
Hogg then claimed to the officials that he had done it because it would lead to "pedophiles on the Internet" and then he "set to be a police officer to scare them."
Attorney Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was a addiction - that he was addicted to scare people.
He admitted that the searches on the computer were carried out by him, but said it had happened because he wanted to claim to be a police officer to scare Pedophile.
He was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and whom he asked to send even more photos.
He said he did it to lure her.
He said he was sick in the head when he drank, and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added: "When the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was trembling and crying.
She then also saw the improper pictures on the phone and confronted the defendant with them.
The girl was interviewed and said that the accused computer and playstation used to talk to girls who looked much younger than he did.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, declared guilty, in the sense of the indictment, to have taken improper pictures of children on June 14th last year, to have violated the conditions on January 25th this year and not to have appeared in court for a hearing on March 24th this year.
Defense agent Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not appear in the register of sexual offenders, since one could argue that "no significant sexual element" is to be found in his offence.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the sentence until October to receive background reports on social work.
Hogg was granted a deposit in this case, but was held in custody for hearing other outstanding cases.
He was included in the list of sexual offenders before the date of the judgment.
Lockers alternate on small border crossings to Germany
More and more refugees are being taken away from the major control points on the German-Austrian border.
Many lockers, out of fear of discovery and arrest, made people more and more at smaller border crossings
on the Austrian side, said a spokesperson of the Federal Police.
Along the border river Inn, more than 1000 refugees have been taken up in the districts of Passau and Rottal-Inn since Tuesday.
They had reached the German side on foot over bridges and dams.
There they are received by federal politicians and forwarded for registration.
According to the Federal Police, much more refugees arrived at the Munich Central Station on Wednesday compared to the beginning of the week.
By 8.00 a.m. alone, about 700 people arrived in the state capital, said one speaker in the morning.
After the reintroduction of controls on the German-Austrian border on Tuesday 1759 refugees had reached the city.
Stuttgart: Outflow of tropical tower "Henry" expected in the southwest
Meteorologists warn against stormböen in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon.
Due to a low pressure area across Western Europe, warm sea air is currently streaming into the country, the German Weather Service (DWD) announced in Stuttgart.
The strong depth is the foothills of the tropical storm "Henry", which has moved from the Bermuda Islands across the Atlantic in recent days.
Heavy storms and thunderstorms are mainly expected in Baden.
According to DWD, there are also trees from 60 to 90 kilometres in the Black Forest, in the Swabian Alb and in the Bodenseekreis.
On Friday, the sun can be seen for longer.
The mass does it: Every two years the car builders at the IAA show their innovations.
In 2015, especially the compact cars are moving, which currently sell particularly well.
Cars from the compact class are currently in particular in demand: about 28.1 percent of new registrations were in this segment alone, according to Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt (KBA).
This is also reflected in the IAA (Public Days September 17-27).
Between all the futuristic concept vehicles and new top-class and luxury cars, many new compact models will be presented this year in particular.
One of the biggest premieres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra, which will stand with the dealers in autumn.
"The Astra is an extremely important model for us," said Opel CEO Karl-Thomas Neumann at the fair.
He's at the heart of the brand.
In order for the volume model to sell well, the new Astra should not become much more expensive for this.
Opel offers an entry point below the largest competitor VW Golf, which starts at 17 650 Euro.
The current Astra costs 16 990 euros.
The Astra is equipped with a new 1.4-litre engine with 74 kW/100 hp.
In addition, Hessen offers further diesel and petrol engines from 70 kW/95 hp to 147 kW//200 hp, including three-cylinder petrol engines for the first time.
Unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus, Opel Astra is only available as a five-door.
The second variant will be followed in spring by the combination, which can also be seen on the IAA.
And what is going to happen to new compact cars next to the Astra at the IAA?
Renault Mégane: Renault sends the fourth generation of his Astra competitor Mégane into the race.
At the trade fair, the Mégane can only be seen as a five-door version in a conventional and a highly sporty GT version.
He will be on the market at the beginning of next year, then also as a combination.
Infiniti: The Infiniti Q30 is completely new in the segment.
With the new model, the Nissan offshoot wants to find its position in the rapidly growing segment.
The compact infiniti with its curved lines fits fully into the design line of the brand.
The base model will receive a petrol engine with a power output of at least 90 kW/122 hp.
In the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW/109 hp or 125 kW/170 hp.
Suzuki Baleno: New in the segment is also the Suzuki Baleno, who celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt.
The model is offered with petrol engines, including a newly developed 1.0-litre turbo engine and a power of 82 kW/111 hp.
The maximum torque is 170 Newton meters (Nm) according to manufacturer specifications.
The sale start of the Baleno in Europe is in spring 2016.
DS 4: Not completely new, but completely renewed is the compact class DS 4, which can be seen on the IAA.
On the outside, the designers of the noble Citroën dipped mainly hand at the front section: Here the cooler grill was newly drawn and the changed headlights were equipped with LED technology.
In the interior, the infotainment system has been modernised, the number of buttons reduced by a touch screen and the Apple CarPlay integrated for the first time.
In addition, a series of revisions and new variants such as the updated Mercedes A-Class or the Peugeot 308 GTI are joined at the IAA in the compact class.
JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five square meters of cell are inhumane
The Federal Constitutional Court authorized an ex-prisoner of Tegel, who had been housed in a too small cell for months.
Because of the violation of their human dignity, prisoners are in principle entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in too small cells.
This was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday.
According to the judges, they can even hope for money if they have been imprisoned in the too narrow rooms for only a few days (As.: 1 BvR 1127/14).
Thus, an ex-prisoner was successful with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe: he was housed in the Berlin-Tegel judicial execution centre between June and November 2009 in a single cell with about five square meters of floor space; the toilet was not separated spatially.
After that, the man who, according to his lawyer, was now on his feet again, had been transferred to a larger cell.
Although his civil liability complaint for the unworthy terms of detention against the Land of Berlin failed.
However, the constitutional judges lifted the judgment of the Berlin Chamber Court and rejected the case for re-examination.
You see the man's human dignity hurt.
Chamber Court now decides on the amount of compensation
Even if, for legal reasons, only a few days of imprisonment in the period in question were valid for compensation, there was a claim for compensation.
Otherwise, "a reduction in the legal protection of the personality would be feared".
The court must now clarify the amount of compensation.
The constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past.
Only in April did they assign damages to a prisoner because he was locked naked in a cell.
According to a 2011 decision, the multiple occupancy of a cell without a separate toilet is also unworthy.
Furthermore, Karlsruhe confirmed on Wednesday the Berlin Constitutional Court, which had certified a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009.
For three months, the then applicant was housed between 15 and 21 hours a day in a cell similar to that in the Karlsruhe case.
The Berlin prisons had also come to headlines in recent weeks because of the lack of personnel.
Therefore prisoners are kept in prison for 23 hours, aggressiveness is increasing, even beatings are said to have already come because of the tense situation.
According to the judicial press office, 21 posts in Tegel are not employed due to the lack of young people, 19 are expected to fall away in 2016.
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy: "We'll do it"
The immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it.
What is happening in Germany?
Some 800,000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year, according to Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is even able to receive a million refugees.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: We can do this and we can do it."
What is relevant in Germany is the following overview.
According to different forecasts, apartments are used between 350000 (estimation of the Federal Ministry of Construction) and 400000 (estimation of the Pestel Institute) every year - for the next five years.
This is almost twice as much as is built before (250000 apartments).
The lack of living space is dramatic, but especially for affordable rental properties: Annually, 6000 to 80000 social apartments are excluded from the rental price, and these particularly cheap apartments will also apply for refugees.
Federal Minister of Construction Barbara Hendricks (SPD) therefore wants to double the funding, from currently 518 million euros to one billion euros.
This is far too little from the point of view of the Pestel Institute: 80 000 social housing needs to be created annually and the federal government should invest a grant of 6.4 billion per year.
Scientists and Federal Construction Minister agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in housing.
According to estimates by the Institute for Labour Market and Vocational Research, 55 percent of refugees in Germany can be in employment in the long term.
However, refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications to help them get started, criticises Claudia Walter, Project Manager for Integration and Education at the Bertelsmann Foundation.
However, integration of refugees is crucial if they are to find work in Germany.
Work is the key for social contacts, for appreciation in the host society, but also for the self-esteem of immigrants, says migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt.
There has been a political turn in Germany, according to Dränhardt: from the ban on the work of refugees to the recognition of work.
While there used to be a ban on the employment of asylum seekers up to five years old, this was reduced to three months in November 2014 as well as the residence obligation to restrict asylum seekers to a place of residence.
In society - also because of the shortage of skilled workers - the view has been that refugees should be able to access the labour market more quickly.
A major obstacle to access to the labour market is the lack of German knowledge.
There is not yet a sufficient supply of general and vocational language courses.
Studies also show that jobs are most often mediated through personal contacts.
The construction of networks is therefore, according to Dränhardt, the Königsweg to work integration.
The Berlin School Administration has found that only a few refugee parents give their children to the Kitas, an estimated 10 to 15 percent: "For the uprooted parents, it is first of all very important to keep the family together," says Ilya Koschembar, spokesperson for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration.
In order to convince the family of the benefits of the Kita, the administration distributes hand-held notes in different languages.
Should the need for educators increase sharply due to the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacity, for example by allowing more vocational schools.
In the countries, students without German knowledge are prepared for teaching in Welcome Classes.
However, they are not always taught by fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, by teachers who have only one qualification in German as second language.
There is no lack of them, says Beate Stoffers of the Berlin School Administration.
The German Studentenwerk estimates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany.
In principle, no federal state prohibits asylum seekers or patient persons from studying - the only exception was Berlin so far, but inner senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now abandoned his attitude.
Study-based refugees could be made easier to access the university.
For refugees with a residence permit or toleration no longer receive benefits under the Asylum Claimant Services Act when they begin to study.
In principle, the latter do not get a bafög, as they do not fall within the circle of the competent persons.
Patied refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be entitled to Bafög, from 1 January 2016 onwards this span is reduced to 15 months.
But this funding gap must also be closed, demands Steffen Krach, Berlin's State Secretary for Science, and the German Studentenwerk.
Students should get Bafög immediately.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many, religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should gradually grant Islam the same rights as the churches, and develop the existing state church law to a new state-religion relationship.
It would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare association, which takes professional care of the new arrivals.
The rights also include obligations.
For example, the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts and be ready to cooperate with the State in many areas and give it some control.
This also includes the willingness to take a hearty action against religious fundamentalism.
The chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany.
Those who wanted to carry out such conflicts in Germany "are immediately having their right to live here, in Germany," he said on Bavarian radio.
He proposed to translate the basic law into Arabic.
Integration will continue to be a topic of society as a whole.
This will also mean that the majority society will have to change, and the reduction of discrimination and racism will become more pressing.
Germany - as a result of European decisions - has for a short period of time had an anti-discrimination body and a General Equality Act.
But it learns very slowly, as the NSU murder series showed, in which police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for all: What migrant organisations and stakeholders of non-white Germans have been demanding for a long time and what international agreements such as the Anti-racism Convention Germany require must become reality in the coming years if the country is to remain peaceful and its new citizens are to take advantage of its possibilities - for the benefit of all.
In general, Germany is able to provide medical care for the previously expected refugees, says Dr. Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"As far as man power and capacities are concerned, we can do that," he said to the day's mirror.
However, additional money would have to flow into the system.
In order to avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery demands that all arrivals be handed over health cards as soon as they register.
Services provided could later be settled with the federal states.
And in the long term, it is highly questionable to feed so many people with the limited service catalogue provided by the Asylum Claimant Performance Act.
Otherwise, doctors make the most of the language barriers.
So far, according to Berlin's health scientist Thea Borde, migrants are better informed about their diseases than other patients.
Not only in clinics, but also in medical practices, interpreters' expenses would have to be taken over.
Many refugees would have been helped, but also with more general medical contact points in the emergency ambulances.
And with another diagnostic look.
Among refugee children, for example, there are significantly more untreated disabilities, and young people are concerned with HIV education.
However, with some of the other disease pictures, German doctors are clear from their training, says Montgomery.
"Parasite infestation or tuberculosis is not so difficult to recognize." And as far as the medical lack is concerned, refugees may even be able to relieve themselves.
The Syrians have a sophisticated education system that many refugees are even doctors.
However, in order to be able to practice, they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly re-examinations.
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill according to estimates by the Federal Psychotherapist Chamber (BPtK): Most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
Especially vulnerable are refugee children, explains Dietrich Munz, President of the BPtK.
A recent study published by TU München proves that every fifth Syrian refugee child arrives traumatized in Germany.
Those who are suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder suffer, among other things, so-called flashbacks with difficulty of breath, dizziness, heart turbulence and death fears.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders, severe horror and emotional deafness.
In order to prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic, early treatment was necessary, Munz explained.
To date, however, only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive psychotherapy.
Although psychologically ill asylum seekers can apply for psychotherapy at the social offices, processing usually takes several months.
In addition, in the social services, experts or doctors who are not trained for mental illness would decide whether or not therapy is necessary.
This often leads to misevaluations, says Munz.
Manege invites you to dream
With the new production "Leience", the Circus Probst draws on the traditions of circus art.
The goal is to draw every age group into the spell of fascinating acrobatics, animal dressage and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus Probst invites you to the wheel on the brick to dream.
"Our passion is circus."
"I can't imagine living without my circus family," says Stephanie Probst, animal teacher and junior head.
"Leience" - under this motto is the current manegen production.
For more than 33 years, the circus has been in the hands of the Probst family.
So the gift of enthusiasm lies in the family's blood.
"It is important for us to take people away from their daily lives and take them to a completely different world for two hours," emphasises 27-year-old junior chief.
"Manegen cocktail with World City-Flair", says Director Reinhard Probst.
50 cities on the nearly 3,000 kilometers long tour can now experience this flair.
The circus program convinces with talented artists from all over the world.
Excellent at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family attracts the audience with joke and charm.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their crafts.
With the heroes of silent films, it wants to take the Cuban duo easy.
Easiness and mobility - with these words they identify themselves.
Her humorous art on the mast is supposed to conquer women's hearts in the storm.
The acrobatics of the Circus Probst are also fascinated with fingertips and jointness.
Balancing with the unicycle on a ball?
No problem for He Yuan.
Snakes fascinate and frighten people at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics like little others and fascinated with its mobility.
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect.
"The animals belong to our family," says Stephanie's mother, Brigitte Probst.
Mistakes in the position of circus animals are all too often the subject of various animal welfare organisations.
Stephanie Probst also comments: "If our animals are not well, we are not well either."
Around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every petting unit.
The "four-legged artists", as they are lovingly called, are read from the eyes as far as possible.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal doesn't feel well, it doesn't want to be in the way.
So the top commandment: take good care of the animals.
Especially for her Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of a ShetlandPony stallion and a zebra sheath, the Probst family is proud.
The two animals have lived together for eight years in a shed and nothing has happened.
"But then, suddenly, our little Jumbo was there," says Brigitte Probst.
The Zebroid is not yet ready for the mange, but it is the unique mascot of the Circus Probst.
So, for every visitor, there's probably something about it.
"One thing is safe," says Stephanie Probst: "Whether five or 1,200 spectators, we always do our best and are with us with all our heart."
The Circus Probst invites you daily from 17th to 20th September at 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. to its performances.
The program starts on Sunday at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m.
Thursday is family day, for the presentation at 5 p.m. the prices are reduced.
In addition, the animal show is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe gives false speech in Parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell down the stairs from a stage at the beginning of the year.
He remained unharmed, but the case video quickly spread through the social media.
Parliament's opening was also saddened by claims by opposition representatives that they had received anonymous death threats and that they were warned against accompanying Mr Mugabe's speech with bubbling calls.
Last month they had exploited it and interrupted it during his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) speaker Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their phones, which they warned against disturbing Mr. Mugabe's speech.
"The message comes from a number that is not displayed, but she has the title 'Death'," he said to journalists after Mugabe's speech.
It warns the Members of Parliament concerned that immunity ends in Parliament, and as soon as they leave Parliament, their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective.
The chief spokesperson said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was "anxious" about the dangers to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will reduce up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to reduce between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs in the framework of restructuring and savings efforts in the company's services.
HP will divide into two listed companies later this year and separate the computer and printer business from its fast-growing enterprise hardware and services business.
The expected job decline leads to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter, said HP in a statement.
"These restructuring measures will allow for a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard enterprise," said Meg Whitman, HP Chairman and Chief Executive, who will lead the unit after the separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and stronger focus than HP today, and we have a broad and deepened portfolio of businesses supporting companies in the transition to a new style of business," Whitman said.
As an independent company, we are better placed than ever before to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion of annual turnover and "will be focused on providing previously unattained, integrated technology solutions for companies", says the company.
It divides a company founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stanford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to produce electrical installations and their Palo Alto Garage has been called "the birthplace of Silicon Valley".
HP has undergone massive restructuring to deal with the departure of traditional PCs to mobile devices.
HP's action, the world's second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US technology companies, is the latest in this area, based on the conviction that closely focused companies provide better performance.
FC Arsenal Captain Mikel Arteta says that teammates must stand behind the injured Jack Wilshere in front of the match against Dynamo Zagreb
Wenger stressed to Wilshere that it was only September and, if his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there is no reason why he can't play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Willhere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England and, given his history, his participation in the European Championship will certainly be uncertain next summer.
The great shame in this current problem is that Willshere had finished the last season after a separate ankle injury and then returned to his old swing during the previous season.
"This kind of injury does not threaten the career," Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal well.
That's no big deal.
This was just an accident.
It was not related to his ankles or to the injuries he had before.
This may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger also acknowledged, there is the associated danger of further injuries whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It also develops an unpleasant pattern.
The investigation of Premier Injuries Ltd records 23 different diseases of Wilshere since his debut six years ago.
He also played in only 65 of Arsenals 157 league games in the last five seasons.
The broader picture for Arsenal is that in six out of eight seasons since 2007/08, they were one of the two Premier League clubs that record most of the injury days.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will continue during the last season.
"Sometimes when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain military power," Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to get over this.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm confident he'll do it and he'll go through a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Dinamo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on the next Wednesday, and Wenger sets up a rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta should start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and give the players that need a little break," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal's clear favorites are to continue through Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds with the greatest intimidation effect in Europe.
Dynamo is unbeatable even after 41 games after the "invincible" campaign was launched in the last season.
The stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening, measuring 3.2 on the Richter scale.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has drawn the lessons of the past season with the Champions League capitulation against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope of leading the club to his first European Cup triumph with his management.
"This drive is immense," Wenger said.
It's never worked at Arsenal.
We were very close to it in 2006, but on the other hand, I am long enough in business to be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the comedy show that gives us serious lessons about male friendships
The lack of similar representations in shows is obvious, especially in terms of how the need for men to open up has become even more desperate now than ever before, as suicide rates among young men prove on a 15-year high.
In 2013, it was the most important cause of death among men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and it remains three times more frequent in men than in women.
In an effort to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM - Campaign against a pathetic life) announced 2015 as the man's year, with the aim of challenging the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the struggle to meet this challenge.
A recent study in more than 2,000 high-school students with depressive symptoms found that if the sufferer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "healthy mood" his chances of recovery doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of spiritually healthy friends halves the risks of mental problems.
But of course you have to have friends first so that a friendship can work.
In the age of social media communication, with its focus on substance style, the immediateity of the response is often more important than a meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, life-loving and successful, even if in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, everything at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that has a profound impact on our mental health.
And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently explained, money really can't buy happiness.
The nice thing about Friends was that this focus was put on the head.
Every character was not defined by his work, but by his personality, which shined through the interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, moments of football watching in cozy armchairs and the longing of Ross for Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can definitely refer to it, even if they often hold back from completely exploring their feelings.
As one employee of the telephone soul care explained to me:... "My audience role for people who feel depressed and are at risk of suicide has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."
The men who contact us often do not feel able to talk to friends.
The old saying "I can handle it" has an enormous effect, such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when you talk about problems openly."
Friends is one of the shows that comes to my mind when I try to act on longer-term management mechanisms.
She clearly presents the small moments of male friendships.
As much as my objective outsider status via the phone may help people at moments of despair, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so if you're visiting Comedy Central FriendsFest with the new setting to celebrate the day, why don't you take your friends to a drink in the Central Perk?
Or, better yet, if you see someone sitting alone in Starbucks, give him a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends are sent to Comedy Central from beginning to end - the entire 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria meets to help PSG crush Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his hit against Malmö.
Di Maria meets at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG to pass Malmö.
Here are the game report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani held a course when Paris Saint-Germain started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmö in the Prince Park Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as a PSG player who led the French champion, but then they missed a number of opportunities before finally increasing their lead when Cavani reached a headball goal in the 61st minute.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donetsk also in Group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion, as they not only seek the qualification for the K.O. rounds, but also an improvement on the way to the quarter finals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it wasn’t a class game by Laurent Blanc’s team with Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s missed opportunities in front of the goal. He was later replaced in the game against his hometown team and against the club with which he started his illustrious career as early as 1999.
"It is not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League. Therefore, it is a good start to win 2:0, to cause our opponents problems and to look back relaxed, even if there are certain things that we still have to perfect over the course of the season," said Blanc.
"That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we haven't achieved one or two more goals."
After his injury, Ibrahimovic returned to the Paris team in one of three changes, which on the weekend could hold a 2:2 final decision on his own place against Bordeaux in the First League, but he was ostracized in the fourth minute by Di Maria.
The Argentine wingstorm was called the man who can take PSG to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United last month, and he indicated why, when he entered Marco Verrattis Pass behind the Malmö defense before passing Johan Wiland in the long corner of the net.
However, if someone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory that was disappointed.
Malmö, who beat Celtic in a playoff to reach this level, joined Anpiff with nine national players on the field and was with a five-man defense and two deep in the middle row a heavy opponent.
But besides a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, who passed far past Kevin Trapp's posts in the 34th minute, they offered little in the attack.
Instead, PSG itself sometimes gave up, with some mispasses and bad finals, not least by Ibrahimovic, who, in no less than five trials alone in the first half and then was abandoned after Cavani had used it after the restart.
Nevertheless, he proved much more skill when he put his fellow players into play, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic that turned Di Maria into a shot, which Wiland passed the post in the 52nd minute ...
The second goal finally fell shortly after the hour-mark thanks to Cavani. The Uruguayan thus achieved its sixth season goal after Ibrahimovic had fished up a left flank of Maxwell.
This ended all thoughts that Malmö could come back to the game, and only an excellent intervention from Wiland from a short distance to stop David Luiz, could keep the final result low before replacement player Ezequiel Lavezzi was finally recognized a goal.
The coach of Malmö, Age Hareide, later admitted that PSG played a class over his team, and the Norwegian said, "Our last champion league game was last December.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish League, which does not have the same level.
The skills games are not enough."
Get off Paris!
It was a great game of them!
Glencore collects $2.5 billion through stock sales
The Swiss-based mining giant Glencore, which is affected by falling raw material prices, collected $2.5 billion on Wednesday through a share sale as part of its huge debt eradication plan.
Glencore, registered in London, said in a statement that it sold new shares worth approximately £1.6 billion to pay off its own debts.
The company, which lost 57 percent of its market value this year, fights with falling raw material prices, as China's economic downturn pushes demand and has a devastating effect on markets.
The issue of subscription rights led Glencore's stock price at trade on early Wednesday morning to a rapid increase at the top of the London Stock Exchange.
The stock jumped by 2.77 percent to 131.60 Pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore announced last week the $2.5 billion share sale as part of the more comprehensive plans to clear up about one third of its $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new holdings to 125 Pence per share, which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday.
There were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 0.9 percent of the group.
Concerns regarding long-term growth in China have cut iron ore prices by about half, and coal, copper and other commodity prices have fallen by 20 to 40 percent.
Refugees arriving in Weimar
On Tuesday afternoon, after a long flight, 49 people reach the city administration in Weimar.
The refugees come from Syria, Albania, Afghanistan, Macedonia and Somalia.
The youngest arrival is a six-month-old girl from Syria.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the USA at the end of the month, the White House confirmed in a statement on Tuesday.
The visit, Xi's first official in Washington, will take place on 25 September and will reply to President Barack Obama's trip to Beijing last November, said the statement.
The U.S. President and the First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan at a state dinner this evening after the two leaders have held bilateral talks.
"President Xi's visit will provide the opportunity to extend American-Chinese cooperation on a number of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, while also giving President Obama and President Xi the opportunity to address matters of disagreement constructively," the statement adds.
XI, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to meet several US technology leaders on his way to Washington in Seattle before moving to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to address a number of controversial issues, including Washington’s concerns about alleged cyberspionage of China and its growing self-confidence in the controversial waters of the South China Sea.

On the rainy highway then came the evil awakening.
With a company in the district of Gotha you can fulfill the dream and once a V8 US sports car Ford Mustang Boss 302 with 440 hp can be rented out and driven.
So did a 29-year-old from the district of Gotha.
On the A 71 near Arnstadt the dream was off and over.
The 29-year-old lost control of the sports car, got into the sling on a wet road and went into the guideboard.
The sports car suffered total damage, nobody was injured.
The property damage is estimated at EUR 40,000.
Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented 2008 from moving to FC Bayern
World and European Champion Xavi has been playing for the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
The FC Bayern was obviously close to the commitment of Spain's superstar Xavi, who played for the Barcelona FC at the time.
Eight Spanish champions, three cup winners, four champions league winners, two club world champions, two European champions, one world champions - the title list of Xavi is breathtaking.
In the summer, the now 35-year-old left Barcelona after 24 years and moved to the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar.
However, in an interview with Marca, Xavi now reveals that he was already in Barcelona before the 2008 EM.
"They told me that Barça wanted to sell me."
"Madrid won everything at the time, we won't do anything," he says.
And that was also registered by FC Bayern.
Xavi: "There was an offer from Bavaria."
"Rummenigge wanted me."
To remember: In the summer of 2008, Jürgen Klinsmann took over FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason Xavi didn't change
But the change did not come about.
And the decisive man for this today works for the German record champion: Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: "Barça signed Guardiola and I played a great EM."
"Pep told me I wouldn't change that he couldn't imagine the team without me."
"That's how he got me."
Who knows how Bavaria's 2008/2009 season would have been with Xavi.
Xavi stood for Barca in the quarter finale of the Champions League against the Bavaria over the entire distance on the lawn, switched off the Reds (4:0, 1:1) and finally celebrated the King Class Triumph.
Matt Damon plays down diversity in filmmaking
Matt Damon faced African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion of diversity and said she would not be needed behind the scenes.
During a episode of Sunday Night by HBO's Project Greenlight, the experienced actor Brown interrupted the need for alternative perspectives, in relation to a black protagonist in the selected script of the project.
"When we talk about diversity, you do it when you occupy the film and not when you occupy the show," said Damon.
Brown responded shockedly, with insulted disbelief and cried out "Hoo! Wow. Okay," when The Martian's actor's comments strengthened.
Damon and Brown joined producer colleagues Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show finalists.
"I would like to ask people to think about it - whoever the director will be - how they treat the figure of the Harmony," Brown first said.
The only black person, and she's a nut beaten by her white beekeeper.
The producer of Dear White People was committed to directing the film for finalists Leo Angelo and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon replied that her direction could "give us something that we don't want at the end."
After the discussion was broadcast, the social media exploded from disapproval of Damon's comments.
Twitter user Mr. Pooni expressed his anger about the clip by writing "Matt Damon talks about the only black person in the room, so he can explain her diversity - this is SO WEISS that it hurts".
The Tweet earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since its release.
Damon's comments come at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the forefront of the social discussion.
After the teenager Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement achieved national effect and urged legislators and authorities to prevent discriminatory practices against colored halt.
In February the singer Prince made an allusion to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums still matter", (albums still have their meaning) he said.
Like books and black life, albums still have their meaning.
In recent times, leaders of the movement Black Lives Matter have published an explanation in response to the question of Fox News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter network is a love group," the leaders said.
Recently, it was announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers and media mogule invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he has accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is unclear.
'American Ninja Warrior' crowns first champion
Professional climbing and operating aid Isaac Calliero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of $1 million.
The competition show, which just finished its 7th season, had never seen a competition participant who could complete all the stages of his obstacle course.
During the season finale, two men, Calliero and cameraman Geoff Britten, made it to the finale.
The final task was to climb a 75-foot climbing rope in 30 seconds.
Britten finished the task within the time with which he was the first athlete to complete the strenuous phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior. However, Caliero completed this challenge fully three seconds faster, making him the winner.
Calliero spoke to E!News after the hard-fought victory, still under shock about winning the Grand Prix of $1 million.
"I mean, it's amazing to think about it, I've never earned more than $10,000 or lived," Isaac E! said about his pile of money.
All of a sudden, like I can't even imagine what this is like... the future is unknown.
The leading producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the finale and why Britten, although he was the first to finish the race course at all, won't get any prize money.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"If there is more than one finalist, it gets the one with the fastest time," Weed said.
How much money is a wonderful price and how life changes, he gets the great congratulation.
I don't think he has any resentment about it.
He's just so happy to have done what he did.
He received masses of awards from fans.
He's such a great guy and a family father.
He's a hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If I should be beaten by someone, I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same way if they had changed roles.
America Ninja Warrior was extended for an eighth season, the shooting will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers sneak past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS--The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tigers.
They used to be one of the best teams in baseball, and today the tigers stand in the last place in the American League Central.
The tigers are reduced to their role as spoilers, but on Tuesday this part played perfectly against the Minnesota Twins with 5-4 in the Target Field.
The Twins wasted a chance to climb within a half of the Houston Astros for the second American League Wildcard place.
For Detroit, though only for one evening, it was a return of the three letter F-word, which was so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season.
"All wins are fun no matter how it comes," said Tiger's manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger-Pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) hit 6 times in the 1/3 innings and enabled three runs.
It was only his third successful start in his last nine games.
"I want to finish this year," said Simon.
It's hard to throw every game in the bull, so I want to go into the game completely concentrated.
The designated tiger hit Victor Martinez and was in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-speed game since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He has curved the stickwood well," said Ausmus.
He looked good at (beat training), looked much better in the bull, and he put it right into the game.
With three runs at the end of the seventh inning, the Twins had their best chance to get back into the game.
Center Fielder Byron Buxton finished the inning with a double on the left field line.
Right Fielder Aaron Hicks reached a colorful spot, and Simon brought his second Baseman Brian Dozier to strikeout before being replaced by the left-hander Blaine Hardy.
Hardy survived Wall, the only man he was confronted with, in front of the designed Rookie striker Miguel Sano, who detached a two-run to the right-handman Drew Verhagen.
With a pair of runners and the finish-run at the second, Verhagen brought the third Baseman Trevor Plouffe to a double play.
It was the leader in the Major League 27 times this season that Ploffe beat a double play
After Detroit added an insurance run at the end of the ninth inning, Wall created an RBI double against the Closer of the Tigers Bruce Rondon and reached the level of 5-4.
The right-handed man, however, excelled Sano at three pitches for his fifth save.
Detroit benefited from a non-moving Phil Hughes for the start of the game.
The tigers scored three runs in the first two innings against the right-handed veteran, who had been deleted from the injured list before the game after he had missed more than a month due to a back suffering.
"Obviously not the beginning I wished for," said Hughes, "but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pitches in the third inning."
After receiving the lead-off battery in the first place, Hushes released a single to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez to the game, who created a single "up the middle" at the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez made his 0-21 success series with the runners in the scoring position.
The third Baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right, created another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third, which ended the threat.
The tigers increased in the second, achieved a one-out double by Catcher James McCann and a two-out single by Center-Fielder Anthony Gose to 3-0.
"That was a big blow," said Twins Manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't beat very well, but he got the right place.
Hughes was in a pitch count, did not score any points in the third inning before he was replaced by the reliever right-handed A.J.Achter.
At Hughes there were three runs with six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
COMMENTS: Tiger's RHP Anibal Sanchez resigned for an injury of the cast shoulder.
He is examined by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, since mid-August on the injured list due to a shoulder distortion, is to be activated for the start on Wednesday.
With Sanchez from the game, LHP Daniel Morris is removed from the injured list to start against the Twins.
Norris with 1-1 at four launches with the Tigers, since he was acquired in exchange with LHP David Price on July 30.
He has been missing since August 20 because of a rupture in the right hip joint.
The Tigers and Twins will finish their series of three games in the Target Field on Wednesday
Norris (2-2,4.43 ERA) will play against Minnesota's RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73)
Hundreds of refugees are supposed to live in Wiesbaden
A train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to Hessen.
His arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday.
The people who arrived there will then be accommodated in emergency shelters in Wiesbaden, as the city of Wiesbaden announced on Tuesday evening.
She expected 450 to 750 incoming refugees.
Several sports halls of the Hessian capital had been prepared for this case in recent days.
Up to 1000 refugees can temporarily stay there.
They should then be distributed to other municipalities.
Over the past ten days alone, 7500 people have arrived in Hessen, according to the government president responsible for the first admission.
Frankfurt and Hana have also set up emergency shelters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees.
Ischinger: German military measures in Syria an option
The head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, considers military measures with German participation in Syria to be a possibility.
"I believe that the decisive reflection on military action options must not take place without Germany," he said.
He accused the European states of "collective looking away".
Four years ago, one was glad that the cup of military participation in Germany had passed by.
"Now the conflict is cracking on our doorstep," he said in Germany's radio.
The former German ambassador to Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid on the spot for refugees.
Austria controls at southern and eastern borders
According to Germany, Austria has also introduced controls at its southern and eastern borders.
Austrian Minister of Interior Johanna Mikl-Leitner said on Tuesday evening in the Austrian television station ORF that no one will be sent back to Hungary.
Germany had also not sent refugees back to Austria.
"No, that's agreed," she explained.
As regards the question of an agreement under which Germany could accept a certain number of refugees from Austria per day, Mikl-Leinner said that there had already been discussions on this issue between the Director-General for Public Security and representatives of Germany.
She did not mention concrete figures and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin.
In recent days tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so-called Balkan route from Hungary.
Their goal is mostly Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann, together with several other EU Heads of State and Government, requested a special summit next week.
Germany had begun temporary border controls on Sunday.
The EU Member States have so far not been able to agree on a common approach in the crisis.
EU Ministers of the Interior intend to take a new call for a binding distribution of another 120 000 refugees at a special meeting on Tuesday (September 22nd).
In view of the strong refugee rank in Germany, the Federal Government wants to give greater support to the countries in the initial admission and distribution of people.
The Federation would manage this together with the countries, announced Merkel on the late Tuesday evening after almost four hours of consultation with the Prime Minister at the Chancellor's Office in Berlin.
Merkel pointed out that those people who had protection would also have them.
But those who do not have a living perspective could not stay in Germany either.
This view had been expressly shared in the round.
The chancellor stressed that the state as a whole must now deal with a "great effort".
Thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route.
Hungary had closed its 175-kilometre-long border with Serbia on Tuesday.
A few hours later, the government in Budapest announced that it would also seal the border with Romania with a fence.
This neighbouring country belongs to the EU differently from Serbia.
Hungary wants to prevent tugs from looking for escape routes across Romania, said Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szyjarto on the planned new border fence.
The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan.
There were first arrests of people who had cut the fence.
In Turkey, eyewitness reports indicate that thousands of further migrants were on their way to the Greek border.
Cassini spacecraft finds ocean on Saturnmond Enceladus
Under the Eispanzer of Saturn moon Enceladus a global ocean is waving.
This is the conclusion of researchers from observations of the Cassini space probe.
As a result, the moon is slightly doomed on its orbit around the ring planets.
Although this tumble movement is only small, it is still too large for a consistently solid celestial body, it is said in a communication from Cornell University in Ithaca, New York State, on Tuesday.
The researchers present their analyses in the journal "Icarus".
For a long time, it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of Enceladus.
For example, "Cassini" had already discovered ice volcanoes at the south-east of Saturnmond in 2006, spewing water vapor and ice particles and thus feeding the so-called e-ring of Saturn.
At least in the south-west, there must be an underground sea, the astronomers closed at that time.
However, the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clarified.
Rama missing 1860 Munich several weeks
The 1860 Munich must for one month for the Offensivachteur Valdet Rama.
An investigation had resulted in an additive injury for the 27-year-old, the association reported.
Rama had already complained about pain at the beginning of the week.
According to Munich lion, the diagnosis means "hopefully four weeks of forced pause".
"That's hard on us, Rama's a hard lose."
"Of course, we need to think now," said sports director Necat Aygün of the "image" newspaper, with a view to the possible commitment of an undisputed professional.
As a training guest, however, the sixties initially presented a defensive man.
The 30-year-old Hrvoje Cale was last active in Belgium and was already under contract with the VfL Wolfsburg.
The Croatian currently has "the opportunity to prove his ability".
Torjäger Rubin Okotie can return to the team training next week after his convulsion.
On Thursday, the Austrian national player will enter the running training.
Okotie had been injured in the game with Fortuna Düsseldorf (0:3) in a violent collision on his head.
However, contrary to his first fears, he remained without a serious injury.
No diet fruit - Mangos contain a lot of sugar
Mangos are exotic and juicy-sweet.
But if you want to pay attention to your slender line, they are often rather dissuaded.
Mangos contain a lot of sugar - especially sucrose.
The exotic fruits are still healthy: in them are B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. In particular, mangos contain a lot of vitamin A and its pre-stage beta carotene.
Whoever eats the fruit supports vision, immune system and metabolic processes in the body.
When buying mangoes should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasant.
The skin color alone does not matter how ripe the fruit is - so also green mangos can taste very delicious.
They should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days.
Then, of course, they taste pure or in sweet food.
A mango also gives a special touch to hearty dishes.
It softens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as chicoree and radicalcio.
And a mango chutney fits well with fish, poultry, lamb and game.
The UPS package service again employs up to 95000 assistance for the US Christmas business.
The company had already started recruiting seasonal workers, announced UPS on Tuesday.
Especially drivers are being sought.
As early as last year, UPS had already increased its workforce for the holiday season by 95000 grants.
In view of the booming online business, UPS and its competitor FedEx have been taking steps since last year to be prepared for the Christmas business.
In 2013, late deliveries had brought harsh criticism to the parcel services.
First hairstorm, then striking cold front
In the coming night, Meteo Switzerland broke through the valleys of the Alpine north side of the Föhn, as announced on Tuesday.
On Wednesday and during the night of Thursday, the hairdryer blows partly with stormy strength through the valleys.
After the mooring on Thursday morning, a striking cold front crosses us, bringing strong rains, windshields and a temperature decline.
As MeteoNews writes in a communication, Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low-pressure area across the British Isles in a strong south-west current.
On the northern side of the Alps, the Föhn breaks through the valleys during the night on Wednesday.
As a result, the hair dryer blows until Thursday morning in the hairdryer valleys with trees from 60 to 100 km/h, isolated and especially in the Urnerland also partly with over 100 km/h.
The hair dryer can penetrate into the adjacent central country, and on the mountains even hurricanes of over 120 km/h are possible.
While in the north on Wednesday stormy hair dryers provide summer temperatures from 23 to 27 degrees, the humidity begins to stagnate on the southern slope of the Alps.
There's rain that lasts until Thursday night.
To sum up, south of the Alps must be expected to partially over 100 litres of rain per square metre over the next 48 hours, after large amounts of rain have already fallen in the last days.
On Thursday morning, the hair dryer goes out of the air, as a result, a cold front rolls with strong, partly thundery rain from west to east across Switzerland.
Together with the cold front, the wind refreshes strongly to stormy, and the temperatures go down significantly.
The following days appear autumnly in the north with 15 to 20 degrees, but in the south it gets sunnyer at the weekend and warmer with up to 25 degrees.
Rome now has a Martin-Luther place
Almost 500 years after the Reformation, there is now a Martin-Luther place in Rome.
On Wednesday, in the presence of President Ignazio Marino, a nameless place in the park on the Oppio hill was baptized on the name of the German reformer.
At the "Piazza Martin Lutero" he is now recognized as "German theologian of Reformation".
The park is located in the middle of the old Rome right next to the Colosseum.
The name had been applied for by the evangelical churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, parish priest of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome, recalled on Wednesday that the Protestants in the city of the Popes for centuries as a minority could often only live in the hidden faith.
With the place becomes symbolically visible that its tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) spent several months in Rome at the turn of the year 1510/11 as a young Augustinian monk.
At the time, he felt the city was a wasteful scapegoat.
His negative impressions should have strengthened him in his later fight against Rome, according to historians.
Luther had then initiated the splitting of the evening church with his theses against the discharge trade.
Hammer Künstler invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (golden) crown of thorns is one of the main works that Otmar has painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts.
In the beginning was the word?
No, not with the Otmar-Alt Bible, which has now appeared with magnificent pictures.
In the beginning was the image for Otmar Alt, who in 150 motifs formulated his very personal interpretations of Bible stories on paper and canvas.
His "language" with colorful colors and imaginative shapes has been preserved by the 75-year-old - but this is by no means equivalent to "funny" images.
On the contrary, adjusted to the respective topics, this can seem quite dark.
About three years, Otmar Alt has worked on his Bible project, for which he has made a subjective-art selection of the many themes of the "Book of All Books".
There are cycles that focus on such topics as crossroads, plagues, commandments, or our Fathers.
He has thus spontaneously fascinated several partners: This applies to the Luther publisher with his theological orientation as well as to the Kettler publisher with his focus on art books.
And there is especially the author Klaus Altepost, who has dealt with the Bible passages on the basis of painting.
He has interpreted the Bible passages selected by Otmar Alt and thus "translated" into current contexts today.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of Alt's painting.
They are embedded between the original biblical quote of Martin Luther and a sentence of the artist, who here formulates his very personal thoughts about the situation.
The jewelry cover has golden letters.
Thus, the 75-year-old allows twice a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high level of intimacy.
Eventually, emotions were the cause of the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born in 1940 in Wernigerode and raised in Berlin, comes from a family belonging to the strict Protestant Order of Lords.
"There was an education with the tube stick," recalls Otmar Alt.
"I have tried to work this up, perhaps to put up with the Lord's Father again."
His second concern is to restore the importance of art in fast-lived times: "The perception of image worlds is characterized by advertising today, and it is loud.
Symbolism is being pushed out there.
Artists have a different desire and delight to show things.
Images always have something mysterious and are not decorative.
"In this respect, I am a dinosaur."
Otmar Alt wants the viewers to "fall in" the pictures, let them affect themselves, discover and feel the power they have: "The image is looking for its counterpart".
Klaus Altepost admitted on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar-Alt-Bibel in the Otmar-Alt-Stiftung that "even always" was a lover of Otmar Alt's art: "I like how he understands life with his pictures".
Alt did not take full note of the Bible but chose its important, also mysterious, themes.
"This was not a collaboration at eye level," says Altepost: "This is about the pictures, the text merely explains." It was a picture Bible.
For Hans Möhler of Luther-Verlag, this work is an invitation to "decrease his life and find freedom".
Otmar Alt's pictures speak for Möhler both the (biblical) language of love and that of responsibility.
A part of the original - paper and canvas pictures - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be opened at the Otmar Alt Foundation on November 15.
Construction start for BMX train approaching
Plans made, places found, companies commissioned, Earth hills modeled for a round course: a year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BMX train was already finished.
Failures in politics and administration led to confusion, especially among residents who did not want to tolerate the railway.
So hill shoved, new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permit.
The first municipal councillor, Sabine Mosebach-Bock, was now able to inform the Children's and Youth Committees about the approval in October.
"I hope that something will happen this year," she said.
The work at the former indoor pool should then be started without a "further commemorative pause".
DFB strengthens commitment for refugees
The DFB expands its commitment to refugees by 2019, and the Bundesliga is a clear sign on the weekend.
Football reacts to the rising situation in Germany and assures the policy of helping to deal with the problems ahead.
"I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since reunification."
"No one can in principle say that's none of my business, I have nothing to do with it."
"Each individual must be interested in getting to grips with this topic," said DFB CEO Wolfgang Niersbach.
At the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin, he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively.
"I will be in the Chancellor's Office next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State, Mrs. Özoğuz, and the Chancellor."
"The subject will certainly play a central role," he announced.
The football could and would like to help.
However, the decisive course must be to set policy.
The German Football Association has therefore extended its refugee initiative "1:0 for a welcome" by four years.
"About the Egidius Brown Foundation, we have ensured that this program continues until 2019," explained Niersbach at the edge of the UEFA Conference in St. Julian's/Malta.
Some Bundesligists also support this programme.
This weekend, the 36 professional associations will show a clear sign when they will wear the imprint "We help - #refugeeswelcome" on the left jersey sleeve instead of the usual sponsor logo (Hermes).
"We also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can," said Leverkusen's sports manager Rudi Völler of the "image" newspaper (Tuesday) and called the project "of course".
"The refugee drama concerns everyone, no one is allowed to see away."
"We football Bundesligists can, no, we have to use our radiance, our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly," said Hertha Manager Michael Preetz.
Hoffenheim's Managing Director Peter Rettig spoke of a "prominent sign of the league".
On this Friday, the women's national team will invite 100 refugees to Halle/Saale for the EM qualifying game against Hungary.
Niersbach described the support of refugees as "a large joint venture of German football".
The fact that all 36 licensing associations started their own projects in their places is great.
Just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active there.
The message "1:0 for a welcome" that we have issued will be lived in football.
"This is of enormous importance," he said.
This year and the next year, the Association, together with the DFB selection and the Federal Government, will provide 300 000 euros each for the integration of refugees.
"The clubs have already collected the entire sum for 2015," reports Niersbach.
Reports: SAP Chief of Management loses an eye in the event of an accident
The CEO of Europe's largest software group, Bill McDermott, reportedly lost his left eye by a fall in early July.
In the event of an accident on the stairs in his brother's home in the USA, after midnight, he had fallen on a water glass that he had carried in his left hand, reports the "economic week" on Wednesday.
"He's almost bleeding, he's fainted, then he dragged himself out on the street - he told us so last week," quotes the "WiWo" SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner.
But McDermott could do his job.
"At the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Walldorf," Plattner said.
The 54-year-old manager is present at the meeting and "fully working".
McDermott announced in an interview with the "Südddeutsche Zeitung" ( Thursday edition) that he would come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software group.
"I'm full of SAP, full of my job."
"Of course, I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Hasso Plattner all the time," said McDermott of the "SZ".
McDermott usually commutes between Germany and the USA, but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Walldorf.
To him it is important to go to the public with such a personal story, the manager of the "SZ" said: "Anything like this can happen."
"It's important to get up again when you've fallen."
McLaren replacement pilot magnus except fighting...
Magnussen tweeted a corresponding photo and explained that he had suffered the injury when he fell off the wheel.
Therefore, during the night race in Singapore on the weekend, he is no longer in question as a reserve driver for the two pilots Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button, as well as a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan.
Football: BVB without giant against Krasnodar: Weeds fields in the gate
At Borussia Dortmund, all hopes for a comeback by Marco Reus in the first group game of the Europa League were finally broken.
The national player will also be missing the table leader of the football league in duel with the FK Krasnodar on Thursday (19.00/Sky).
"Unfortunately, we cannot resort to him," said Thomas Tuchel on Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be back in the Bundesliga top game against Leverkusen on Sunday, the BVB coach left it open: "We expect a return from him to the training on Friday".
In view of the high burden of his professionals, Tuchel will not only change his trunk at the Reus position.
So he announced a change at the goalkeeper position.
That's why Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of tribal keeper Roman Bürki.
"He trains at an absolute top level," the football teacher praised the world champion.
Whether weidenfeller will be used in all Europe League games in the future, however, Tuchel left open.
With high probability, he will also challenge the second game.
The research statement by Co-Player Reus that the final entry for the BVB in the Europa League must be the goal, says Mittelfeldspieler Julian Weigl: "That doesn't make Marco so wrong."
"I think we have a good chance to take the title."
Robotic cars: Government wants pioneering role for Germany
According to the Federal Government's will, Germany is supposed to be in the process of changing the car of technological pioneers.
On Wednesday, the Federal Cabinet decided to adopt a strategy paper from the House of Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which includes investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure.
On Wednesday in Frankfurt, Dobrindt spoke of a "new age of mobility" at the edge of the IAA car fair.
The automated and networked driving would increase road safety and reduce traffic congestion, said Dobrindt.
He also wanted to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G7 countries, who also met with representatives of industry at the IAA.
The Ministry of Transport's strategy paper highlights, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid switch to digital radio.
A test track on the highway 9 in Bavaria is currently being developed to test new technology.
In order to "do not impose any additional liability risks on the driver", the Federal Government intends to "check the legal framework conditions and adapt them to the new developments where necessary".
For example, Germany wants to work internationally to increase the maximum permissible speed for self-driving cars from 10 to 130 kilometres.
The Federal Government also intends to amend the Vienna Convention, which until now only provides for people as drivers.
In automated driving, the car is increasingly taking the lead, and the driver becomes more and more a passenger.
The technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds.
According to a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, highly automated driving on motorways will be technically possible by 2020.
Nevertheless, non-drived vehicles on public roads are "to be expected far after 2020".
The authors of the study estimate the value added in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the location Germany to around €8.4 billion for 2025.
"The digital networking of the car can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road transport," said SPD transport politician Sören Bartol.
However, the question of liability in the event of accidents and the safety of the driver's personal data must be clearly clarified.
However, the Germans still see self-driving cars skeptically - much more than French or Americans.
A survey by the Forsa Institute on behalf of Dekra, presented on Wednesday at the AA, concluded that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous cars will prevail over the next ten years, 32 percent expect only in 20 years, 31 percent do not believe in it at all.
In France, 21 percent of respondents expect autonomous cars by 2025, 33 percent in the USA.
Nevertheless, the motorists in Germany are not yet ready to rely entirely on a self-driving vehicle.
After a survey of the Bitkom Digital Association, only seven percent would agree to surrender control throughout the journey on all roads.
On the motorway, the flow of traffic could be at least 15 percent, 45 percent in traffic.
Well, every fourth would not leave the car control under any circumstances.
Boll cancels team and double start at Table Tennis-EM
After the present state of play in the title fights from 25 September to 4 October, the Düsseldorfer only wants to pick up in detail.
The final decision shall be taken by 22 September at the latest.
"This is a huge loss for our team."
"The boys found out in the morning."
"But we are strong enough to get the title even without Timo," said Federal Trainer Jörg Rosskopf during the EM course in Düsseldorf.
Boll was on the fly at that time at a long-term sponsoring date in China.
The 34-year-old German champion is expected back on Friday.
"Without Timo, the disadvantage is that we are no longer such a clear favourite," said single European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov.
The Hamelner, who led the ranking list in Yekaterinburg, also recalled the EM 2013 in Schwechat.
"At that time Timo also missed, and we have become European champions."
"This is what we should focus on," said the world rankings five.
The English national football player Luke Shaw of Manchester United has suffered a serious injury to the right leg.
In the Champions League game at the PSV Eindhoven, the defender was hit by a rackling by Héctor Moreno and replaced after long treatment.
The first diagnosis indicated a shin fracture in the 20-year-old co-player of Bastian Schweinsteiger.
Gaultier feels too old for an enfant terrible
It is a mixture of a very large fashion show and a wax-figure-grusel cabinet: The designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich.
The highlights: mannequins that look terrifyingly human thanks to video projections.
They carry the spectacular creations of the French designer, who became the great star of the fashion scene with Madonna's stage outfits, among other things - and with him being men in skirts.
"I can't say today that I'm the Enfant terrible of the Haute Couture because I have white hair."
"Before it was bleached, it's real now," said Gaultier.
For the visitors to the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk" (from the sidewalk on the runway), which is to be seen in the Art Hall of the Hypo-Cultural Foundation from 18 September, it is a luck that the fashion creator has changed his at first negative attitude to a show about his person.
Actually, he was against it, because: "For me, an exhibition sounded a little after death," he said.
If you die, you get to the museum.
The impressive collection had already been made in Montreal and Paris, Canada.
"It's about so much more than just beautiful clothes," said the director of the Kunsthalle, Roger Diederen.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight into the man's work, which is hardly yet to be seen, that has written fashion history without ever having completed an education.
Chronologically, the show is not built up, but it is an excellent choreographed overall work of art, for which much effort has been made: To freeze the dolls, for example, a stylist was specifically engaged.
According to the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot, 14 tons of material were transported to Munich by the makers.
Just before the start of the October festival, there was a special treat: a leather pants outfit with corset.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He was always interested in strong women ("Women are smarter than men") and for people who are a little different, said Gaultier.
Gaultier's old Teddy can also be seen in the exhibition.
He stands for the designer's first, discerning fashion walking attempts.
As a child (he was not a good student and bad in football), he put on his Teddy bras and clothes, said Gaultier.
To play with a doll, his parents wouldn't have allowed him.
He later taught himself the design of fashion.
He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaultier told in Munich.
But later I bought them, of course.
He could not have paid for his first fashion show.
They didn't get anything, but they were allowed to keep the clothes.
Jewellery instead of curtain - Plauener lace as fashion niche
In the past, it used to go into the long embroidery machines and around plauen to make meters.
The embroidered fabrics and laces were made in large quantities for customers, for example, who continued processing them into blankets and curtains.
This alone no longer works today, explains Andreas Reinhardt, Managing Director of the Modespitze Plauen.
Instead, fashion is important again.
In the early days of the Plauen peak fashion played a greater role, was then pushed out by the home textile industry - and is now rediscovered as niches.
Reinhardt gives some examples: lace in jewelry, accessories such as bags and regional costumes.
In general, the so-called vintage fashion, which leans on past periods of style, formed an increasing order potential.
Those who do not serve niches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market.
With us, they already account for half of all orders.
Modespitze Plauen, together with nine other companies, is a member of the Plauener Spitze and Embroidery Association.
Only they are allowed to wear the protected label.
In the last 15 years, about 80 percent of sales have broken down.
Private specialist shops and also the wholesale trade there is almost no longer.
Our products hardly reach the customer in this way.
The bulk goods are nowadays produced much cheaper in Asian space and are almost exclusively distributed through chains.
Furthermore, exports are weak, currently to Russia and the USA.
So enough reasons for new ways.
The industry association is also trying to point out by environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer of the Stickperle in Falkenstein explains: "Since this year we have been holding a quality seal that shows that we produce ecologically and socially compatible."
Reinhardt adds: "This also refers to the materials used".
Diploma designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberger Exterior Office of the Zwickau University of Saxony - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specializes in embroidery and lace.
To counter competition from the Asian region, you need to find high-quality and innovative products.
It takes time and courage.
A field of tension arises between the freshest ideas of the designers and the companies, which above all have to think economically," says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design is often only slightly varied to keep a customer base.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historic snowball tip.
In some places the machine embroils small balls.
The Plauen goldsmith master Bianca Hallebach-Kruße was inspired by this: "I couldn't begin with a traditional Plauen peak."
Now she's using the snowball tip for her jewelry.
In an elaborate process, it embosses the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region identify themselves with the theme of Plauener Spitt - young and old," says Reuter.
It also delivers to the United States, Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in plauen and surrounding areas and who want a memoir.
With this I see my jewelry as the modern ambassador of the Plauener top.
Disney plans new "Mary Poppins" film
You should not touch legends, but Disney still dares to make a new film of his classic "Mary Poppins".
According to "Entertainment Weekly", however, this is not about a re-filming, but about a kind of continuation, which 20 years after the first film plays with the magical nanny.
It is about the experience of Nanny with the Banks family in times of the global economic crisis in England.
Whoever plays Poppins more than 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear.
But the director is already clear: Rob Marshall, last with "Into the Woods" in the cinema.
Xi urges to open the economy wider for the world
The economy has to open up to the outside in order to promote growth, said President Xi Jinping on Tuesday of a group that was entrusted with steering the reform.
"China should be committed to attracting foreign investment and know-how and improving business start-up strategies," he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Executive Group for the deepening of a comprehensive reform.
Promoting new start-ups and reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new place for economic growth, said Xi.
The Management Group has adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of market access rules, relaxation of border control policies, promotion of state enterprises (SOEs), raising private capital, and overtaking the population reporting system.
According to the statement, a negative list is drawn up identifying sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment.
The system is gradually tested and improved by test programs.
The initiative is important as it gives the market a greater role in the allocation of resources, guarantees a rule of law business environment and makes the market more open, said the statement.
The government will also loosen controls on the powers conferred on undertakings and ensure that companies decide how they conduct their business.
The statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
Further areas for private investment will be opened up as part of an offer to open state-controlled sectors.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide them with better services," said the statement.
In addition, it is made easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the "Green Card" by optimising the requirements and facilitating the application process.
The right of lawyers to guarantee their activity and to use professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at a meeting.
The meeting was attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and important leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, as reported in a statement published after the meeting.
EU wants to double mercury limit in predatory fish
The European Commission intends to double the limit values for mercury in large predatory fish, thus giving consumers a significantly higher dose of nerve poison.
The Foodwatch consumer organisation, which has a corresponding EU working paper, strongly criticized the plans: "Risks and side effects of missing industrial and environmental policies are being passed on to pregnant women and toddlers with full force," said Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch.
According to Wolfschmidt, the limit values of the nerve poison for large fish at the end of the food chain such as shark or swordfish for "economic policy reasons" are to be increased from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish.
However, large predatory fish are already so heavily burdened with mercury that about 50 percent of catches cannot be sold on the basis of the limits still in force.
After doubling the limit values, only 14.5 percent would be unsaleable.
In return for this easing, according to Foodwatch, the EU intends to increase the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.
However, Foodwatch described this as "trick" because smaller peace fish, such as carp, are usually so low that they already comply with the planned maximums.
The reduction in small fish is therefore "a perfide distraction maneuver that helps the economy alone," said Wolfschmidt.
Mercury is a highly toxic heavy metal for humans, which is greatly enriched over the food chain, especially in predatory fish.
The Federal Government therefore warns against the fact that "a small amount of damage to the nervous system can be caused especially in the case of unborn people".
However, on its homepage, the Federal Ministry of the Environment, in view of the applicable maximum values, states that a "health hazard to the general population" is not to be expected.
Mercury comes mainly into the environment by burning coal.
According to a written information from the Federal Ministry of the Environment, the German coal-fired power plants send more than six tons of mercury per year to the Green Federal Deputies Annalena Baerbock, two thirds of the total quantity emitted in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fish, for example in Elbe, Rhine and Danube was "permanently and comprehensively exceeded", the "spiegel" had quoted from the paper in March.
Last year, European alerts to mercury in fish were among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RASFF.
