Mr Modi is on a five-day trip to Japan to strengthen economic relations with the third largest economic nation in the world.
Plans for stronger nuclear cooperation are on the top of the agenda.
According to reports, India is also hoping for a defence cooperation agreement between the two nations.
Karratha Police Arrested 20-year-olds for fast motorcycle hunting
A motorcycle was seized after the driver had driven it at 125 km/h in a 70 km/h zone and through Bushland to escape the police in Bilbara.
This morning, traffic police in Karratha tried to stop a blue motorcycle after watching it leave a gas station on Bathdate Road at 125 km/h.
The police report that the driver then ignored the stop signals and continued on the Burgess Road before he went down to the Bushland where the officials lost sight of it.
The motorcycle and a person corresponding to the description of the driver were later seen at a house at Walcott Way in Bulgaria.
Karratha Police accused a 20-year-old man of not respecting a stop signal as well as ruthless driving.
He is to appear in the court in Karratha on September 23rd.
The motorcycle was secured and confiscated for three months.
George Webster charged with hotel rapes in Naim and Pitlochry
A man is on trial for the rape of women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was read at a hearing of the Supreme Court in Glasgow.
He is accused of raped a woman at the Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry in Perthshire on June 7, 2013.
The charge is that Webster attacked her while she "was unconscious, asleep, unable to signal consent."
Webster is also accused of having raped a second woman at the Golf View Hotel in Naim in the Scottish highlands on 4 May 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set the negotiating date for 17 November at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh.
Looking back to the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
Congressman Keith Ellison and John Lewis have tabled a bill to establish the organization of trade unions as a civil right.
"As unions die, so do middle-class jobs," said Ellison, a Minnesota democrat and deputy chairman of Progressive Caucus in Congress.
Therefore, together with the civil rights icon John Lewis, I am proud to present the employee empowerment law.
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal opportunities in the case of discrimination over the organisation of trade unions as in other forms of discrimination - and thus stops anti-union forces.
The addition of the national labour law law to create an opportunity for discrimination-exposed workers to organise a trade union representation in order to sue before a civil court for justice - and to receive compensation or penalty - is a useful and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of their bill suggest is to link back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks the trade unions have been exposed to in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other countries throughout the country - Americans once encouraged countries around the world to recognise, extend and respect labour rights.
There was a time when millions of Americans remembered when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right of association in one breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution to ensure that the militarized autocracy of Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy.
Conscious of the fact that the workers and their trade unions played a role in creating a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly acknowledged that "the workers' rights to union and joint negotiation and action are guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that the fascism would replace Adolf Hitler with a strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that the workers would have to organize themselves and raise their voice in the new nation, the Germans inserted a clause expressly saying: "The right to establish associations in order to secure and improve the working and economic conditions is guaranteed to every individual and every profession or trade.
Agreements restricting this right or aimed at narrowing it are null and void; measures aimed at it are illegal.
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt held the Presidency of the International Human Rights Commission, which designed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the other authors provided a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form trade unions to protect his interests or to join them."
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labour rights are human rights.
When this country advised other countries on how to form civil and democratic societies, Americans stated that the right to establish a union - and that this union should then participate in collective negotiations as an equivalent partner with companies and government agencies - must be protected.
After these rights were under fire in America, it is indeed very wise to see the American ideal once again, which means that the working population must have the right to unite and be heard in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
The story is a great teacher.
Now all know that the workers' movement did not limit the strength of the nation but enlarged it.
By raising the living standards of millions of people, work has miraculously created a market for industry and raised the entire nation to unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but the story preserves them.
The story remembers, and we should do the same.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of citizens' rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of workers' representations - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that have made America great in the past and that have given way to the promise of democracy.
Judge temporarily stops law that all abortion clinics in Louisiana could force closure
One U.S. federal judge for the time being stopped the implementation of a law in Louisiana on Sunday, of which lawyers say it would probably have led to the closure of all five state abortion clinics.
This measure, which was brought into force by Bobby Jindal, Governor of Louisiana, in June and is due to enter into force on September 1, would force doctors performing abortions to obtain a patient admission right at a hospital within a radius of 30 miles to acquire their practice.
However, the judgeâ€™s decision means that doctors may continue to exercise legal abortions for the time being while applying for such a right.
"The plaintiffs can continue to work in accordance with the law as they seek to obtain these rights," wrote Federal Judge John deGravelles in his judgment.
Within one month, a hearing shall be held for the judge in order to bring about a more lasting decision for the law.
Abortion advocates welcomed the decision to take the most recent in a number of judgments against similar measures and said that doctors could so much time to obtain hospitalisation rights.
"Today's decision means that women in Louisiana miss out on an insidious law that wants to take their health and rights," said Nancy Northup, president and chairman of the Center for Reproduction Rights, who had complained on behalf of three of the five clinics of the state to stop the law.
It was not directly clear whether the judgment also extended to the doctors from the two clinics who had not joined the action and had also applied for the right to be ordered.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have passed similar laws, where courts have recently declared such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.
A law in Texas, which had forced most of the state's clinics to close, was issued by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion advocates and the American College of Eastern Retricians and Gynecologists as well as the American Medical Association agree that prescription rights of doctors require unnecessary restrictions.
Absorption opponents are opposed to the fact that the measures serve to protect women's health, although some also welcomed the effects of closing clinics.
Only one doctor who conducts abortions in Louisiana has patient rights, the Centre for Reproduction Rights informed.
If all other doctors in the state are forced to stop performing abortions, this doctor would no longer perform the operation for fear of his safety, said the group.
In their argument against the judgment, representatives of the State of Louisiana said that they would not punish doctors for carrying out abortions while their applications for patient rights would still be pending.
Delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment options lead to higher death rates due to ovarian cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have posted a videohome for her mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in the rural areas of Australia have a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than women in cities.
Researchers analyzed the medical data of more than 1100 Australians who were diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 25 percent were alive five years after the diagnosis.
Research director Susan Jordan of the QiMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20 percent higher than for those living in urban areas.
SMALL STUDY: New medicines may slow down lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers examined the medical care of women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman in the diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, existing predispositions and social and economic status also influenced the chances of survival.
The survival rate was lowest for older women and those whose cancer had already progressed at the time of diagnosis.
For those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality was 20 percent higher during the study than for those living in urban areas.
Although the study did not investigate why women living outside the city were more likely to die of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suspects a delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centers as possible factors.
"This disease is best treated by gynecological oncologists, and these are mostly found in larger cities," she said.
Despite improving telemedicine services to counter the distances, as a possible remedy, she proposed strengthening the service of flown doctors in order to give specialists the opportunity to provide women closer to their place of residence, as well as treatment programs for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that regardless of geographical status, the study showed a poor long-term survival rate in women in ovarian cancer and underlined the need for better treatment and prevention strategies.
The study funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is now published in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a young mother of 33 years from the Gold Coast, learned that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centres regret falling homeowner numbers
The decline, together with an increased fall in the number of homeowners under 35, could result in garden centres losing tens of thousands of pounds a year if today's young consumers reach the "core age group for garden products" according to a study of the HTA, as reported in the Financial Times.
The report says that tenants spend an average of 55 percent of the amount spent on their garden by people with their own homes.
The increase of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popular method of asphalting gardens for park purposes, and the falling garden size are other factors that threaten the industry, in which an estimated Â£5 billion per year are implemented in sales.
In the Greater London area, where the share of homeowners has fallen from 61 to 43 percent over a period of 6 years, the lowest expenditure on garden products per household is reported.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that housing for rent or small gardens does not mean that people cannot draw plants.
Guy Barter, Chief Garden Advisor for the RS said, "Container gardeners, for example, are very popular with tenants because they can take their plants with them when moving."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of the retail garden as a result of rising homeowners and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
He also predicted an improved market situation for this year because of the better weather after unfriendly weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement in Pakistan, led by the opposition politician Imran Khan and the clergy Tahirul Qadri, continues.
In the capital Islamabad, around 1000 demonstrators stormed the state television station PTV.
Minister of Information Pervaiz Rashid said that soldiers could have pushed the protesters out of PTV buildings again.
The station stopped operating for about 40 minutes, but is now sending again.
At the same time, some 3,000 demonstrators tried to reach the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
Around a kilometer away, they supplied themselves with sticks and stones equipped with collisions with security forces.
The police used tear gas.
The demonstrators demanded Sharif's resignation, but he refused.
The country's army is now calling for a political solution to the conflict, "without wasting time and using violence".
After a meeting in the headquarters on Sunday evening, the military announced: "The army remains obliged to ensure the security of the state".
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has already cleaned up more frequently.
The opposition politician Imran Khan accuses Prime Minister Sharif of cheating on the May election last year.
The protests were escalated on the weekend after Khan and Qadri had called their followers to enter Sharif's residence.
Three people had been killed.
Turkey orders US diplomat for espionage reports
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has ordered the country's oldest U.S. diplomats on information from a report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister BÃ¼lent said that the executive of the US Embassy and Turkish officials had discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept reported that those of the former US analyst of the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, showed that Turkey was a main area of activity for the US and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan played down the importance of the report and said that all important countries pioneered each other.
A previous report, which was also viewed by Germany's most important intelligence service Ankara, caused significantly more angry reactions from the Turkish government.
Warning strike: Locusts threaten with consequences for commuters
The national alert strike of the train guide on Monday evening could also affect passenger transport in NRW.
The reluctance announced for 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. affects all transport companies throughout Germany, including long-distance, regional and S-Bahn transport,
The main thrust of the warning strike is freight transport.
Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image
said the district chairman of the German Locomotive Guide (GDL), Sven Schmitte, in DÃ¼sseldorf.
We expect significant failures.
Regional priorities are not available.
The main thrust of the warning strike is freight transport.
The Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced that it would do everything to minimize the impact.
However, the GDL did not say where it wanted to strike, so it was difficult to predict the consequences in concrete terms.
Police chief of Magaluf charged with corruption
On Friday, the prosecutors presented evidence of extortion by police officers and employees of the city of CalviÃ  to the office of Mallorcaâ€™s prosecutor.
The head of the CalviÃ  Police on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested after allegations of corruption by businessmen and bar owners in the notorious binge drinking hotspot Magaluf.
Chief Commissioner JosÃ© Antonio Navarro was arrested by several merchants from Punta Ballena, the street where most of Magaluf's bars and nightclubs are located, after allegations of corruption against him.
According to the online newspaper Mallorca Diario, the prosecutors presented evidence of extortion by police and employees of the city of CalviÃ  to the Office of the Lawyer for Corruption of Mallorca on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in connection with the accusations of corruption and were questioned by a judge together with Navarro.
The Spanish national daily ABC reported that the angry nightclub owners said that the veterinary industry of the authorities had a serious impact on their business.
"It's no longer about making money, it's about survival," said one of the businessmen to the court.
Leave our basis of life out of the game.
We have nothing to lose.
This summer, Magaluf made international headlines due to a viral YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British tourist who performed 24 men during a tour of Fellatio.
Since then, the island authorities have tried to stop the wrongful behaviour of alcoholic holidaymakers in Magaluf by minimizing the number of participants in the infamous alcohol drunk pub tours.
The Playhouse Club, in which the Fellatio incident took place, was forced to close for one year, while Playhouse and the pub tour organizer Carnage jointly have to pay a penalty of â‚¬55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist resort of Magaluf, which is particularly popular among young British holidaymakers, is also known for a number of accidents involving alcohol, including the trend of "balconing", where people jump from one balcony to another or from one balcony to the hotel pool.
The first spring day with wet and stormy weather conditions affects flights from Adelaide Airport
FÃœHLING has given South Australia a winter surprise, with violent showers and strong wind that affected flights from Adelaide airport.
In the evening until 9 p.m., another 5mm rain fell on the city, after 6.6mm, which had already fallen in the night of Sunday.
The last rainfall was the result of a series of short, stormy showers, including a cast that started shortly before 8:00 and caused almost 4mm of rainfall in about 10 minutes.
After the winter last week had provided an early dose of spring, the temperatures in the city fell again on Monday to a maximum of only 15.8Â°C.
The arcy weather conditions have probably led to the delayed landing of a flight from Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane should have landed shortly after 7.30 p.m., however, was hit by a shear wind - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to take off.
At that time, windfalls reached about 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport.
The flight data showed that the aircraft had to take off on a second landing and finally set up at about 8.40 p.m.
The delay in flight resulted in a delay in some other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quanta flight from Sydney.
For Adelaide a maximum temperature of 16Â°C is predicted on Tuesday, with possible showers.
Matthies means: Maximum time for great networking
In view of the galloping technical progress that threatens to transform our comfortable home into high-tech switchgear, our columnist Bernd Matthies comforts himself with an extremely familiar electronic accessory.
While I'm writing this, I'm looking at the spiral cable that connects the listener to the phone, and I'm thinking, "Boah, how retro is that?"
But behind it is a consideration: If the cable were not, all the listeners would fly around the house in no time, and that would be much more retro.
The Ekeltronic (Ekeltronic?
No, typo error: electronic) sector the rule that the world news of today is the electric scrap of tomorrow, purchased - obsolete.
And for example, if you still have a tube TV in your living room today, you'll just say that he rejects television in principle.
Why these considerations?
Because this week the urge of the Ifa on the radio tower will bring us back to our eyes our absolute incompetence in electronics questions.
Today, the layman, who used to blindly master washing machine and CD player, does not even understand the purpose of the equipment that is spread out before him with inconceivable eitlem expert speech: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" promises us the press office.
Yeah, you okay?
What should one talk about with people who apparently voluntarily spread out such quark?
In fact, for about 20 years now, it has been mainly a matter of connecting our house properly.
So that the yoghurt can re-order himself so that the fire detector will tell us on holiday in the Maldives that it burns in the study room.
And wouldn't it be wonderful if we had air conditioning from the office on our soon arrival ...?
Yes, however, this requires air conditioning.
But a dream will certainly soon come true: We lift our watch, you say loud "suck!" - and at home the vacuum cleaner starts.
I'm sorry.
Everything goes to nothing less than a revolution: "The boundaries between white and brown goods are blurring," says a industry expert, you can connect the washing machine with a headphone, the steam heater sends the weather report, and the data glasses show how long the pizza still needs in the oven, which is of no use, however, because we are in the jam.
We also know from daily practice: When a new fashion device is really needed urgently, the battery is guaranteed to be empty.
Which is another reason why the spiral cable on the phone will also survive the next radio exhibitions.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from the territories near the Gaza Strip returned to schools on Monday after they had spent the summer in airspaces, while rocket and mortar shooting fell on their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas and the schools in Gaza remained closed while the area recovered from the fighting.
The start of the school brought a feeling of joy and expectation to the communities drawn by rocket gunholes in the south of Israel, but the signs of the struggles are still fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, staff of the "Pashosh" kindergarten, which was hit by a rocket, were removed from the walls and sliding walls before the students arrived.
"We're a little scared, but we're excited," said Ronit Bart, resident in Kibbutz Saad and there English teacher.
Many children from our area urgently need to return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it feels "a bit funny" to suddenly go back to school.
"These were difficult times, and we didn't leave the house at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited Kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Until a ceasefire last week, thousands of residents of the border communities, such as Saad, remained in their homes or left their homes to move further away from Gaza in safer areas and to escape rocket and mortar fire.
Many inhabitants of Nahal Oz, a community near the Gaza border, in which a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar grenade, are still reluctant to return.
The Ministry of Education announced that about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Their children were temporarily accommodated in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attended a school in Sderot, a border town to Gaza, which is heavily marked by the Palestinian fire.
He appealed to the children to learn a lot and said, "We will ensure that you acquire knowledge and provide you with security."
Israel and Hamas agreed on an indefinite ceasefire last Tuesday.
The ceasefire provided an immediate end to the fighting, but important problems remain unsolved, such as Hamas' demand for the withdrawal of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of the air and sea ports in Gaza.
Israel calls for the disarming of Hamas and the handing over of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the battles.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin in Egypt this month.
In the war more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, three-quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children were estimated by the Palestinians and the UN.
Israel contests this information and estimates that at least half of the deaths are fighters, but did not provide concrete evidence for this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and mortar grenades during the battle on Israeli cities, most of them in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in the Gaza area and about 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools, which were converted into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in the shelters and struggles continue, the educational authorities moved the beginning of the school year last week.
"I hope the school will soon be re-opened so that we can continue to learn, like the children in the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who currently lives in a school in Gaza City.
At election in Saxony: CDU-Vize Strobl calls into question NPD prohibition procedures
In view of the NPDâ€™s loss of votes in Saxony, CDU-Bundesvize Thomas Strobl has declared itself to be an end to the ongoing NPD ban before the Federal Constitutional Court.
Berlin - According to the CDU-Bundesvize Thomas Strobl, the ongoing prohibition proceedings against the NPD should end before the Federal Constitutional Court.
"The NPD cuts off worse than last time," said Strobl, who is also CDU Landeschef in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, the "Leipziger Volkszeitung".
This is a gratifying development in the right direction and a development that rather leads me to the conclusion that the NPD is being fought politically and not before the Constitutional Court.
In the vote on Sunday, the NPD had failed very little at the five-percent hat.
A first attempt to ban the far-right party had failed in 2003 because the protection of the Constitution had informants at the time also in the NPD tip.
In December 2013, the Federal Council submitted a new request in Karlsruhe after a long period of preparation.
The Federal Government and the Bundestag did not join.
Harburg: tents for new refugees
Refugees are now accommodated in tents at the New Zealander Platz.
The central first shot for refugees in Harburg bursts out of all the seams.
Now the internal authority has had three tents of the Red Cross placed next to them.
The district politicians were informed just before - they are not very enthusiastic.
"These Hauruck actions continue to stimulate citizens' reservations and give the district politicians no opportunity to participate constructively in the human housing of refugees," says Britta Herrmann, Group leader of the Greens in the Harburg District Assembly.
Her party demands that Harburg County Council provide currently unused homes for accommodation.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
The reasons for the overfill in the initial recording are the onset of aid seekers - and the fact that the authorities cannot provide enough space in follow-up facilities.
Many refugees therefore remain longer than the regular three months.
The house prices have experienced the strongest winter rise in seven years, shows a widely observed index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for private homes in the Australian capital increased by 1.1 percent in August, according to the RP data from Monday.
As a result of this increase, the total increase in June, July and August is 4.2 percent, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was around 10 percent, more than twice as high as the increase in the 12 months to August 2013, but the increases were not evenly distributed across the country.
RP Data's head of research, Tim Lawless, announced that Sydney and Melbourne are driving a two-part market.
RP Data figures show that house prices in Sydney increased by 16.1 percent last year, while in Melbourne, by 11.7 percent.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose by an average of five and six percent.
At the other end of the scale is Canberra, which was severely hit by the cuts in government expenditure and where prices increased only by 1.4 percent over the year.
Mr. Lawless continued that with the spring beginning, an increase in the real estate for sale would now be observed for the next few months, which would put the market "a real test".
"If you look at the persistently high rate of auction prices, a generally fast selling rate and the persistently low interest rate environment, it is likely that home prices will continue to rise over the next three months," he said.
In a statement to the New Press, he contradicts statements by the Managing Director Peer Medau and attests to him to pose "like a master of the field".
This is not the style of the university, it says in the communication.
For example, the Medau family had already been "in mid-June orally informed about the establishment of the university.
The statement that the plans were not known until July are definitely wrong," says PÃ¶tzl.
At the same time, he points out that the plans are not "preventions or decisions", but they are "preferences".
Also the extension of the narrow road up to the castle necessary for access is less dramatic than the Medus feared.
A nine-metre-wide road was and is not the talk.
According to the current state of affairs, it goes by 5,50 meters, which is one meter wider than before," PÃ¶tzl explains.
The argument of the Medau operators that their free and school-based parking spaces will in the future only be used by students of the university does not want to apply PÃ¶tzl.
It is not parked at all because, like with other public parking spaces, it is now intelligently solved.
Remembering the Residents
According to the president, the Bergwichtel Children's Crib, which is located on the site and would lead the way to the Parkdeck before its doorway, is "not to be affected".
Rather, he gives thought to "that this is not only about the children's crib, but also about the residents at the estuary to Friedrich-Streib-StraÃŸe and the 800 students of the neighbouring real school.
So it's about much more than the particular interests of Mr. Medau," says PÃ¶tzl.
Whether the criticism of the Parent Council of the Children's Crib, with the expansion of the street would be entitled to a "the few natural spots of Coburg lost", "can the reader decide for himself".
At the beginning of October, PÃ¶tzl, together with the Bamberg State Building Office, wants to inform the city councils about the building development of the university by 2020 "and address the importance of the new development in this context".
Last week Peer Medau had informed the parents of the children's crib about the plans of the university.
According to this, the access to the new Parkdeck is not supposed to lead through the campus and Friedrich-Streib-StraÃŸe, but through the Medau-mountain.
The narrow road would therefore have to be extended to a length of about one kilometer.
According to the Medaus, the traffic in the park of Hohenfels Castle would be tenfold.
About 2000 vehicles a day are mentioned.
There was no intention of expressing the project on the part of the city so far.
Glandorf withdraws from Handball National Team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old of the Bundesligist SG Flensburg-Handewitt cited health problems for this decision.
I don't like the decision, it's matured over several months.
It is time for me to listen to the signals of my body and finish my career in the national team," said the World Champion of 2007 on his Facebook page.
He thus goes to international retirement with a balance sheet of 167 national games and 576 goals for Germany.
Because the throwing back room player wants to go for a few more years for the Champions League winner from Flensburg, he is now no longer available to the new Bundestrainer Dagur Sigurdsson.
With the Icelandic, who announced his cadre for the country games against Switzerland on Tuesday, Glandorf held a "long and good conversation.
His ideas and approaches have just as excited me as they will also inspire my long-standing associates and my successors.
But for my club I would like to be available healthy in the next few years, which requires longer regeneration breaks, which do not allow the current double load.
The left-handed man had to fear his career after a heel infection in 2012.
Because of Achillessen problems, he had been treated by team doctors from the German Handball Association (DHB) with a cortisone syringe, which later triggered a strong inflammation.
An emergency operation and two further interventions followed.
Then Glandorf had announced a complaint against the team doctor, the dispute ended with a comparison.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team career pass no body without trace.
I have some health construction sites that I can no longer ignore.
After the three infection-related foot operations that took place at short intervals in 2012, I never got the right grip on my blood pressure.
In addition, there are some other wear-related complaints.
As early as the beginning of the year, I noticed that although I can control my head, I can't deceive my body," Glandorf explained in the interview to the magazine "Handball Time".
He would only be available for a comeback in an absolute emergency.
"When all the knits tear, I'm always ready to talk," the two-time father of the family told the magazine.
However, I can count the years I can still play handball on one hand.
I also have to say that after my long hospital stay in 2012, I became quite humble as far as my health is concerned.
After my career, at least I want to be able to go straight.
In 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo) he won the EHF Cup.
In 2012, he won the European Cup with Flensburg.
German economy in spring decreased by 0.2 percent
The crises surrounding the globe slowed the German economy in the second quarter.
The gross domestic product decreased by 0.2 percent from April to the end of June 2014 compared to the previous quarter.
This was communicated to the Federal Statistical Office and confirmed provisional calculations.
The economy alone lived up to consumption in spring, while investments fell.
Foreign trade also slowed down the economy.
Thanks to the strong annual start-up, a total of 0.8 percent of GDP plus for the first half of 2013 is generated compared to the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and the goal of the "MÃ¼nsterland-Mooiste", which led through the Burgmannsstadt for the first time on Sunday.
The Burgmannstadt Horstmar experienced an invasion of Dutch "cyclists" on Sunday.
The largest cycling association in the Netherlands, NTFU, organized the so-called "MÃ¼nsterlande-Mooiste".
It is the largest cycling tour across MÃ¼nsterland, the cycling paradise near the Netherlands.
Over 1000 participants thanked Jos ter Huerne for the organization of this tour of MÃ¼nsterland.
This tour was offered to interested people in various specialist magazines.
We came from Den Helder and drove overnight to participate in this tour.
We would also like to get to know MÃ¼nsterland in this way," the cyclists were pleased about the route through the districts Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After registration at the Verenigingsheim der SchÃ¼ SchÃ¼tzenbruderschaft Sta.
Katharina went on a small "peace ride" through the city over the wall, where the start was also made.
Further, the route, which was designed for three different categories, led towards Herrenholz over the SchÃ¶ppinger mountain towards Coesfeld and via Havixbeck and Bilderbeck back to Horstmar.
On lines of 95 kilometers with 1175 metres of altitude, 120 kilometers with 1475 metres of altitude and 145 kilometers with 1775 metres of altitude, cyclists proved their good condition.
They were taken care of on the road in Havixbeck and Bilderbeck.
Main organizer Jos ter Huerne and mayor representative Heinz LÃ¶lfing were very pleased about the success of this cycling event.
We are satisfied and it was a nice experience for everyone involved.
The organization went without problems and there were no negative incidents," says Heinz LÃ¶lfing, drawing a positive conclusion from this event.
Unfortunately, not so many participants came, as the organizer had hoped, which was probably due to the bad weather forecasts and the morning rain.
"We'll see you again in the year 2015 in the hopeful weather on August 30 or during another weekend," the cyclists promised to return to MÃ¼nsterland and the organizers are planning a new edition.
Konstantin Alarmer's unrelentingly honest memoirs
It is actually more philosophical evidence than biography, which has brought to paper Konstantin Wecker, Songmaker, Pacific, politically safe activist, ex-prisoner, in "Monch und Krieger" on 287 pages.
Not chronologically, but more thought fetters for thought fetters, the Munich-born on June 1, 1947, wrote down his memoirs, starting each chapter with a suitable song.
And he is ruthlessly honest: From the Onanie as a gymnasiast to shoplifting and drug use, he does not miss out on any human weakness.
Also to show how he himself has learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings.
Wide space also includes abstract but all the more important terms: love, soul, ego, being in the present, spirituality - all this he tries to get to the bottom, in a very philosophical, but also very personal way.
And he also explains his pacifism, his social critique, his political commitment - and also how he not only influenced the music (the opera lover became a soul and rock musician), but also his prison stay.
The latter also brought Lebemann Konstantin Wecker closer to the ascetic monk, who "becomes by subtraction", as he says, "by leaving everything unnecessarily away".
But there are also short anecdotes to the earth between all the high-spirited views: for example, through battlings in a locality frequented by GI's or a crazy driveway, in which he went frontal a tree.
There too he is ruthlessly honest.
Lenny Henry: My father never took me in the arm.
I never said "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children of a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and her relationship was limited.
Henry tastes for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and which emerged from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mixture of Reggae and Rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He visited "many" therapies after his mother's death, and Henry is thinking about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
You never saw his face, just stopped his voice: "Stop the crack.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to see Cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who had already grown up when I was a child - went to the bar with him and talked about things like the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket beat.
I never had such a conversation with him.
Most of my life he was this serious guy in the corner who read the newspaper.
Recently, Henry opened a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions were better than at the time of his father, he gained an insight into how life might have been for him.
It's a little brighter now, but they're dark, smoky, deep ascent labyrinths with flames and smoke and lots of soot.
My father used to just lay in the tub and then he could be heard singing slowly, because he could wash the foundry of himself.
As I walked around there, I realized that he had done this for years to bring the food to the table, and my respect for him grew bigger.
Still, Henry grew up as a child without his parents â€™ expressions of love.
My father never embraced me, he never said "I love you".
It wasn't until my mother went bad toward the end of her life that we started to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he was able to share the love he had missing as a child.
Could you stop with the "I love you"?
Stop hugging me!
Daddy, I'm 22!
with Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
It is still friends with French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's mother was a diabetic.
That contributed to her death.
So when I became very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You have to be radical.
So I went through this fitness thing and also had to make a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's exhausting.
No one likes to eat carrots.
Henry's career change may be reflected in his elegant, short-cut beard.
Since he was praised by the critics for his otello, he has been taken from the theatre.
It followed The Comedy of Irrigations, and then Fences of August Wilson.
This is a different experience from the sitcoms and comedies that have filled out his busy working life.
He started at only 16 years of age when he worked in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on stage when he imitated people and wrote to New Faces about him.
His television career began in the mid-1970s. "I was the only black imitator/comedian on television for quite a long time."
He learned in the profession.
Not only did I have to grow up in front of the public, but I also had to learn from 1975 to 1985 how I could become an efficient joke-telling machine while I was a star through television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
Since his manager had the stage right on the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program in which people "blackly painted themselves," Henry performed his comedy there for over five years.
My family was very uncomfortable.
I wish it had never happened, but I don't regret that I did.
It was a strange, unpleasant position for me, but I worked on huge projects and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But this "year-long award-winning light pillar of British television" was also a "grotesque parody of black people."
By introducing figures that both mocked and celebrated British black culture, Henry worked in the eighties on an alternative comedy circle.
The first series of the Lenny Henry Show went on show in 1984, and in the nineties he was known, among other things, as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!.
Advertising, documentary films, TV series and film roles shaped his next decade, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv in 2008, he thought: "What are you doing next, Len, because everything feels like you're just bringing the time around or a little bit on the spot."
Then came a documentary series for Radio 4 entitled What's So Great About ...?
The first episode was about Shakespeare.
I was really allergic to Shakespeare.
I had never really learned anything about him in the school and thought he was mostly a middle-class domain, white in tights and a carbon head in front.
So I was very scared of it.
All we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said, "You should try it.
Don't make it bad if you don't know what you're talking about.
Put some of the words in the mouth, and then you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry performed 20 lines from Othello's final speech for the documentary and he was enthusiastic.
I felt like I could do it.
It was almost as if someone had finally put up my head right.
"That's what it's about, it's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your text, research a little.
The samples were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we did it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car accident, and that just didn't happen.
And soon he appeared in the comedy of error.
Suddenly I was at the National Theatre and I could hardly believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you changed."
There was a technical mistake and Henry instinctively felt that he had to entertain the audience.
"A little voice said to me, "You have to bridge for 10 minutes now while they're repairing the computer."
Instead, the director announced that the idea continued as soon as the problem was solved.
I left the stage and said something inside of me, "Oh, thank God."
I'm not responsible for that.
I can leave this to someone else.
"You play in a play, so stay in your role."
Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image
Learning the text for Fences was challenging.
Panic is very good, which strengthens the tendons.
This was also a good thing, so it's like a big sign of the gods telling me "This is your destiny."
He says this, of course, with a donnerous voice.
So I'll stay with you.
I really love that.
I love being in a sample room.
But Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation is filled with humorous outbreaks, while he constantly imitates people.
I have decided not to make a stand-up comedy because I find that this kind of instant satisfaction from a room full of strangers is somehow dangerous.
When you always look for it, you drive it in front of a wall.
I sometimes perform live in Apollo if I like it, but overall I don't have as much as I used to.
I'm asking him if he'll ever make a stand-up comedy tour again.
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps to form a beginning, a middle part and the end of a trip - I don't think I ever want to give it up again.
So is this his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like to be an actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and that's great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Huthi rebels block streets in Yemen capital
In the conflict between Shiite Huthi rebels and Yemeni government, the Huthiss called for civil disobedience in the capital Sa.
Huthi supporters had occupied central streets on Monday in Sa, said a speaker of the Huthi party "Ansar Allah".
Access to Parliament has also been blocked.
Yemeni media report a traffic chaos in the capital.
According to the online publication of the newspaper "Yemen Post", Huthi leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi called for the measures on Sunday evening.
Huthi, according to the sheet, threatened with a further escalation of the conflict if his demands were not met.
The Shiite Hutis are fighting for more independence from the Sunni-led Yemen and demanding the resignation of the government.
The Huthi tribe has been besieging Yemeni capital for almost two weeks.
Around 30,000 rebels have built protest camps on the major access roads of Sanaa.
In the surrounding area, bloody struggles with the Yemeni army occur over and over again.
Kenya registered officials to limit "spirit workers"
Kenya has started to register all state officials biometrically to delete "spirit workers" from the government's payroll lists.
Staff who did not register in the next two weeks would no longer be paid was a government announcement.
The government suspects that thousands of people will still receive salary payments even after their resignation from the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to fight corruption in the public service in his 2013 office.
In an examination at the beginning of this year, it was found that at least $1 million (700.000) a month was lost in payments for "spirit workers" and other abusive financial practices.
The government suspects that salaries will continue to be paid on accounts after a person dies or leaves the public service, reports Wanyama Chebusiri for the BBC from Nairobi capital.
All officials must now appear at identification centres within the next two weeks to ensure that their data on biometric registrations is recorded, has been communicated in a government message.
All those who would not do so without a credible excuse were removed from the payroll list, the communication continued.
"This approach contributes significantly to the rationalisation of the public service by identifying the actual number of officials and also correcting the pay list at both levels of government - the "spirit workers" are eliminated," said Anne Waiguru, the cabinet secretary at the Ministry of Decentralisation and Planning.
The scandal for the art consultant Helge Achenbach will be negotiated for the first time in court on 11 November.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, son of the Aldi founder Theo Albrecht, claim 19.4 million euros in damages from Achenbach and two of his companies in insolvency proceedings in a civil trial at the Landgericht in DÃ¼sseldorf.
That was announced by a court officer on Monday.
In the appeal, it is stated that Achenbach had cheated on the purchase of works of art and old-timers and that Berthold Albrecht calculated higher than actually paid purchase prices.
As a result, the agreed commission was also higher.
Achenbach purchased value items for Albrecht for 121 million euros.
Children need roots and wings
He spent 44 years in school, 23 of them as headmasters.
From that time Manfred Richter knows many of Petershausen's and Kollbach's faithful students.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always supported by his striving to see the people in the student.
The snowheads are the most famous mountain in the Giant Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motif from his homeland.
Judge was born in 1930 in Trautenau/NordbÃ¶hmen, today Trutnov.
At the age of 14, he was already interested in the teacher's profession after four years of high school.
One year later, the Sudeten Germans were expropriated.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave their home.
After a few months in a camp, it went to Bavaria in 1946 - in the freight wagon.
This was how it took judges to the Upper Franconian sink village.
Teacher education took place in Bamberg.
To do so, Manfred Richter had to run six times a week ten kilometers to the next station, take the train to Bamberg, go there three kilometers across the city to school and back in the evening.
After two months Manfred Richter got a sleeping place in a Red Cross home in Bamberg: together with up to 15 fellow students in a dormitory.
In 1951, he took the second state examination and in 1954, after three years of teaching.
Since Oberfranken had no free teaching position for him, he applied for Oberbayern and arrived at the school in Kollbach on 1 November 1954.
The "FrÃ¤ulein Room" was his first "service apartment" in the schoolhouse.
In 1958, he moved to a three-room service apartment in the newly built teacher's house next to the school.
This house bought Manfred Richter in 1980 after the school had been dissolved in Kollbach in 1968.
Until then, there were three classes in Kollbach in the school association Petershausen-Kollbach and five in Petershausen.
From the school year 1968/69 these were summarized in Petershausen in today's town hall.
When the school association Indersdorf was founded, only the primary school remained in the village.
In order to avoid a resurgence in the now smaller school, the then rector Georg Sigl moved to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
But Petershausen grew, and so from September 1982 onwards, the children and their teachers were able to obtain the modern construction, which was extended after Richter's retirement in 1997.
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor Ludwig GÃ¶tz, who had a workroom built at municipal cost and at the extension in 1997 cellar rooms, although this was not eligible under the guidelines for school buildings.
"BÃ¼rgermeister GÃ¶tz was very school-friendly," continued Richter gratefully.
In all his career Manfred Richter never forgot the speech of a government representative who had replied to a speech by a school council on justice and justice: "You must never forget love." Manfred Richter implemented what he had heard as a young teacher.
"You have to give the children two things: roots and wings," says the 84-year-old today.
And he had to learn: "It doesn't always succeed." Whether he only means his students or his own six children, it's not quite clear.
In any case, Richter's actions were sometimes unconventional.
When students beat themselves, they didn't get a criminal job from him, nor were they thundered for after-sitting.
At the expense of the community, judges had two pairs of boxing gloves purchased and had the two counterparts compete against each other, even if there should be a auction.
For the benefit of the school, judges used to have a good relationship with the then mayor Ludwig GÃ¶tz (CSU).
He moved the non-partisan judge, after his retirement, to run for the municipal council in 1996, at least as the last on the CSU list.
But judges were elected to sixth place and joined the CSU.
180 kilometers in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 cyclists put stop at the spa park of Bad Salzhausen and Schotten
If cyclists rest on their tour in Bad Salzhausen or Schotten, this is nothing special in itself.
On Friday, however, the only impression was that the 700 participants of the hr4 cycling tour and the companion tross enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of Bad Salzhausen and later a party under the open sky in the Schottener Alteburgpark.
Under the motto "Raddles and celebrate on newly discovered paths between Nidda and Kinzig" the participants met in Bad Vilbel on Thursday and saw a concert by Van Baker & Band.
On Friday it became serious: the cyclists took the first stage, the 60 kilometers from Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and further to Schotten.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes were welcomed by Mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who had started cycling in Bad Vilbel, and the head of Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing-DÃ¶ring, own-owned company.
To refresh body and mind, all kinds of good things had been prepared: the country women from Ranstadt and Nieder-Mockstadt had baked 85 sheets of apple, twin, scatter and cheese cakes, which gave a wonderful mouth to the competent cyclists.
"Such cakes can only bake landwives," praised a participant from Aulendiebach, while ordering another piece.
Cold refreshments could be obtained at the water level of the GeiÃŸ-Nidda Turnverein.
The "Duo Bravo" entertained visitors with famous melodies from operettas and musicals and enjoyed enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful ambience of the park seemed relaxing.
A gentleman also enjoyed a head massage from his partner: "He deserved it, after all, he has already attached already jumped bike chains today".
Meanwhile, the mayor and the manager had to work: they were interviewed at the well in front of the drinking spa house by reporter Rainer Janke and took advantage of the opportunity to advertise on the radio for Bad Salzhausen.
Doctoral director Tobias Hagen, since the first hr4 bike tour 2004 as a tour director, was only able to eat briefly, he had plenty to do with the technology on site.
His pickup truck, in which he communicated via three phones and a radio with his employees and the 15-member motorcycle squad of police police station, wrote Facebook and made reports, also needed a check.
"Most of the participants come from the Rhine-Main area," he said, "but also from GieÃŸen or Fulda, from Lauterbach or Taunus and even from numerous cities in Westphalia, cyclists have arrived.
The number of participants depends a little on the available overnight capacity.
In category I, participants are accommodated in hotels, in category II in collective accommodation.
From the spa the cyclists had a good impression when they left after an hour and a half: "Bye!"
"It was nice in Bad Salzhausen!" they waved for farewell.
After arriving in Schotten, the group was allowed to take a short break.
But in the evening the cyclists were required in the idyllic Alteburgpark.
Under the direction of the Schottner Gesellschaft fÃ¼r Tourismus und Stadtmarketing (GTS), the park had received a beautiful festive environment and, of course, it had prepared treats such as flame cakes with well-cooled spring whitener.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS Managing Director Markus HoÃŸfeld and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs in his role as Board member of the ADAC Hessen-ThÃ¼ringen welcomed the visitors.
The three were clearly pleased about the "many operations in Schotten".
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance stage.
The opportunity to move under the open sky was eagerly used in spite of the sporty activity on the bike.
Among the guests there were increasingly mixed citizens who were just as pleased with the good mood as the great crowd of cyclists.
On the second day, the stations Birstein, WÃ¤chtersbach and Bad Orb - including a concert with the Trenkwalders - were on the program for cyclists.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometers of cycling, the athletes arrived back in Bad Vilbel.
Dozens of Turkish police officers arrested for "conspiracy" against the government
A total of 33 police officers were arrested in Turkey on the suspicion of "conspiracy against the government", reports local media agencies.
The police authorities did not comment directly.
Among the arrested are 14 high-ranking police officers, reports Hurriyet Daily News.
Some of them were involved in corruption investigations against government staff, including four government ministers last December.
In July, a number of Turkish police officers were arrested because they allegedly founded an organized criminal association and tapped telephone numbers.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (then Prime Minister) described her approach as part of the activities led by the Islamic clergy Fethulla GÃ¼llen against him and other people in power positions.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (1 September) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenij Jazenjuk brought his daughter to school.
There he told waiting journalists that not all schools had opened again, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in every school.
Heaven is not peaceful across Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful heaven.
The whole Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian people's front must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Paakthow, head of the school in Slavyansk, who visits Jazenjuk's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally prevail here and that the children will receive an education that will be useful to them in the future.
The first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons in their hands and giving flowers to their teachers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director she needs.
She arrives with a proud drag from the banking world, media management and the inner circle of the Tory party.
And she has her own front experience.
Her career began with the global management consulting company Bain and Co., whereupon she moved to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearsons.
She was Chairman of the Financial Times Board for seven years and resigned when the parent company Pearsons' top position went to a younger male colleague.
Their payoff was supposed to be almost Â£1 million.
Their political ranking is also solid.
She was recommended to David Cameron of Lord Browne, the former chairman of BP, when she looked for more private knowledge in Whitehall: she became a consultant to the cabinet.
Her husband is an earlier Tory Councilman.
As early as May, I described the chairman's task with a poisoned cup.
Not only is the BBC a huge and complex unity in the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Trust works in two directions: to the inside of the first guard of the BBC's own management hierarchy, but also to the outside as a voice of public concern and unrest when things are going wrong.
This ensures an almost unsustainable duopol, which requires a complete comprehensive reform.
But what new arrivals would risk entering, beating at everything and taking apart an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while perhaps killing himself around his job.
It's a difficult task.
And as if that were not enough, many are still interested in seeing the BBC reduced - power, money and status overtaken.
While competition is approaching and new technologies are threatening old, comfortable collateral, the forthcoming negotiation of license fees for the BBC is associated with particular dangers.
For the modest sum of Â£ 145.50 a year, the British public is buying into the world's largest media company.
The BBC tells a good story: it says it reaches 96 percent of all households, each costing only 40 Pence a day.
And apparently the BBC is rising again on the popularity scale: 53 percent support them today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
The visual and usage habits for the BBC have changed: I get news headlines on my cell phone these days and see missing programs later on my iPlayer.
But it remains a very beloved and remarkable institution.
She needs a considerable chairman - I hope she found him.
Perry from Texas says that lowering tweet was not authorized
A tweet from the official user account of the Republican governor of Texas, Rick Perry, on Sunday contained a lower comment on the democratic district attorney who is at the centre of a criminal charge against him for abuse of the authority.
The Tweet was later deleted and replaced by another one by Perry's user account, which rejects the previous one.
A tweet has just been sent from my account, which was not authorized by me.
"I don't approve of the Tweet and have deleted it," said the later message.
Perry staff did not respond immediately to requests for comments.
Although the tweets of Perry's official user account went out, it was not clear who was actually serving the feed.
In the earlier Tweet, an unfavorable picture of Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg was drawn, which was sentenced to drunkenness at the tax in April 2013.
Perry filed a veto against the financial support of her office when she refused to resign, leading to an indictment of Perry - which might be a presidential candidate in 2016 - before a Grand Jury this month in Austin.
The text of the Tweet reads: "I don't always drive drunk with the triple permitted alcohol level ... but when I do, I charge Governor Perry when he chats it."
I'm the most drunken democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not entrusted with the management of the investigation of the Grand Jury against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a special state attorney from San Antonio, who was selected by a Republican judge.
Perry pleaded for not guilty and called the charge a political trick.
His high-ranking team of lawyers requested that the judge in charge of the case reject the charges and argued that the law against the most senior governor in the history of the State of Texas is unconstitutional diffuse.
Perry stopped $7.5 million of government money from the State Public Integrity Unit - which is based in Travis County and determines in cases of state corruption in Texas - when Lehmberg refused to resign.
This veto caused a public complaint on the part of a left-wing watchdog group.
Perry's official user account is often updated - and sometimes famous.
After completing his fifth position at the Iowa elections during his presidential election in 2012, Perry went on to speculate that he would stop by posting a tweet of a photo of himself jogging near a lake, with the words "South Carolina, we are coming!"
Berkeley again declares housing market for "normal"
One of London's most prominent construction companies pointed out that the housing market in the south-east of England had returned to normal levels.
Homes in the capital were sorely coveted and subject to enormous price increases, which caused the Bank of England, because of the widespread fear of a loan bubble, to set limits on mortgage loans in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and CEO of the high-class construction company Berkeley, said on Monday: "Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the peak of 2013 and added that this offers a "stable environment for action".
The real estate market in London was well positioned during the downturn, as foreign buyers pushed into the capital.
According to information provided by the Cataster Office, prices in the urban area rose by 18.5 percent last year alone, far more than the average increase in England and Wales as a whole.
The average sales prices at Berkeley's private, cheap and student offers rose by about one fifth in the past year and were around Â£423,000 at the end of April.
However, a stronger pound has made real estate ownership in London less attractive to foreign buyers in recent months - some of them have also been deterred by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric for a possible "Villing Tax" before the general elections next May.
The London real estate agent Foxtons warned last week that the Mortgage Market Report for April, which presented tighter lending arrangements, would also lead to lower market growth in both real estate sales and prices in the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England from Monday show a decline in mortgage approval in July, which also indicates that the real estate market is cooling down.
Hampsys International, another real estate agency, corrected its prediction for the increase in real estate prices in London in 2015 down to 3%, based on a already weakening domestic price awareness.
The volume of transactions in Londonâ€™s most expensive areas, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, has dropped by a quarter year by year, according to broker WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, the desire for a home in Berkeleyâ€™s capital is a blessing, as the amount due for fixed-term sales amounts to over Â£2.2 billion.
Mr. Pidgley added: "The demand for the right, well-planned product at the best locations remained stable and, as a result, forward sales remained stable."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year until the end of April - almost a third more than the peak in 2007 before the crisis.
Annual pre-tax earnings increased by 40 percent annually to Â£ 280 million, with revenues of 18 percent to Â£1.6 billion.
In a communication on Monday before the company's annual meeting, Mr. Pidginy said that Berkeley's revenue is expected to be in line with current market expectations in the current year.
Analysts estimate the annual pre-tax profit at Â£ 450 million.
Berkeley shares stood at Â£23.96 in London trade in the afternoon.
Naked photos of Jennifer Lawrence published by hackers on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence's performance at the 85th Oscar's ceremony.
Naked photos of Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence were published online by a hacker who claimed to have a "master list" of pictures of another 100 starlets.
A representative of the star from "The Tribute of Panem" confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were real and sued the hacker for "eclatant violation of privacy".
The authorities have been notified and will follow all those who post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos originally posted on the Photo Sharing page 4chan were supposedly purchased by a gap in Apple's iCloud online storage system. The alleged "master list" of hacking victims includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Cate Olsen, reported BuzzFeed.
It is not certain how many of the pictures are real, although Winstead, star from "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" also condemned the hack on Twitter.
"To those of you who look at photos that my husband and I took years ago in the private environment of our house - I hope you are so really satisfied with you," Winstead wrote on Twitter.
Victoria Justice from the Nickolodeon series "iCarly" and "Victorious" however argued that the photos were pictures of her and tweeted "These so-called nude pictures of me are FEELING, people.
Let's get to the beginnings. *Word game intended*.
Buzzfeed reported on the late Sunday that a speaker of the pop star Ariana Grande rejected the authenticity of the alleged photos from her.
Exclusive extract from Howard Jacobson's highly praised new novel about love and the letter "J".
They were broken, so it was best described, they slowly disintegrated like a box that was left in the rain.
Sometimes a woman told him he was too serious, strenuous, intense, distant, and perhaps a little scratchy.
And then shook his hand.
He knew scratchy.
He was stingy, like hedgehog, yes.
The last victim of this stinginess was a just beginning affair that had been more promising to ease the lonely boredom of his life than usual, perhaps even bringing him a certain satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a trembling tender beauty with untamed hair and a flattering heart from a village on the North Island, which was even more remote and rough than Port Reuben.
She had come south with an older companion who thought Kevern was her aunt, and who had inherited a property in a damp but paradise valley with the striking name Paradise Valley.
In several years, no one had lived in the house.
The pipes were leaky, in the bathrooms were still spiders, naked snails had left their traces on all windows and believed that all of this belonged to them, and the garden was overgrown with weeds that looked like huge cabbage heads.
It was like the house from a children's fairy tale, both threatening and tempting, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the longlist for the Man Booker Prize 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
With Ailinn, Kevern had sat on the broken deckchairs in the high grass and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon. Both of them had sunk mentally into the service console, which provided the country with soothing music and consoling news when the sight of their crossed brown legs reminded him of an old song of a long-forgotten black entertainer, whom his father had liked to listen to in closed shutters in the house.
Your feet are too big.
Due to their own aggressiveness, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Not banned - nothing was so properly forbidden - just not played.
It was successfully obsolessed, just as the word obsolessessed.
The general taste created what decrees and regulations had never been made, and how people choose from books the from-counter-to-millionaire-memoires, cookbooks and love novels, so they chose the ballads at the music.
In the euphoria of the day, Kevern began to play an imaginary piano and to sing in a grossly comic serenade of Ailinn's great feet.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"That was a well-known song by a jazz pianist named Fats Waller," he explained to her and automatically laid two fingers on his lips.
His father had always done that to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It had started as a game between him and his father when he was still small.
His father had played it with his own father, so he had told.
If you start a word with a J without putting two fingers over your lips, it'll cost you a penny.
It had not been a very funny game back then, and it was not very funny now.
He knew this was expected of him, that was all.
It had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard of any.
Jazz was not played, even though he was not directly forbidden.
Improvising was no longer modern.
It was only space for a single "if" in life.
At the beginning of a melody, the people wanted to be quite sure where they would end.
So is the mind.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was musically expressed mind.
Although he had grown 10 years old without hearing about Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew about jazz from the half secret collection of his father's old CDs.
But at least he didn't have to explain Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
At her age she probably couldn't remember a time when pop singers weren't black.
Again, no laws or constraints.
A compliant society meant that every element of this society gratefully agreed to the principle of group talent - gratefully as those spared from fate.
People of Afro-Caribbean origin were suitable for entertainment and sports through temperament and physique, so they sang and ran.
People originally from the Indian subcontinent were blessed by nature with electronic talent and were entrusted with the task of ensuring that no family remained without a functioning service phone.
What was left of the Polish community took care of sewerage; what was left of the Greeks crushed plates.
Those from the Gulf States and the Levant whose grandparents had not quickly left the country when WHAT HAPPENED TO BE, WHEN IT HAPPENED - for fear of being charged with fires, for fear even that the flames would eat them next - had opened Labneh and Shisha pipes restaurants, kept themselves in mind and were depressed with the inactivity.
Everyone according to their abilities.
Since she had only heard ballads, it was difficult for Ailinn to understand how the insulting words that beetles had just sung her could ever be displayed.
Music was expression of love.
"They're not really insulting," said Kevern.
Except maybe for people whose feet are too big.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved that song.
He talked too much, but the neglected garden gave him the deceptive sense of security.
Nothing could overcome the sound insulation of the huge carbon-like leaves.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why would your father have loved that?
He wanted to say that it was a jux, but he hesitated to put two fingers on her lips again in her presence.
She thought he was a little weird anyway.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She shook her head and blocked Kevern's vision.
There was nothing else to see all over the world than her uncombed ravenish-black hair.
There was nothing else he would have liked to see.
"If you say so," they say without conviction.
But that doesn't explain why you sing it to me.
She seemed honestly concerned.
Are my feet too big?
He looked back.
Your feet aren't that straight.
Maybe your ankles, a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
Hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
That's just the stupid song.
He could have said "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"Your thick ankles are exactly the reason why you like me," he tried it instead.
I'm a little perverted.
That didn't sound right.
It should have been funny.
When he tried to be funny, he often found himself in trouble because, like his father, he did not have the soothing charm needed to master the cruelness inherent in jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he wanted to be, Kevern.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomons became red and rose from her deck chair, threw the console over and poured out the wine they had drunk.
Older flower wine, so drunkenness was no excuse for him.
In her excruciation, she seemed to be trembling, like palm puddles in the storm.
"And your fathead is exactly the reason why I pulled myself to you perverted," she said...
Except that I'm not at all.
She was sorry, both for the unnecessarily unkindness of his words and for the fear shown in her eyes when she rebelled against him.
Did she think he'd beat her?
She had not told him about life on the cold northern archipelago where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially like here.
The same huge and ice-cold ocean broke here like there on the shore.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and more shady according to DEM WAS WATER than their ancestors had been smugglers and beach robbers, went from bar to bar, always ready to raise their hands against a woman who refused or laughed at them.
Dickkopf?
They would have shown her a big fist if she didn't care!
They just squiggly - Knutchen was the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, an antidote to the inescapable love ballads from the console - they squeak first and then beat.
In Kevernâ€™s view, this was an unnecessary refinement, since the knut itself was already an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign through her body to go.
He rose from the deck like an old man.
She also felt bitten, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
That was not the end of the world.
They hardly knew each other.
She watched him walk away, just as her companion watched him from a room on the upper floor, a man complained by something he himself had sworn up.
Adam left the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, although some had raised their hands against her.
A man turned away from her, bowed his back, ashamed, defeated, without a fighting spirit - why was it a sight she seemed to know well, if she could not remember one time she had seen something like this before today?
When she was alone again, Ailin Solomons looked at her feet.
Some years before the events just told, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher commissioned by Ofnow, the non-legislative monitoring body for the public mood, was working on a short lecture on the continued violence at a low and medium level in precisely the parts of the country where their reduction, if not abolition, was most likely, given the money and energy invested in the eradication of this violence.
"A lot has already been done, and much remains to be done," she wrote, "to appease the innate aggressiveness of a people who have waged a thousand wars and won most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country, in which the sweet breath of human kindness has rarely been felt historically despite the highly challenging church towers between the hedges.
But some characteristics prove to be inexhaustible.
The higher the church tower, it seems, the less the passion it continues to awaken.
The population cries in hearing sentimental ballads, intoxicates themselves with stories about overcome difficulties and claims to firmly believe in the virtues of marriage and family life, but nevertheless not only does the former roughness hold the rural communities as well as our urban structures firmly in hand, but there is also evidence for the emergence of a new and insidious fight at home, at the workplace, on the streets and even on the playgrounds.
"They have an unfortunate tendency to exaggeration," said their mentor when he read the whole report.
I suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nut Tree lowered her head.
I also have to ask, are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to say that," replied Esme Nussbaum.
Are you gay?
Again, Esme called on her right to privacy and to refuse the statement.
Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image
Keep quiet.
"I don't ask," said Luther Rabinowitz finally, "because I was against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
This is a prejudice-free job.
We serve a prejudice-free society.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which in itself are absolutely acceptable and praiseworthy, may occasionally distort results as you have presented them.
You yourself obviously have prejudices against the Church, and these things that you call "behind" and "raw" could equally be interpreted by others as an expression of natural strength and vitality.
If you continue riding around on that, WHAT IT IS, WHEN IT IS GOVERNED, as if, if it had happened yesterday, it means taking its essential vital life force from the land.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, an LED lettering in Flamingorosa repeated the advice that Ofnow had given to the country in the last quarter of the century or more.
Smile at their neighbors, appreciate their partner, listen to ballads, visit musicals, use their phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, the sung word is better than the written, but nothing is better than love.
"I absolutely absolutely want to go beyond what you want," Esme Nussbaum replied with a calm voice when she was sure that her superior had spoken at the end, "and I say nothing but that we are not yet as effectively healed as we imagine.
My concern is that without warning we may find ourselves repeating the mistakes that have been made only to THE WHO, WHEN IT IS FEARED.
But this time it's not the others we're letting go of our anger and our mistrust.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands.
In order to point out an angel's virtue.
"You go too far," he said, "if you call actions "mistakes" that our grandparents may or may not have committed.
They go too far, too, when you say that they have omitted their "wit" and their "mistrust" of "others".
Actually, it should not be necessary to remind someone in your position that we speak of "us" and "others" in understanding the past as in protecting the present.
There was no "we" and there were no "other".
It was a time of disorder, that's all we know.
"From the one, if we are honest with ourselves," Esme dared to throw, "no part of society can claim to have behaved well.
I'm not suing anyone.
Whether it has been done bad or good, what has happened has happened.
That was then.
Nothing needs to be said about this - we agree.
And just as no debt has to be allocated, no debt has to be cleared if such redemption is appropriate and if there is a way to annul it.
But to what does the past serve if we do not learn from it -
The past serves to make us forget it.
If I can say something about it -
Luther Rabinowitz collapsed his pyramid.
"I will remember her report," he said and released her.
The next day, when she went to work as usual, she was crossed by a motorcyclist who, as Passersby described, had gone on foot in a kind of "brutal rage".
There are coincidences.
Lesotho military member says no coup is planned; Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Official representatives of the military in Lesotho argued to have planned a coup d'Ã©tat to overthrow the government and said that they were against police officers accused of arming political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Tabane fled the country and announced that the country's army had surrounded its seat and occupied government buildings in Maseru capital.
The Prime Minister brought his family to neighboring South Africa after reporting threats of attack.
Military spokesperson Major Ntlele Ntoi said that there was de facto no coup d'Ã©tat, but that the military responded to the threat posed by "political fanatics" whose armed forces were about to come.
"What happened this morning was that the staff of the defence forces of Lesotho acted after having received several intelligence reports that within the police were acting on some elements that actually wanted to arm some of the political, party-political young fanatics who were about to do devastating damage," he said to Voice of America.
South African spokesperson Clayson Monyela said that the military action had made the impression of a crash.
"Even if no one has claimed to have torn the government by force, all reports agree that the activities of Lesotho's defence forces so far show signs of a coup," he said.
Speakers of the military of Lesotho announced on Sunday that the soldiers were going back to their barracks and the location in the capital was quiet.
In the meantime, Vice Prime Minister Mothetjoya Metsing takes over the leadership during Tabane's absence.
Tabane announced that he believed that he had become a target because of his attempt to fight corruption in the country.
In Lesotho there have been great tensions since June after Tabane suspended parliamentary meetings due to the conflicts in his single government.
He said that his actions would not have undermined the government, otherwise allegations would have been made.
Production in the eurozone at a 13-month low
The increase in production in the eurozone slowed down to the lowest point in the last 13 months in August, according to a closely observed study.
The final market purchasing manager index of the manufacturing industry (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, after a stand of 51.8 in July.
An indication of over 50 indicates an expansion.
New orders went back and factories experienced collapses at a time of rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures arrive before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
The markets expect the Bank to have a clear plan for dealing with a slow recovery of the euro area and for the imminent deflation at an inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There are speculations that the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could provide further information during this week on whether he is considering a quantitative relief for the euro area, in line with those made by the United Kingdom and the United States during the financial crisis.
"Although small growth is better than no growth at all, the inhibiting effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainty have become more evident for manufacturers," said Rob Dobson, Managing Economist at Markit.
The factory PMI for Germany, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to the lowest level in 11 months at 51.4.
In the meantime, in the second largest economic nation of the block, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France remains a child of concern, as did the descent of Italy from a solid expansion to stagnation.
Notes that growth incentives in the key industrial mechanism Germany and in Spain and the Netherlands are no longer a source of comfort are also not soothing," said Mr Dobson.
The decline in industry is likely to fuel the fire of the analysts who expect further monetary or fiscal incentives.
A positive news came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI increased to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, Chief Business Expert at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing to say about the Eurozone's purchasing manager index for the Eurozone's manufacturing industry from August is that the sector continues to grow after that."
He added: "Producers in the eurozone currently find life quite difficult, as the current increased geovoltage of tensions - especially with regard to Russia and Ukraine - increases uncertainties in the still difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy, in particular, and consumer confidence, and are likely to cause some orders to be delayed or even cancelled, in particular large-scale contracts.
He said that it would be "always more likely" for the ECB to finally introduce a kind of QE, "although we suspect that this will be limited."
The Hellâ€™s decade of Beslanâ€™s survivors: Ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school, as the children in it still suffer today.
Ten years ago, over 1,000 people were taken hostages by Chechen militias in a school in Beslan in southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day martyrdom that shocked the world.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death during the atrocities in the classroom.
Just a decade after the horrific siege of the school of Beslan, in which 334 people died, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned of a new apocalypse in Ukraine last night.
As fanatic Islamist terrorists captured and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, the beginning of a new school year, it seemed like the worst of evil.
The tragedy united West and East in horror, and then surprisingly turned into action and hope for the future in the middle of the worst misery.
Ten years later we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death during the atrocities in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, although the memory of this terrorist hell will persecute them forever.
Your greatest hope?
That the war that is now attacking Ukraine - and in which children die as they die - now finds an end.
The girl who was photographed trying to get back to the shot school sports hall
She was photographed and famous by the Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakov when she only tried in her underwear to climb back to the broken school sports hall after a mine had exploded.
Completely confused, Aida was looking for her mother Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were considered dead, but they survived.
"A woman told me to run around my life, but I couldn't," said Aida.
My legs were flooded.
I got up and climbed back in to look for my mother.
A soldier put her in safety.
After a number of operations, she considered herself completely healed, but said yesterday: "Three months ago, the pain returned.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to go back to surgery.
Some pomegranates are still in my knee.
Her goal now is to become a dentist to help people how doctors helped her.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it didn't break me," she said.
"This happened to me, and you can't change that.
Once a year I always go to the gym to remind myself of those who have stayed there.
My friends and I are trying not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were little and dreamed of going to school together.
"I don't want to marry until I finish my studies and start my career.
I think of a family later.
She says that the siege will always remain a part of it, although the memory becomes a little weaker every year.
I am glad that many people in the world remember our horrors and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in the UK and everywhere.
When I see the photo of myself online, how I climb back to school, I think that many people see it for the first time, understand our disaster and contribute to the fact that something like that doesn't happen again.
The boy who fled through the spherical hail, in the opinion that his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (Russians went to school at the age of 7) and survived the three-day siege in his mother Tamara's arms.
When he was seven, he said, "Mama told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand."
After an explosion, he thought she'd die.
She said to him, "Run."
Afraid that she could be dead, he fled and saw a crying toddler on the way, caught it by the hand, and fled through a spherical hail.
His father Vladimir, who closed his son in his arms outside, said, "Damir told me his mother had died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In reality Tamara was stumbled outside and with leg injuries in the hospital, on her part assuming that her son had died.
After her reunification she said, "I wept for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and embraced me.
Damir was later flown to London (from the meanwhile dissolved newspaper News of the World) to receive the title of a Barnardo's Children's Champion by then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror follows you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering," he said yesterday.
But I can say it's getting pale in my memory.
I remember throwing away all my toy guns right after that.
But now I can play computer games with shooting scenes and that's not a problem for me.
"I'm not afraid of going back to the gym, but I don't think about myself.
I remember those kids I played in the yard with and who didn't do it outside.
We never say they were killed or dead.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember very well my trip to London, especially to the toy shop, where I could choose everything I wanted, and the ride in an open car.
But now he is afraid for place like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of disaster he and his friends suffered.
This horror follows you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I am so sorry for all those who suffer from the abominations," said Damir, who worked as a volunteer in a monastery last week.
I'd like to help.
I want to go to the police one day and hope they'll take me to the training academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said, "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine that?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were just no children who could call and walk around, and this silence lasted many months.
She remembers her trip to London with Damir.
The people in London cried when I told our story.
At the time, I understood how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the prize and the opportunity to travel to London in autumn 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her myself that 10 years have passed, but I still remember the meeting with her and her husband in London, and how the Damir and I helped.
I remember Damir wanting to eat Borschtsch and call them all Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with waiters in a restaurant. Damir shot at her with his water gun and they ran away and played with him.
And that was only a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British willingly shared our pain and supported us.
She said, "I always think this world hasn't gotten better in these 10 years.
In Ukraine, the war continues now, and every day people die, and I believe that many children have been killed and are still killed.
These are just like our children.
I think that for many the war is part of the news they hear when they are bored or busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, the whole horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and that's so sad.
Damir grew up and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he is not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he does not look for revenge, he is not overwhelmed by past abominations.
I know he doesn't like to remember it, but he has six close friends from the class and they occasionally go to the gym and light candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from it - I remember sometimes laying down on the sofa, turning the face away from us for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he threw off all his weapons and other military toys. Damir is now 17, bigger than I am, good-looking, intelligent and healthy.
I can hardly believe I was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and came to the legs, I looked around and saw hell around me, with body parts all around.
I was absolutely sure my little boy could not have survived in this hell.
"I remember calling him, "Damir, run, run away," but I was also so sure he hadn't heard me.
But he heard it, and he ran away.
And so, unlike many others, life goes on for us.

The boy whose terrible image became the symbol of Beslan's abomination after the siege
Comfort: The Beslan-surviving Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege in 2004, on the right a picture of Georgij today
His flooded face was drawn by fear when he ran around his life while Chechen terrorists shot his classmates.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols for the barbarians of Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, had dismissed him for his first day of school before she set off to bring her older son Vladimir to university.
"I left the yard about two minutes before the terrorists stormed him, and so my little boy stayed there alone for three terrible days," she recalls.
Not all alone, there was a whole family of relatives of us, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgia managed to survive.
The closer this date comes, the harder it is to think about it and talk about it.
There's not a single day we don't remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's been a long time, I mean, it would have happened yesterday, some scenes from these days always follow me.
No one will ever forget that, I promise you.
Intensive: The image of Georgij (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right).
I remember that Georgij was so eager to go to school that day, and he said he wanted to embrace his teacher.
I only knew he was alive when I saw him on television.
And now there is even this statue of the crying Georgia in San Marino.
Georgij doesn't like the picture, and it's hidden in our bookshelf at home.
I understand, but I also mean that people around the world feel our pain thanks to this image.
Georgij says today: "It is important that this can never happen again.
"I doubt we'll ever learn the truth.
People constantly examine such tragedies and never learn the truth.
And now they're investigating the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused him?
This world is becoming something terrible.
"I can't understand how this is possible, because if you ask people, no one wants a war, so how does this happen?
Ten years are nothing in such pain.
We need dozens of years to forget it a little bit.
It has attacked my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years, I had a few nightmares because of the siege, but then it got better.
I went back to school later in 2004 and was scared every day.
I was thinking of my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That's why I always go to the gym when September 1 approaches.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It's hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is now part of my past.
I won't forget, but I'm not sorry.
My life goes on.
I graduated from school this year and attended a medical school in Vladikavkaz.
I'm going to be a heart surgeon.
My first choice was an education in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health didn't allow that.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that won't happen.

The boy who survived, although caught at the feet of a murderous terrorist
A miracle: Georgij Fanijev was trapped at the feet of a murderous terrorist during the siege, but he managed to survive.
During the siege, he was caught in the gym and sat next to the bomb, which was attached to the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It's really a miracle that he wasn't killed.
"We feel as if it had been before," says Georgij, who wanted to go to FSB as a secret service agent, but could not do so because of his health damage due to the siege.
It's still with me, it's nothing I left behind.
I'm older now and people say that children can easily deal with bad experiences - I have to say that's not true.
"In 2006, I worked with psychologists and felt a little better after that, but I can't forget it.
And I'd like to forget.
2005 - the year after - was the first and only time I went back to the gym.
I lost consciousness.
I will never return there again and please don't ask me to show you where I sat in this famous picture.
Survivor: Georgij Fanijev today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is immense, and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know that I don't like to think about it or talk about it, and they never asked me about school.
Physically, I'm fine.
I should be careful with my wounded knee, but I can walk well now.
But because of my health, I couldn't study at the FSB's Secret Service Academy in St. Petersburg, as I wanted.
I sent in my documents, also the medical ones, and they replied that it was not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I've been there for two years.
He learns the treatment of all animals "from cats to cows".
He said, "I knew I would never tell my children about my experiences.
Children should know nothing about it, and they should not, of course, suffer it.
His mother Marina, 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
He's in my soul, worse when the anniversary draws closer.
I'll go to the celebrations to remember.
I know Georgia won't go.
It has to be much stronger for him because he was there and I wasn't.
I waited for him at home and could not help.
I am so grateful to God that he was given back to me.
It stays in us.
Georgij is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.
It's hard to accept this when something so unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't participate because of his knee.
He's been operated on several times, he can run, but he can't do any sports.
I'd say he overcame the horror 50%, but you can never completely overcome it and forget it.
This terrible experience will always follow us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the siege and this only reinforces my pain.
I lost a lot of people I knew well and who were expensive to me.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could make me, but my heart cries for the dead.
I know about families where new children were born, but also widows who never got married again.
It's hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart leaped inside me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what is going on in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is now very close to our country and I can hardly believe it.
We used to be a friendly country, how can we fight now?
People and children suffer, I am sure that many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many are still killed.
If only we could seize and throw out all these rebels - as far away as possible.
Aljona Tskayewa, 10
The baby so grippingly carried by a special mission command in safety
Gerettet: Aljona Tskajewa is secured by a Russian special mission command (left).
It is now ten (right) and does not remember the atrocities at all.
The world held its breath in 2004 when the baby Aljona was carried in the arms of a Russian police officer from the siege of Beslan.
The terrorists let her go, but held her 30-year-old mother, 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar back in the school sports hall.
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljona's mother and sister died in the murderous slaughter.
Her father Ruslan has remarried since then and has a little girl with his new wife Svetlana, whom he named after his lost daughter Kristina.
Aljona, ten years old today, does not remember the siege and has grown up to be an intelligent and happy girl, say neighbors.
"They are now a great happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to spare them all the memories that come up with the tenth anniversary.
You'll understand why.
Man accused of having crossed girls on pedestrian crossing in Fife
A 78-year-old man is on trial for crossing a three-year-old girl on a pedestrian crossing in Fife.
Gordon Steward is accused of having hit a girl on the transition in Pittenween in East Neuk.
The indictment states that Mr. Steward controlled his Audi Q3 without the necessary care and attention and injured the girl.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, broke the charge before Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC initiated the trial for January.
4 tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you would like to take photos or videos underwater, there is a selection of devices.
The cheapest option is a waterproof point-and-shoot, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action cam like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which are both available for about $300.
I took these photos at a family party with multiple cameras, all of which are available at a price below $350.
Regardless of the equipment, there are a few rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery compartment and other compartments are closed.
Set your camera to the photos or videos you want to record.
Some cameras and camcorders have scene and recording modes that optimize exposure time for the insulating underwater conditions.
And before you jump into it, check to what depth your equipment is functional.
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Search our shopping guide and reviews of digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models.
Make multiple shots - because many won't work.
Point-and-shoot cameras feature an LCD that allows you to compose images, Action-Cams usually do not.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to see it underwater, and the right picture setting is a lucky thing.
So take a lot of shots.
If your camera has a row mode with which a series of shots are made with slightly changed exposure settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light gets dramatically worse, the further you get away from the surface.
So if possible, stay close to the surface when you take shots in a pool, lake or sea.
This will also allow you to bring more color into your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Go close to the objects.
This is also a good advice on land, but it is all the more important under water because of the bad light conditions.
It is particularly important when working with an action cam: These devices often have a fixed wide-angle lens, which means you need to get closer to your objects when they are to fill the entire frame.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the variety whose character changes things, even in such a huge organization as the NHS.
As a consulting anaesthesiologist, he dedicated his career to saving the sick both the agony of the disease and the torments of treatment.
Among his patients, his wife remembers, was an MI6 employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that doctors are important for the diagnosis and disease, while the patients are mainly concerned with something quite different: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose path of suffering began.
"I didn't feel like it," he wrote in May of this year.
I had trouble getting up.
While fighting the flu-like symptoms, he noticed that he was impatiently blaming his wife Juliet.
"I want everything right away than later," he noted.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt quite unusual and unwarranted.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to carry out an X-ray examination of his chest.
It was only two weeks ago that he had been skiing in the French Alps.
The results of the X-ray investigation were available.
He suffered from mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that attacks the breast skin, i.e. the skin that covers the lungs.
As with most cancers, the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine.
While some smokers suffer from lung cancer, not all lung cancer patients used to be smokers.
But Mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos load - contact with the fibre building material, which was once considered "wonder" but has now been recognized as deadly.
For most of us, Mesothelioma is a disease that can easily ignore.
Asbestos is finally a product of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos was no longer used in the UK since the 1960s when industry voluntarily committed itself to stop using it.
Even where he was still employed, only people in certain industries worked directly with the fabric - plumbing, construction workers, carpenters, and shipyard workers, for example.
As an industrial hazardous substance from another time, it seems to be hardly worrying today.
But this self-satisfaction is inappropriate.
Britain, it seems, is experiencing the culmination of a mesoltheliom epidemic today.
There are more deaths from mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths a year, twice as many people die of this disease as in traffic accidents.
Annual statistics of Mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and expected future deaths in Great Britain
The reason why we are experiencing the deadly effects now, although asbestos has been illegal for years (all asbestos types were banned in 1999), is that a mesothelioma only develops after decades.
And the scourge of Mesothelioma is not limited to former workers in the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and is often still present in the houses in which we live, the offices in which we work, the schools in which we learn and the shops in which we shop.
And therefore Mesothelioma knows no class barriers, financial limits, professions or age.
The privileged bastions, from the elegant department stores in London to private schools, are no shelter.
The Parliament buildings are asbestos-defiled.
Even in hospitals where we are supposed to get well, this deadly carcinogen has already been designated as the starting point.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a plumber either.
In fact, it was difficult for him to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
"It looks like there was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I completed my training for six years." he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and gaters - use the tunnels.
You wonder how many my peers will suffer from the same illness?
Unfortunately, he was able to answer at least in part this question.
"From the four doctors who were trained at Guy's Hospital and who have been suffering from Mesothelioma in the last five years," he wrote in a letter in 2010, "I am the last one who is still alive."
How many of us will still be ill?
At Andrew Lawson, Mesothelioma was diagnosed at the age of 48.
When he died on February 17 this year, he was 55.
That was an unusually long survival period.
Fifty percent of all mesotheliomars die within 8 months of diagnosis.
The disease always ends fatal.
We can therefore only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us will still be ill?"
UK's leading expert on Mesothelioma, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain is expected to fall, a total of 90,000 of the disease will have died.
Most of them have no idea at the moment that they will die like this.

A brief look at the files of the courts to which the persons concerned often refer for damages claims shows how far the scourge of the Mesothelioma has already been spread.
In June this year, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that Janice Allen had negligently exposed asbestos.
She worked for nine years for the chain, from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of which was the flagship store on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years old when she started working at M&S.
Now she has two children in the twenties.
"Before this thing," she says, "I had never heard of Mesothelioma, I didn't even really know anything about asbestos.
I never thought this would affect me.
There are only a few people who know a lot about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos does not refer to a substance, but to a group of six minerals.
The name comes from the word "Asbestiform", a description of the fiber structure that makes the fabric resistant and flexible.
Three out of six were used in the construction industry.
Chrysotil, also known as white asbestos, is today by far the most commonly found asbestos in buildings.
It was used for roof plates, floor panels, pipe insulations, boilers, even for brake pads in cars.
It is less deadly than other forms of asbestos, but is nevertheless considered by the EU and WHO as a "great health risk" with possible death.
However, more dangerous is the brown asbestos (Amosit) and the blue asbestos (Krokydolith).
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts believe that "there is clear, but indirect evidence that this was the main reason for the uniquely high mesothelioma rates."
A staff member of Marks & Spencer was exposed in the flagship store on Oxford Street, London, Asbestos Alamy
Janice Allen may not have seen himself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but Julian Peto's work indicates that her story is by no means unusual.
He has presented a study of the persons concerned, showing that "a significant proportion of mesothelioma without known suspension by work or in the home was probably caused by asbestos contact in the environment."
Most of these contacts are said to be based on the "normal use and aging" of our buildings.
It looks like no one could assume to be safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, who has examined the palace of Westminster, shows how people could have been unwittingly exposed to the substance even in the heart of the government.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service shafts and pipelines behind Parliament's committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be infiltrated by something as harmless as "strong air movements".
Members of Parliament are often accused of taking care of their own interests, but here it looks as if the opposite is true.
While the Directorate of the Parliamentary Labour Service insisted that the Westminster Palace had received a "clean health certificate", it is now undisputed that 1 billion pounds of work has to be spent over several years in order to renovate Parliament, modernise the electrical installations and remove asbestos, and that after the 2015 general elections, Members will probably meet in the nearby QE2 conference centre rather than on the green banks in Westminster.
The Goddard report also pointed out that "the presence of asbestos was not handled in accordance with the respective provisions."
No one can know if this mismanagement will cost life.
All you can do now is wait.
A person who could never precisely determine contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general physician.
Like Andrew Lawson, the 50-year-old Abbott suspects that he was exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital where asbestos complaints were decided positively," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It is so difficult to remember all the places you have worked on and the data.
What he remembers is the day at the beginning of December 2009, when he got such a fever.
He was 45 years old, and he was performing surgery late in the evening.
All of a sudden, I had a shaking frost.
It came all of a sudden.
I felt terrible.
I didn't think I'd make the trip home anymore.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain from the chest skin, the skin around his lungs, was causing.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma.
He didn't go to work for a month.
Surprised doctors took x-rays of his chest and set up pleuracathether to extract fluid from the lungs and test in the laboratory.
However, his complaints remained undiagnosed.
His health improved slowly, and he returned to his workplace.
From time to time, however, the symptoms returned, often after sporting activity and intense breathing.
In 2011, a patient came to Abbotts with similar symptoms in his practice and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even now, Abbott did not link this to his own case.
Finally, his patient was a few decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in that case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated again and his family doctor brought his CT scans and X-rays to an expert group.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott felt sick for the first time, a probe equipped with a camera was introduced into the cave between the rib and the breast fur.
I'm an optimist.
Most of the time, I'm just going on," he says.
Honestly, I didn't even worry so much.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was the week between Christmas and New Year: "They told me it was Mesothelioma."
Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image
Suddenly, Abbott had appointments with Macmillan nurses, one of whom he recommended to take a lawyer.
Only now did he understand the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often isolated with asbestos," he says.
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now suffering.
And so Mesothelioma meets younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous pipes with asbestosing in hospitals were under the ground, so patients were probably not exposed to the substance.
But many employees who had moved in pedestrian tunnels from one building to another (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in underground canteens (as Graham Abbott often did), were most likely in contact with the toxic substances.
It appears that over several decades after the war, hospitals may have been life-saving for the patients, but life-threatening for the treating doctors.
He's still being removed today.
Students put their Bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and city halls due to its fabulous insulating and flame-retardant properties.
Schools too.
In fact, many people probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.
Throughout the country, in thousands of chemical hours, students have put their Bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
The topic of asbestos in schools is now often addressed on websites.
And in the meantime, such innocent objects in our houses as flooring plates or shed roofs have standard asbestos.
"It is an industrial poison that is contained in much of our properties," observed Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that struck a affected woman was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
So be careful how to tear down your garden sheds.
The effects of the diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, are immense.
"It takes a while to process that," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to continue, but I realized I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I was in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I'm not going to see another Christmas party.
With the greatest difficulty, the change of perspective was from the position of a doctor to that of a patient.
Like countless patients in front of him, he remembers how overwhelmed he was by all the information he had to deal with.
"It was very difficult to record all of this," he says.
"I asked my doctor how long do I have?"
And they gave me about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to have another Christmas.
That's it."
Mesothelioma is particularly insidious because it is our life-keeping mechanism - breathing itself - that causes deadly cancer.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos consists of smallest fibres.
When the asbestos is swirled up and the fibers are inhaled, they can be stuck in the breast fur, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the breastskin and can trigger cell mutations.
"The problem arises with the inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibers," said Professor Tom Treasure, a heart-thorax doctor who moved to Guy's Hospital in 2001.
Just the hospital that Andrew Lawson suspects has exposed him to asbestos is now ironically, a leading center in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others who were probably also exposed to asbestos during their training in the hospital.
As soon as the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, Treasure says, "they are pushed from the breathing process to the edge where the skin is.
By nature, it is invasive from the beginning.
The usual options for other cancers do not work so well with mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of an operation, for example, is hotly controversial.
Some think she's worth a try.
Treasure rejects that.
"You can't cut the chest skin out," he says.
They don't come around with the knife.
In the meantime, cancer "does not appeal very well to chemotherapy," the "effect shows", but does not heal.
"Sometimes there are long-term survivors," says Treasure.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live long, much longer than expected.
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still fighting.
After contacting Mesothelioma, Abbott came in contact with Andrew Lawson, who had become a one-man support and consulting office for the affected four years after his diagnosis.
"Hello, cancer centre," he thought cheerfully about calling.
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He had received his diagnosis 4 years earlier and was still very active.
Originally, Abbott had been offered six chemotherapy cycles that lasted four months and were expected to extend his life only by one month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson managed, however, to "let things appear in a slightly more positive light."
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, heart-thorax specialist at Guy's.
"We had an advantage that I didn't have to be referred to, I just called and got an appointment," says Graham.
A normal patient would have to receive a transfer and wait for the approval of treatment.
Money is crucial for mesothelioma sufferers in order to be able to perceive the best available therapies.
But if these treatments inevitably fail, many of those affected are of another financial concern - about the future of the families they leave behind.
And so they turn to the courts, hoping for compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous to health," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s was that it was recognized that a very low burden was also a health risk.
And here the negligence of the companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital finally filed their case, but it was not what Morgan called a "full compensation" because Lawson could not prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma was due to an asbestos contact with Guy's.
After the investigation of his death, however, a speaker of Guy's confirmed that "the asbestos fibres were removed in the cellar area concerned in the 1990s."
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to Remove Asbestos
In fact, for mesothelioma-sick people who are seeking compensation, it is a huge problem to attribute to the deadly asbestos contact of a company or a workplace - usually decades after the incidents.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed down.
Insurance documents may be lost.
And those who resist claims know that the time is for them, but certainly not with the applicants.
In response to this, there were clear new legislation this year that makes it easier for Mesothelioma victims to sue compensation, even if their former employers are no longer to be found.
The law has set up a fund of Â£350 million funded by the insurance industry for all who have been diagnosed after July 2012 can prove a contact but no one can sue.
In these cases, the applicants receive 80 percent of what a court could have done to them in a normal compensation process - about 120,000 pounds.
About 300 successful applications for the programme are expected per year.
Andrew Morgan, like so many Mesothelioma victims, thinks that Â£350 million was a "very good job" of the insurance industry.
"This is a deal of insurers for insurers," he says, and suggests that this sum is a quarter of what insurers should have paid if the time had not gone by and Mesothelioma patients found the companies and could normally sue them.
Mike Penning, then Minister of Labour and Pensions, also admitted that the law was "not perfect".
But both Penning and Morgan admitted that, in the face of seven deaths, quick action was necessary every day.
"People suffer so much and need help today," said Penning during the second hearing of the Mesothelioma law in December of last year.
At that time Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After their first consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation that he expected to have a positive effect in contrast to Tom Treasure.
This was accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy that allows Lang-Lazdunski to present a survival rate of up to 40 percent for five years.
Abbott felt strengthened.
"This is of course the most important thing," says Abbott.
You can see that in patients again and again.
There's something that makes you keep going.
If you give up, you'll get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012.
At the end of August he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles behind him.
Post-care scans showed no signs of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer spots around my chest.
I just got 50.
That's not life threatening.
That's life-ending.
==References====External links==
Now there is no trace of the tumors visible anymore.
But the process is physically and psychologically very strenuous.
You have to think about practical things - about the money when I'm no longer, for example, or my wife show how the boiler time setting works.
If you get bad news, you will be negative.
You have to look forward.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, this is not always easy.
"It's hard for parents," he says.
It's hard to know what to say and how much.
When I got my first diagnosis, I told my girl I had a disease I wouldn't grow old with.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very social and rude.
She told her friends and we soon got a lot of calls.
Ellie was more hesitant.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to go through.
But for Mesotheliomerkranke, such conversations are not filled with hope, not a trace of hope for survival.
The disease (and finally Stephen Jay Gould) brings a gruesome security.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesothelioma is not life threatening.

China refuses Hong Kong right to government election, protesters swear retribution
On Sunday, despite the increased call for democratic reforms, the Chinese Parliament decided against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 elections by the Hong Kong voters.
This approach probably fuels the long-announced protests in Hong Kong's business district, while activists launched planning and mobilization within a few hours of the announcement.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress in principle allows Communist leaders to reject all non-peking candidates.
"This is not unexpected, but it makes us angry," said legal expert Emily Lau, chairman of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing had promised.
The people of Hong Kong have been lied to.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In his defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, Vice General Secretary of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that the admission of public nominations in the elections for the Hong Kong government would be too "chaotic".
Since 1997, when Great Britain returned control of Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing has promised to have its inhabitants elected to the government presidency from 2017.
The Chinese leadership presented Sunday's decision as a democratic breakthrough, because there is a direct right to vote for Hong Kong citizens, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leadership is firmly in the hands of a closely controlled nomination committee.
After a new clause, only candidates are to be admitted "with love for the country and love for Hong Kong".
The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most public protests took place in Hong Kong for several years.
Behind the pro-democratic campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to cut off the financial district if Beijing does not allow a real universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, hundreds of Occupy-Central followers had gathered in the rain in front of the government headquarters in Hong Kong within a few hours after the announcement.
During the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement had reached a new level of civil disobedience and planned protest waves in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any further information, apparently in order to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online announcement, the organizers announced that the movement "considered the occupation of the central district only as the last means, an action to take place only if all opportunities for dialogue are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are sorry to have to say that today all the opportunities for dialogue have been exploited and that the occupation of the Central District will definitely take place.
The Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for the Beijing announcement for days, and security measures, including police forces and barricades, were tightened on Sunday in front of the government building.
The unrest is reinforced by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city.
The introduction of people from the mainland strengthens competition for products and services.
Moreover, the fear is growing that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are beginning to crumble under the growing pressure of Beijing.
Some criticized the demonstrations of the Occupy-Central movement as it endangered the business - the lifeline of Hong Kong.
"The protests they speak of could cause great economic damage, depending on how many are involved and how long they last," said legal expert Regine Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to cause any fear that Hong Kong will be out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
The state-controlled media of China also recently reported on the democracy activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by Western powers.
This summer, activists organised an unofficial referendum on the electoral rights in which 780.000 people participated - more than a fifth of the voters in Hong Kong.
In July, tens of thousands participated in one of the largest demonstrations of democracy in the history of the region.
The tradition of school graduation balls in the USA is now transferred to the universities where freshmen will be offered performances with the private aircraft.
We are pleased to be able to respond to this demand and to offer the first luxurious travel service of Great Britain for students today.
The company also offers transport options such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten and McLaren P1 in order to achieve a particularly impressive appearance at the university.
Mr Stewart also stated that the service had a security section.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to transport their belongings in a dangerously overloaded car across the country.
Together with our new VIF options, we are looking forward to this year ensuring that students reach the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury.
One company spokesperson said that there were no new bookings yet, as the service had just been introduced, however added that "students would book the service in the next few weeks".
The company also announced that, despite the cost of study of Â£9,000 a year, it was expecting a market for this offer.
Students today are very different in their expectations and demands from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can do just that.
However, the National Student Union criticised the service as removed.
Megan Dunn, vice-president of the NUS for Higher Education, said: "This offer seems completely separate from the life of the majority of students.
Many students who start studying this month are facing a crisis of cost of living, as the available grants in the form of loans and scholarships do not keep pace with the sharp increase in bills for the simplest basis of life before they can even think of spending thousands of pounds on something simple as arriving at the student home.
Feminists criticise racial issues and police behavior in Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo. at the beginning of this month.
The participants raised their hands in the air and sang, "Hands up, don't shoot," while waiting for the funeral.
After two weeks of protest in Ferguson, Mo, because of the shooting of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
According to her experience, white feminist commentators put the sex ahead of the race when it comes to addressing reproductive rights and income inequalities.
However, while tensions in the Middle West rose and received attention throughout the country, Perez saw that the responses of white women revolved 100% around the race.
Compared to the answers of black women shortly after the shootings of 9 August, the personal essays with titles such as "Thinks to Ferguson of a White Woman" and "Feminism is not only about the oppression of women" came relatively late.
But for Perez, that meant an important change.
"I don't think you'll find many people in feminism talking about white and privileges in such a high-class way," she said.
People felt pressured to express something about the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis in which we are and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnic that they have to express it.
For English professor Koritha Mitchell of Ohio State University, Ferguson revealed problems that black Americans are exposed to every day, but that they are not considered "women's themes" in cultural space.
"I can publish something funny on Facebook about myself and my partner and get 150 likes from anywhere," said Mitchell.
If I post something about how colored people in their own country are besieged, silence is deafening.
"How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship, but not about security in public space?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have studied race, sex and sexuality in the history of the USA, there is no dichotomy between racial and gender problems.
For them, black women have not had the luxury to cleanly separate the topics; they live every day in the combined reality.
While white women now combine racial and gender issues in the feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattery, professor of women and gender research at George Mason University, says that her predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the reason was almost always the rape of a white woman," said Hattery.
White women had to be involved in the story in order to justify the lynch murder.
For Hattery, the division between white and black women came to the point where white women fighting for women's rights such as Susan B. Anthony analyzed the country in the late 19th century and found that the struggle for election rights could only be successful for each group: women or blacks.
"They made the decision to stand up for women's rights, and the right to vote for blacks should come later," said Hattery.
When one remembers such things, one becomes aware with power of why colored women do not trust white women.
We didn't do our job well.
We have never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women were given the right to vote in 1920, it took another decade for white women to organize themselves against the lynch in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group arose almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women, says Mitchell.
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist reactions to the questions raised by Ferguson - police behavior, racial discrimination - is a mirror of the time when white feminists played "fangs" with the problems that black women have faced for generations.
" Wouldn't it be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms took the right to raise a child as seriously as they do with the right to control conception?" Mitchell asked.
Women of the second generation who built their careers on the fight for reproductive rights and access to anti-receptive means are now trying to understand what that means.
The well-known white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went on Facebook two weeks after Michael Brown's shooting and published a pointed article by Rebecca Carroll, columnist of the Guardian, in which she demands more protests from white Americans on the subject of racism.
"I hope that women who have another but parallel reason to understand a danger inherent in the body - and opinions on the race that are clearly different in public surveys - will lead the changes," wrote Steinem.
Although Steinem stands for a rather intersectional feminism, in which racial and gender issues are addressed, some of their comments on racial issues in America are astounded.
Christina Sommers, researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole Feminism?", told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, are "far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's remarks on Ferguson are contrary to her earlier criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently imposed a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and hypanic men, there were annoying reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The relationship between police and the black community is not the only problem that pushes into the foreground of mainstream feminism.
After the US border police have taken up nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors at the south-west border of the country this year, the issue of immigration reform is again on the surface - this time as a women's theme.
Andrea Mercado, co-chairman of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that for a re-examined theme as an essential theme of women, they only have to publish the stories of immigrants.
"These speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the large majority of work visas go to male immigrants, the women they accompany are in a position where they are susceptible to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories find a reverberation in the women's organizations," she said.
"Poor house" in Ipswich is for sale
The picture of a house for sale was removed by real estate agents when it became clear that it showed a large pig that made it comfortable in the living room.
The detached house has one bedroom, is located on a private street in Ipswich and is offered for 120,000 Â£.
Among the details was a picture of the living room of the house - including a pig who had put his head on a sofa.
Real estate agent Connells said the pig in the photo was the owner's pet.
"However, the photo has been mispublished and has now been removed," said one of the company's spokespersons.
Connells described the former Assembly House as a "unique family house with one bedroom."
Although the broker has removed the image from the website, it still appears on advertising material.
The sale of the house in the social media was of interest when some asked if the pig was included in the purchase price.
The SW city of Harvey is home to a new millionaire after Lottowinn
A lottery player from Harvey this month
The search for a new millionaire in the southwest of Perth lasts, with a happy winner who receives almost $1.1 million from the lottery draw on Saturday.
A newspaper skiosk in Harvey pulled the jackpot for the second time in five years in the draw of the first division, after $1 million in November 2009.
However, the lucky winner still has to report.
The shop owner Steve Forward said that the profit provides for conversation in the small town in the southwest of Perth.
The city's not talking about anything else, and everyone's pretty excited.
We thought that such a profit could occur.
Eight WA winners have celebrated winnings in the first division last month, a due end for a few happy weeks for the players in the state.
Last week, a player from Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires in August, after a couple from Belmont had achieved the mega win of $7.5 million just a few weeks earlier.
The winner couple had played for twenty years and said that the win allows them the possibility of a world trip and the purchase of a new house.
The millionaire from Harvey is the 59th winner of the first division in the WA this year, with a total of almost 85 million dollars.
Leonidas asked in the gladiatorial arena
Not only the gladiators stood knee deep in the Matsch at the first Rheinbacher RÃ¶mertag in the amusement park.
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract far more than 1000 visitors yesterday, who defyed the rain showers and the autumn cold and let themselves be inspired by the historical spectacle.
There was a colorful dance of representations, performances, games, exhibition pieces and information about the Roman period and its significance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial combat force of the Gladiator School "Amor Mortis", which used every rainy break to demonstrate its robust martial art in the soft sanded arena.
Gladiator owner "Leonidas" proved to be a humorous and expert presenter and sent his men in succession to the ring for heroic strife in various gladiatorial holes.
At first, the "provocators" were on the row with rectangular shield and shortsword as well as leg rail on the left leg and arm rail on the right arm.
It followed the "Essedarii" with chest shield, short sword and pitcher as well as iron gladiator helmet, leg and arm protection.
The appearance of the "Retiarius" was particularly impressive, which with thrownet, three-zack and dagger came against the "Sector" and after a short fight hit the boys to the ground.
The swords were working metallically together, the shields were creating and the pitchers were flying through the arena, that fear and anxiety could become around the health of gladiators.
But the impressive Summa Rudis, the muscular arbitrator, had an always attentive eye on them.
"We wanted to revive Roman everyday life and make the culture of the Roman era experience," explained Lorenz Euskirchen, chairman of the organizer "Friendeskreis RÃ¶merkanal", the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, an "Oppidum Romanum", a Roman city, was made out of the theme park for a day, as Vice Mayor Claus Wehage noted in his greeting.
Finally, the Romans not only brought war and conquest in our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings we admire today.
Residues of these were also to be admired during the Roman day, such as "Aqueduct marble" from the 11 meter high and 1400 meter long Roman Channel Bridge, which was once at LÃ¼ftelberg.
The Frontinus Society once and now faced the supply of water and energy, and Managing Director Petra Fricke knew: "We still benefit from the knowledge of the time."
This also confirms the diploma survey engineer Ralph Heiliger of the "IngenieurteamTwo" from Rheinbach, who introduced survey instruments of the Romans such as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented sketches and models from the excavations of anno 1894 as well as bricks from the original hypocaust, the warm air heating that once warmed the Roman villa.
Impressive, too, are the footprints left out of clay by Wolf and Fox two millennia ago in the footsteps before they were burned.
In 2011 the Landesverband Rheinland had excavated the remains of a Roman villa in the North Commercial Park in Rheinbach.
The walls of an economic building with a darre for drying grain and for grinding had been found.
The building had probably belonged to a Villa Rustica, an agricultural estate, explained archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser.
A number of finds from these excavations presented them in a glass vitrine, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels and parts of a delicate necklace.
The villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century AD, until the invasion of the Germans in the Roman Rhineland, Morscheiser suspects.
The children were also concerned with the Roman windmill game, similar to today's mill game, or they wrote their names with metal handles on waxboards, as the Roman students once did.
At the stand of the RÃ¶merthermen ZÃ¼lpich, the children were allowed to lay mosaics themselves, bask glass mosaics at the stand of the glass museum Rheinbach and serve a heavy wheat mill made of stone at the stand of the Eifel Nettersheim Nature Centre, to grind the flour for a fladen bread or a muesli.
With the original Roman caravans, drawn by two cold blossomers, the visitors drove through the theme park and passed the impressive stand of the Gymnasium, which presented the results of their Roman project weeks.
With a Roman week from 13 to 21 September, the municipality of Wachtberg will also bring itself into the Roman Year 2014 in Rhineland, which is to commemorate the death of Emperor Augustus 2000 years ago.
Together with the home and history clubs as well as the Wachtberger Wander-Verein, the partnership association and the lay play group Oberbachem, thematic hikes, a lecture, cooking evenings as well as guided tours for school classes are offered and the Roman past of Wachtberg is remembered.
For example, a Roman legionary will tell about his work on the corresponding Wachtberg, present plants as living monuments from the Roman era, and present a funny lesson in international understanding between a group of Wachtberger "Germans" and drawn Romans.
The Adendorf primary school is dedicated to the Roman theme as part of a project week.
With the Roman Week the numerous but often not visible traces of the Romans in Wachtberg are to be made available again.
A small presentation of the find of the Berkumer Matron Sanctuary in 1879 will be remembered in the town hall in Wachtberger.
Ebola: The epidemic is taxing West Africaâ€™s economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a severe blow to the economy.
Markets are orphaned - and international companies go a long way.
The devastating Ebola epidemic is causing a severe blow to the West African economy.
The harvest rots on the fields, the mines are abandoned and the markets are lost - the virus has hardly added to the region.
A number of international companies are already going a long way.
"The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis, but also an economic one," says Donald Kaberuka, head of the African Development Bank.
Liberia is the hardest affected
"It's a total disaster, we're losing a lot of money," says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells clothes on the second largest market in Liberia's capital.
Only those who want to buy food or something for disinfection against Ebola will be on the market.
Liberia has been hit the hardest by the virus, and more than 600 people have been killed here alone.
Recently, the health authorities declared that the disease had spread at every corner of the country.
The virus has also spread in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
A total of more than 1,500 people have already died, thousands more have been affected.
Foreign companies deduct employees
Companies are suspending their operations everywhere in the resource-rich countries.
Foreign companies such as the steel group Arcelor Mittal withdraw their employees, several international airlines no longer fly to the affected regions.
The local merchants and farmers also react: few merchants leave their homes to get supply.
In some areas of Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are quarantined, the cocoa and coffee beans on the fields, among other things, rotted.
Farmers don't dare leave their homes for the harvest.
Food is becoming scarce
"People will travel less and less," says Phillipe De Vreyer, Parisian expert on the economy of West Africa.
For example, the man who normally goes to the market and sells his vegetables would rather stay at home.
Therefore, the population gets the consequences of the epidemic to feel direct and pressing: food becomes scarce.
In the markets, the stock of basic foods such as rice disappears.
At the same time, the region heavily dependent on international companies is in danger of image damage - with far-reaching consequences.
The biggest danger is that international companies will in principle avoid the area for a long time, says Philippe Hugon of the French think tank Iris.
It is crucial how far and how long the virus will spread.
Investors may feel "that it is dangerous to live and invest in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia," warns Hugon.
The disease also affects the damaged state budgets of the States
The disease also affects the already severely damaged state budgets of the countries concerned.
Moody's credit rating agency fears that their budgets will be heavily strained by the high spending on the health system and additionally by the worsening economy.
The African Development Bank has already promised to help the health systems of the countries concerned with $60 million (â‚¬45 million).
The effects are also noticeable in Nigeria, where only a few Ebola cases have been diagnosed so far.
Although the oil-rich region of southern Niger delta has not been affected.
But elsewhere many people already stay at home for fear of infection.
Reservations in hotels also go down significantly.
Protectors celebrate their 50th anniversary
The SchÃ¼tzenverein "Tannenwald" Berngau celebrates its 50th anniversary from 12th to 14th September.
On high-tours the preparations for the 50-year-old founding festival from 12th to 14th September are underway at the SchÃ¼tzenverein Tannenwald.
It is planned on Friday, 12 September, a big entertainment evening with the group "Dorfrocker".
On Saturday the big BÃ¶ller shooting is at 6:00 p.m.
Then in the big festival tent is the mood evening with the "StoapfÃ¤lzer Spitzbuam".
Blaskapelle provides the music
Highlights on Sunday are the festive service and 9.30 o'clock in the parish church and the large ceremony at 2 p.m.
In the afternoon, the price distribution of the Federal and Gau shooting is also available.
A particularly beautiful sight will be the 25 dams with their dirndln.
Festkapelle is the Blaskapelle Berngau.
The patronship was taken over by Mayor Wolfgang Wild and State Secretary Albert FÃ¼racker.
The original name "Schutztengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" dates back to 1907, when the association was founded on 21 March for "social entertainment through practice in the room stand and small caliber shooting".
The NS regime had caused the club to disband in 1937.
It was only in 1964 that 19 young men found themselves again, who raised the "new" SchÃ¼tzenverein "Tannenwald" Berngau from baptism at the inn Lukas on 30 April.
Karl Marz and Adolf Ried led the club as a shooter through a difficult start time when it was mainly about finding a club location and installing the shooting operation.
In the autumn of 1965, the SchÃ¼tzenverein started in the inn "Leininger" with two teams in the round competitions.
In the following years, the sportsmen, who were now organized into seven teams, established themselves in all classes up to the 1st Gauliga.
The records of the club were used every year and the magic limit of 380 rings was reached for the first time in 1980 by Rudi Meier.
As the performance of the active shooters has increased, members have also developed positively.
After the club's "Leininger" location had ceased to meet the demands of a modern SchÃ¼tzenverein, Johann Rinn's then board of directors decided to create a future home in the basements of the new "Landgasthof HÃ¤rteis".
After a work performance of 2700 hours, Father Strasser granted the ecclesial blessing for the new protective rooms on 8 May 1988.
One of the great highlights in the history of the club was certainly the 44th shooting, combined with the solemn consecration of the new shooter flag in July 1991.
On 23 and 24 April 1994, the SchÃ¼tzenverein celebrated its 30th anniversary.
In 1995 a BÃ¶ller group was established.
Josef Schmalzl became a BÃ¶llerreferent.
A major challenge for the "BÃ¶llerer" and for the association as a whole was the orientation of the Bavarian BÃ¶ller meeting 2005.
In many hours of voluntary work, the members of the association have modernised the rooms and the shooting facility in the Berngauer Hof last year and thus brought it to the latest level of technology.
Eleven teams in rounds competitions
You can also see the sporty performances of the SchÃ¼tzenverein.
A total of eleven teams currently participate in the rounds: six Air Gun teams, one Air Gun team, one Sport Gun KK1, one Youth and two AH teams.
The first team, with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann, rose in the 2013/14 round from the Gauoberliga (highest league in the SchÃ¼tzengau ANB) to the district league 1.
The 2nd team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml has risen from the Gauliga Nord to the Gauoberliga.
In addition to shooting sports, events such as shackles, carnival and kingball, club trip and Christmas celebration have tradition.
The shooters are also present at the festivals in parish and community.
Tony Stewart suffers accident when returning to the race track
Tony Stewart's return to the race track ended about halfway through his race on the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart drove against the wall for the second time after his right front tire burst 172 and finished his evening.
Stewart drove his damaged car into the garage and left without talking to journalists.
His team leader Chad Johnston said his 14-member team was disappointed, but now concentrate on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish we had a better use and a better result for him," said John.
We'll go to Richmond and hope we can do better there.
Stewart had already been driving into a wall during the race on Sunday evening after a collision with Kyle Busch and had to have the right side of his car repaired.
"I entered a good result today with quite good hopes," said John and added, "It just didn't work out."
Not long after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded into the tractor and the team had packed and was ready for departure.
Stewart dropped three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car met and killed another driver in an ash railway race in the north of New York State.
He decided to return this week and win either in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to win a place in the persecution.
He returned to his workplace during an investigation into the tragic incident that led to the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who had stepped on the road during a race to confront Stewart.
On Friday, the authorities announced that investigations on the cause of the accident would continue for at least two weeks.
No decision has yet been taken as to whether Stewart has to expect an indictment.
The three-time champion was received with great applause when he was presented before the race.
After a start at 12th position, Stewart had already moved into the first 10 and was temporarily in fourth place.
After a restart in round 122, Buschs got
Cars with no. 18 out of control after exit from curve 2 and collided with Stewart, with both cars driving against the wall.
Stewart continued, but fell back to 21th place.
Danced Young People Wanted
Just try: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and head Lisa Nijzel (from the left) are looking forward to co-opulents.
Like many other clubs, jazz groups in TV Jahn also make all-day lessons at the secondary schools.
After the summer holidays, some groups have strongly decimated.
Now more young people are being sought for a sport that is healthy and fun.
In the two jazz and modern dance groups of Lisa Nijzel, once dancer in the jazz and modern dance formation "Spirits", there are only nine children.
"Three in the group of eight- to twelve-year-olds, six in the group of twelve- to 15-year-olds," says the 20-year-olds.
With more active people the whole thing would be much more fun, "you could dance completely different choreographies," she says.
If you want to dance, you can sniff into the training hour between 5am and 6pm on Thursdays or between 5pm and 6.30 pm on Fridays in the dance sports room at the former Hotel Meyer, FreistraÃŸe 9, without obligation.
"Training starts regularly with a warm-up program," says the trainer.
Afterwards, different choreographies are practiced.
JazzDance has the feature that there is no fixed form and is therefore open to many styles.
Elements from folklore to classics up to sports and acrobatics are processed in jazz dance.
Of course, socialization is not too short.
"We're also going to eat, watch dance films and we've been staying in the dance room before," says Lisa Nijzel.
In the group you can make friends, share a beautiful hobby and do a lot for your own motor development.
Whom jazz dance does not lie like this, can also sniff into one of the other offers of TV Jahn.
On Wednesdays children and young people can sniff into the classes in the areas of children's dance/jazz dance, Bambini ballet, video-clip dancing and hip-hop.
The dance trainer is Francisco Afonso.
Adults are welcome to the dance evenings on Monday and Wednesday.
If you want discofox, slow waltz, Wiener Walzer, Rumba, Cha-Cha-Cha and Tango, you can watch and participate.
Bulgarian prison guards protest nationally
Hundreds of prison workers from all over Bulgaria have organized a national protest in front of the Ministry of Justice in the capital city of Sofia.
In the peaceful demonstration, they repeated their demands for the restoration of their old working conditions, which have recently been changed.
Higher salaries are also on a demand list to be discussed with the interim Justice Minister Hristo Ivanov.
Officials have been protesting symbolically for one month against the new working hours and are calling for a return to the former 24-hour shifts.
Despite the meetings between the union of prison staff and representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, the National Bulgarian Ratio (BNR) reported.
Negotiations continue, the Director-General for the Implementation of Penal Measures, Rosen Zhelyazkov informed BNR.
The protest of prison staff is expected to be supported by members of the Trade Union Association of Interior Ministry employees.
Ukrainian Army has given up airport of Luhansk
In the eastern Ukraine, the pro-Russian fighters are on the move.
According to heavy battles, in which Russian tank battalions were also said to be involved, the Ukrainian army today, Monday, abandoned the airport of Luhansk Rebellen.
At the same time, the army announced that seven soldiers had been killed in the past 24 hours.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had previously drawn human consequences from the severe defeats of his army in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the top army leadership without mentioning details.
Pro-Russian separatists shot off plane
In the fight against Ukrainian government troops, pro-Russian separatists shot off a fighter aircraft and two military helicopters, according to their own representation.
Some 100 soldiers had also been injured or killed in fighting in the Donetsk region, according to Russian agencies on Monday.
Coast Guard Ships sunk
The insurgents also claimed to have sunk two boats of the Ukrainian Coast Guard for the first time in the Azov Sea.
The Ukrainian border guard confirmed that two of his ships were under fire on Sunday near the port city of Mariupol.
Seven border guards had been injured, a speaker in Kiev told the station 112.ua.
Two crew members were considered missing.
Local media made Russia responsible for the incident.
The separatists also reported that they had brought several towns under their control in the Donetsk region.
Diplomatic offensive in Minsk
In the Belarusian capital Minsk, the Ukraine Contact Group meets today.
In addition to representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, an envoy of the separatists from eastern Ukraine should also take part.
In advance, all actors used their appearances to publicise their claim.
NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia as a result of the planned stations in Eastern Europe as a result of the Ukraine crisis.
NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels that NATO adhered to the establishment agreement of the NATO-Russia Council of 1997.
However, the NATO chief accused Russia of "a serious breach" of the agreement.
"Today, we need to see reality in the eye that Russia does not regard NATO as a partner," says Rasmussen.
From documents and opinions from the Russian side, it appears "that they consider us to be opponents".
Stronger NATO presence
Rasmussen has also announced its intention to strengthen NATO presence in Eastern Europe.
A "Readiness Action Plan" to be decided at the NATO Summit in Wales will ensure that "we will have more visible NATO presence in the East as long as necessary," said Rasmussen on Monday in Brussels.
Kiev and Moscow agree on new gas talks
Russia and Ukraine have, according to official information, agreed on new talks to resolve their gas dispute.
The negotiations were scheduled for next Saturday, said Russian energy minister Alexander Nowak on Monday.
A decision by the European Union is still to be taken as to whether it will also send a representative to the talks.
Because of the dispute over the gas price, Ukraine has not been getting fuel from Russia for weeks.
Finally, EU Energy Commissioner GÃ¼nther Oettinger had communicated between both sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also interrupt the gas supply for Europe.
Europe draws about one third of its natural gas from Russian sources, a large part of which flows through Ukraine.
Merkel speaks a word of power: Toll will come "very clear"
Now the chancellor confesses clearly.
A free letter for all complicated details, however, it is not.
Constant concerns from the CDU against the car toll the CSU have become more and more hot.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, after continuing resistance from her CDU, has spoken a word of power for the introduction of a car toll.
"To say it quite clearly, she is in the coalition agreement, and she will come," said the party leader on Monday after meetings of the CDU summits in Berlin.
However, Merkel was not determined for the time being on a detailed model.
In the Black and Red Government programme, " certain parameters" are called.
Federal Minister for Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) has made "a proposal and is now being worked on".
However, the NRW-CDU persists on its no toll on all roads.
Merkel stressed that Finance Minister Wolfgang SchÃ¤uble (CDU) also contributed constructively to the deliberations for a draft law.
In addition to the topic, he also talked to Dobrindt about further opportunities to activate more private capital for investment in infrastructure, including broadband expansion.
"There's nothing special about it." On Sunday, SchÃ¤uble had left a "spiegel" report uncommented, his house checked out his own concept to pay for highway investors with toll revenue - after the election of 2017.
CSU chief Horst Seehofer warned against developing toll concepts against the leading minister in the cabinet.
CDU-Bundesvize Armin Laschet confirmed his objections.
"The coalition agreement never assumed to be tolerating all district and federal roads," said the North Rhine-Westphalian CDU country president.
In so far as it is an important signal that Seehofer has now announced to discuss the subject again.
Resistance to the plans also comes from the CDU national associations Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate.
Background is fears that tolls affect small border traffic to neighbouring countries.
Seehofer had demanded coalition loyalty because of the toll criticism of the CDU.
The left views the plans in the face of the dispute in the Union as failed.
"The Murks toll is dead," said party leader Bernd Riexinger of the "New OsnabrÃ¼cker Zeitung" (Monday).
"With the toll the minister fails." Dobrindt wants to introduce a vignette obligation on all German roads, which is to start in 2016.
However, domestic car owners may not be subject to additional tax under the coalition agreement.
Therefore, they are to receive a full compensation for the toll through the car tax.
However, the model must not discriminate against foreign drivers in accordance with EU law because of their nationality.
Genetic disorder often misdiagnosed
A British woman says she thought she would die as a result of a misdiagnosis over many years.
Karin Rodgers lived almost all her youth in the belief that she had only a few years to live after being diagnosed with another disease.
It actually suffered from the Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK reported that misdiagnoses are a common problem in people with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
About 23,000 people in Britain are likely to suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle muscle muscle, an insecure passage and curved toes.
Diseases also suffer from numbness or pain. The disease is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms get worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed that she was suffering from Friedreich-Ataxia (FA) - a disease with very bad survival chances.
Rodgers thought she was sitting in the wheelchair before she was 18, and dying before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children, who is 51 years old today, said, "As a child, I knew I couldn't do the same thing as the others.
I fell all the time and everything took longer with me.
I could never ride with the other kids rollershoe or skateboard and was often grounded in school because of my way of going and running.
Rodgers said that at the age of 13 years after several operations to relieve her Achillessehnen and stretching her feet, she saw her medical records when her doctor had left the room and read that she was suffering from FA.
"I felt guilty because I had been curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home looking for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA society," she said.
When I received an answer, I was shocked and panicked.
I thought I was going to be in the wheelchair at age 18 and die at age 25, and in between, I would slowly lose all my abilities.
I made all this out with myself and planned my own funeral.
She said when she turned 17, she realized that her skills had not decreased as much as she had imagined and asked her doctor.
He just got up and hugged me and said, "My love, I don't think you have that, otherwise you'd be in the wheelchair already."
I think you have a little less life-threatening.
After some genetic tests, CMT was detected.
"When he told me what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT awareness month to draw attention to this disease.
Stabsfeldwebel a. D. Berni Diether has been working as a fireworksman since the closure of the former military practice site
For just under ten years, the former military practice centre in MÃ¼nsingen has not been shot.
Nevertheless, every month, death - killing ammunition appears in the heart of the Swabian Alb biosphere area.
The grenades are sometimes still so dangerous that they have to be sprayed on site.
An ear-absorbing bang sounds at the explosions about the heart of the biosphere area.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot fell on the MÃ¼nsingen station, which was closed at the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operation.
Since then, the 6500-hectare area has been the core of the Swabian Alb biosphere area, which is open on 13 designated paths for hikers and cyclists.
Tax burden on businessmen in Washington increases with economic recovery
A recovery of the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax rulings for companies in the country increased slightly last year, while economic recovery accelerated, according to a newly published study last week, and companies in the Washington area were no exception.
Companies in District, Maryland and Virginia jointly paid $27.6 billion to government and local authorities in the financial year 2013, an increase of 3.8 percent compared to 2012 revenues of $26.6 billion.
The government and local tax burden of companies rose by 4.3 percent last year to $671 billion, compared to 3.9% a year before, and it was the third growth year in a row after the several years of falling notices in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes increased more than local taxes, by 4.3 percent, according to the study carried out by the Ernst & Young Service Agency with the Center for State Taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of the tax revenue of the district, 56 percent, comes from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland's income comes from companies.
Virginia achieves the lowest tax revenue from companies at 28 percent.
Much of the increase in tax revenue is due to a recovery in the real estate values of companies, say the researchers, which led to an increase in real estate taxes by 3.7 percent this year after the three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 percent.
While a large part of these profits came from major states such as California, New York and Texas, the process also seems to be true for Washington.
Companies in the district, Maryland and Virginia paid together more than $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 - an increase of 4.2 percent over the course of a year.
However, the apparent recovery in real estate values in Maryland is not so effective in increasing state and local tax revenue, as the real estate tax amounts to just over one-fifth of the tax rulings of companies.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half their state and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.
"The following is happening in Maryland: a large part of the property, especially in the tax area around D.C., is owned either by the government or by non-profit organizations that do not pay property taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, Managing Director of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced, for example, to rely much more on income taxes in order to be able to provide the same services that other states offer.
The recent recovery in corporate tax revenue cannot only be attributed to the recovery of the real estate market
Business revenues also seem to recover, according to the data.
Companies in the region reported income taxes on government organizations of $2.3 billion compared to 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland took $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount of the region.
While the trend is in the same direction, the local tax burden on companies does not increase evenly in all three places.
The rate of increase in the district was 4.3 percent of the national average, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9%.
Only Virginia reported an underaverage tax revenue of 4.1 percent.
With 6 percent in all three areas of office, Virginia has the least corporate income tax (in all three there are fixed corporate tax rates).
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 percent and in the district is relatively high 9.975 percent.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce at the beginning of this year showed that in Virginia fewer state and local corporate taxes are required and a better tax climate is in place than in Maryland.
In the study, the district was not investigated.
Despite the advantages, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbours.
North Carolina has passed laws to reduce its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9% to 6 percent, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 percent in the coming year.
If the state continues to achieve its income targets in the coming year, this law could reduce the state's corporate income tax rate to 3 percent by 2017.
In the meantime, it seems to be better for small businesses in the Washington area, so they pay more state and local taxes, according to the recent study.
Corporate taxes paid as personal income taxes by small businessmen - a transitional structure according to which most small businesses are organized - in the district, Maryland and Virginia last year increased by 20 percent to $2.4 billion, a significant faster growth rate than the corporate taxes as a whole.
The researchers say that the trend and increase in corporate taxes throughout the country are likely to continue this year, with an increase in general extra defence tax revenue for the state and local governments by 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period of the previous year.
Nevertheless, the Washington area could be lagging behind if the Federal Governmentâ€™s reduction in expenditure had an impact on the labour market in the region.
Partner city: German beer for Guangzhou
Hops and malt - also in China a popular combination.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt's partner city in China now wishes for a brewery and hopes for a direct flight between the two cities.
German beer, brewed in Frankfurt's partner town Guangzhou - that's the urgent wish of the official in China.
"We would be very pleased if a German brewery settled in our city," said the vice-party secretary of the South Chinese metropolis, Li Yiwei, this week when visiting an SPD delegation in his city.
In the course of the conversation, the Chinese ruling Communist Partyâ€™s official repeatedly came back to this concern of the twelve-million metropolis.
Guangzhou, also known in Germany as Canton, was one of the richest cities in China, Li advertised.
Therefore, people also had the purchasing power to afford themselves German beer.
Hessian SPD chairman Thorsten SchÃ¤fer-GÃ¼mbel, who led the German political delegation, said to the host that he would look for a possible partner for the project in Germany.
"It doesn't take much for beer: good water, grain and joy of life," he added at lunch with the party superior in Guangzhou.
This joy of life already exuded Mr. Li, he flattered the host.
The Guangzhou official then started with a shepherd-gÃ¼bel - but with red wine, which was served for dinner.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao dates back to German brewing.
Tsingtao beer is brewed after the German purity bid.
More business
A second wish of the Chinese hosts would be a direct flight between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Vice-Parteichef Li.
Lufthansa had offered the flight earlier, but had been withdrawn in 2012 for economic reasons.
"It would be worth it again," the local politician was convinced.
"Business between our two cities continues to grow."
At present, travellers would have to take the detour via Changsha in Hunan Province, complained Li.
Also the administration of the province of Guangdong, whose capital is Guangzhou, is hoping for the flight.
Chen Yunxian, deputy governor of the province, put this wish in the foreground in his conversation with the Social Democrats.
"This is a very good idea," said SchÃ¤fer-GÃ¼mbel - the Chinese Deputy Minister Li Jinjun, an intimate expert in Germany, nodding.
Established partnership
The lousy Vice-Chairman of Guangzhou hopes that he will be able to attend Frankfurt for a partnership meeting next year.
Li Yiwei was already at the Main, but not yet in this function.
He did not come into office until this year after his predecessor had been expelled from office for allegations of corruption.
The party leader Wan Qinglian also had to go.
The attack against Guangzhou officials is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in the party and administration, which is enforced by head of state Xi Jinping with hardness.
The new top politician Li Yiwei had worked for an American company before his party career, which is extremely unusual in the Chinese Communist Party.
Before taking office in Guangzhou, he worked as a top-ranking officer in Fujian, where the automaker VW built a large plant.
Frankfurt has officially entered more than a dozen urban partnerships.
The connection to Guangzhou, 9,000 kilometers away, is one of those who are maintained by both sides, for example, with a student exchange.
Last year, the 25th anniversary of the German-Chinese connection was celebrated.
With its economic strength, the South Chinese metropolis on the Perl River is almost as strong as all Hessen.
Next year they want to reach a gross domestic product of 250 billion euros, reported Li.
Family of Joan Rivers "press the thumbs"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since she was sent to a hospital in New York City three days ago, but her daughter has been hoping that the 81-year-old comedy will recover from her illness.
"Thank you for your ongoing love and support," said Melissa Rivers today in a message.
We all press the thumbs.
Her mother, according to sources, was sent to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency due to cardiac arrest in a clinic on the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy.
The doctors willfully sedate them and observe them under more precise supervision until they are more satisfied with their condition, which is still described as "serious".
The reactions came from many sides, also in the form of overwhelming online support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmentally friendly vacuum cleaners and rising wages
Cars and vacuum cleaners that are now on the market will be subject to stricter environmental standards in the future.
Similar to refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners receive a label from 1 September, where the buyer can detect central data such as the energy efficiency of the device at a glance.
New cars are subject to sharper nitrogen oxide values in the "Euro 6" pollutant class.
There is also more money for scaffolders: they receive a nationally uniform minimum wage of 10.25 euros.
Amazon buys Tswitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what information had reported on Monday morning: the online retailer - and video producer, and a variety of other things - buys the video streaming service Tswitch for $1.04 billion (US$970 million).
The announcement comes surprisingly, not because no one had expected a takeover of Twitch, but because it was widely suspected that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago it looked like the sale of Twitch to Google's video service was for a cool billion decided thing, and the collaboration also appeared naturally.
Tswitch, which was only founded three years ago as Justin.tv, was launched as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to publish their bravour pieces in games, a "YouTube for Live Games", such an insider.
The Tswitch interface.
And "let's play", a video genre in which better-knowers give the (mostly older) games a paint of secret science theatre, are already very popular on YouTube.
It's just that YouTube is often called if you want to describe Tswitch, so the news that YouTube Tswitch wanted to buy was taken up a bit boring, a textbook example of a well-established technology company that buys up a potential competitor.
It is a mystery why the deal with YouTube did not come about, as the company reportedly was willing to pay as much as Amazon.
All we know about this right now is this statement by Emmet Shear, President of Tswitch: "We have chosen Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions and they want to help us get there faster."
Another secret is, honestly, the incredible success of Tswitch.
For Snobs like me, who explain that they prefer to play sports rather than watch, it is difficult to understand the attraction that is supposed to be watching others while playing, rather than taking control console into their own hands.
It's one thing to look over a friend's shoulder at 3:00 in the morning, while she's sneaking through Resident Evil, and something quite different to watch a spider shoot at him 20 times in a row in Call of Duty's head.
All these games you could watch right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games, so watching without control of the perspective can be a really good recipe for headaches.
I admit that the fast-tracks in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age perform entire games in record time are entertaining.
But as long as there is no play or humor virtuoso, his tswitch channel is probably not that interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know about it?
Tswitch is called by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic peaks.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money from it?
It's hard to imagine that Twitch is as elegantly integrated into Amazon Instant Video as YouTube Twitch could have just swallowed.
But Twitch has something that every company would like: thousands of young men who are advertised as advertising customers.
As the chairman of Twitch, Shear, said, Amazon and Twitch both "believe in the future of gaming," and the medium shows no signs of shrinkage, not even - swallow - as a spectator sport.
There was a lot going on Sunday evening at the HÃ¼pfburg at the Burggartenfest.
The concept of the organizers was correct.
Despite the strong rainfall on Saturday evening, an estimated 1200 music fans came to the open-air festival in the Burggarten.
At times the intake had to be stopped.
"That was annoying," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salzwedel l Light and fun.
From two Spanish words, Maxim Sagraj and Ron Sem formed the name Amula.
Because the open air in the Salzwedeler Burggarten is intended to radiate brightness in the day and evening through various shows.
Well, the fun comes by itself anyway.
This was already evident in the early evening when the first visitors to the Open Air arrived.
The organizers had promised a festival for all generations.
And they succeeded.
Around the supply stands on the Burggartenwiese, Salzwedeler, but also guests from the nearby and other surroundings were comfortable.
They followed the first live appearances, wimped with their feet, enjoyed cool drinks - in short: pure relaxation and pleasure were auspicious.
And that across the generations.
While one of the ceilings on the extra-carved white sands smelt at the beach bar, others labored in a quarter of wine in the Vinothek, the young people on the HÃ¼pfburg, which was a great attraction for the smaller guests.
But even when making children, the volunteers had their hands full in the truest sense of the word to become lords and to conjure up imaginative creations in the small faces.
The larger ones used the kicker tables or participated in a skateboard workshop, which the Goodfoot crew made of salt weeds.
Until the big rain came.
Shortly before 5.30 p.m. he pounced on the visitors, especially families sought the wideness and dryness.
But the attractiveness of the feast did not break down.
"More people came than expected," said Ron Sem, who spoke of a "success on the whole line".
That is why there is nothing against a repetition of the big party in the coming year.
Although work needs to be done on the content and size of the event, Sem made clear in a first report on Sunday against the popular voice.
He was annoyed that in the meantime the entrance had to be stopped.
Obviously, the security company had been booked with too little power.
The result: Some who had already paid did not come to the site anymore.
The resonance had been very good.
In a first careful estimate, the Salzwedeler co-organizer spoke of about 1200 visitors who were tumbling in the castle garden.
There were problems with sound technology.
The hip-hop band Block`n`Rox broke off their appearance.
The technicians were unable to create a semi-reasonable sound.
The planned Shisha lounges could not be built because the tents could not be brought to Salzwedel because of a tire pan.
"But next year they will be there," says the organizer.
The premiere of the Amula-Open-Air was more than successful of the number of visitors.
And this in bad weather.
However, the organizers have made some mistakes, which will be forgiven the first time, but will have to be eliminated at the second edition.
Even in the social network Facebook, the organizers have to be critical.
"Sorry, but for twelve euros you just expected more," says Melanie Meier on the event page.
"Unfortunately, you've taken over a bit," says Ele Zimmermann in the same place.
Others do not see the initial problems as closely as possible.
I think it is very good that some not only talk stupidly, but also really try to put something on their feet.
Hat off!", Stephanie Jens writes about the amula.
Now the organizers remain a year to make these criticisms.
New Radom in Berkum: Wachtberg's landmark shrinks
That is not the case, according to expectations.
Rather, the ready component is waiting to be used in the distinctive structure.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: almost 50 years after the establishment of the TIRA space observation radar, the shell, the so-called radom, is completely renewed.
The new radom will be a little smaller with a diameter of 47.5 meters than the old one.
But the size still remains world record.
The last step to complete the new case is to replace the cap
The upper quarter of the old case is separated and removed with a crane.
Then the last quarter of the new shell is placed on.
As far as the weather is concerned, the action will go over the stage at the beginning of this week.
Participant in the Ice Bucket Challenge Disintegrates Kiefer
Isabelle Roberts from Britain screamed so much when her ice-cold water was poured over her head that she hurt the bone structure of her face.
This Ice Bucket challenge was painful next door.
A woman was sent to the hospital after she shouted so much at the Ice Bucket Challenge that she ran out of the jaw.
Isabelle Roberts from Great Britain circled so much when her ice-cold water was poured over her head that she violated her facial structure.
"The water was so cold that I screamed, and while I did, my jaw just stopped," she said to The Mirror.
Icewater is poured over the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts just seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but I couldn't, the jaw was hacked, and then I understood something was wrong.
My mother and my sister saw this too and almost laughed in their pants, but I had to go to the emergency room.
The 20-year-old from Great Britain was sent to the hospital to get the jaw reassessed after taking part in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip has been linked to an internet sensation and a thousand times to Facebook and Twitter.
Do the castle clubs soon pull back at a strand?
In the last few years, there was a twin between the two Wolfratshaus Burgvereinen.
Now, the board is thinking about possible cooperation.
As an example of the reconstruction of the Wolfratshaus castle, the late Richard Dimbath, former chairman of the Wolfratshauser Burgfreunde, led the project in the French GuÃ©delon.
A year ago, there was no good climate between the Burgverein and the Burgfreunden Wolfratshausen.
The views on how to deal with the history of Wolfratshaus Castle and a possible reconstruction seemed to be different.
Now the two camps are moving towards each other: discussions are to be held soon on a common approach.
This is confirmed by the club leaders Torsten SjÃ¶berg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfreunde) on request of our newspaper.
"I called Mr Piffl and suggested that we could sit down once," SjÃ¶berg reports.
In his view, all members of the two associations could in the future once again pull on board.
Thus, there are faster visible successes.
While the castle friends around the suddenly deceased Richard Dimbath had in mind a reconstruction of the castle on the mountain forest until the last time, for the Burgverein around SjÃ¶berg, the "exploitation and experience" of the site is in the forefront.
Herbert Piffl, Second President of the Burgfreunde, was very pleased, according to his own information about the call.
Since Dimbath's death, he has been in charge of the castle friends.
A new chairman is to be found in a general meeting in mid-September.
According to the 74-year-old, the club currently has around 40 members.
"After my friend Richard Dimbath's death, we left the club's activities out of respect."This "think phase" was necessary to "think how it could go on."
According to Piffl, the new chairman is supposed to go into the conversation with the Burgverein.
Until then, the friends of the castle could also create a current mood within their group.
There is currently no candidate for the Presidency, says Piffl.
"But I am confident that someone will find himself." He himself does not want to run because he has his residence in Bad TÃ¶lz.
The new chairman should be a Wolfratshauser.
The TÃ¶lzer would like to continue to work on the project "but very much".
The different views on reconstruction will probably remain in the eyes of Piffls in the near future.
He honors Dimbath as a "missionary", who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar, far advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an airlock.
Through a high participation of the population and by volunteers from all over the world, they are a tourist magnet.
Piffl: "I was also skeptical at the beginning.
But over time I became more and more convinced that it makes sense to advance the project, and that it could be created as a "one-off feature" for the FlÃ¶ÃŸerstadt.
There's nothing else here.
In addition, the project could be financed by EU grants, visitor tickets and potential sponsors, Piffl believes.
"That's why I don't want to personally throw the idea of reconstruction overboard." He hopes that the Burgverein may be moving on this point.
Their goal of first documenting history is "important and good".
After that one could see on.
Smart ways to save on university textbooks
Since the cost of university textbooks for many students is more than $1,000 a year, the fast-second semester student Matt Schroeder considered a clever sparidee.
He invented a loan system for books by students of higher semesters and offered a nominal compensation to delay the resale.
"My math book usually costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a Chick-fil-A cookie," said Schroeder, 19 who attended the Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester would have cost him $430, he said.
He spent $120.
The college management reported that the student spends more than 1,200 dollars a year on textbooks and study materials, but that there are different cost-reducing options for the students.
Online stores and creative approaches such as the Schroeders are increasingly the solution of choice for students.
Renting textbooks becomes more popular, and so students can use a book for a semester, often at a much cheaper price than when buying.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 university bookstores, announced that the rental of dictionaries has doubled since 2011.
Surveys in the industry show that about a quarter of the books were rented in college bookstores last spring semester, Neebos Vice President Tevor Meyer said.
Less than half of all textbooks, according to the National Association of College Stores Trade Association, are purchased in campus bookstores.
Here's the one time for the best deals.
Buy Online
Some new books cost only a third of the price for which they are available in the campus bookstore online.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $290, but can be purchased from the specialized textbook retailer Chegg.com for $239.99.
Used Buying
If you don't care about the notes of other or normal traces of usage, used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is needed on Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, graduate student at Brigham Young University, says he has spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used issue of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business."
The book was sold for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls, recommended that students ask their professors if previous expenses are permitted.
Sometimes the updates are not relevant to the seminar work.
In such cases, older expenditure can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest issue.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, Half.com from eBay Inc is a popular alternative for used books.
Rent
Renting textbooks is worth considering if you treat them quite well, think of giving them back and you do not want to keep the books after completion of the course.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased book.
For example, a student could rent "Calculus" for the duration of a semester for about $20.
Find out about the terms of the business you rent, including the penalty fees, which may apply to the writing of notes, underscores or traces of usage.
Tenders are careful: If you do not return the book, the penalty fees may even exceed the price of a new book.
Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image
E-books instead of traditional textbooks are also an option.
Sometimes these books are de facto rented by providing an electronic license for a certain period of time by wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc..
At Chegg you can rent "Calculus" for 6 months for about 61 $.
Bracey says that students in literature courses often find the best offers, as many classics can now be downloaded for free, while scientific and engineering textbooks can be very expensive.
Look around anyway.
Joe Gault, 29, who is about to attend the Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for pricing in books, as one can be so sure to find the right textbook.
And before ordering an online order, you should check, Gault says, whether the book is actually in stock.
He learned this lesson on the hard tour.
He bought a book that had four weeks of delivery and finally paid the full price in the college bookstore.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" didn't become a cashier
"The Exendables 3" of Sylvester Stallone played less than 30 million dollars of his 90 million dollars budget in the United States, while "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" recorded only 12 million dollars of his budget of 70 million dollars.
The film "Sex Tape" was cut to Cameron Diaz at the end of the opening weekend only $14 million, while children's films such as "DrachenzÃ¤mmen leicht 2" also disappoint the revenue.
An article by the telegraph film critic Robbie Collins suggests that the lack of quality in the films could be the reason for the children's films themselves.
Collin described 2014 as "the worst year" so far for children's films and described "draft tame made easy 2" as a purely "functional" fantasy continuation.
For films for a slightly older target group, however, it seems as if the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritical rating for each summer film launch, which was shown on at least 2000 canvases between the American Memorial Day and the 20th of July 2013 and the current year.
The results are based on the views of the cinema visitors and film critics and indicate that this year's film hits are similar to those of last year.
Some commentators believe that the development is due to changing visual habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's soon released jungle book film, said to Hollywood Reporter's website: "I think times are changing."
We must accept this and not try to follow the past.
In contrast to the currently weak cash results of Hollywood productions, Netflix recently generated sales with the streaming content amounting to 1.2 billion dollars, almost twice as much as last year, in which sales amounted to 837 million dollars.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios for focusing too much on filming comics and foretold a "core melt" of Hollywood.
In the light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that his gloomy prophecy contains a true core.
However, due to the potential cash beats expected in summer 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic:
The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, recently described the decline in cash results as simply "cyclical" and said to Hollywood reporter: "The next summer will be the biggest summer at the movie casino at all, and no one will worry about the business any more."
When a few years ago the 2nd table tennis district class was removed for the purpose of streamlining leagues, this has been a step in the right direction.
Now the Deutsche TischpÃ¤nnisbund has launched an additional 3rd Bundesliga.
The result: Those who did not ascend have gone down.
While GÃ¶ttingen's top-class team Torpedo avoided the descent in the Oberliga-Relegation, it only plays fifth-class in the coming season.
==References====External links==* Official website
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Lower Saxony League, as well as the boys of the SC Weende.
The SG Lenglers and the Torpedo reserve will be in the new Bundesliga, and in the Landesliga there are no more GÃ¶ttingen clubs.
With the ladies, the TTV Geismar plays in the Bundesliga, the Torpedo-second in the Landesliga.
What looks like a better district class from the composition, is now the new district upper league south.
TSV Seulingen, VfB LÃ¶dingen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Oberder SV, Langenholtensen, FC Weser and TTC will compete here.
In the district league play as regional representatives Dransfeld and the SC Weende, in the district class of TTC II, Red-White, Upper SV II and teams of TTV Geismar II and III. The district upper league of the ladies starts at least in sollstÃ¤rke.
GÃ¼ntersen, the TTC and the TTV Geismar II are part of the game.
Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/WÃ¶llmarshausen start in the district league.
Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image
The SC Weende sends his girls to the little district league.
Also the district league season of the SCW-boys - Torpedo II is still starting there - is not complete.
In a district class, Geismar, Tuspo Weende and the Upper SV go into the season.
In the first season of the newly founded regional association, the two GÃ¶ttingen Kreisligen start with nine teams each.
In the Western season are Red-White II, Upper SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausenhausen and SG Lenglern II.
In the Eastern season, Sattenhausen/WÃ¶llmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen play among others.
The women's circle league consists of Sattenhausen/WÃ¶llmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and the SG Rhume.
This is still better than in the district of Osterode, where there are no more women's teams at all on the circle level.
It is remarkable that none of the six 2nd circuit classes achieves goal strength, here the innovative and energizing circuit board will have to think.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
At the weekend, there were protests from opponents of the NATO Summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the center of Newport for an anti-nato march.
On Sunday, some 150 people gathered in Cardiff in front of the town hall to hold a so-called counter-conference summit.
Stephen Fairclough has been following the developments on the weekend and talking to demonstrators who traveled from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers flown out of the Blue Mountains
TWO youthful bush-walkers were put in safety with the rope winds after they were caught the night over in the Blue Mountains in NSW.
THE 16-year-old girl and the 19-year-old man set out for their tour shortly after Sunday afternoon in Govett's Leap in Blackheath.
Concerned relatives called the police at about 8:00 when the two had not returned home.
A search force from local police and rescue services broke out and the couple was found near the Bridal Veil waterfalls at about 23 o'clock.
The girl had been hurt at the knee and the man had crashed and had hit his head.
Rescues stayed overnight with the couple, and they were flown out on Monday morning.
They were delivered to the Blue Mountains Hospital in a stable state with an ambulance.
Escalating anti-governmental protests in Pakistan
The around 1000 demonstrators had been forced by soldiers from the PTV building, said Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid.
After about half an hour, the transmitter resumed the broadcast.
PTV director Athar Farooq said that the demonstrators equipped with sticks would have damaged devices in the editors.
Dead or injured have not been reported.
The demonstrators demand the resignation of the head of government, to whom they accuse election fraud.
The police reported that around a kilometer from Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's residence, there were again clashes of around 3,000 protesters with security forces on Monday.
According to hospital records, a police officer was injured.
At least three people were killed at the weekend and more than 500 were injured when demonstrators tried to get into Sharif's residence.
They demand the resignation of the Prime Minister.
On Sunday evening after a meeting in the army headquarters, the powerful military had called for a political solution to the conflict, "without wasting time and using violence".
It was also stated in the communication: "The army remains obliged to ensure the security of the state".
The escalating violence has caused concern about military intervention, which has been more frequent in the past.
The protests led by opposition politicians Imran Khan and the preacher Tahirul Qadri have continued since the Independence Day on August 14.
Sharif refuses to resign.
Khan and Qadri had called their followers on Sunday to endure.
"We will not go back without having forced Sharif to resign," Khan said.
Qadri spoke similarly.
Khan accuses Sharif of winning the May election by fraud.
Qadri calls for the withdrawal of the central and provincial governments.
Then a transitional government is to reform the electoral system and call for new elections.
More than 40,000 security forces are in operation to protect the government quarter.
At first, the demonstrators had endured peacefully in front of Parliament until Khan and Qadri called on them to force them to Sharif's residence on the weekend.
Huttldorfer is the third highest in the table after the second season.
With the 2:0 over GrÃ¶dig for Rapid a bitter week on Sunday has taken a reconciling end.
"The victory is very liberating," said Trainer Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached an intermediate depth with the Aus in the Europa League League on Thursday.
"The success experience was extremely important," confirmed Captain and goalkeeper Steffen Hofmann, who advanced with green-white in third place.
Schrammel-DrÃ¤umtor brings Rapid on SiegerstraÃŸe Rapid has shown the right response to the disappointment against Helsinki with the second season victory and goes to the Landesspiel-Pause with a success experience.
"We wanted to show a positive response," said foreign defender Thomas Schrammel, who, with his wonderful leadership Volley from the sixteenth corner in the 14th minute, set the course on track.
"I thought I'd cut in all the frustration from Thursday and snap it under the slat," said the 26-year-old smiling.
When Schrammel met for the last time in a federal league on November 13, 2010, it was still for Ried.
The first championship hit in the Rapid-Dress will therefore remain him in special memory.
"For me, this is something very special, I'm from the rapid offspring," Schrammel said.
Due to Mario Pavelic's short-term Becken-Blessur, Schrammel moved from the left to the right defensive side and made his cause very good there.
He has enough experience that he can also reflect on this position.
He earned the goal, he did some assists this year," praised Barisic.
Team shows character Schrammel also delivered the flank at 2:0 by Hofmann after about an hour, which finally made the decision.
Because the guests could have written a letter before that.
"Thanks to God we have had some luck today," Schrammel noted, who thus pointed to the splitting of performance and result in the past weeks: "The results did not vote, but the playful was always good compared to the last year."
Barisic even found that one had been "better in many games than today" - against "the strongest team that played in this stadium this season".
The first three-pointer since 26 July has therefore proved that the team structure is intact in spite of the setbacks: "Today my team has shown that it has character".
No less gratifying for him: "That we finally played too zero again."
A lot of work during a country game break Also the fact that several failures have to be complained with Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger gave their starting debuts make the victory even more valuable.
"Don't forget that," said Barisic, who lost in the last three days with Behrendt and Pavelic players, "who have been very stable lately".
The country game break therefore had to be used to "sew wounds and increase a bit in the physical field," explained Barisic, who has five U21 electors in his ranks.
One of the ones to whom the break is probably particularly located is Captain Hofmann.
He's tearing himself down for the team, he's going over pain.
Especially in this difficult phase, he has shown that he is a very important player for us," said Barisic.
Hofmann not only gave the structure to the game Rapids before his replacement in the 68th minute, but also achieved the second goal.
For the 33-year-old who completed his 350th Bundesliga game, it was the first hit out of the game since 2nd November 2013 (4:2 over the admira).
Hofmann: "Don't believe that everything is good now" "We must have had a little luck too, but at some point the happiness must come back to us.
Now it was high time," said Hofmann.
He, of course, warned to concentrate on further work: "You can't always see it black and white.
We haven't played as bad in the last few weeks as it's been presented.
But we must not believe that everything is good now.
He could not dispute the importance of his role for the team.
It's a very young team that I can help very much at the moment.
They still stick to me at some stages," said Hofmann.
GrÃ¶dig-Coach Michael Baur had little to blame himself and his team.
He regretted the quick counter-beater "from the magic gate category", as well as the regular gate of use in the 40th minute, which Arbitrator Kollegger had wrongfully denied.
The only accusation I can make to the team is that we were not concrete enough towards the gate in some phases.
We've had too few degrees there.
Interior defender Maximilian Karner saw it similarly: "It started badly, but then we found it and even made a goal.
On the whole, more would have been in it.
There is rest under this pauper
We showed a powerful tribe in our mystery task of the summer series "My piece of RhÃ¶ner GlÃ¼ck" last Friday.
Several of these tree giants still exist in the district, the pictured specimen is the "Giersruchiche" above UnterweiÃŸenbrunn.
A bumpy footpath leads up to the 600-year-old oak.
It passes by clusters, basalt stone piles and basalt stone seas.
A bit below the quarry from Bauersberg, one kilometer north of the road to Weisbach, it stands.
Vital is the natural monument, it rises beyond the other trees of the surrounding area and reminds of an American mammoth tree with an area of more than eight meters.
A small Buddha on a tree stump indicates that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
Despite intensive research, however, there was only evidence of the origin of the name.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has consulted the Bischofsheim Archive and asked older people from Unterwissenbrunn to find out what it has to do with the gecko.
The result of his investigations remained the rather sober explanation for the name.
Thus, until about 80 years ago, the goats â€™ shepherds were said to have driven their animals from under-white brown onto the hard-to-earthed and stone-free meadows.
At the foot of the tree, the exhausted animal keepers are said to have rested.
In the meantime, the area has regained its importance, for in the meadows, goats actually feed again.
The area has also been declared the core zone of the biosphere reserve, Schneider has found out further.
However, when entering the stone collections one should exercise caution, because the basalt warmed up by the sun is also a popular place of stay for crucifixes.
A hiking trail leads from UnterweiÃŸenbrunn to the tree, but it is a little hidden.
Further routes are signposted, which climb up towards HochrhÃ¶n and invite you to an extensive hike.
Where's the water castle?
However, a water castle, which is sought in our next task, is rather rare in the height.
The reflection in the trench already gives a good impression of the building, but we have in the district some historical buildings that could fit the building counterfei.
Where is our "piece of the RhÃ¶ner GlÃ¼ck"?
My piece of RhÃ¶ner GlÃ¼ck

After weeks of migration, Italy's Prime Minister and EU President Matteo Renzi, against strong conservative resistance at the EU Special Summit, has last week enforced the nomination of his Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini as head of EU foreign policy, she becomes successor to British Catherine Ashton.
Renzi considers how the government-based daily La Repubblica reflects the appointment of his favourite Mogherini as a strengthening of the position of the Social Democrats and his own in the EU.
He also expects a boost for his "reform package" in Italy.
Last but not least, Renzi hopes to calm down the persistent left-wing base of the party, because Mogherini is assigned to it, albeit in a moderate manner.
Against the conservative representatives with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Poland nominated as President-in-Office, Donald Tusk, the dominant opinion in Rome would be to achieve political compensation.
For the EU's chief diplomat will also be Deputy President Juncker.
The still pending consent of the EU Parliament is considered safe.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly have called the nomination of the 41-year-old politician of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) a "important recognition" of Italy's role in the EU.
La Repubblica is spreading optimism that Mogherini, who has been proven in leading party offices for almost two decades and has been known for her ambition, will show up to the "estandard challenges".
The native Roman woman is married and has two daughters.
Her party career began in 1996 in the youth organization of the then Democratici di Sinistra (left-wing democrats), who joined the Catholic Center for Margherita as today's Social Democratic PD in 2008.
In 1999, Mogherini became Vice President of the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth (European Young Socialists) for three years.
In 2001, she joined the Left Democrats' Party Council, and worked in the Foreign Policy Department, whose head she soon became.
It occupied traditional areas of Italian foreign policy such as the Middle East, was known by studies on NATO operations in Afghanistan, in which Italy is involved with a military quota, used contacts with the S & Ds in Europe and with the US Democrats.
Since 2008, she has been a member of the Chamber of Representatives, where she is an expert on defence and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became a prime minister in February 2014, he called Mogherini to his foreign minister.
Today, if the PD has a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country, which contributed to the more than 40 percent of the party's votes in the EU elections in May, Federica Mogherini will have a share in it, as noted in PD circles.
The statements in Brussels, the new Commissioner for Foreign Affairs have too little diplomatic experience, so if there is no substance, the PD will be notified.
In Brussels, especially Poland and the Baltic members, mistrustfully realistic accents of Mogherinis on the crisis in Ukraine are being followed and defamed as a "Russia-friendly course".
It supports the pipeline South Stream, operated by the Russian company Gasprom, through which Russian natural gas is to be transported directly to southern Europe under the bypass of Ukraine, which also serves the energy security of Italy.
After Renzi took office as EU President in July, Mogherini travelled to Moscow on her first state visit.
Photos they showed with Putin at the shake-hands were taken in Brussels with indignation, as were that they invited the Kremlin chief for October to a Milan economic summit.
A total of nine young people started their training at emz-Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
Among these is an Azubi who has previously completed another training in the company.
In four training occupations, the new employees will work in the future: electronics (three trainees), mechatronics (two), tool mechanics (two) and process mechanics (two).
All Azubis come from the district of Schwandorf: Tobias Braun and Thomas Buchel from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidgaden, Johannes Beer from Neunburg form Wald, Felix Domaier from Oberviechtach, Daniel Sorggenfrei and Sebastian Zahner from Pfreimd as well as Ferdinand Strebl from Teunz.
The new trainees previously attended primary or secondary schools and real schools.
From Wednesday to Friday, the trainees of all years as well as the trainers drive to Oberammergau for a team training event, where, among other things, a full-day walk and rafting are on the program.
The company counts 435 German-wide and 950 employees worldwide.
The number of trainees distributed over all years is 27.
The socialists in France should "keep their mouths shut and put France in order," said the most important ally of Francois Hollande.
Mr. Valls called on the deeply split left to show "their love" for the controversial socialist president, whose cabinet transformation has come upon disapproval of the great majority of the French.
The President deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It's our duty to stay by his side," he said with great applause.
The Prime Minister insisted that his government would not call into question the controversial 35-hour week in France despite strong demands for a relaxation of the regulation by Emmanuel Macrons, the new economic minister.
On Saturday, Mr Hollande urged his fellow socialists to show themselves "united" with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the Minister of Justice, spreads sand into the drive, in which she appeared at a meeting of apostate socialist delegates and criticized the Socialist Party for taking the French "the faith in their future".
Marine Le Pen, the far right leader of the National Front, mocked the permanent pit fights of the socialists and said that she could not imagine that the new Valls government would last for more than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls also has none, they are forced to form a new government if the old has not even survived a summer.
"And the new will not survive the autumn or winter," said Miss Le Pen to supporters.
She repeated the call of her party after a resolution of Parliament and said that she was confident that she would appear as a winner in early elections and be ready for the government.
The French ruling party suffered a defeat at the municipal elections in March and the right-wing national front was in the forefront of the EU elections in May.
A survey in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche revealed that 76 percent of French people believe that the Socialist Party is at risk of breaking up into several rival factions before the end of the Dutch term of office 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at the Science Po University, warned against the French quickly losing patience if the new socialist government did not achieve an improvement in the economy and record unemployment figures.
"There is a small window for possibilities, but public opinion must quickly feel that things are changing," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could continue to deteriorate.
Norwegian Cruise just before a deal with Prestige Cruises of $3 billion
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third-largest cruise provider in the world, according to experts in the industry, leads advanced negotiations to acquire the competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc for about $3 billion.
A deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to the luxury cruise ships of Prestige Cruises and its wealthy clientele, while competing with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
An agreement could already be announced this week, said the sources on Sunday and warned that the talks could end without results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N) also has a share of 20 percent in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to remain anonymous as the negotiations were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments while a spokesperson for Apollo refused a comment.
In Miami, Norwegian Cruise operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenue in 2013 was $2.57 billion, an increase of 13 percent compared to 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also located in Miami, operates under the brand names Oceania and Regent, which jointly operate eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenue for 2013 of 1.2 billion dollars, an increase of 6 percent compared to the previous year.
The cruise industry is about $29 billion in total and is expected for it in the coming years due to the strengthening of the middle class in emerging countries such as China and India.
The companies are trying to position themselves for these new customers as the best choice among cruise providers.
Prestige Cruises applied to the U.S. regulatory authorities in January 2014.
Apollo has been the majority shareholder in the company since a $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was formed in its current form in 2000 by a merger with a cruise provider owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a leisure and casinomic group under the control of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise joined the stock exchange in January 2013.
According to licensing authorities, Genting held 28 percent of the shares, Apollo 20 percent of the shares and the private equity company TPG Capital LP held an 8 percent share in the company at the end of June.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruises have over 82 percent of American cruise ships' passenger capacity together, according to the original application documents for the Prestige Cruises stock exchange.
Pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China the day after the election decision.
A peking faithful group swiveled the Chinese flag nearby.
On Sunday, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress adopted a framework law allowing only two or three candidates for the Hong Kong leadership election in 2017.
All candidates must first obtain the majority support of a nomination committee, which is expected to be filled with peking faithful members.
This decision makes it almost impossible for opposition democrats to be admitted to the election and has led pro-democracy activists to face their threat and to paralyze Hong Kong's financial centre with "Occupy Central" protests.
Political reforms have long been a controversial issue in Hong Kong; and the leadership of China fears that the calls for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following the publication of a Beijing White Paper setting out China's supremacy over Hong Kong in June, democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on electoral procedures in the Special Administrative Region, where hundreds of thousands marched into the city's business district and organised a sit-in there.
Li's survey is organized by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
The Deputy Chairman of the Legal Commission of the Standing Committee, Zhang Rongshun and the Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macau Office of the Council of State, Feng Wei, should be consulted during the day.
Student activists announced that they would gather in front of the Hong Kong leadership office in the afternoon.
Britain did not provide any democratic elements until the end of the 150-year colonial government in Hong Kong.
Putin asks Kiev to take up "state-of-the-art talks" with the eastern Ukraine.
According to Russian President Vladimir Putin, Russian media reports claimed on Sunday that the Ukrainian government ceases the struggle against the separatists in the east of the country and immediately begins negotiations on the "statehood" of the apostate region.
His speaker Dimitri Peskow later made it clear that Putin did not mean that the eastern Ukrainian territory under the control of the separatists would be a part of Russia, but that his status to Ukraine would have to be redefined in order to give the Russian-speaking region power to represent its rights and interests.
However, Putin's call to the Kiev government to negotiate at eye level with the pro-Russian insurrectionists is in line with the strategy it has apparently pursued since the beginning of the outcrops five months ago: to help the separatists take over territories and pressure on the Ukrainian government to enable the newly proclaimed region of Novorossija to provide factual independence for an alliance with Russia rather than the West.
In an interview with the state television channel One, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to recapture the separatist areas in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were taken in March and April after Moscow had annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently referred to the occupied area as "Novorossija" or "Neurussia", a term reminiscent of the pre-revolutionary heyday of the Russian Empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who, in the course of the campaign of Ukrainian politicians for the elections on 26 Oct. and while government groups attack civilian communities in the areas held by separatists, hope to be "caught in their illusions", Itar Tass reported.
"We need to start extensive discussions immediately, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organization of society and the state status of the South-East Ukrainians in order to preserve the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskow said that Putin's reference to the statehood must be seen in the context of greater autonomy, which has been discussed by Kiev's leadership for months to dispel fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are at risk.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the eastern territories the necessary autonomy, said Peskow.
This is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskow said, "because it is not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but about an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The clarification of the Kremlin speaker to correct Putin's remarks' "fellin interpretation" underlined Russia's claim to leadership in dealing with separatist rebellion in the East, as opposed to the direct annexation of Crimea, on which the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have far greater difficulties in connecting the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians, and polls from prior to the conflict resulted in a large majority for the stay in Ukraine.
The autonomy addressed by Russian diplomats on international forums would empower regional governments in Ukraine to negotiate its own trade agreements and external relations, giving the Kremlin de facto control over an area that links the Russian territory with Crimea.
The Black Sea Peninsula, which was annexed five months ago, is the home port for most of the Russian Navy as well as an important trading port and historical coastal region.
The regions between the Rostov region of Russia and Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian military.
In his speech on 7 June, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed that Ukrainian legislation should, after new elections, take into account the constitutional additions which would allow the respective territories greater control over their finances and the status of languages.
But his idea of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to that of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, whose armament and incitement Moscow is accused.
Putin's last call to Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders at eye level followed a further advance of the rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks invaded the eastern Ukraine over the previously peaceful region along the Azov Sea.
The separatists supported by Russia, who, according to fears of Ukrainian security officials, is the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region up to Crimea, took control of Novoasovsk.
For this reason, massive civil and military preparations have been launched to secure Mariupol, a steel-industrial port with 500,000 inhabitants located between Novoasovsk and the narrow access to Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke on Saturday at a meeting of the EU leadership in Brussels and asked urgently for action to prevent another Russian aggression against Ukraine, an earlier Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We're about to get to a point where there's no going back," Poroshenko warned.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now located in the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit decided not to take concrete action, and the leadership called for further sanctions against Russia to enter into force in the event of an uncertain escalation of the Ukraine crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovajsk after two Russian tank columns and 1,000 soldiers entered the Donetsk region last week to support the besieged separatists, said Colonel Andrij Lysenko, spokesman of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, reporting on Saturday in Kiev.
The first probably 63 Ukrainian soldiers who were included in the Russian invasion of Ilovajsk were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian paratroopers who had been captured in Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko announced on Sunday.
Naked photo scandal around Australian Celebrities and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Noblests made no mess about his anger at hackers who probably stole nude pictures of his fiancÃ©e Gabi Grecko and a who is who the A-promis from Hollywood.
The film city is excited, after a series of clear photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence appeared in a hacking scandal around Celebrities on the Internet.
The hacker who is responsible for this probably has 60 nude photos by Lawrence, star from "the tribute of Panem" and Superstars, including the models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle and actress Kirsten Dunst.
From the Australian actress Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne, private photos were also said to be public due to an iCloud hole.
On the list are 101 Celebrities.
Noblest, who had been engaged to Grecko last month, said to Confidential, "It's disgusting."
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and passed on to others.
Grecko, currently in New York, said reports from a news website that the hack was "disgusting" and that the affected felt "injured".
The hacker probably has 30 pictures of Palmer with her ex-girlfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots in which she is up without in a pool.
The film works Palmers include "Love is invincible" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovski and the actress Browning from sugar punch were not available yesterday for comments on the hacked pictures.
A representative Lawrence' said to TMZ: "It's an abominable violation of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his tweet: "Posting hacked pictures from a mobile phone is nothing but selling Hehlerware."
Legally speaking, the spread of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Radlers, joggers and hikers were there yesterday at the 8th cycling on the GroÃŸe Feldberg and thus supported the association "Help for Cancer-Sick Children".
The tour, which was a tortur for one person, was an easy training for the other.
In one, however, everyone agreed: It was fun.
Thomas Studanski must have slept well last night.
For the first time in his life, the head of the Oberurseler Brauhaus drove his bike to the Feldberg yesterday.
For good cause.
He can easily hide the little muscle cat there, especially since the participation in the 8th wheel on the GroÃŸe Feldberg in favor of the association "Help for cancer-sick children" (Frankfurt) also brought him a valuable insight personally.
A great thing.
"I know now that I can - fine!"
Small pause on the way in the applause curve?
No, if I had stopped, it would've been over.
Like Thomas Studanski, who sits for the CDU in the city parliament of Oberursel, many of the 718 participants tormented yesterday in the early dew to mountains and came close to exhaustion, but happy to arrive on the plateau.
Others, on the other hand, made it easier to overcome the 11-kilometre-long route between Hohenmark and Feldberg.
Norman Diessner, for example.
The green politician from the district day â€“ red dress, red bike â€“ was still doing something on understatement at the start ("Every amount of professionals, there is arrival is the goal!"), but then on the mountain he proved to be half a professional and went through the goal after 45 minutes without need of breath.
He also went through the route in a slide, as did Nina Kuhn, press spokesperson of the city of Oberursel, who together with Frank GrÃ¼neisen had set out.
For the two triathletes, the "Feldberg-Radeln" was not necessarily a sporting challenge: "This is about Charity, we are happy to be there - we would have made an exit today anyway," says Kuhn.
On the way they had met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) had gone down to Oberursel in the morning to climb up again.
The Frankfurter Florian Zierz had turned home at 9 a.m. in the morning, "make" the Feldberg twice to roll home with fun.
Fun also had "Friet-Toni".
For the head of the Oberurseler Kultkiosk, cycling tours over the Feldberg simply belong to this.
He had planned for 40 minutes with his 6.5-kilo racing wheel.
It's a crazy event.
For this purpose - I like to be there," said Andreas Balzke.
The trained Mainzer says he's an "ambient racer".
He has to be, because he was on the road with the "Fixie Wheel", which is also racing bikes, but without circuit...
Not only did the 20 walkers climb up the White Wall and the Fuchtanz to the summit without a wheel loosely, but they also showed a jogger who went after a car tire with weights on a cord.
Bergwacht-Arzt Professor Volker Lischke, who with his team, equipped with all-wheel-bully and quad, said: "I know them" from Frankfurt, who trains a special sleigh trail, only that he pulls the sleigh itself." So the man is in a way his own sled dog.
The 718 participants - and so many as never before - had been sent to groups in the morning.
The walkers first at 9.30.
The first cyclists and runners followed at 10 a.m.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bikers started.
Bent Hansen, chairman of the association "Radeln auf den GroÃŸe Feldberg", gave the start commands and wished the participants a nice trip.
For next year, he hopes that it will be possible to block the route up to the Feldberg towards the safety of the participants.
