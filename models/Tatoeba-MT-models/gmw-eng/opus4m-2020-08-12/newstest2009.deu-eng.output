The Prague Stock Exchange falls into the minus against the closure of business.
After the steep waste in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange was able to correct the losses.
Transactions with ČEZ's shares reached almost half of the normal daily business.
At the beginning of Tuesday transactions, the Prague Stock Exchange joined the collapse of Monday when it dropped by another six percentage points.
This time was the reason for the collapse on Wall Street.
In the Czech Republic, too, the market's reaction to the result of the vote of the American House of Representatives, which had refused to support a stabilisation plan for the financial sector there.
Case of shares in Asia
A dramatic case was experienced on Tuesday by the stock exchanges in Asia, although the indices were able to offset some of the losses during the day.
The index of the Hang Seng Stock Exchange in Hong Kong lost almost four percentage points during the business day, but was later able to offset some of the losses, thus reducing the decline to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which observed the movement of Chinese stock shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, dropped by 3.8 percent, while the markets were closed in Shanghai.
The shares on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but then reduced the losses to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange dropped by 3.6 percent according to the local index.
"The timing for the rescue action in the United States is uncertain and will affect the financial markets worldwide," says the head of the monetary authority in Hong Kong Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, although belonging to China, is determining its monetary policy itself, independent of the Chinese central bank.
The interest rates in Hong Kong are moving at the same level as those in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, American legislators should return to the negotiating table as soon as possible and adopt the draft financial system support.
Otherwise, other countries would also be affected by the collapse.
A massacre of American shares
On Monday, the American House of Representatives rejected the plan to support the financial system, for which up to 700 billion dollars (almost 12 trillion Kč) should be spent.
The legislators thus ignored President George Bush's request to support the plan.
Bush's view is that the plan would regulate the fundamental causes of the financial crisis and thus help to stabilise the economy as a whole.
The U.S. shares had a massacre on Monday, and the main stock indices recorded the biggest break-in in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index dropped by almost seven percent, and he had recently recorded a similar breakdown in 1987.
The index had already fallen before the vote, but there were hardly any signs that the draft in the House of Deputies would not pass through, the index experienced a free fall.
Congress makes concessions: US government is allowed to pump $700 billion into banks
The top representatives of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of an agreement on financial assistance for the American financial system.
The vote will take place at the beginning of next week.
The American legislators reached a breakthrough in the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of a financial aid to the American financial system in the amount of 700 billion dollars (about 12 trillion crowns).
However, this does not mean victory.
Congressmen still have to negotiate some details of the agreement before they can publish and vote on the final draft of the law.
The plan to support the financial system will be negotiated in the American Congress on Monday.
On Sunday, this was said by the Chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services Barney Frank of the Agency Reuters.
According to the Senate, different figures are likely to be voted on on Wednesday at the earliest.
According to economists, a communication on the adoption of the plan should be the first significant psychological factor for the recovery of financial markets.
After that, however, there will be a "disillusionment" due to the complicated mechanisms that could help the markets in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made significant progress.
We have explained our different views on what a package to stabilise the market should look like," said the Democrat Nancy Pelosi to the Bloomberg agency.
According to their words, there could be a final vote on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislators met with US Finance Minister Henry Paulson on Sunday night to give the Government Fund its final form.
This provides for a purchase of non-saleable mortgage assets from the financial companies, which plunge financial firms into serious losses and endanger the stability of the entire system.
"We are on the verge of a definitive agreement on a plan which will work and which must also be effective on the market.
You have to continue the health plan, but I think we're at the target," says Paulson.
A signal for Asia operations
The global financial crisis is also markedly reflected in the stock markets that are falling sharply.
According to the democratic senator of Nevada, Harry Reid, the legislators were trying to reach a final agreement before Sunday in Congress.
The aim is to calm down investors in front of business on Asian financial markets, which are in the first time zone where a Congress decision could affect business on Monday.
So far, however, it is not quite clear when both chambers of the American Congress will vote on the law, nor is there any clarity as to whether the negotiations could not fail at the last minute.
The legislators hope that it will be adopted in the next few days.
However, the law will still be subject to some changes.
The total amount allocated to support the system is to be divided into two parts.
The initial 350 billion dollars will be made available as soon as possible, as President George Bush demanded.
The Congress can, however, block the distribution of the remaining money if it has the impression that the program does not fulfil its function, with another 100 billion dollars and later the final 350 billion dollars.
Bush Has Positive Progress in Negotiations
The President has a right to veto in this decision, but the Congress can overrun his veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the programme remained, based on obtaining finance for the purchase of bad mortgage securities, whose value has fallen, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to repay their mortgages.
"We've worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on Sunday on the law, the Senate then on Monday," said the Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
The American President Bush was also pleased with the progress.
His speaker Tony Fratto said Bush was satisfied with Saturday's progress and "estimated the two-sided effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy".
Restriction of golden parachutes
The Chairman of the Banking Committee of the Senate Christopher Dodd, the leading negotiator, stated that the legislators had agreed on a responsibility for the money programme, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the conclusion of benefits and a timetable for financing the plan.
The new law should also restrict the so-called golden parachutes for directors of companies involved in the programme and set up a committee to supervise the fund.
The Ministry of Finance should be responsible for this.
"We have worked very hard on it and made great progress towards an agreement that works and is important for the market and for all Americans," says Paulson.
The plan also calculates a help for homeowners who have problems paying back their mortgage.
The government should negotiate new mortgages, which it buys up, with the aim of reducing the monthly costs for debtors and enabling them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological aid
The proposed plan is a good idea after Patria Finance David Marek's main economist, but implementation will be very difficult.
"That's because you don't know what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets are bought up.
This will be crucial for how the financial sector and the government divide the losses between themselves," Marek said to the iHNed.cz server this week.
Whether the plan is adopted now or at the beginning of next week is not decisive in Marek's view.
"It is much more important that the Congress members agree to support the plan and that they adopt it as soon as possible.
The psychological importance of the agreement on adoption is the most important thing at the moment," Marek stressed.
Duel on knife cutting: MP3 player against mobile phones.
We will advise you on your choice
While almost any mobile phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can call.
So, of course, it looks like it's better to buy just one phone.
Despite everything, there are enough reasons why you should create an independent player.
The choice depends entirely on the type of use and the claims of the future owner.
It's hard to buy a great expensive record player at home to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
Once such musical novelties do not appear on LPs, and from a qualitative point of view there is no objective reason for them.
However, if you have LPs with Art Rock, Jazz or Blues on the shelf, you probably dream of such at least.
This is also the case with music on journeys, i.e. with compressed music, simply expressed - music in MP3 format.
Here too there are price and quality categories.
For one, it may not be acceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for a player, but also a Pink-Floyd fan will probably get a hard headphone for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes between which there is enough space for everyone.
The selection is broad.
The battery life is also crucial.
Some good music players can play much more than just music, but what mobile phones can do, they don't even make sense.
No modern device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions, phone calls and sim, it can play music and videos, record both, it has a better one, sometimes a worse camera and may also be able to navigate.
And if you still include the smartphones and communicators, you have almost a small computer in your pocket.
It's a little miracle, because no refrigerator can grill and no TV take pictures.
But the universality of mobile phones also brings disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your phone, the more often you will have to reload it.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy eaters.
Few mobile phones can play music for more than ten-twelfth hours, mostly it is much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the easiest) are much more powerful.
That's why you should expect the cheap phones that they can't play music for more than a few hours.
If you call now and then, you prefer to buy a charger for the office for security - this also applies to more expensive devices.
For MP3 players you will not have this problem, even the less good keep at least 9 hours of continuous operation with one charge.
Another problem is when you want to put the music on your mobile phone.
Unfortunately, only a small part of the devices has a USB connection, and not every mobile phone can be connected directly to a PC without special software.
Of course, the music can be transferred directly to a storage medium, but only a few card readers will be able to complete the tiny memory cards that are used in mobile phones without any reduction.
For players, you do not need any special software except for exceptions (iPod).
You only need to feed the device via USB port with music from your PC.
Most mobile phones and players create a music library themselves, arranged by the name of the performer, the title of the album, the genre or, for example, the user rating.
Some devices represent only the tree structure of the address directory, similar to the Windows Explorer, some can both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent phones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobile phones can be more
When selecting a specific device, you should in particular check the battery life, storage capacity, quality and type of sound, and of course also the ease of use.
If music is especially scenery for you and you hear it every day, for example, in the tram, then any mobile phone is enough to play MP3 files.
Which really can be almost any mobile phone.
You also do not have to control specifically which music formats a mobile phone or player can process.
MP3 create all, and most of the music you get will be in this format right now.
The format is one of the most common, and most devices can also play music in WMA format.
Less common is AAC (a format that Apple and its iPods use).
Better mobile phones also enable the purchase of music online.
You only need to access the respective pages of a provider (or another provider) via mobile internet, and you can already purchase a song or album.
This service can already be a striking argument on and off for why a music handy should be laid.
Unfortunately, the offer of the providers is bad and is mostly limited to fast radio hits.
Prices are not the lowest either.
In general, however, it is assumed that this kind of sale of music (whether it be via GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
The mobile phone carry the most.
If you want to listen to something, grab your phone in your jacket pocket while the player forgets is at home.
However, it is important whether you carry headphones or at least a wireless accompaniment equipment.
If not, you can use the integrated speaker, which has almost every mobile phone, but only the least MP3 player.
The biggest advantage of the music handys will probably be in the price for many.
The cheapest usually costs less than three thousand crowns.
For three and four thousand crowns you get a very decent walkman.
The biggest handicap will be for most that no normal headphones are included.
The best and technically sophisticated phones with a 3.5 mm opening for normal headphones cost up to fifteen thousand crowns.
The advantage of the players is the easy operation.
The easiest - and not necessarily cheapest - player can really use anyone.
A minimum of functions, the similarity in operation with the previous normal cassette recorder or, for example, the record player is obvious.
It does not threaten a collision in the form of an erratic mobile Internet and a subsequent data transfer bill.
What device should you grab now?
Also the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for removable storage media (type M2, microSD etc.).
Even if you buy a corresponding card, two thousand crowns are enough.
Yes, I do.
The basic models usually only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive can also read 8-GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy another cheap MP3 player, grab Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you do not have to put more than 1100 crowns on the table.
Be one of the more demanding listeners, prefer to take specialized phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have separate controls for MP3, and the ease of use comes to a single MP3 player.
The widest part here is Sony Ericsson, whose phones from the Walkman series have the same user interface as the individually sold MP3 players.
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours) provide MP3 players from the above mentioned manufacturers.
The first virtual provider is already coming to the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite mature, the Czech suppliers offer virtually all services, as they are offered by their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, something is missing here - a virtual provider that forces the classic at lower prices.
Maybe he won't be waiting for long.
The fact that the Czech mobile operators are the most expensive in Europe at all, we have often reported on it on Mobil.cz.
This was also confirmed by the ČTÚ Telecommunications Authority, which pointed out that the price for a text message is higher here than in the rest of the European Union.
Following the last steps of the European Commission in regulation of roaming fees, it is likely that a paradoxical situation will occur - for some customers of Czech mobile phone providers, text messages from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
Why is it that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that really makes a fight.
Perhaps it sounds paradoxical, but in the Czech Republic there are three mobile networks and a penetration of well over 100 %.
Mobile operators, on the other hand, like to blame the fact that there is an extremely high level of competition in the Czech market.
This is often due to the chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (ČTÚ) Pavel Dvořák, who has often said in the past that there is no place for another provider in the Czech Republic.
It is likely that a classic provider with its own network no longer has a lot of opportunities (by the way, it would probably hardly find any frequencies).
But there is still one possibility - a virtual provider.
Especially the entry of virtual providers into the mobile market brought with it a significant price reduction, to which the classic mobile phone providers had to respond.
Before the entry of such companies as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile into the market in Great Britain, there were similar voices to those in the Czech Republic.
However, it has been shown that there is room for such providers and that they can be really successful.
By the way, you don't have to look long for examples.
In February this we reported on the launch of the virtual provider Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this provider succeeded in winning more than 100 thousand customers and thus becoming the country's five largest provider.
The financial group Penta, which owns U:fon in the Czech Republic, is behind Mobilking.
The advantage of virtual providers is that you can focus on a much more concrete target group.
In order to function effectively, virtual providers need much less customers than a classic provider.
They do not need a relatively high cost for the construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network.
In the world, virtual providers usually stand out as low-cost companies - they offer cheap phone calls and text messages, but this is often accompanied by a less extensive range of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be quite a good move to rely on a non-cliché target group.
This provider is specifically addressed to men.
"Real guys choose Mobilking - the provider they like and can trust," says David Seibert, CEO of the Mobile Entertainment Company, the operator company of this virtual provider.
It is difficult to say whether a similar approach could be taken in the Czech Republic, as in Poland.
Vodafone Miroslav Čepický's press spokesperson also doubts this: "The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment on which most virtual providers are based.
In addition, it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the supply of services."
In the Czech Republic, the mobile phone providers think that they have no chance.
However, it is almost certain that if a virtual mobile phone provider conquers the Czech Republic, this will not be mobileking.
"We are talking about an expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not look very hopeful.
It will be more likely to enter the market of Mobilking in other countries of our region," says a telephone call for Mobil.cz Jana Studničková, press spokesperson of the Penta financial group.
Indirectly, it confirmed that the current mobile operators in the Czech Republic are not particularly inclined to this idea.
On the contrary, they are trying to do all they can to ensure that no potential competitor is created.
Their interest in launching a virtual mobile phone provider has long been demonstrated by the group GTS Novara, who wants to take another step to become a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the business sector.
"We have a great interest in offering our customers not only fixed-line, but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
With some of them, we have already been able to achieve progress in negotiations," said Pavel Kaidl's press spokesperson.
Maybe better times are coming now.
Non-official information shows that the first virtual provider may be expected by the end of the year.
But so far this is surrounded by an insurmountable wall of silence.
"At this moment, we do not assume that there is room for a full virtual provider in the Czech Republic.
The Czech market has a great deal of specificity vis-à-vis other markets.
So far, no subject has addressed us with a complex and serious project in this area," says the statement for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sršeň from the press department of Telefónica O2.
Further suppliers point out the specificity of the Czech market.
The press spokesperson of T-Mobile Martina Kemrová adds in rare agreement with the O2 statement: "We have not yet found a viable and mutually beneficial project on which to build further."
And she adds: "By the end of the year, a virtual provider will hardly appear in the T-Mobile network.
At this moment, we must already have a concrete offer to think so short-term."
Vodafone focuses his attention on meeting the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický says: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual providers, especially in the area of sharing costs and infrastructure.
This is precisely what we consider to be the best from the customer's point of view.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to search for a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile internet."
The responsible authorities - hand in hand with the providers
The approach of mobile operators is easy to understand, and another provider called more competition, which would lead to lower prices and thus also to a decrease in profits.
So why make it easier for such a competitor to enter the market?
The fact that the providers can pull at a strand when it comes to something also proves the long round and round about the emergence of U:fon.
The strongest pressure in the direction of ČTÚ was at the time when U:fon came to the market, from the company T-Mobile.
This is also demonstrated by the publicly available information from the ČTÚ websites.
But now U:fon is suitable as an argument why you should not allow a virtual provider.
Martina Kemrová commented: "The competitive environment of the mobile market has recently been strengthened by the entry of a fourth mobile phone provider.
Taking into account the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that a new player would place high demands on the market itself and, above all, its services."
However, given this approach by mobile operators, the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory authorities is surprising.
It is not just the attitude of ČTÚ, which unfortunately - unlike the United Kingdom and other highly developed countries - does not have the power to intervene in economic competition in the Czech Republic.
It has exclusively the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS).
This, however, referred to this whole problem as his very typical attitude.
"The market entry of a virtual mobile phone provider would be possible after a contract has been concluded between a mobile phone provider and a virtual provider about the hire of the necessary infrastructure.
So far, no such contract has been concluded, because the offer of potential interested parties was probably not sufficiently interesting for the classic suppliers," said Kristián Chalupa, of the Department of External Relations of the ÚOHS, in his reply to our request.
Such a formulation would not be surprising by representatives of the providers.
This is more than worrying by an authority representing consumer interests and, among other things, ensuring that no one abuses its position on the market.
In particular, when Kristián Chalupa adds: "Foreign, where virtual providers work normally, it can be observed that their market entry has contributed to a price reduction in mobile telephone services."
However, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market and a price reduction are probably not among the interests of the ÚOHS.
In this case, the almost already moving harmony of the three mobile operators, which results from their reactions, is really shocking.
The question of whether this is really just a coincidence is obvious.
Just like the absolutely same petrol price at the gas stations is certainly just chance and the result of a tough competition.
"The Authority has not discovered in this case any signs of anti-competitive action, and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way in the matter.
None of the suppliers has a dominant market position, so he does not have the corresponding increased responsibility for acting on the market.
The regulatory authority for telecommunications probably lacks the necessary tools for opening the mobile market for virtual providers," said Chalupa in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many controversial points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, prepared by ČTÚ, according to which telecommunications is a single market from the point of view of economic competition.
In such a market, of course, none of the Czech mobile operators have a dominant position.
However, some legal experts offer a different perspective - the agreement of the network operator is always necessary to enter the market of a virtual provider.
And the mobile phone provider - logically - has the monopoly for its network.
This means that it necessarily takes a dominant position in a particular segment.
However, even if one does not go along with this argument, it should be at least a warning for the UOHS that three mobile phone providers are strikingly similar.
Complaints from a number of interested parties (including the mentioned company GTS Nova) prove that they encounter very similar obstacles in negotiations with all providers.
The shift from responsibility to responsibility for ČTÚ is then a fairly common trick in telecommunications services, with which the UOHS distances itself from the whole matter.
This has already been observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, in the recent amendment to the Telecommunications Act, it has not been possible to enforce the extension of ČTÚ's competences to the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of experts had promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the UOHS only need to know this too well, but they probably have other interests.
It's all right when no one's looking at it.
The operation of some pseudovirtual providers, of which there are several in the Czech mobile networks, is not taken into account.
They are companies that issue their own price lists for mobile telecommunications services, but which are only partially public.
It is usually companies operating in the field of multi-level marketing.
Own mobile phone services include Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others.
The price lists of these companies usually come only to the chosen ones.
The joke of the matter is that the company appears to the operator as a classic company customer who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer he then receives special price offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit similar resale.
"If there are cases that you describe, then it can be a violation of the contractual conditions that we will then deal with, which can lead to an end to cooperation with the corresponding society," Martina Kemrová replied to our question about this problem.
However, it is quite unlikely that such a thing will not be the case with those responsible for the mobile phone providers.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned, it may be thousands of customers.
However, no operator opposes such action.
In fact, from the activity of these companies, profits do not flow to them to be neglected, at the same time - unlike the actual virtual providers - they will not be affected by the actual official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický draws attention to possible problems: "The law allows such types of speculation, despite everything, the services of these companies are used only by a very small percentage of customers.
They also have to accept that the SIM card does not run on their phone, so they cannot have it fully like the normal customers of the mobile phone providers."
But this alone would have to be at least strange for ČT.
In addition, another question arises for the UOHS.
Before such an approach, do mobile phone providers close their eyes, and why do they block themselves against a virtual provider?
It must be added that the UOHS has quite strong powers to detect such activities, and if it does not, it does not have to be satisfied with the supplier's statement that they do not know anything about them and their terms and conditions would prohibit them.
When Czech Republic Is Not Most Expensive
As has already been stressed several times in the text, the market entry of virtual suppliers brought a marked decline in the price of the various services.
In all countries where virtual providers have been created, the classic providers have tried to prevent their development practically more or less.
The arguments they used were practically identical - a market too small or too saturated, problems in the quality of services, etc.
In the developed countries, however, the regulators intervened precisely at these moments, which in no way tried to safeguard the interests of mobile operators but those of their customers.
Whether through formal measures or non-formal pressure, they achieved that the first virtual operator was created, and this followed further.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are throwing the whole case like a hot potato.
Based on our experience, we can't get rid of the impression that ambiguity in the competences in these cases is more than beneficial.
But let's not throw the flint into the grain.
If the background information is correct and a virtual provider will soon appear, the Czech mobile market may soon start moving again.
If a provider allows the creation of a virtual mobile phone provider, the UOHS will not remain inactive when it comes to rejecting (discriminatory) other interested parties.
And the Czechs will at last make no more expensive calls than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new recordings of the national anthem on the occasion of the Czech statehood. Where is my home country?
The anthem was re-recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo songs, in choir version and in an instrumental version.
The song version was taken over by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The editors of the anthem versions are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to all four versions.
For Bělohlávek, the Czech national song is one of the most beautiful anthems.
He had already told the Czech radio that he had chosen singers with young, representative voices that are striking and popular for the solo versions.
"From the beginning, I tried with both and then with the choir to keep a clear section, so that one could understand the text well so that a harmony could be created," the conductor said.
The Czech national anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov můj was first performed in 1834 on the stage of the Städetheater in the originally Czech play Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl, the music from František Škroup.
It became popular, and people spontaneously accepted it.
The first verse of the song became an organic part of the national anthem after the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
One of the seven symbols of the state remained after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
How does the "new" anthem sound
The Prague transport companies also transport on a chip for the first time on Wednesday
Wednesday, October 1st, 2008, will enter the history of Prague's transport operations as a date on which the first passengers will board an electronic coupon instead of a paper ticket in their pocket on a subway, tram or bus.
These can currently buy about a hundred thousand people who own the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy a 30-day, 90-day or one-year coupon (valid from 1 January 2009) and can also play it on their chip card at the information centres and branches of the transport operations at the metro stations Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobellisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
The coupons have been available on the website of the transport companies www.dpp.cz since yesterday.
The service was used until the afternoon hours of more than four hundred customers.
Those who use the internet sale can really forget the output window at the subway stations where they had to wait regularly in long queues for their paper tickets.
You buy the coupon over the Internet, it is played on the Opencard in one of the thirteen branches of the city library.
"At these points, a switch with trained staff is also available to travellers, the interested party advises on the internet purchase and also plays the coupon on the card," says the spokesperson of the project Martin Opatrný.
In addition to the libraries, the electronic coupons can also be played on the opencards on self-service machines, which are mounted in some underground cities.
What do such machines look like?
They are red, reminding of ticket holders, the passengers may have noticed them in the metro stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are currently five of them in the city, but it should be eighty by the end of the year," Opatrný adds.
The coupon controls an automatic machine instead of the driver
The operation of the machines that will work tomorrow is simple.
All you have to do is introduce the chip card, and the previously purchased coupon is self-contained.
The electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the surrounding area.
So in the suburban trains and on the bus lines with the numbers 300 to 499, with which the inhabitants from the municipalities of the region of Central Bohemia arrive in the capital.
"In the trains which are part of the Prague integrated traffic, the train attendants have readers to check the validity of the coupons according to time and zone," explains Filip Drápal of the organization Ropid. This organization compiles the timetables for the Prague transport operations.
The suburban buses have card readers at the cash desk at the driver's.
When entering, the chip card must not only be shown at the driver's side, but the open card must be placed at a marked place at the side of the cash desk.
In this way the driver controls the validity of the played coupons.
"If a passenger wants to check the validity of the coupons played, nothing is easier than to ask the driver for this information," says Drápal.
A passenger who does not drive by suburban buses and no longer knows when the validity of the coupon ends can go to the self-service machines where the coupons are played on the card.
Here the information on the validity of his documents is displayed on the display of the device.
The Sudeten demanded a popular decision from the USA
In 1945, the Sudeten Germans had asked for the transfer of the Bohemian forest to the United States.
This is reflected in a letter that is stored in the collections of the Southern Bohemian scientific library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the auspices of the United States of America.
With such a wish, some groups of Sudeten Germans have turned to the U.S. president in 1945.
This is reflected, among other things, in a letter that has been preserved in a private archive and is now kept in the collections of the Southern Bohemian scientific library.
In the letter, the Germans of Krumau ask the American president not to allow the return of the "Sudetengau" - which was taken on the basis of the Munich agreement by Hitler - to Czechoslovakia.
"We have correctly understood the situation and we really want to be sure that the American units do not enter as oppressors and enemies of German territory, but as liberators," says a letter signed with the words "people to whom the fate of the Sudetes is at heart".
Since the connection to Czechoslovakia suggests that the Sudeten Germans - knowing the Czech national character - would expect brutality, recklessness, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the author of the letter asks the American president to take over protection of the Bohemian forest for today and forever.
"We cannot believe that, without regard to the view of a quarter of a million inhabitants of this area, you have been advocating a state that is foreign to us, which has tried to suppress and eliminate minorities and has contributed nothing at all to the victory of the Allies," is read in the letter.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is said to be the fear of revenge of the "Czech oppressors".
If the U.S. President doubted the attitude of the Bohemian Forest Germans, it would be sufficient if he would initiate a popular decision in the Bohemian Forestgau whether the inhabitants would become part of the United States or want to live under the protection of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound somewhat naive in today's knowledge of post-war history, however, in the opinion of some contemporary witnesses, it paints a good picture of the then expectations of the Sudeten Germans.
Even if the Bohemian Germans at least had to suspect that one would negotiate about their deportation from the Republic, few of them admitted to such a possibility at all.
Some were waiting for the United States and Great Britain to negotiate some kind of autonomy for the Sudetes.
Still others believed that they could just stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who comes from Budweis.
He was used in the war as a Budweiser German at the Navy on the Baltic Sea.
When he came to British captivity at the end of the war and was taken to a prisoner of war camp in Holstein, dozens more Bohemian Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that if they came home, the Czech would fit in with them," said Chalupa.
No one of the German prisoners of war who had lived in Czechoslovakia before the war expected him to be expelled from the Republic on the basis of the Beneš decrees.
Don't you think - then pay!
An emotion-laden campaign is aimed at drivers
Most expensive road safety action in Czech history.
This is also the way to characterise the emotion-loaded media campaign that the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
Minister Aleš Aébíček's authority promises to drive off drivers of dangerous behaviour behind the steering wheel.
The campaign for 150 million crowns will run on TV, radio, cinema, the Internet, but also on flyers.
It's supposed to take the drivers off too fast driving and alcohol at the wheel.
And they also remember getting dressed before the start of the trip.
The campaign primarily wants to talk to young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what is shown in the spots?
Especially stories of people who appeal to emotions.
This is also borne out by the "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign:
Don't you think - then pay!
The words "don't think" are in capital letters on a label.
And then the word "pay" is in a bloodshed.
This means that one can pay a moment of inattentiveness with one's own life.
The spots will "shock" the spectators by 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where it is quite normal to see images with dramatic shots of accident victims.
It is promised that the number of accidents and the number of road deaths will fall on the Czech roads.
The spots were compiled by the agency Euro RSCG.
Sugar bread and whips for motorists
"The motto of sugar bread and whips applies to the drivers.
Sugar bread means that when they drive for example in red, they save time.
The whip is then the threat of punishment or accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk," said the traffic psychologist of the Na Homolce Martin Kořán hospital.
That is why information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative advertising are necessary, says the psychologist.
In his opinion, boards are less effective, which alert the drivers to a danger.
"If you set up a static board that warns of a danger, it will probably soon flow with the environment, and the drivers will not perceive it anymore," says Kořán.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
The President of the Provisional Israeli Government Ehud Olmert has expressed his support for the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including the Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, if one could make peace with Palestine and Syria in exchange for it.
He stressed this in an interview printed on Monday by the newspaper Jediot Achronot.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories, if not all," Olmert said to the newspaper.
"We keep a certain percentage of these areas, but we will have to assign a similar percentage (Israeli) to the Palestinians because there will be no peace without them," he added.
He acknowledged that a possible return would include East Jerusalem.
"The one who wants security in Jerusalem and, above all, does not want tractors or bulldozers to roll over his legs, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to renounce a part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in allusion to two attacks in the city in July, in which several people were killed and dozens were injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the temple bears and sacred and historical places" located on the territory of the old town.
"The one who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
That won't work," he continued.
Deduction from the Golan Heights
Olmert called for a withdrawal of Israel from the Golan Heights, which in his view is an essential condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
However, this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"My proposal is not to conclude peace with Syria only on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan Heights," Olmert affirmed.
"The Syrians know only too well what they have to do without in order to get back the Golan Heights.
They will have to refrain from their present relationship with Iran; they will have to abandon their relationship with the (Shiite) Hezbollah movement; they will have to refrain from the constant support that they provide to the terrorism of the (Shiite) Hamas movement, the terrorist network Al-Khaida and the jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," the Prime Minister specifically stated.
Questions about the accident: Are stewards illegal on the bus?
The law does not know them, a long distance bus does not allow you to walk around
In connection with the tragic accident of a company's Student Agency bus near the Italian Padua, the question arises as to whether stewards and travellers can walk back and forth on the bus during the journey.
"If we want to comply strictly and formally with the law, the activity of a steward is contrary to the law on road transport," says the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The accident, which killed a twenty-two-year-old stewardess last week, was probably caused by the driver of the truck crossing the bus.
The young woman was sitting at that moment at all the accident beside the driver, on which the least safe place in the car, although she had two more places available.
However, a bus can also have an accident at the moment or brake sharply in which the steward carries coffee or newspapers.
It also plays a role in whether the bus is equipped with parking spaces after the letter of the vehicle.
If this is not planned on the bus, travellers must sit.
Student Agency's long-distance buses have no standing places; what the director of the company, Radim Jančura, confirmed to Aktuálně.cz.
"We discussed this with the Ministry, and this first did not agree with the movement of travellers.
Later this was taken back, and we reached a consensus that passengers may go to the toilet during the trip if they have their seat," he said.
The law does not know any steward
"There is no clear legal interpretation for the role of a steward - no description describes this role.
However, there is no legislation prohibiting the carrier from providing services.
The law on road transport only knows the term vehicle attendants, but it does not define their rights and obligations," the spokesman of the Hanzelka Ministry clearly adds.
The Director of the Department of Road Vehicles of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorný, on the other hand, believes that the law will later cover this problem.
"It is important whether the bus has standing places in the product authorisation.
That's all," he emphasizes.
Buses are divided into city buses, where there are standing spaces and the maximum speed is limited, local buses with parking spaces and higher permitted speed and long-distance buses without parking spaces with the highest permitted speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
As in the plane, says the expert
The BESIP expert for road safety Jaroslav Hořín sees no fundamental problem in the move of stewards on board a bus.
"In case of a liquid mode, not many dangers threaten, the situation is comparable to the service on board an aircraft.
Again, it is not certain when turbulences are coming, and the stewardess can hit its head."
"However, a bus breaks sharply, then of course the laws of physics also apply.
Just like on the city bus or on a tram.
The safety of the stewards must be clarified to the carrier by internal rules," he says, and also believes that this problem is not completely solved from the point of view of the law.
Jančura is ready to delete the services
Student Agency is the only bus company offering Stewards services.
The company employs about two hundred people in this function.
Even after the accident, the Director does not consider her profession to be risky.
"But as soon as I get the impression that the steward's career is risky, I'll delete it.
Coffee and newspapers can be obtained by travellers when they get in.
That would also reduce costs," he says.
As an interest in safety, the director of Asiana Alexej Litvin founded the lack of stewards in his bus. However, his company operates only a fraction of lines compared to Student Agency.
"We don't have stewardesses, but we're resisting from the beginning.
Sooner or later, this ends with some fatal accident," he said not quite a year ago for Týden.cz.
That was an incredible tragedy.
In the event of an accident in Naples, a young stewardess from the region of Pilsen had failed, who had worked for the company for two years.
The Slovenian truck was probably bent off the strip without flashing off and had blocked the bus.
The driver of the bus tried to escape through a sharp maneuver, but collided with the right front with the truck.
Jančura argues that the two seats had been sold for the stewards.
"These places cannot be reserved for remote connections, they are blocked."
Company wants to sue truck drivers.
With compensation for the young woman's family, the agency will not wait for the court judgment, but it expects financial compensation from the debtor.
A change in the law?
Not in sight
A more precise regulation of the movement of stewards on board a bus could bring about a legal regime on which a thirty-member expert team from the Ministry of Transport has been working for over a year.
"However, this has not yet reached a concrete conclusion.
Buses are also not necessarily on the agenda, rather the point system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile phones on the journey," says specialist Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of the stewards to be something that could put the safety of travellers at a significant risk," says Hanzelka, with the control of the safety of the buses in the competence of the police and of the occupational safety authorities.
Düsseldorf hopes rest in Frankfurt
The letter of the WestLB Board of Directors to the staff of the House does not lack any big words.
By merging units of the Düsseldorf Monetary Institute with the Frankfurt Deka-Bank, "the central capital market house of the Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe" could be created, according to the letter published on Monday.
The WestLB introduced a "competence block" with sustainable profitability into such a business.
And at all events such a link is the decisive incentive to further bundles in the state banking sector.
This is what it reads when a board wants to demonstrate its ability to act in a difficult time.
Because the WestLB is still under enormous pressure.
Not only on the part of the EU Commission, but also on the part of the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Office, which the North Rhine-Westphalian state government recently made clear, the time has come to find a future solution.
A connection between the Deka bank, which has always existed, which savings banks know about because of their investment funds, and the WestLB has been talking about for some time now - also on the Frankfurt side.
Although he did let Franz Waas know when he presented the half-year figures at the end of August, he did not see any sense in a merger of the house on the Mainz Landstraße with a Landesbank, such as the Helaba or the WestLB.
However, the Board of Directors of the Deka, which is each carried half by the Landesbanken and the Sparkassenverbands, has commissioned the Board of Directors to hold talks with the WestLB about joint business activities.
This could be about the capital market business or parts of it.
The discussions have, of course, just begun at the financial centre.
The Deka-Bank, which, with its 3,000 employees, is one of the more important employers at the Finanzplatz Frankfurt, is not the first time when it comes to consolidation in the savings bank sector.
In 2003 it looked like the Deka-Bank was able to merge with the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and the Helaba.
However, this tributary became nothing.
Hardly had the plans become public, the Hessian government opposed the participation of the Helaba in it.
Even the other two houses did not find each other.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz went instead to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
However, there have always been thoughts about a link between the Deka-Bank and Landesbanken.
However, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Helaba Board of Management, had recently spoken out against planning games about joining his house.
However, it seems to be mature in the realization that a compaction of the various houses in the public sector is in need.
After the Landtagswahl in Bavaria is over, the first possible connection between the BayernLB and the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg could be approached.
For the Helaba this is not necessarily a good news.
Should the pressure rise to further mergers, you gradually assume the partners.
In the south, she would only be a junior partner, although she has so far endured the financial crisis far better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
In turn, the savings banks and Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen, which is involved in the Helaba with 85 percent, put forward a bar at the beginning of the year to join the West LB.
At least stay the North LB.
Such geostrategic considerations are, however, only the one side.
On the other hand, the question is how the different business models of the individual houses fit together.
In June Merl said that the crucial question of the business model to ensure the future viability of the Landesbanken was not answered by the German Sparkassen- und Giroverband.
In the end, the West LB could also be decomposed, but it is self-evidently not desired.
Thus, in the letter of the local board, it is said that a "total solution" for the house is definitely being sought.
How the combination of individual units with the deka bank can be brought under a hat will still be shown.
The second weekend is known as the "Italy weekend"
For Elena it is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena is with him as his girlfriend, and so be everything different, he says.
Behind them, the five-litre beer barrel of the Kaiser brand, stands a massively built bearded man and proves to the approximately 200 Octoberfest travellers what deep tones his throat can produce.
Elena gives Luca a clapping first, then a kiss.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, the bus parking lot next to Puorta Nuova station, four buses, "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", start this evening at 23.45 hrs., arrival expected 6.30 hrs.
Three buses are reserved mainly for the Italians, on a bus only Brazilians travel.
In a corner of the parking lot, the South Americans already sing alongside their flag, they have celebrated already at night.
And so loud, says Marco Guarda, that's nothing for Italians.
Marco, wearing a long coat of fur-cimitate lining and glasses with wide silver straps, includes the buses.
For five years they have been driving to the Oktoberfest, three tours this year alone.
At night, during the day on the meadow, back at 10.30.
Staying would only mean unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
75 euros costs the trip, the welcome drink with Kaiser-Bier, brewed true to the Bavarian purity bid, the health insurance and the German-speaking tour guide - Marco has attended a language course in Frankfurt - inclusive.
And already the buses roll into the night, on the Autostrada direction "Brennero".
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly it gets quiet on the bus, the travelers sleep.
Well, they're going to need their powers.
The salary will be in Brixen and in Holzkirchen, where several other buses with Italian signs on the highway 8 just before Munich will take a break again.
When Marco's group finally arrives in the parking lot near the Theresienwiese at half past seven in the morning, there are already 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather together, Marco gives a final address, explains the attack plan.
First, put on the yellow cap.
On the left is "Octoberfest", in Fractur, next to the internet address of Marco's travel agency: "conoscersiviagggiando.it".
Second: "When the doors go up to the beer tent, it's called running!", Marco calls in in the morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the seats in the rear part of the tent.
"Not at the front, otherwise we block, and not all yellow hats spread on the same benches, in the room!"
The measure, Marco roars, costs 8,25 euros.
And don't forget the tip.
"The security officers show that we behave well!
As soon as you leave the places, they will be gone."
Third: "Today evening point half past eleven again in here!"
And I'll go to the meadow.
On the way, a yellow cap binds to the trees, signs and even to the election poster of a large Bavarian People's Party.
You want to be prepared for the retreat.
It is the second meadow weekend known as the "Italy weekend".
There are no precise figures; the talk is about 50,000 who are making their way across the Alps and who are in the beer tents, and ten percent of all visitors are said to have arrived from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police are strengthened by seven South Tyrol police officers, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which leads a national statistics in which the Italians take first place in front of British (about 60 missions) and Austrians (about 80) with around 200 medical services.
The Hofbräuzelt is particularly popular with Italians.
Insomnia nights for creditors of the Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system was relatively stable, emphasized Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück only in the past week.
How good that the politician used the word "relatively" and also intervened that the German banking sector was not spared from the crisis-like developments.
Because it's now coming on the weekend.
The Munich real estate finance company Hypo Real Estate (HRE), which is listed in the Dax, receives a billion credit from a consortium of German banks to shield itself from the turbulences on the markets.
A person familiar with the situation said Reuters on Monday that the loan aid amounted to up to 35 billion euros.
The Hypo Real Estate must only interest the part they use.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
Background are losses with the daughter Depfa.
According to a newspaper report for long-term projects for which he has granted money, the state finance officer had extremely short-term refinanced himself - which is now no longer possible because of the mistrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's cash reserve had decreased by 95 percent to 2.37 million euros, and the equity ratio had slightly declined from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
The current income and net income from financial operations fell to zero compared with the previous year, the proceeds from liabilities to exposures and certain securities as well as the resolution of provisions in the credit business fell by more than 70 percent to EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to higher revenues from refunds of downstream transfer costs from the restructuring of the former Depfaa group and the refund of interest in accordance with the tax regulations and from the business delivery for Group companies, the profit reduction had been moderate at around 16 percent.
The former state finance provider had initially speculated himself after his privatisation in 1990 with commercial real estate loans, which had then been distributed in the Aareal Bank.
Because of the lack of income in the classical state finance, Depfa had become increasingly involved in infrastructure projects and the financing of joint projects between private investors and the state (private public partnership, PPP) and international diversification.
To the value of the daughter, the Hypo Real Estate must now make amortizations that will have a "essential material effect" on the profit and loss account of the group, it is quite indebted.
The fact is that the dividend was deleted.
It had already been shortened by two thirds for 2007.
The Hypo Real Estate has been a major public and infrastructure finance company since Depfa took over.
It is more dependent than other institutions on refinancing on the interbank market as it has no customer deposits.
With the collapse of the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, lending among the banks is again largely depleted, as the banks have their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs some - around 50 billion euros - of Depfa's short-term loan portfolio for refinancing each year.
According to the Hypo Real Estate, the financing needs of the Group are covered by the loan for a foreseeable period of time and the company is "protected by the influence of the currently largely inoperable international money markets".
It can be heard from other sources that, thanks to the funds, the refinancing was secured by the end of 2009.
The HRE Chairman Georg Funke stated that, on the other hand, the Hypo Real Estate Group would no longer have to make use of the money markets in the foreseeable future.
Bundesbank and the Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstverleistungsaufsicht (BaFin) assume that the marketability of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now secured.
This is to be hoped for by shareholders and creditors of the bank.
But given the dynamics and uncertainties of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even inconceivable that funding should not be used to the full.
But the opposite cannot be ruled out either.
After hearing about the bank on the late Sunday evening before insolvency, the at least preliminary rescue could not calm down the minds.
The share price breaks down by 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
On the other hand, the bond rates are quite good.
While the priority debt is hardly moving, the rates of subordinate bonds are more pronounced.
In particular, the bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo are affected and understandably the durations beyond 2009.
Seems hypo-real-estate bonds once a speculative alternative to investment, their value must be regarded as dependent on the stability of the international financial system after the marked strengthening of the banking crisis and the institution itself, which had only taken over the Depfa in the house.
As long as the central banks, governments and less affected commercial banks are still ready to support the system, it will be possible to expect the pension to be paid in due time.
Or what hardly dares to hope for at the moment is that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the reports which the sub-nationalisation overwhelms, the likelihood of security is currently only a legitimate hope.
Above all, long-term believers should prepare some sleepless nights to decide whether to separate themselves from their engagements.
Short-term investors can at least use a closing line to make a loss statement for future remuneration tax payments on price gains in later years.
Sylvana and the Secrets of the Bento Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, is supposed to introduce herself at Tachibana High School on the first day of school, the girls begin to tickle: The Germans are totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas - in the new exchange log she tells about Japan.
"The first day of school in Japan.
I was excited.
Even before the school way, I had Bammel.
I live on the edge of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and drive 40 minutes by train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way alone, luckily I didn't go.
The beginning of the course does not seem to be as strictly defined at Tachibana as at our home in Lower Saxony.
The students trouble from eight o'clock, until about twenty before nine a short meeting with the teacher begins, the 'home room'.
But before class began, I was on the line to introduce myself.
I'm not the guy who likes to talk to people, nor am I in front of a class of 40 students.
Because I had no school uniform yet, I put on an old skirt of my guest mother, plus blouse, blue knee stockings and black leather shoes.
So in this elevator I put myself in front of the pult and tried to say everything right: 'Sayonara Where she Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, come from Germany and have a birthday in a week.
At that moment I was very happy that I had already started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class have all shuffled, tickled and won and I have heard the word "kawaii" constantly.
I knew that from my mangas.
It belongs to the surviving vocabulary of Japanese girls and means 'necessary, sweet'.
Then I quickly went to my place.
The girl next to me smiled pretty broad, she found it an honor that the exchange student should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite quiet, but when the Gong sounded, I was really stormed.
All talked messed up and tickled and asked me holes in the belly - it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
During the break, all of her Bentos would unwind.
My guest mother had also made me such a lunch box - this is a bit different from the tedious German break bread.
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, salad of cucumbers and algae, fruit and some kind of meat in the tofume.
I don't usually have a pale shimmer what I eat here in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely new.
It's certain everything's really delicious.
Well, except for the salty plums, maybe, brrrr!
The Bentos are not just lunch at Japanese schools.
It sometimes happens that a girl gives a self-prepared Bento to a boy, who then makes her especially artistic - hoping to get to know the boy more closely at the break snack.
I read about that in my Manga comics.
I'm excited to see if I can watch this.
'Why Japan?' my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I've always said:
"Because I'm fascinated."
Finally, I've been reading Mangas for years.
And so that I can understand the comics and the culture in them better, I also started to learn a little Japanese sometime.
So it was perfectly clear to me that I had to travel here sometime.
Because I also have a facility for tradition, customs and customs.
And they're very important here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I haven't felt lost here yet, even if Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen."
Rats also have feelings
A rat or a scarf flees in danger, does it mean that it feels fear?
Neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
Just how could you check if they feel the same way they behave like us?
For several years, contributions from famous scientists have been published in the Internet magazine "Eedge".
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness, without me or anyone else being able to prove this so far where we cannot even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, at least we can hope because all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we turn to other species and raise questions of feeling or generally of consciousness, we enter the impenetrable terrain because the hardware does not agree.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same as many other animals: it dies, flees or attacks.
People behave similarly, from which some scientists suggest a comparable subjective experience.
However, I do not believe in that.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
On the one hand, the circuits associated almost always with human consciousness include the side prefrontal cortex (because of its participation in short-term memory and in the execution/control functions).
This wide region is much higher in humans than in the other primates and seems to be completely lacking in other creatures.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including the knowledge of who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is therefore reason to assume that man is even different from the other primates.
Another dramatic characteristic may lie in the linguistic nature of man: Since a large part of his experience is connected with language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
However, even if consciousness does not depend on language, it would certainly affect it, so that animal consciousness, as it may be, was probably very different from most of our consciousness states.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine what awareness of other animals may look like.
If, as something internal and subjective, it is neither possible to measure it nor, because of the special hardware, to analyze it based on our own experience, his research presents us with major problems.
Most of my statements relate to the content of conscious experience, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that is likely to be more scientifically accessible.
One could investigate the animal consciousness processes without regard to their content, and this is exactly what happens in studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially the example of visualization.
But with this approach, followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, one focuses on the neural correlates of consciousness rather than on the causal mechanisms: both may be identical or not.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal cortex for the state of visualization.
What is the result of the sensations?
I point out that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in one of its own activity conscious brain.
So what we call "fight" is the mental state in which we find ourselves, when the activity of the immune system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) exhibits memory.
In this way, sensations are closely tied to the regions of the Cortex, the primates and especially the people.
In connection with linguistic nature, fine gradations of feeling arise, because with the help of words and grammar, we can differentiate states and categorize them in order to attribute them to others as well as ourselves.
Antonio Damasio, on the other hand, believes that sensations arise from more primitive activities in the cortex and brain stem body feeling regions similar to Jaak Pankseep, which however focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it may well be involved in across-the-board sensations.
In theory, I cannot contradict this, but I think it is unproveable.
Pankseep argues that what appears in rats and people like fear is likely to feel this way in both cases: But how can one verify whether rats and humans feel the same thing if they behave similarly?
A scarf flees in danger if she too feels fear?
In my view, mere behavioral similarity cannot yet prove a level of experience.
Although the neural comparison is further helpful: rats and humans have similar brain strains, however, they do not even have a brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for sensations?
And even if one could prove this to man: How did one want to prove it in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even scabs (who knows?) have sensations.
But I don't know how to prove it.
And because their feelings are probably fundamentally different from those of ours (because human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore emotional behavior rather than the emotional sensations of rats.
At any rate, progress is being made here at the neural level, provided that the same is measured in rats and humans.
How I do not explore language and consciousness in rats, nor do I feel, I do not know if they exist.
You might think it's shortsighted, but I'd rather get ahead than run against a wall all the time.
I'm just a practical emotionalist.
Uefa President Platini: Term of grace for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Wasjunik said that preparations would soon be put under the direct responsibility of President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees Uefa's decision in Bordeaux as proof of trust in Ukraine and its ability to organise the EM together with Poland," said Wasjunik.
"But this is not an amnesty for our country.
Work has just started and there is still much to do in both countries."
In the schedule for the construction or reconstruction of the stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, the two hosts are behind.
The number of EM stands may even be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We have to work at the highest speed now," said Ukrainian Union President Grigorie Surkis.
"UEFA will keep an eye on us constantly."
An even more radical step was taken in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish association PZPN has been suspended by the National Olympic Committee after numerous scandals and replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission had met at the request of Minister for Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is "the serious danger that the PZPN will not be able to act according to the rules," said Drzewiecki of the Polish news agency PAP.
"We assured Uefa President Michel Platini in a letter that the preparation for the EM 2012 will not suffer."
Several first leagues had been sentenced to forced descent only in the past season, after all, even the league start had to be postponed in the short term.
Indignant Dennis Quaid strikes back
She wanted to promote a new film, spoke in the interview about Privates - and now has trouble with the ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan outed her lost Dennis Quaid as a adulterer.
He foams - and beats back.
Late rose war with ex-husband Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors now have an unsavory dispute with each other - in public.
Meg Ryan, in an interview with the U.S. magazine InStyle last week, said for the first time on the reasons for the failure of marriage: "Thousand was unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful."
The extent of the fraud had only become apparent after the divorce.
The reason for the soul striptease was Ryan's press work for her new film "The Women" - the story of a adultery is told.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his outing as an unfaithful husband was clear: "It's incredible," said the 54-year-old of the "New York Daily News", that "Meg re-curs and re-seals the history of our relationship for the time being."
It is also "pity" that the common 16-year-old son Jack is once again "remembered publicly of the pain and upheavals that mean divorce for each child."
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid is remarried and has recently become the father of Gemini.
And so close his inductions with the pavement: "At least my life goes on.
I appreciate that I have a wonderful family that is doing well."
Rates for tickets and hotels are falling
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
According to a current study, flights in Germany were even 50 percent cheaper.
Flights and overnight stays in hotels have become cheaper again - this is the result of a study by the travel and financial service provider American Express.
The company analysed its booking data from the first half of 2008 and found a significant fall in the second quarter following an increase in prices in the first quarter.
After years of rising prices on the hotel market, overnight stays have already been cheaper many times.
From January to March, prices in 41 out of 48 European cities were still rising by an average of 6.9% compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6% lower than in the previous year.
The trend in Paris and Rome was most marked, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
As a cause for this, American Express sees the weak dollar rate, which has led to a "absorbing drive of American tourists".
Financial places such as Frankfurt or London are also more affected by the fall in hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices with an increase of 26.3 percent even keep the record in Europe.
The trend also showed upward in the first quarter of the flight prices:
Due to the price of kerosene, passengers in the economy class had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, and fuel-intensive long-distance flights were up to 29.2 percent more expensive.
From April to June, prices for Economy-Class tickets fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but in Business- and First-Class, price changes were much lower.
In Germany, prices fell even more than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had risen by 11.9%, and in the second quarter, they fell by 23.6 percent.
According to the study, German domestic flights have even halved prices.
On the one hand, the reason for the price drop is the fall in economic growth, explains the company.
Demands in many segments of the air travel market are bleak.
On the other hand, the open-skies agreement, which liberalises air traffic between the US and Europe, has increased competition.
The situation was marked by the removal of unprofitable routes from airlines, as well as the high number of airlines which had declared bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - only in Europe were these 24 airlines.
HSV beats Gladbach 1:0
With a gate and simple methods, the Hamburg-based SV becomes a table leader.
At Borussia, Luhukay continues to fail to find a functioning elves.
From Kristofer Klein enlarge break landing for national player Marko Marin.
The Gladbacher only came late in the game and failed with a lifter to the latte.
His message was precisely formulated, she was persuasive about his lips.
He just knew he was right.
"We need the second goal," said Hermann Rieger in the cabin walk of the Hamburg Arena.
Much was not going on in the catacombs, the half-time break was over and most were sitting back in their seats.
Rieger was a physiotherapist of the HSV for nearly three decades, enjoying a higher reputation than some lost actors.
And so his request also found hearing in responsible place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and raised his thumbs.
Cornelius is the brother of Martin Jol, Chief Trainer of Hamburg.
His command will have spoken similarly: Here with gate two!
Implementation has not been completed.
"There wasn't everything nice to look at today," Marcell Jansen admitted later.
Also Bastian Reinhardt would have wanted it "more relaxed".
The 1:0 (1:0) is due by the Hamburgers to Mladen Petric's headball hit (11.); and the fact that very weak Gladbachers could not hurt the weak hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol summarized.
The Hamburg SV will be 121 years old this Monday.
On Saturday afternoon the spectators celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the flash table on the video wall, which showed their club as a class prime.
It'll be a birthday without a real party.
"We know that," said Marcell Jansen.
He suspects that the table intermediate certificate stands for the unpredictability of the league more than for the dominance of his HSV.
The team with its late-commitments - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goalner Petric and the Jansen, who had been recruited by the FC Bayern - finds themselves slow, but they cannot shine yet.
"We need more flair and more dribblings," said Jol.
After the vote
On Wall Street, fear goes around.
First news of the failure of the rescue package temporaryized the Dow Jones to break down around 700 points.
That was the biggest point loss in his history one day.
Later the Dow caught something again.
At about 20:30, the world's most important stock exchange barometer recorded at 10,579 meters in a minus of about five percent.
The Nasdaq Technology Exchange was at 1548 points with more than seven percent in the minus.
The biggest loser at that time was the Dow American Express, which lost nearly 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12 percent.
No title could win.
The shares of Bank Goldman Sachs fell by almost ten percent.
Only a few days ago, large investor Warren Buffett had participated in the company.
As part of the rescue plan, funds are to be provided for the purchase of so-called lazy mortgage papers.
However, the sum should be paid out not at once, but gradually.
In return, the State should receive stock option certificates from the financial companies which could be redeemed if price developments were to be made in order to reduce the burden on the State bank.
Stock prices in Europe and the USA in the downwards
Billion aid to banks in Europe and the US does not solve investors' doubts.
The stock price of the German big bank Hypo Real Estate is falling and tearing down the Dax.
The US index Dow Jones is losing despite the planned saving of the financial market by the state.
Spectacular price losses of the Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have broken down the German Stock Index (Dax) deeply.
The share of the Munich real estate financier lost three-quarters of its value in spite of the rescue operation of the federal government and private banks, the Commerzbank fell by more than 20 percent.
The Dax slipped clearly among the psychologically important 6000 points mark and noted with a minus of 3.7 percent at 5,839 points.
The stock markets have fallen to their knees worldwide.
Wall Street opened in New York with significant losses.
Investors feared that the 700 billion dollar rescue package of the U.S. government could not be enough to revitalize the financial markets.
The Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent to 10,809.25 points in the first trading hour.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the rescue plan that the vote in the Senate could follow on October 1.
The other European exchanges also knew only one direction: in London, the FTSE index fell by 3.2 percent, while the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9%.
In Asia, the Japanese lead index Nikkei fell by 1.26 percent to 11,743,61 counters after initial profits.

In the MDax, shares of Arcandor fell after the announcement of a capital increase.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim has signed the 23 million new shares.
The commercial and tourism group also announced that the shares in Thomas Cook were not sold.
Dark Matter Pollution Flight from Space Sins
For years, a mysterious phenomenon in research has been causing inconsistency: Dark matter pollution the speed of space probes during so-called swing-by maneuvers.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity could not be quite correct.
For almost 18 years, the "Ulysses" space probe flowed through space.
Because of quick freezing fuel lines, you are now threatened with cold death.
Among scientists, a mysterious phenomenon has been causing confusion for years - the swing-by-anomaly.
The Swing-by is a flight maneuver of space probes in which they receive additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as the Earth.
This allows the probes to save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the sun probe Ulysses.
What the researchers have been wondering about for years, however, is that the missiles do not behave 100% as they would be expected under the old-fashioned gravity law.
Rather, irregularities occur in speed.
The probes become unexpectedly faster or slower.
So far, the physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
They baptized him Swing-by-Anomaly.
Some experts fear that perhaps even the general theory of relativity of Albert Einstein, which describes the attraction of matter through a curvature of space, could not be quite correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study still firmly believes that Einstein was not wrong, and tries to explain the swing-by anomaly with the so-called dark matter that astronomers have made up in the universe.
"Responsible for the anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be very close to the earth," he writes.
The space researchers only know about the existence of dark matter for about ten years.
From it, it obviously assumes an attraction whose effect on other celestial bodies can be observed.
On the other hand, it itself is completely invisible, that is, it sends and reflects no electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to the calculations of the scientists, the dark matter constitutes at least one fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hand of their kidnappers, the tourists who have been dragged away in Egypt are said to be free again, as the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
The kidnappers from Sudan had demanded several million euros of ransom.
Six hostages are said to have been killed in a shooting before release.
Five Germans were kidnapped in southern Egypt.
Redemption negotiations are already under way.
Again and again, Germans are caught in the sight of kidnappers.
WORLD ONLINE describes the most important cases.
The European tourists who have been dragged away in the Sahara seem to be free.
This was reported by the Egyptian state television, the Arab TV station Al-Arabija and Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after reports by Italian television station Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been liberated.
We're just checking her health," said Frattini.
The five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions were well-informed and safe, reported Egyptian State TV.
The 19 participants of a desert expedition are already on their way to Cairo.
The background of a shooting before the hostages were released remains unclear: According to an Egyptian security official, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six of the kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed to a ransom," said the official.
It was "only about receiving the hostages" when suddenly "this surprise" came.
Sudanese soldiers had shot six of the kidnappers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt and had arrested two of them.
The hostages had demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money was to be handed over by the German wife to one of the hostages.
The daily "El Masri El Jom" reported, calling on a German mediator, that the release of the hostages is delayed because the kidnappers feared their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers want to release the female hostages after payment of the ransom.
The men should be held until the kidnappers have a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo rejected an opinion on the report.
Abuse of the stepfather " led to suicide"
Her stepfather's years of abuse have led to the killing of a woman, and a court has been reported.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, received a six-year prison sentence after confessing eight cases of sexual abuse.
The Truro Criminal Court learned that he regularly bound his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession: "I feel responsible for her death."
The court learned that Ms. Randle had been killed in her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise tied her up and tied her eyes before performing sexual acts while her mother was away to work in a restaurant.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s and he moved back to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, the court learned that Ms. Randle, who worked for the National Trust for a large part of her time, was persecuted by the abuse that had been committed to her twice a week.
Attorney Ramsay Quaife told the court that friends had said that Mrs. Randle, who had been a zealous surfer and cyclist, had been "emotional dead" since 2006 and had given up her "life"
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It is believed that she killed herself by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle faced the stepfather of his daughter, who wrote a letter of confession, which ended in this way: "I used to bind her and bind her eyes together."
"I didn't need them sexually.
I feel responsible for her death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: "They are an extremely strange fetishist and it must have been terrifying for her victim, especially since she was only seven.
This unpleasant story ends with the suicide of the victim.
Worse still is the fact that it is very unlikely that the case would have ended in court if it had not done so."
He added: "I take note of the consequences, according to the description of Stephanie's father and mother, her deed had on her daughter over the years.
Otherwise, she would have been a promising, successful and happy young woman."
Officers responsible for lost data shall be charged with:
The BBC has learned that the Cabinet Officer, who lost strictly confidential documents in one train in June, will be charged under the "Public Security Law".
The man was seconded to the Ministry of Defense when he lost two extremely confidential documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is the weakest charge within the law and there is no reference to criminal intent.
BBC defense correspondent Frank Gardner said the action was a surprise for many in Whitehall.
He said, "You would have thought that this would be dealt with internally at the Ministry of Defence and Cabinet."
The employee whose name cannot be mentioned is charged according to paragraph 8.1 of the law, the clause dealing with the safe storage of information.
The Royal Prosecutor's Office recommended that the Metropolitan Police charged the official with the most sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he published contained classified assessments of Al-Quaida and the capacities of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken from his home to a secret place.
Housing companies are looking at B&B costs
After the rescue of Bradford and Bingley Bank, British housing companies could cost over 80 million pounds.
The government provided 14 billion pounds to protect Bradford & Bingley's deposits 2.6 million customers.
Interest on this loan is paid by all companies receiving money from investors, including the 59 construction companies
The Director-General of the Association of Housing Companies (BSA), Adrian Coles, said that it was "unbearable" for the companies and their members to pay.
The 14 billion loan will eventually be repaid when Bradford & Bingley's loans are cleared.
However, the interest accumulated in the meantime is charged each year to the 700 financial undertakings accepting deposits.
The financial services compensation programme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing companies were included in this number.
It is bitter that those institutions that have behaved cautiously ... are now called upon to take over some of the costs of those institutions that were far less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that each company would have to pay in relation to the deposits it would hold, and that companies would have to pay about 18% of the costs together.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that interest on the loan will amount to 450 million pounds in 2009.
This means that companies must obtain £81 million for the interest of the first year.
Adrian Coles, Director General of the Association of Housing Companies, told the BBC that he believed this was unfair.
It is bitter that those institutions that have behaved cautiously during the real estate upturn are now being called upon to bear some of the costs of those institutions that were far less cautious.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the records existed in 1945.
"We will observe all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what alternatives there are to protect housing companies and their members of potentially significant costs."
The interest due in 2009 covers the seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010, interest rates will be due for a full year and that could be almost twice as much.
Since construction companies are mutual organisations without shareholders, their members will have to pay for the costs either through higher fees or lower interest rates on savings accounts.
Milk gets five pence per litre more expensive
People in Jersey are confronted with paying more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will raise the wholesale price of its milk by another five pence per litre from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-pence increase in February, and comes after investigations of a consulting firm.
Retailers should decide for themselves whether to pass on the price increase to their customers.
Prior to the price increase in February, the wholesale price of Jersey milk changed last year in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh is denied bail
A court in Bangladesh rejected a bail request from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which means that she could be arrested if she returned to the country.
Her defenders said that the court refused bail regarding the indictment of 50 million Taka ($729,700) extorted by a businessman while she was prime minister.
The case is one of several floating charges for corruption against them.
Sheikh Hasina's long-standing political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released for bail at the beginning of this month.
Sheikh Hasina will return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but her party, the Awami Alliance, demanded that the military-based transitional government first grant her full freedom.
The correspondents say that, although their suspension was granted to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear as part of her release, whether she will be able to continue to stay free when she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers state that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court rejected Sheikh Hasina's deposit request because it says she doesn't need to be granted a deposit because she is already in custody abroad to be treated abroad," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
We will file a complaint against the Supreme Court."
Her lawyers claim that she needs a deposit to return to the country from abroad to prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina was expected to return home after October 17, said an awami alliance party chairman on Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the army-supported transitional government took over power, but was released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Sheikh Hasina, as well as Khaleda Zia, deny all charges against themselves.
Fears of the anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan
In the recent anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan, nearly 200 000 children have not been vaccinated because of the violence associated with the Taliban, says the United Nations.
The United Nations carried out a vaccination program in six provinces last week.
However, they could not reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
According to a UN spokesman, this was the case despite the Taliban's promise not to attack or hinder the thousands of people carrying out the vaccinations.
BskyB loses action in case ITV
BskyB has lost its claim against the Competition Commission's decision to reduce its share of the competing ITV channel.
The competition court has ordered BskyB to reduce its participation in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The Commission had previously claimed that the share of BskyBs distorts competition and allows it to have an unfair influence on ITV.
BskyB acquired its share in 2006 by successfully preventing NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that BskyB’s purchase of ITV’s share of the ITV’s independence would cast doubts on the ITV’s independence, which led the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
The Virgin Boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the communications office of Ofcom have opposed the purchase.
BskyB argued that the pressure to reduce its share of ITV was an unreasonable and excessive measure, especially because BskyB had announced that he would like to give up his voting rights.
New investigation in the U.S. Public Prosecutor's Office
The U.S. Attorney General has commissioned a specialist investigator to deal with the termination of the nine prosecutors in the United States in 2006.
The occasion was a report by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Justice, in which the actions of the administration staff were criticized.
The report criticised the officials of the White House, legislators and former Advocate General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was driven by the fears that the lawyers had been dismissed for political reasons.
The specialist investigator Nora Dannehy is now supposed to find out if the officials interrogated during the investigation have betrayed the investigators in order to hinder justice.
Serious accusations including criminal proceedings have not been fully investigated or clarified, said General Inspector Glenn Fine in his report.
The appointment of a specialist investigator with the power to force witnesses to testify was one of his main recommendations.
The conflict began when the Ministry of Justice deposed nine U.S. prosecutors from its offices in December 2006.
At that time, the Ministry argued that the prosecutors would be dismissed due to poor employment.
However, it was later found that the dismissed prosecutors were not worse than many of their colleagues had been judged, which led many observers to view the terminations as politically motivated.
Some of these prosecutors were involved in the judicial persecution of high-ranking Republican congressmen, while others refused to investigate the charges of election fraud of the Democrats.
US prosecutors are responsible for investigating and persecuting court cases for the government.
They may be released at any time, but may not be dismissed for political reasons.
The then Head of the Department of Justice General Attorney General Alberto Gonzales has been arrested for the dismissals and in the final effect has deposited his office.
A number of officials from the Ministry of Justice have also resigned.
In particular, the report of the General Inspector referred critically to the role of Gonzales by carrying the "main responsibility" for the dismissals, "resigning" his leadership role and showing "exceptionally disinterested" in the process.
Other officials, including former Chief Advisor of President Bush Karl Rove, were criticised for their lack of cooperation with the investigators.
Meat Loaf's epic song is to be honored
The rock star Meat Loaf is to be honored during the music award "Q Award" for his epic anthem "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer, who will accept his special golden prize in London next week during the award ceremony, said he was honored to be recognized.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track of Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
"Coldplay" lists the nominations for this year's prize award after having come into the narrower selection in four categories.
The editor-in-chief of the magazine "Q Magazine" Paul Rees said that there were some songs that go beyond such materials as time and genre and that "Bat Out Of Hell" was certainly one of them.
The song written by Jim Steinman required a strong voice delivered by Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental part that takes almost two minutes.
The song was released for sale in the UK as a single in 1979 and finished 15th in the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's "Bat Out Of Hell" spent about nine years in the charts and sold more than 40 million times worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose true name is Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered from serious health problems in recent years, one of which was surgery in 2003 due to irregular heartbeat after he collapsed on stage.
In 2007, he had to cancel concerts due to acute throat inflammation.
Later, it became known that he had a cyst on his vocal cord.
Obscure street in city, often forgotten and possibly soon to sell
New York City has thousands of major roads, avenues, side roads and other bypass roads, some of which are famous and others are just comfortable.
Nevertheless, even for experienced taxi drivers and long-term locals it is difficult to say where Extra Place is, simply because most have never heard of it.
This tiny road is located in the East Village and runs from First Street north between Bowery and Second Avenue, without reaching Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks more like a dusty alley than an active passageway.
There are no street signs either.
It is practically impossible to find them on a standard street map.
This street still has its admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that recently built luxurious buildings on First Street.
It wants to pave Extra Place to create a clean passage to the shops and boutiques expected in the new buildings.
Among the other admirers is the long-standing neighborhood, which says it is fascinated by the short alley, simply because it is one of the remains of the past of the building block.
However, the City Administration Department, which is responsible for protecting and constructing the residential buildings and is responsible for the road, has no interest in obtaining them.
During a meeting of the Committee on Land Use of the City Council this month, representatives of the City Administration and Avalon Bay have designed a proposal for the purchase of the road by the construction company.
Nevertheless, the Committee prefers that the street remains in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan to be presented in the coming month, says Susan Stetzer, the district officials in the municipal council 3.
"Only very little space has remained in the possession of the city and we want Extra Place to continue to belong to the city," she said.
"There could be offers to repair and operate the road, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want public access to be guaranteed."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that it would like to re-pave the small street and set up seats designed, among other things, for a café to which the company wants to rent space.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was made public for the first time during the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman from Avalon Bay, said that while the company wanted to use the street, she did not necessarily want to own it.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renovate this decaying alley and make it a public meeting place," she said, adding that the city itself had proposed the sale.
Seth Donlin, spokesperson of the Department of Building Protection, said that it was actually the city's desire to sell the street and stressed that the department's task was to develop rather than manage real estate.
Compared to its colorful neighborhood The Bowery, Extra Place has impressed something of its historical impression.
Some believe that the street got its name in 1802, when a large farm, owned by Philip Minthorne, was divided between its numerous children and a narrow strip of land was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of the music club CBGB, the punk rock monument, which was closed in 2006, opened to Extra Place and the street is certainly most known as a setting for the photo on the cover of the album "Rocket to Russia" by Ramones.
The patch was great, said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who had taken the photo in November 1976.
The road was full of scrap, rags and parts of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes.
Some residents, including the bloggers who write about the gentrification of the East Village, have rejected the idea of selling Extra Place, with the argument that this public property, as modest as it is, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rarity – a virtually unchanged splitter of the city that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs the blog called "Jeremiah's Vanishing New York" (subtitled "The Book of Complaints: A Bitter Nostalgic View of the Extinct City"), has published part of the conversation in city history about Extra Place, which was published in the journal "The New Yorker" in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote at the time: "Extra Place is a small narrow dead end that remains dark even during the day and is marked by rusted metal doors of the warehouses, closed windows and rainy women flying past old newspapers".
With few exceptions, the road looked just as recently on one evening.
A rat ran through the back of the street, not far from the door that once led to the CBGB, where today there is a more expensive clothing shop.
Graffiti were on view on the walls and an empty bottle of beer lay on the floor not far from a fresh bundle of classified newspapers.
Some passersby said they rarely thought about Extra Place, but suggested that the road could be slightly polished.
Fields, added that in his opinion, some people underestimate the charm of the street in its current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in the places that were dark, damp and disgusting.
Discussion on bilingual training: education in a language environment
In this issue of the Education Watch Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of candidates for bilingual training.
Lance T. Izumi, senior scientific assistant in California studies and senior director of the Department of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "Not as good as you think: Why the middle class needs a school selection".
Addressing the Hispanic voters is a complicated task.
Barrack Obama's proposals on education are a typical example of this.
Obama's campaign mentions that "the probability of afro-American and Hispanic students successfully completing the school is lower than with white students" - which is true.
In order to close this gap in performance, Obama’s educational plan specifically recommends a bilingual transition phase in training for those who first learn English.
The question to Obama, however, is whether his commitment to bilingual training, which focuses on teaching in languages other than English, contradicts his interest in reducing the distance in schooling.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, a primary school in eastern Los Angeles.
The majority of students are Hispanic and come from low-income families.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have recently been in the country, learn English.
Nevertheless, in 2008 amazing 100 percent of fourth-class students passed the state examination in math at a good level.
Also surprisingly, 93 percent of children from the fourth year of school were considered to be well qualified in the English exam.
This amazing success has been achieved with other methods than those preferred by Obama.
School Sixth Street focuses on checking and exercising, on constant control of knowledge and an attitude that does not tolerate exceptions.
Furthermore, the school practices the approach by which the education takes place in an English-speaking environment. This is exactly the point that Obama should consider, says the headmaster of the school Linda Mikels.
This approach places emphasis on the almost exclusive use of the English language in vocational education.
Mrs. Mikels, who rejects the idea of bilingual training, told me that the school had a remarkable success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico. 12 months later, one would enter the classroom and cannot recognize it anymore.
"It works," she said, "it works for us."
Would Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model for other schools with a large proportion of Latin American and other English-learning students?
The school's achievements would make the answer to this question easy, but the educational positions within its own party (the national image associations have long supported the idea of bilingual training) and its own consistent support for bilingual training make predictions of Obama's response uncertain.
While agreeing that immigrants should learn English, he has recently trivialized the subject by noting that people should stop worrying about the legislation aimed at "only English".
Instead, he said, "You should make sure your child can Spanish".
If Obama really wants to close the performance gap, he should carefully take into account education models that work instead of despising and trivializing them.
The price of oil is falling as a result of new fears about the economy
The price of oil on Monday, because of the fears that even the American rescue plan for the financial markets could not be sufficient to revive the economy, has fallen heavily.
In the morning session, crude oil forwards on the New York Trade Exchange fell by 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel.
Since last Monday the price has dropped by more than $20.
In the last two weeks, the freight markets have been shaken by the financial turbulences on Wall Street as well as by strong whirlwinds in the Gulf of Mexico.
After the prices reached their peak of $145.29 per barrel in July, this month they fell to almost $90 per barrel, to rise again as a result of the enormous uncertainty in financial markets.
On Monday, investors have already shown concern, although Congress representatives had announced that they had agreed on a rescue plan on the weekend, which should be the largest in history.
This news was overestimated by new concerns that the financial crisis was still far from complete.
In the last chapter of the growing crisis, according to a government announcement on Monday, the Citigroup is to buy up the banking operations of the Wachtovia Corporation.
In the meantime, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partly nationalized the European financial group Fortis.
According to analysts at Barclays Capital, despite the tense negotiations that took place on the weekend and led to a rescue plan, it seems that the mood in the markets has failed.
As the economic situation continues to deteriorate, demand for goods, including oil, is expected to continue to decline.
In a communication to investors, analysts of Deutsche Bank wrote that the forecasts for global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates had become absolutely uncertain.
We believe they continue to write that the goods markets will also be affected.
"From the perspective of the goods markets, we are most concerned about whether the US virus is spreading worldwide, especially to China."
The bank's analysts have downwardd their expectations for oil consumption due to weak economic growth in the coming year, and their oil and gas price forecasts for 2009 have reduced by 20%.
Team record by series in the second quarter
Interior defender Shaun Ellis thought he'd seen everything after he'd been in the last eight and a half years more than anyone else in the jets jersey.
Then on Sunday he saw the second quarter in which the jets turned an inescapable game into a triumphal train.
"I've never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
After a sloppy game between the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals, which corresponded to the bad weather, the second quarter began.
However, when Quarterback Brett Favre's Pass arrived at Lavernues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, it marked the perfect start to an afternoon when her developing collaboration took a huge step forward.
Favre found Coles in this quarter for two more touchdowns, which once slipped out as an outside defender and the other time 10 seconds before the end of the half-time.
"I didn't work out very hard," says Coles about the passports that went to Coles.
"He's a super player.
Our vote has been taken, no matter what people think."
While Favre and Coles were playing catch, the defense took quarterback Kurt Warner apart.
External defender Darrelle Revis caught an accident and turned him into a 32-yard touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith came to another pass and caught him.
Linebacker David Bowens then caused a loss of Warner.
The last ball loss, forced on Bowens, was probably the craziest.
The Cardinal had conquered the ball with another 10 seconds left in the game when the jets took the ball back and Jay Feely turned a 20 yard shot into 34 to 0 guided.
These were most of the points the jets had ever achieved in a quarter.
When he was asked to describe the insanity, Erik Mangini, the jet coach "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
To the answers both, because the jets allowed 21 points in the third quarter without reaching a single, Mangini said: "Believe me, I have enjoyed the second quarter more than the third.
A lot of points were made in a short time."
Exploited gebrselassie beats his world record
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has again shown why some consider him to be the best long-distance runner of all time after he broke his own record in the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and became the first person to have the distance of 42.2 kilometers in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory on the flat course in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie improved his previous result of 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, which he had achieved last year in Berlin.
Gebrselassie, 35, has thus set his 26th world record in his versatile career, in which he has at least reached a world championship title or set a world record on every track from one kilometer to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie left out the Olympic marathon in Beijing, because of fear, which was perhaps exaggerated afterwards, that air pollution could aggravate his asthma problems.
Instead, he signed up for the competition in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions - with sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees at the finish - Gebrselassie has won at an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since railway runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya changed to long distances, the record time for marathon in the last 10 years has fallen by more than 2 minutes, since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in 1998 in Berlin with the result 2:06:05.
After his victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie informed the press that he had had cramps in his wade two weeks ago and therefore could not exercise a week.
Obviously, he was refreshed after a break and did not come back rusted.
"I'm so happy," he said to reporters.
"All went perfectly.
I started the training a week ago and still had some concerns today, but in the end, everything was great."
He was criticized for this - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's rivals from East Africa - for orchestrating his racing races excessively, avoiding many world's best marathon stars in general, relying too much on the race leaders as if this were a race, and putting world records over the competition.
But this criticism hardly harms the size of Gebrselassies as a long-distance runner.
Accompanied by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie had reached the center of the line in 1:02:04.
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the tempomakers had dropped.
A little more than three miles before the finish, Gebrselassie made his last appearance to separate from Kwambai, who arrived at 2:05:36 and thus improved his best time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi became third in 2:07:48.
In women, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now German, completed a remarkable year by showing the seventh fastest result of all time at 2:19:19.
The world record of 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliff from Great Britain.
Last spring, the 36-year-old Mikitenko had surprisingly won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She missed the games in Beijing due to problems described as a back injury. However, she recovered to win in Berlin and improve her best time in her third marathon by five minutes.
She has planned her course by leaving a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners to leave, but after 30 kilometers she overtook.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia became second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop from Kenya arrived as third in 2:25:01.
The pride and the strata in the life of the black population, in a city of a very special kind
Hidden between the outcrops of the amusement parks in the vicinity of Orlando, a few miles away from the glittering, noisy and gigantic drive, lies a quiet city in which pride and complications of Afro-American culture come to light.
Eatonville, the first completely black town in the country and the hometown of Zora Neale Hurstons, is no longer as easy to describe as Hurston did in 1935: "The city with 5 lakes, three croquet sites, 300 brown hides, 300 good swimmers, more than enough guavas, 2 schools and no prison."
Nowadays, it's a pilgrim's place.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to commemorate the most famous author of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet, the city it describes – and which it made a tourist destination by including it in the Florida travel guide, which was produced by the Federal Writer Project at the time of depression – is in many respects a place of the very special variety.
Eatonville is as independent, rich and private as in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man who "know so little about us that he doesn't know what's going on."
Even today, in a year when a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open discussion on racial relations, many are still sorry to be watched by outsiders.
"We are very concerned about how our history is told," said Hortense Jones, 59, from birth to a city's inhabitants and parishioner of the oldest church in the city.
It must be right."
Eatonville was long defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is a historical example of the black movement as well as a community of nearly 2,400 inhabitants in which the poverty rate is twice as high as the national average.
On the one hand, it is a stronghold of literature and, on the other, an example of the black culture of the rural south, sometimes condemned, sometimes praised, which has its roots in American slavery.
It is not surprising that people here are both proud and on the hat.
And the concerns about Eatonville's image actually began with Zora, as all Hurstons call here.
She presented to the world her hometown in books that came from the heart and were written in Mundart, such as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973)
Five paragraphs in the Florida guide changed the city, which is very close to Route 77, a road leading through the often-forgetten centre of Florida, to the scenes of black history and human drama.
Frighten like Oskar both in real life and in literature, Hurston led readers to the store of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then turned to more private matters.
"Beside the street to the left," she wrote, "is the brown-white painted modern school, with its well-kept gardens and playgrounds, which Howard Miller always cares for, although he can hardly read and write."
She also mentioned the new man of Widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sold drinks of all kinds and what-ever-appropriate to hourrooms."
In just a few hundred words, Hurston thus associated Eatonville with self-government, but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
This was certainly not a guide.
In fact, this was not a portrait appreciated by all.
"Zora described the things as they were," said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls who immortalized Hurston by quoting the men who sang songs about her beauty that were full of sexual allusions.
She added, "Some people didn't like this."
One still remembers Hurtson as a lively eccentric who regularly returned after her family had moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, remembered that when Hurston came to the city, she usually did so without warning, in a noisy chevrolet, smoking and dressed in pants, in a city that itself is today imagining something on her honorable style of clothing.
According to Mr Franklin, most of the inhabitants were fascinated, while many despised them.
"People were always happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But "she never stayed too long," he added as he rocked in his chair, on a back terrace looking at the lake Sabelia, in which Hurston was most likely baptized.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of print.
Together with most of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them.
Although she was once a famous author, a contemporary Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived, in an anonymous grave.
In Eatonville there was no great commemoration, no public readings in great style.
"I don't think they understood her contribution in the world or her inheritance in the least," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography about Hurston published in 2003.
The turn of events came in the 1980s.
Orange County authorities wanted to put a five-lane highway through the city to replace the Kennedy Boulevard, the slow two-lane main road in the municipality.
Orlando's suburbs had already pushed the 4th motorway through the western edge of the city.
The proposal was made when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult stage in his history.
Forcible integration, among other things, put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the fight against racial mixture brought hatred into the community.
"At that time a bunch of white boys often came and they threw oranges and stuff at the people sitting away," said Mr. Franklin.
"There was even a woman who was killed.
They threw a watermelon out of the car."
In 1955 Hurston questioned in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel the demand of the Supreme Court to force integration by calling its decision in Brown against the school council "respectively rather than my race".
Today, residents say that although the abolition of racial segregation was positive in some respects, it weakened group cohesion in Eatonville and the self-confidence of its young people.
"Black children were used to being hugged - I remember - they embraced his teacher in the morning and they embraced his teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and managing director of the non-profit group to protect the Eatonville community.
This could be maintained for so long, she added, until teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
"They didn't embrace his white teacher, because he was a white teacher - I mean there's a cultural gap present," said Ms. Nathiri.
However, the civil rights have contributed to the creation of space for other Zora Neale Hurstons - black authors, actors and artists who overcame prejudices, as they did, with positive self-confidence and statements such as: "How can anyone refuse the joy of my society!
I don't understand."
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker set out for Hurston's nameless grave and began to fight for the revival of her fame.
Five years later, a much praised Hurston biography by Robert E. Hemenway was found in the bookshelfs, making it once again part of the American literary canon.
The long distance project came at a time when Eatonville's most famous daughter was once again in the public light.
And this time Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The municipality began planning a Hurston festival in 1988 to show what the district could destroy with the construction of the highway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January many return for the celebration.
A few years later, the district turned away from its road construction plans.
"The plans of a five-lane highway revived the city, accelerated the whole thing at top speed, aroused real citizen pride," said Ms. Nathiri.
Ms. Boyd expressed it a little easier: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the long-distance project has contributed to a change in the city's self-image.
More and more prisoners came, like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been going to church here since 1993, and locals began to appreciate the past.
Eatonville was added to the national historical register in 1998.
A new one-storey library (of course named after Hurston) opened in 2006 on the newly paved and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Nowadays, Eatonville is still a special feature in Florida: only 6 miles from the city centre Orlando, it can sometimes feel like a back alley in the summer rain, as small as it was then when it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(She's 90% black these days.)
Outsiders looking for the history of Eatonville and its meaning are often still treated with caution.
Most interviews require prior approval and certain things - such as the wall painting of Eatonville's oldest church, painted by a white man and representing black men in field work - must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Ms. Jones, a courageous, self-confident teacher with a taste for dark red, still fear that her shielded community will be misunderstanded.
And yet, at the same time that the Hurston festival grew bigger, a higher degree of home pride was also born.
Young people in particular tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw her entire race: beautiful, with all his problems, neither worse nor better nor as proud, creative and diligent, silly and mixed up as any other racial and ethnic group in America.
It is the sincere love for this city that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the city administration or the police who could use some help according to him.
And even the younger ones, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people who only pass through here will think, "Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others," said Alondra Kenon recently on a Sunday after the church.
"But if you actually stop and look at your story for a moment, it's a very beautiful city."
Here with us in New York you speak fluent financial Latin.
At first glance nothing changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the newspaper stands and the huge television screens in Times Square, they would not even notice that they are in the middle of a debacle.
They would never believe that over their heads, in the shoe box-like offices with the glass facades, bankers and hedge fund managers who have the monopoly in New York have daily the worst horror working day since the Stock Exchange crash of 1929.
Suppliers still push the metal tea carts along side platforms with loud flaps and transport trays loaded with muffins for breakfast meetings.
Latinos still slurr between apartments, like human pack animals loaded with around 50 ironed T-shirts hanging on a yoke-like rod on their shoulders.
Office staff are still waiting for their breakfast bag and it is still impossible to get a yellow taxi between 4 and 7 p.m. on a weekday.
It didn't feel like a crisis at all until Thursday afternoon I decided to open a new savings account because of all the world's downfall.
Although I had decided to put my duty in time on the quiet late afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase branch, about 20 people already stood snake.
Not at the money desks to withdraw or deposit money, but at the customer service switch where regular customers order checkbooks, ask tourists for the way to the department store Macy's and where new customers open accounts.
Most of it before me, so I later learned from Starr, my "personal banker with license", stood for the same reason as I was a snake.
However, unlike me, they had already removed their savings from smaller banks, from places from where they were commuting, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had withdrawn money from so-called thrifts (a little bit like a building savings bank), cooperative banks and those local savings banks that only have branches in a state and say that they treat their customers like family.
Last year 15 of these banks went silent and quiet.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with investments of $327 billion, went to bankruptcy administration and when last Friday New Yorker went home over the weekend, was Wachovia, another bank that owns savings investments worth $440 billion, looking for a saving buyer.
In the fear of another collapse, the office and shop workers brought their bares in front of me to a bank that is considered a safe port, a bank that is responsible for most rescue purchases on Wall Street.
Quite normal New Yorkers have taken on flowing financial Latin in the last few weeks.
A woman who telephoned in my Chinese supermarket, with so much familiarity, referred to Lehman Brothers, the pleite bank and its lean-looking CEO Dick Fuld, as if she were blaming about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the 50-year-old uniformed concierge of my residential block, has escaped from our usual entertainment topics about Brad and Angelina and my food delivery.
"I now have all my savings in money market funds," she told me after my visit to the bank.
"I've changed, I'm not going to take a risk anymore."
Muslem graves damaged during right slide in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a left-wing judge of the Austrian Right-wing Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter, a member of the Belgian Right-wing Pertei Vlaam's interest, take part in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday, 17 January 2008 to represent the organization "Cities against Islamization".
They carry signs in the style of traffic signs on which a mosque is pictured, crisscrossed with a red line.
The police accuse right-wing extremists of the grave damage in a Muslim cemetery in Austria, on the same weekend at the extreme right-wing parties, of making significant profits in the parliamentary election of the country.
In the night from Friday to this morning, more than 90 graves at the cemetery in Traun near Linz were severely damaged in an action organized by the police.
The perpetrators sprayed Jewish symbols such as the David Star on some of the graves, but criminal officials consider this an attempt to conceal the motive of the extremists driven by hatred on Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is in any way related to the elections.
A spokesperson of the local Islamic community said they were "extremely shaken" about the news of the tomb damage that took place when the religious month of the Muslim Ramadan tends to end.
At the same time, a round of conscience research is on in Austria after the country slipped to the right in yesterday's parliamentary election.
The FPÖ and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, the two far right-wing parties that received almost 30% of the votes, fought for a strict anti-immigrant law in their election campaign, and some of their election statements were criticised by opponents as an enemy.
Heinz-Christian Strache, chairman of the FPÖ, who won 18% of the votes, advocated a ban on headcloths and Burkas and even announced his aversion to food that is generally associated with Islam.
At his last rally in Vienna, he spoke of a "European Brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to prohibit the building of mosques and minarets with the argument that these political symbols are a continuous Islamisation of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the election, stating that the extreme rights of the most politically strong block are in the country, indicate that this new development is based on young voters who are worried about their future in the European Union.
foreign travel lock for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the glam rock star who has been sentenced to sexual abuse of children, was legally forbidden to travel to France and Spain.
Judges imposed a six-month barrier on Glitter after informing the controlling authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain via France.
The police in Kent were granted a ban on travel abroad last Thursday after giving the judges proof of Glitter's pre-punishment for the sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, the real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford District Court in Kent, but was represented by the law firm Corker Binning.
One speaker of the Court reported: "On Thursday, 25 September, the police asked Kent at Ashford's District Court for permission to prevent travel abroad from Mr. Paul Glad to France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd was not personally present."
According to the register of sexual offenders required, Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad.
He must inform the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also notify the police 7 days before his planned departure.
Failure to notify authorities could lead to a prison sentence of 5 years.
The police in Kent said that she wouldn't discuss individual cases or glids of possible residence in the country.
A spokesman from Kent's police unit said, "The police in Kent will do everything necessary to protect children in this country and abroad."
"In our opinion, it is easier to control someone who is in the UK because we have a comprehensive system to effectively prevent any potential risks."
"It is the chief concern of the police in Kent to protect the inhabitants of Kent and we work closely together to monitor the behaviour of registered sexual offenders in the country in order to minimise any risk that could exist for the population.
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse of 2 girls aged 10 and 11 years.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he was scheduled to take a flight to London.
But he said he didn't feel well and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not let him through passport control and he flew back and forth to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to enter him and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officials insisted that he return to Britain.
Finally, on August 22nd, he arrived at Terminal 3 in Heathrow and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge District Court in West London, since Scotland Yard had successfully asked for permission to request that he register as a sexual criminal.
Glitter had previously been detained in the United Kingdom for 4 months in 1999 for possession of images of child abuse.
According to the Ministry of Interior, Interior Minister Jacqui Smith is calmed down and satisfied that Glitter was prevented from travelling to France and Spain.
"I receive the master behind the stage to capture his character," Günter Brauer, photographer.
No heels, no wigs, no costumes for the appearance.
The nature of the great flamenco dancers who renounce the concentration and devote themselves to the interpretation to get a relaxed appearance as a woman or as a man.
On the one hand, artists
On the other hand, personality
I look into private life, into these moments that are foreign to the audience, I know when I can find a typical gesture for the personality, the depth of a stolen look or expressiveness of the hands that are concerned because they are not entering the stage.
In his project `Flamenco-people', the German photographer Günter Bauer presents alternate theatrelic of some productions on stage with singers, dancers and guitarists. From this page he was still little known for the artists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a special electronicography of flamenco representation on different levels.
The exhibition, which belongs to the programme of the month of the photography of Flamenco, "reflects the international importance of Flamenco, which grows ever bigger from day to day," explains the artist and makes it clear that "Flamenco-people" can be any human being, but when you look at the photos, the viewer notices that there are no typical pictures of artists on stage.
Normal people on the portraits are artists who are able to convey passion, sadness, joy on stage and thus move the audience.
To hold on to the personality of these artists, you don't have to take pictures on stage.
Their personality and character are in their hearts.
What interested me was to create a personal atmosphere that would enable me to capture the characters of the greatest flamenco master with the camera.'
Bauer, inspired by the festival `Cante de las Minas', made a long journey in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the image sorting function of the camera and the existing material, created images reminiscent of classic photography.
The use of various stylistic means destroys the classical basis of the image, giving the image the modernity and the idea of how farmer Flamenco understands: 'music with traditional roots that change and surprise each day'.
These are not only the dance, the singing or the instrumental playing in themselves, but the personality of the artist, his character, which seduces the audience with his art.
The search for the essential, for a certain thing that becomes visible in the form of hearing, being, was and was the firm goal of this work, which will be presented in the next time in the gallery of the El Fotómata.
Known personalities in Flamenco among them Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others belong to the narrow selection of almost seventy artists who were photographed.
The project became an anthology of flamenco and will soon appear as a book, with all the portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for the portraits led him to take up this idea again two years ago and to realize it as 'portraits of the veterans of sport' ('SportART Project').
Although the concepts of the project 'Flamenco-people' are different, I like to take pictures, get to know them and put me in their state of life, be it for a short moment or a long time.
I think in the field of photography the portrait is the most difficult genre.
You meet or encounter people, personalities you sometimes don't know at all, or they leave you alone for a few minutes to take a photo.
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas.'
The collection of the portraits of the flamenco today entitled `Flamenco-people' is on display in the gallery of El Fotómata, which is located on the street called la calle de la Mata and runs parallel to the street la Alameda de Hércules. You can visit the exhibition until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the Roma he is writing is 'a great agility'.
He does not yet know what the novel's action is and what it is about, but Mario Vargas Llosa constantly tries to advance the project he is working on, a novel with the protagonist Roger Casemant, a nationalist from Ireland who lived in the Congo for twenty years and moved to the Amazon region.
Yesterday, during his presence at the Festival Hay Festival Segovia, the favorite Nobel laureate admitted that the project he was dealing with is 'a great agility' and 'everything points out that he would not have to write the novel'.
"If I had been so well, I would not have done it, but I will do it and hope to end the novel sometime," he concluded his participation in the festival, where the ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged. Within the four days he has seen hundreds of writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people who were in Segovia.
The author of `La ciudad y los perros' was one of the most outstanding personalities at the third festival and made predictions.
Vargas Llosa, who won the premium of the festival Hay Festival and who gave their voice to most of those present, is compared to the old edition of `Our mutual friend' and can be seen in the theater Juan Bravo.
It was presented by Félix Romeo and discovered that he had an audience in front of him, who realized that the Peruvian, who has a wonderful memory and great sense of humor, had not been given enough time to go through everything: how his vocation for literature arose, who want to experience from 'exceptional adventure', from 'joy in reading' and from 'more than before'; how he writes and `disziplin keeps' to complement 'the lack of inspiration', his intensive work with documentations, numerous corrections and revisions that he makes; how Falklands, Víctor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas influenced his vocation and what`memorial images' are the basis for his stories.
The Hispano-American novelist admitted that there is 'no way' of measuring what you can measure and how you know whether books change life, 'but I refuse to believe that the literature is pure entertainment, a fleeting experience', stressed Vargas Llosa, who claims that it 'produces effects' and 'reduces people even more apart', so I asked the writers 'not to leave the light' and 'the responsibility' for his vocation to 'take over'.
At the festival in Pozoblanco, the weather did not play: bullfights were partly out.
After the announced bull fighters found that the ground of the place was in bad condition, the bullfight festival, with which the festival was to be completed in Pozoblanco, was moved to yesterday morning.
The organizer, with the agreement of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to postpone the bullfight festival.
Thus the feast was exposed to unsteady weather, so two out of three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday it rained, so the second planned bullfight festival could not be celebrated.
The Matador group consisted of José Luis Moreno, Curro Días and Juan Bautista, who gradually entered the bullring area.
So there was only a celebration on Friday.
The winner there was Daniel Luque, who cut three ears and triumphed, after whom he had left the passage with pleasure and aesthetics.
On the same evening Alejandro Talavante met two horns and an ear of the bull, which he had succeeded more by galloping than by his bull martial art.
And even worse was El July, who went through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without fame.
After fighting so badly, a large part of the audience responded to his second fight with buh calls.
In Álava, two persons wanted to escape the control of their car loaded with two thousand kilos of Haschish.
Tomorrow: five minutes before ten.
Traffic controls in Ertzaintza, in the town area of Amiñon (Álava).
Two policemen called on the drivers of the car to stop, and then they fled.
It looked like they didn't have to stop with the cargo of more than two thousand kilos of hashish.
The police persecuted her and arrested one of the drivers who was 28 years old, known as A. A. J., as reported by the Ministry of the Interior of the Basque State.
The arrested person was accused of drug trafficking and counterfeiting official documents.
The incident occurred when the officials of the traffic police of the region of Álava had already completed the traffic control on the N-1 and passed through the urban area of Armiñon.
They decided to stop a car to carry out the route control. The driver did not follow the instructions, suddenly increased the speed and tried to escape the control.
The police started the persecution until the car stopped at the edge of the street after a few kilometers. At the moment, the drivers got out of the car to flee a country road to a forest area.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza finally picked up one of the two. In the car, an Iveco Daily, the drug dealers transported 2,178 kilos of Haschisch, which was confiscated by the police.
The front part of the car was loaded with hashish bundles, which were later directed to the exact laboratory analysis and to the weighing of the bundle to other police departments.
In addition, the officials found that the mark was 'double', so that it did not conform to the license number indicated in the car papers, which is why there was an additional arrest for for forgery of official documents.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza continue the investigation to carry out the arrest of the second suspect who, as mentioned above, could flee, but also to determine the origin of the seized drugs.
The 28-year-old A.A. J., arrested, was brought to a police station for consultation and will be presented to the judge in the next hours.
The actress Heather Locklear was arrested for driving under the influence of an unknown drug.
The actress Heather Locklear, known for the role of Amanda in the series Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California for driving under the influence of an unknown medicine.
A witness had observed how in a rather strange way she was trying to get out of her parking gap in Montecito, spokesperson of the California traffic police reported to the magazine 'People'.
The witness told us in detail that after 16:30 a.m., Locklear pushed through the gas pedal and made a lot of noise by trying to move her car back or forward out of the parking gap, and when she drove backwards, she took hold of her sunglasses several times.
A little later, the witness, who had probably not recognized the actress at first, saw that Locklear stopped on a nearby street and left the car.
The witness was the person who notified the emergency service because she had 'apprehensive about Locklear'.
When the police arrived, they found the actress sitting in her car, standing across the street, blocking traffic.
"She seemed to be unorientational," so they took the police to a special drug and alcohol center to take a test.
According to a police spokesperson, the actress showed himself cooperative, excessive alcohol consumption was excluded from the first moment. 'The first observations of the officials resulted, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of an unknown drug', the speaker said.
Locklear was arrested under the suspicion of driving under the influence of an undefined substance that could not be determined and sent to a local detention centre at around 7 p.m.
Two months ago, after treatment, Locklaer was released from the Arizona clinic, where she was treated against anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists that the Andalusian Association of the United Left will be responsible for the case of Silva.
Gaspar Llamazares, the main coordinator of the VL and United Left MP, today has assured that the Regional Association for Education will be the one who will take the decision in the case of the former City Council for Youth and Sport of the City Hall in Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of making business with family members.
'In such cases, I am a great federalist, and the Andalusian organization will be the one who has to take responsibility for this', Llamazares pointed out the way in which the party has to deal with that which has until now sat as a city council in the municipal council of Seville.
Nevertheless, the chairman of the VL defended the necessity of 'transparency' in the possible investigations of the infringements that Silva might have started: 'The VL always insisted that such cases receive maximum transparency'.
With regard to this issue, he stressed that education has a strict ethical code for all public offices.

Inspired by 'Episodios Nacionales' by Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Carci in `Sangre de mayo' is the revised version of the famous Spanish insurrection against the French. This is an admirable film in filmography, with about 15 million euros of investment in filming.
In this way, the Cineast has tried to 'present a lot of personalities and social analysis', which he had always admired at the works of the famous novelist, today Carci explained at the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the beginning of a long list of performers.
`Sangre de mayo' with a film length of more than two and a half hours, will be presented this Friday in cinemas and will later be shown on the telemadrid station as a four-hour miniseries.
José Luis Garci, a great fan of Galdós’ literature, assures that thanks to this filming, his dream of childhood was fulfilled. He owes this to Esperanza Aguirre, who instructed him three years ago from the autonomous community of Madrid to make a memorial film for the second century celebration in Madrid on November 2. Especially because the story is based on `Episodios Nacionalles', he accepted the commission.
The total contribution of 15 million, made by the autonomous community of Madrid for filming, provides Garci, as he added, the 'one-time possibility' with the help of decorations and corresponding clothing the image of 'confused Spain', which chose the wrong leader for the fight, because the people had been left behind by the struggle for independence and under the rule of the Ferdinand of VII.'
However, the Cineast regrets that one could not expect funding like `Alatriste' or `Los fantasmas de Goya' (two times as high as `Sangre de mayo'), so some scenes from the script with Horacio Valcárcel, with which Garci worked almost all his career, could not be filmed.
For this reason, Garci, who was also a film director in `Volver a empezar', has contributed through his usual working methods: he stood on the stage to the actors with whom one must try first before one starts to shoot and for those who had not made casting he appeared to be 'humiliating' and giving respect, 'a part of the career of the film director is to provide help in the theatre and cinema to know what is happening in the cinema industry in which one works.'
Many actors, whom he finds in `Sangre de mayo', have to repeat in front of his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, Oscar candidate in four nominations (of which he won one), is of the opinion and assured that none of the three candidates who this year represent Spain in front of the Academy of Hollywood represents a young generation of Spanish filmography. Neither `Sangre de mayo' nor 'Siete Mesas de billar francés' nor, finally, the selected film `Los girassoles ciegos'.
Garci does not expect any awards for this film.
"In the beginning, you think you're working for the offspring, later you realize that it's just for success, and now you're satisfied if you've produced a movie," explains Garci after more than 30 years of professional activity.
Isabel Bayón recalls the memory of the dancer from Seville Tórtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Seville worships a dancer who also comes from Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia: her father was Catalan (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and the mother of Andalusia (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), she was born in the Triana district and when she was three years old, her family moved to London.
She was a dancer and expert on oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first fighters to emancipate the woman, such as Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was Buddhist, vegetarian and stood for the abolition of the corset, which restricted the free female movement.
The life of this woman, who left her traces of the dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe in the time between the wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón.
'I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this role to me, which seemed impossible to me.'
"We do not try to tell about her life without preserving her Esprit," said the flamenco dancer.
Your dance bases helped me a lot in Flamenco.
'The dance of the butterfly' seemed to me, for example, like Guajira, or 'the dance of the serpent' like Tango.
Her dancing was sensual and I was told that my dancing is also in this aesthetic area', she claims.
The production is expected with two extraordinary collaborations: Miguel Poveda, who will sing for Isabel in one of her performances, as he did in `La puerto abieta'; and with Flamenco master Matilde Coral, who wanted to work with one of her ex-schoolgirls.
`Matilde plays Tórtola, a very mature personality.
I am happy because she agreed to participate in my work, and I feel very honored.'
The production also anticipates musical composition and guitarists Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the vocals of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; with the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa el Viola and the collaboration with the actor Juanfra Júarez, he takes over the role of the companion of the artists who were Divas in whom he repeatedly fell in love.'
This work also tells us in a certain way about the life of this woman, who became known in places as far away as India, the United States or Russia and also throughout Europe, although she usually lived in London.
"I wanted to recall her, because I think she's one of the women who has an enormous influence on a certain epoch and doesn't appreciate her works anymore today and so much less," says Bayón.
The performance takes place today at 20:30 at the theatre Lope de Vega.
The publication of the book `Diario de un poeta recién casado' also includes the Triennial
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of `Diario de un poeta recién casado' in the Saint Stephen's Church (New York), in a place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in 1916, offers a corresponding atmosphere to perform planned activities on behalf of the Andalusian Council for Culture, to celebrate the `Triennial of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' (2006-2008). The aim is to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature and the death of the two.
For example, `the Triennial of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' will be completed with the new edition of this work, with the international congress taking place in New York, with the restoration of the house museum of Juan Ramón Jiménez-Zenobia and with the travelling exhibition `Juan Ramón Jiménez: `Aquelchopo de luz', which was opened in May and after which it was in various places in Andalusia, now reached New York and will be presented in the course of the international congress.
The Andalusian Council for Culture has also received eight hundred copies of `Diario de un poeta recién casado', published by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso. The aim is to make the person and the work of the Andalusian world poet more famous.
The USA can hardly imagine without Paul Newman
`Sometimes God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them.'
This sentence came from the actress Sally Field, who worked with him in 'sensation reporter', and from the then prevailing performance of the American cinema, which was abandoned, from the whole of America to Newman with his enthusiastic performance and followed her.
Now look what it cost him to give the Oscar.
And when he retired in 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
Still, that was a big hit for everyone.
"What one sometimes feels is much more than an expression, and now I have lost a great friend," said Robert Redford crying, "my life and my country were the greatest drowsiness of his life."
No one was afraid to ridicule or exaggerate.
As a 'father' of cinema and fatherland, he died in a sad moment in which fear of terrorists and of the market collapse in which the American self-esteem is in the hopeless search for reasons to regain dignity.
If, in this hard time, only a few people who can be admired remain without virtue, one does not necessarily have to be Luis Cernuda in order to love Paul Newman.
For all, he almost embodied a Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered as many losses as did profits: from the foundation that committed itself to the fight against drugs and founded in honor of his son from the first marriage, who died of overdose, to his own brand of homemade and organic products.
All of this is a gift for the country in which it took a lot of effort to enforce a deadly nutritional culture.
A broad wave of wonderment beats home high over Hollywood without regard to nationalities and nationality.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only a person died, but the whole era.
The Englishman Sam Mendes, director of film and Oscar prize winner, said that work with Newman was no more or no less than the head of his career.
Russell Crowe, the evil boy who came from Australia, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
"The greatest of all of us has left us," confirmed George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today dare to live as Paul Newman lived: to maintain high demands on righteousness, to lead a responsible private life, far from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today's media jungle.
But there's someone who's trying, and Paul Newman was an example of that.
He divorced once and then married Joanne Woodward for fifty years, who he was faithful to, although there were certainly many possibilities not to be.
"Why should I eat a hamburger on the street when I have Filet at home?", he often joked himself.
In heaven he will be proud that on earth his daughters have the same opinion as his fans, which is not necessarily common in America.
'Of all the great roles he played, he was not so proud of those of the faithful husband, of the loving father, of the attentive grandfather and of the philanthropist', they say.
The streets in Madrid are flawed for the Olympic Games.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to organise some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the failure for 2012, it may be 2016.
But I wonder, 'Are we prepared for it?'
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say it's not right!
She was called a perfect street, and according to my assessment, she was the worst street with everything and everything there was.
Of course, it's a lot of nonsense if you were to pay attention to the assessment and I could check it out, that would clearly not have happened.
But, let's go through everything from the beginning.
The nonsense starts with the ticket pick that allows you to go first.
I don't seem to be bad either, but if they already let you go, they should give you everything (including chip to avoid the traffic jams on the road).
I don't think so.
Here they just let you get the ticket (the first nonsense that consists of going there only) and (after an infinite queue) there is the surprise! The T-shirt was only in the size 'S' (a second nonsense because I need the size XL)
Where do we live?
Or is it that after the crisis only small, much cheaper shirts were decided to buy from less fabric?
All right, things like these are a little thing compared to the days on the street.
Apart from the fact that you have to go very early to get the chip, there is already a queue of at least 15 minutes and, moreover, you have to leave the backpack.
Waiting took more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible in the case of a road where 11,000 people are expected.
Finally, as it was to be expected, the road started and we had not left our backpacks before, even if it had once succeeded, but it would be more difficult to get back.
Moreover, in these 40 minutes of waiting after rain, it looked like the temptation to organize a popular uprising and attack the house.
I think tomorrow will certainly have some 500 people inflammation and some like me will not even appear in time at the classification because of this chip I got, I can already think that the outcome has been mismarked.
Of course, if you asked me about a perfect street, I would never think of this road.
So I think we will dream of a city that is well prepared for the Olympic Games for a long time.
Microsoft looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the 'Emerging Technology Conference', organized by MIT, Microsoft has presented the progress of the new image recognition system and the human interaction, a being of artificial intelligence without much intelligence, which, however, is able to perform some primitive tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, it is a route planner to move on the company's campus).The system takes note of what it hears during entertainment.
Thanks to a camera and a form and face face system, this `receptionist' can see how many people in the room are, who they are, and even remember how they were dressed, it can listen and understand the keywords of their entertainment.
It can also be classified among the groups after the discussions.
In the presentation video 'the receptionist' notices a third person, but she understands that this person is not part of the group that is talking to her, and that no company employee is.
She asks if the person wants to visit someone here and answers that she will listen soon.
Everything without the blue screenshot
Impressive
This is certainly the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example, the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week, they spoke very superficially about the strategy change of Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be faster and not have so many integrated programs.
Steve Ballmer noted that if the computers were equipped with the most necessary instead of filling them with commercial garbage, they would work five times faster. Man, Steven, that will only be for the few.
Everything is just one finding when you consider that Microsoft added some feature and `Extras' in Windows versions.
The change of direction is worth changing.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is gradually losing in importance, just like the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the web, that was part of the theory that it was Google's first step to compete with Windows.
Many skillfully pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system, as an indispensable part, will always be necessary so that hardware and software can work at the same time.
The operating system fulfils the function that can be compared to the function of his wife or husband when it comes to telling his mother-in-law something.
That's right.
The system will never disappear, but one must think of his 'death', not as an absolute, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is the confirmation of this idea.
Every time people pay less attention to the operating system, more to the web browser.
The computer is only started to run the Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and every day we spend more time surfing than in the surroundings of the 'Windows'.
What are half of the applications in the computer for?
Less is more
And Windows 7 must be more compact, much more compact than Vista.
Easier, not so excessive, less complicated.
Microsoft's interest is more to integrate its online services, which can eventually become the alternative to Google.
In reality, they need that, without a doubt. I'm bringing a small example of it.
The photo of this place I took in Redmond, in one of the recreation rooms for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month.
A sign is attached to the refreshing beverage machine: `Your Search. Our Future'. It prints a request to use its own tool for online search.
In 2006, an independent study concluded that the 66% of employees at Microsoft, Google, used it for research on the web.
By the way, last week it was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 has been delayed.
It will not appear at the beginning, but at the end of 2009, rather even 2010.
Microsoft is looking for the opportunity to simultaneously bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 to the market.
Every day, the phone turns into a computer.
The Android and the iPhon are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso put it in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio had this brand in 'Blood Diamond' by Edward Zwick, just like Al Pacino in `The Pate' by Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time, it belongs to a well-built priest's clothing.
When we start to list the countless stars appearances, we can return to the image of a very strong man, with a sharp beard that had raised heavy weights in a hiking circus.
Basically, this is a typical male t-shirt made of cotton, sleeveless and waisted.
The English-speaking call it 'tank'. Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles, however, surpasses all other brands.
First of all, because of its great name, although it is called in the narrow circle `Marcel'. Legend tells that the name formation is linked to sport and is derived from Boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of singer Edith Piaf.
`La Marcel' excels all because of its excellent cotton, because of its distinctive unisex cut and is characterized by a small Belgian flag (nearly recognizable) that has these T-shirts as a detail on the neckline.
And beware, the Belgian company focuses not only on the production of `tanks'.
You also have college sweatshirts, boxer retro, cardigans and cashmere, pants made of cotton, T-shirts with stripes, babies, mini shorts
Modelled and comfortable underwear.
Although, it's very bad to use them as underwear.
They're very charming.
'I want to be a young mother; I don't worry about the candidate'
Her great appearance with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz is petite, but full of joy.
At the moment, the siblings are taking their new activity very seriously in fashion.
For Monica, that means much more than for some pretty and rich girls who keep their reputation.
She was in Paris with the promotion of the company Mango, she moved there and also made the presentation of the most important awards in fashion, which sponsors the Spanish fashion house.
Merciful and shy, winner on the short distances.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection for this autumn/winter season, which my sister Penélope and I have designed for Mango, and I also visited the presentation of the second edition of `Mango Fashion Awards' and took part in the dinner to Valentino's honor.
A very intensive working time, which is exciting at the same time.
You work for the Spanish house, what is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for Mango?
My sister, I too am fascinated by the cinema of the 50s and 60s; there we find many ideas.
I would like to go through a city and watch women as they are dressed, as they combine their clothes, I often do.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I believe so, but finally, everything meets in one area and these areas have many similarities.
Since I was a little girl, I was thrilled with the clothes; I always wanted to go to my grandmother to search my aunt's wardrobes and see her clothes.
That was great, almost better than going to a leisure park.
Later, as a dancer, I always tried to pay attention to the clothes.
You know, we dancers like it so much to have our own style in class and at the samples to look into the mirror and feel good at it.
As an actress, when you get the costume, you put yourself in the real role of actors.
Finally, everything is connected, it is so, much respect for the costume designer and her professionalism.
Recently you turned 30, didn't you fall into a crisis?
Oh, my God.
I feel better than ever, than thirty years old I feel good.
I think the woman will be mature, has experience and can enjoy life with less mistakes.
I'm not afraid of my biological clock.
I have done the things I have wanted to do since I was little, and that has given me a lot of inner joy.
So, you think about becoming a mother, don't you?
For a long time I have known that I am a mother, because that demands my body and I want to be a young mother; I do not want to miss it.
As far as the candidate's concerned, I'm not worried.
I will give my child great happiness and raise it with a lot of love.
As far as film art is concerned, you keep in mind the works you took part in and were filmed last year.
That's the same thing, and I'd like them to be presented to the public.
I, as a woman who comes from the theater, am very impatient and restless and wants to have everything at once, which, of course, cannot be immediately.
I very much hope that `La última hora' and `En busca de la tumba de Cristo' will be performed for the first time.
Let's see how they like you.
A few days ago, you appeared on the walk with Naomi Campbell, right?
It's okay, don't say that.
It's not like I went on the run to model.
Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for some time, just called me and invited me to London to participate in a parade for the charity event of her organization 'Women for a better world' and the clothes we show. I know that two clothes from our collection for Mango were auctioned to collect the money for Naomi's NGO.
People don't know Naomi's good heart.
A lot of things are told about them. I, as the one she knows, would tell you they're not right.
Nevertheless, I will support this good thing in which she is involved.
She asked me to participate in the parade for this generous thing, but when she comes and asks me to make a handstand, I will do the same.
To support women in the Third World, whatever is needed.
The drivers, who can fall back due to the alcohol level, will have to install the 'Alcolock'.
The authority orders that the driver who had three official penalties for the alcohol level be installed in his car of this system, which forbids him to start the car in drunk state. If he is alcoholic, then the car does not start.
The initiative was announced last month in June and is already part of the General Prosecutor's Office's report. According to its information, it is a pilot project that will last for a year.
The purpose is to re-socialise the driver, which gives him a course for the re-education of transport behaviour.
In addition to the Public Prosecutor's Office, experience, the Ministry of Transport and the Foundation of the Technical Institute for the Safety of Automobiles will also take part.
According to statistics, between 30 and 75 % of drivers who were shown to be on alcohol-influenced driving more than once were back on the tax.
The 'alcolock' would prevent this, because it is a system connected to the car, it measures the alcohol content in the breathed air and prevents the start of the car when the driver has done alcohol testing; or if an alcohol concentration is determined which is higher than allowed.
It costs more than EUR 1 000, the costs are borne by the person who imposes the penalty.
In this context, a study carried out in the USA in 2007 showed that cars equipped with these devices already prevent up to 65% of the regulatory infringements in the first year following its introduction.
In Spain, it is expected that 115 lives could be saved each year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to tackle this behaviour before it became a crime.
And in order to facilitate their implementation, a legal reform can be implemented in the ordinary way, and yet a reform of the basic law is required, which is necessary for the prosecution process.
The equipment is still available in the Spanish markets, in no business, although it has already been installed in some commercial vehicles and public transport vehicles.
The House of Representatives will vote tomorrow because of the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, which proposes to install this system in school buses, which has already been done in France.
In Mexico and without `peep-toes'
With British punctuality, at 17:40 a.m., the time provided by the program, next to the Presidential Hangars of Benito Juice de México DF Airport, the plane of the Spanish Air Force, with the prince and prince of Asturias, landed.
The sun went down, but their rays were still forced to use the hand as a parasol to see the royal couple leaving the plane.
Directly on the Gangway: the Spanish ambassador and other authorities
A few hours before that, I had asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Prince and Princess of Asturias had visited the city to formalise the official journey.
- Ah, very good, so, you can't take people at the airport at this time you're from here or something.
No, she's the Spanish girl, but she's lived here for a few years.
- Well, very good.
But the Mexican press knows exactly who the prince and the princess of Asturias are and knows the importance of the journey.
There are many who are waiting in the hangar of the airport and on the red carpet, also military protection of 27 Marine soldiers who deliver honorary salve.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in marine blue, and she, the princess, with long hairs swept from the wind, without ordinary 'peep-toes', perhaps she was told that a thunderstorm in DF is expected.
Before entering the hall, they smile and are prepared for the photographers in whom the official sequence awaits.
At the door of the hotel where they are housed, one of the four largest in the city, she is waiting for a reporter from Mexican television, who likes to joke.
The best premium of fashion
Probably there was no more suitable place in the world than Paris to present a premium of fashion and there was probably no significantly outstanding fashion designer and bonvivanten than Valentino.
Mango presents the second edition of the fashion competition `el Bóton-Mango Fashion Adwards' to promote and increase young fashion talents internationally.
This is awarded a price of 300 000 euros.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, yesterday saw her drawings in the mango shop window on Boulevard Haussmann number 54 in Paris and almost cried because of the emotional excitement.
By the way, this is the company's second largest business in Europe and was recently opened. It offers a sales area of 1 335 m2.
The largest store is in London.
So many events have happened that are linked to the fact that you want to thank the fashion designer Valentino for his jury chair at the competition. Everything ended with a luxury dinner in Opera National de Paris.
In the vicinity of many famous people, the board table organized by Mango seemed spectacular.
Nati, with the heavy heart, which was broken by the pain, because his brother died recently, pulled himself together. He put on the suit from the fashion house and put on some jewelry by ELAH that were breathtaking. He held himself at the arm of his son Luis, who is almost two meters tall and has accompanied Valentino at dinner, in his honor.
Andik, the owner and lord of the house of Mango, welcomed the guests and was such a cavalier, so that he ended up with the baron of red shield without jackets, for jackets they borrowed the ladies.
Monica Cruz, hastened to the store and had a pants and a shirt on which she herself modeled, and for dinner she wore a long, black sexy dress. During a night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us a hall for ballet samples, so she was excited, reminded of the old times, grabbed a rod and made a sort of 'grand ride'.
Inés Sastre, did not join the walk through the premises of the palace, but before that she had shown us the photos of her son on the phone.
The next morning we were able to look forward to the presence of Oliver Martínez, a personality that always creates a stormy enthusiasm, and to Jon Travolta, who, after his arrival (with his own bed sheets and towels) at the Hotel Internacional in Paris, asked in advance to have a room without smells.
The stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, la la, that's life.
1001 Council against Stress
There are not 1000, but a possibility more to forget chaotic everyday life.
And even if there are few, all are collected in a book that says how to relax. The book comes into the bookstores on September 30.
The alarm clock is a punishment when it rings at 7 a.m., but even worse seems the idea of getting back into the hectic rhythm that demands the current life.
The office is called the tension and the computer that leads to the back pain.
The stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are not one and not two methods to combat daily exhaustion and the problems of how to switch off from the world of work.
However, the number increases, no more and no less than 1001.
In addition to yoga positions, the classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott presents in the book the entire list of options adapted to the taste and time of each individual.
The work against the stress is called `1001 possibilities to relax' and so the peace that the book conveys comes to the bookstores of the publishing house Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If you think that it is impossible to achieve peace in the areas such as work with the help of personal contacts, this manual disproves such faith.
Furthermore, the methods are offered, how to stay in contact with nature or the 100% natural recipes that lead to relaxation.
If the adrenaline in your veins no longer rises to restore the body's balance and the stress has become a problem, the moment has come to sit down on the sofa, shut down the brain and focus on reading.
Talking in sleep
Some children speak at night
I mean not those who wake up and tell us something that happened the day before, but the children who speak during sleep.
If it happens to you for the first time, at best you will be scared, but in reality it has no meaning.
This is a positive sleep disorder called speaking in sleep.
It is quite common, especially among children and young people.
Certainly, more than one of you was told that you spoke at night.
This phenomenon may occur occasionally (one time in life, for example, during the high fever), or regularly (every day, once a week, once a month), the next day the child can remember nothing.
There is no reason to cause this phenomenon.
Often, relationships with other phenomena are sought in sleep, such as nightmares, panic at night, enuresis noctura (bedding at night), talking in sleep, but there is no reason for that.
As we mentioned earlier, it may be due to very high fiber, stress situations or overload.
Anyway, this is a little researched phenomenon.
The frequency with which it occurs is very variable.
It may be that you are speaking quietly in individual words, whispering or it can be quite an opposite (screaming, crying, long discussions ).
In cases where the expression is very intense, it is recommended that the child be observed and consulted with a specialist to see if there is a problem that causes fear and thus arises.
We have said that it is a positive disorder, so it is not treated, whether it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, with the sleep apnoea or with the stress).
What you can do is to carry out a series of simple prevention measures:
Try not to excite the child before sleeping.
So, choose quiet play for the child and avoid stressful television programs that are terrible and a little too wild.
For the nervous children who are recommended for relaxation, relaxation methods can be used to help them get a certain inner peace.
This helps the child to sleep quietly.
Once speaking in sleep, try to maintain calm.
Remember that it is harmless for the child and the next day it will not be able to remember anything that happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake it up.
This is useless, for the child is unconscious, so you will tear it out of sleep.
Although the child speaks, it sleeps, so it rests.
Remember, if it appears frightened after a few appearances, it is recommended to be advised or to find out the reason the child is afraid.
If they understand what it says (which is not so usual), the child does not put pressure on them to carry out a hearing and to obtain more information.
Thus you will not be able to achieve anything with it, because when the child sleeps, it is unconscious and cannot think about it.
Moreover, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it dreams and why it says so, therefore be careful with the interpretation of the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Maybe it doesn't tell the child that you hear that at night and know his secrets.
Not even as a joke.
That's what causes a lot of fear.
So, don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's a moment that takes only a few minutes.
Illhausen ... at last
After a long thirst track, Illhäuseren is finally on track again.
Without much effort, the yellow-blacks played numerous goals and managed to put one of them into practice, thus winning the game.
The pace of this encounter, in which the attackers struggled to show their ability, was not very high.
After a first attack by the guest captain Kauffmann, whose distance shot was just past the angle, Illhäuseren was to dominate the game with ease, and it succeeded alternately only Fonderflick with a remote shot, then brain with a high pass, and Romain with a shot with the foottip to challenge the defense of Denmark.
The opposing team blocked in the middle of the field and left only the lively Riahi at the top of the storm.
The beginning of the second half-time should be decisive with the first two tor chances fought by Riahi and Temporale, and immediately thereafter with the first goal for the Illhäuser by Marais, who was just right to accept a ball that had been averted in a first attempt by Diebold.
But the illustrious goalkeeper shouldn't be able to enjoy his luck for long and be sent to the bank about twelve minutes later, which meant that his teammates had to continue to play down in numbers.
However, Denmark did not take advantage of this, and did not face any major problems that could be solved by an Ilhaeusian Elf, who only retreated a little to 'compress their defense', except in the last few seconds of the game, in which the ball passed very close to the latte after a big mess.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before he flies to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make another detour to Brittany.
In view of the determined attitude of fishermen who blocked the access to several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the French President decided to find himself in the port of Guilvinec in Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet with their representatives.
The latter promised to receive him 'with a constructive spirit', and hoped that he would come with 'concrete proposals'.
The President's visit takes place at the same time as a General Assembly of the Crisis Committee, which was set up by the Breton fishermen to enforce measures in view of the extreme rise in the price of diesel, which has reached a record value of an average of more than EUR 1.14 per litre.
According to Elyséepalast's press spokesman, David Martinon, 'the President will discuss with them possible solutions to help their companies to become competitive again, and to ensure the working conditions and payment of seamen'.
Sarkozy is expected by the fishermen with determination.
Tuesday morning they led in Morbihan and Calvado's protest marches, which caused congestion of nearly ten kilometers in length.
Quiberon's sailing port was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-île did not stop.
The Quiberon peninsula was delimited with a lock.
Already on Monday, the sailors expressed their determination by burning tires and pallets in front of the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient from the early morning, while demonstrations were held in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement extended to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the Channel, such as Sables d'Olonnes, in Vendée, where the catchers did not go out, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the maneuvers of the merchant ships.
The fishermen from Turballe and Croisic in Loire-Atlantique dissolved the blockade of the significant total refinery in Donges in the evening.
The Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the meeting on Wednesday in the Ministry before deciding on possible measures.
In fact, the crisis committee in Guilvinec must decide on the reactions to the movement and its participation in the discussion planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Bretonian fishermen do not want to be represented by those responsible for the National Fisheries Committee who have not supported their movement.
'The strike will continue', because 'the fishermen will not give in' and 'don't want to go to Paris', said Liliane Cariou, President of the Lorient's Fisheries Committee.
The professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on diesel currently cost the litre about 50 cents, but they think that the profitability limit of a boat can only be reached with diesel for less than 30 cents per litre.
Paul Newman the Wonderful
The unforgettable actor from `Butch Cassidy and the Kid' died at the age of 83 due to the consequences of cancer in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, and Sam Mendes have taken their leave from the cinema legend and the engaged actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer holds its 2008 delivery forecasts
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer expects 215 aircraft delivered this year, despite the imminent recession, as a threat to the world economy.
Embraer, the world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer, confirmed his delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 aircraft supplied by President Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer supplied 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer is hoping for much from the Chinese market, especially for its planes of the size of 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider issuing more than 15% of its assets
According to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times, the insurer American International Group, which was financially supported by the US Monetary Authority, is considering issuing more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the 85 billion dollars that were set aside to him.
AIG is willing to charge the sale of a large part of its business, beyond its international life insurance system and its pension provision in the United States.
According to the FT, the board of directors of the AIG Sunday evening met to check possible sales.
The AIG could not be confirmed.
Among the assets from which AIG might separate, its aircraft leasing branch International Lease Financial Corp., its share of 59% in the reinsurance Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its property assets and its investments in the Private Equity, the FT further explains.
With regard to these sales, no final decision was taken, the FT continues.
AIG must quickly make sales to repay the loans granted to it by the Federal Reserve, including the risk that the US authorities will receive 80% of their capital and that the current shareholders will be lost to the same extent.
Analysis Historical Paris of the meeting Historical morning meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported on Monday, after the Chamber of Representatives had rejected Paulson's plan to rescue the banks, a historical case of prices: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss of nearly 800 points, and the Naday 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dropped by 777.68 points to 10,365.45 points.
As regards the points, the strongest case of its history (684.81 points) had previously been recorded on 17 September 2001, date of the decline in trade following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
According to the final discharge figures, the Nadag index, mainly technical, fell by 199.61 points to 1.983.73, and the widespread Standard&Poors 500 index fell by 8.81% (106.85 points) to 1.106.55 points.
After the unexpected rejection of the bank rescue plan by the Chamber of Deputies, which was intended to restore some stability in the markets, Wall Street collapsed, which had already been hit at the beginning of the quarter.
With 228 votes against and 205 against, the MEPs refused the financial secretary Henry Paulson the funds he had requested.
Nearly two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
"Here a bad picture is put in circulation, which represents the Congress as unable to accept a plan," said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
'This shows how much the market counted on this plan', added it, and fears that a project adopted in several days will be 'too late'.
'If the project is actually condemned to failure (...), it will be the task of the Fed (the US central bank, notes) and other central banks to deal with the crisis, which would further limit the credit conditions', warned Brian Bethune, head of the economy at Global Insight.
And Ms. Piegza stressed, stressing even more the feeling of extreme urgency, 'that every day that disintegrates brings the ruin of a financial enterprise to the United States 'with itself'.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, the U.S. authorities planned to buy up Wachtovia's banking operations through its competitor Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly accelerated and thus led to emergency measures in favour of banks in the United Kingdom, in the Benelux countries, Iceland and Germany, a sign that markets are facing not only an American but a global crisis, added the analyst of the FTN Financial.
The market for basic goods has grown strongly.
Within ten years the revenues of the public funds have decreased from 3,632% to 3,827%, and the revenues within 30 years last night from 4,161% to 4,357%.
Obama, winner by points in the first TV dual
After the first debate of the two candidates for the White House of Friday followed another one to find out who came out as a winner, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, for the election of both Republicans and Democrats, the QGs announced their own victory in this television dual, which should be pursued by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCain's performance, although quite remarkable, was not "brilliant" enough to enable him to stop his decline in the polls five weeks before the presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, of which an opinion poll was published on Saturday, according to Obama with five points in the front (49% to 44% for McCain), is of the opinion that the democrat is clearly making the better figure.
For the still undecided voters, i.e. those on whom it now depends, Obama emerged with 39% as winners from the polls, while according to a CBS survey, 25% of them see McCain as winners.
Obama should be able to confirm his lead on Thursday with the good performance expected from his competitor Joseph Biden at first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin.
It would be a mistake to underestimate them.
She's got good instincts, but she warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
Seventy-year-old McCain did not stop putting his indisputable experience in the field of foreign policy to the fore, clearly stressing the 'nativity' of his opponent on these issues that were the focus of this first television dual.
`Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that...', he stressed several times.
"I do not believe that Senator Obama has the necessary experience and knowledge to become President," he also assured.
A point of attack that has been preached in the Republican elections since yesterday.
Obama himself stressed that he represents the future.
He expressed himself briefly and precisely, without being taken out of the version.
He put his ability to make good decisions and renew the image that the world has of the United States.
'McCain has still not understood, Obama has, on the other hand, already', this weekend, opposed a democratic campaign in which Republicans were accused of not having grasped the full extent of the crisis that burdened on the 'American of the street'.
'During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot of things to say about me, but nothing about you', Obama praised 20 000 people yesterday who had gathered in a stream of rain on the occasion of an election event in North Carolina.
He did not even mention the words 'medium-sized' or 'workers'. 'The financial crisis gives Obama, whom the Americans consider most suitable, a clear advantage even on the edge of the abyss to save the economy.
'The next week could be a decisive turning point', estimated yesterday by influential democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton government, compared the 'good economic instincts' Obamas to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the democratic candidates, the current crisis is 'the final judgment of an eight-year bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain'.
After stressing once again that he would even manage to reduce taxes for 95% of Americans despite fluctuations on Wall Street, the Illinois Senator pointed out that the country's priority was to create a possible energy independence and promote renewable energy, along with the introduction of a health insurance system.
McCain, on the other hand, wanted to build a plant from 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates gave thought to the questions raised in the plan to save the financial market over 700 billion dollars (470 billion euros), which was adopted last night by Congress and which is extremely unpopular to the people.
'Did you notice that there was an election in Minsk?'
Young people and oppositionally demonstrated Sunday evening on the main square of the Belarusian capital in order to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening since the closing of the polls at Minsk's market square to protest against the fraudulent nature of the parliamentary elections.
Although no result had yet been announced, many young people had come to demonstrate against the power of Alexander Lukachenko: 'The dictator should resign'.
Some admit that they didn't even choose at all: 'What good is it if they do what they want with my voice anyway', says a youth.
They do not believe that the regime, which has shown itself in the best light to foreign observers in order to resume negotiations with the European Union, is ready to take a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the non-giving of visas for 40 leading Belarusian personalities and the imposition of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered clean by observers.
According to the opposition, it wasn't them.
"We were excluded from the electoral commissions and our observers were not allowed to take part in the counting," lamented Yuri Potemkin, press spokesperson of the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous merger of twelve parties.
This is a cosmetic change, stresses Alexander Milinkievich, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the Pro-Europe movement, because it is important who counts the votes, and with us that is the executive.
If Members of the opposition move into Parliament, then because they have been appointed, and not elected.
But their entry into Parliament can mean broadcasting time on television, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals. '
The opposition is therefore guilty of interfering in the political game, because 'the dialogue with the European Union must be opened.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, gets into a crisis and we do not reform, we are in danger of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
Well, we want to be independent.
The opposition fears that the Security and Cooperation Organisation in Europe, which has followed the elections, will not recognise the election as valid.
It emphasises that the voter participation figures appear too high and that the extension of the voter's voter's voter's voter's voter's voter's voter's voter's voter's 26% in advance has pave the way for any kind of manipulation.
`Have you noticed that an election has taken place?', asks the leader of the Social Democrats Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
No one was in the polls.
And there will be a maximum of five members of the opposition in Parliament, those most likely to be in line with the government's ideas.'
The silence of the night falls again over the Oktoberplatz.
On television, President Lukachenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission congratulate themselves on their success.
Doctrine - From the blood that got safe again
Hema-Quebec celebrated the 10th anniversary of its foundation yesterday, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to rejoice, because Hema-Quebec has become one of the most secure and efficient blood banks in the world.
And above all, it regained public confidence, which had been severely shaken by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As you know, the national blood reserves administered by the blood service of the Canadian Red Cross were contaminated with the HI virus and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In view of this drama and public dissatisfaction, the Canadian Government in February 1994 launched a public investigation, led by Judge Horace Krever, aimed at bringing light to the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy, and to draw up guidelines to prevent a further disaster of this kind.
While Judge Krever was still reluctant to give his report, at that time several provinces set up a committee whose goal was to develop a new system for the administration of blood canning in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this mission.
According to the reports by Gélineau and Krever, two blood banks were established in Canada: Hema-Quebec, which is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian blood company to provide the other provinces and the two territories.
`1998, when Hema-Quebec started her work, hardly 38% of people had confidence in the blood-conservation system in Quebec, Dr. Décary recalls.
The situation was discouraging.
By the enormous efforts to improve the safety of the blood canned and by working in this area during the following years, we have regained public confidence," she says, before proudly stressing that in early 2008 almost 94% of Quebec's population had confidence in Hema-Quebec.
However, Dr. Décary keeps in mind that 'confidence is something extremely fragile'.
Since its foundation on 28 September 1998, Hema-Quebec has acted in accordance with the principle of caution.
At that time, we experienced the presence of numerous cases of the human form of cattle insanity in Europe, a new type of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, tells this woman who has been in charge since its founding in 1998.
And we didn't have the slightest idea if this disease could be transmitted over the blood.
So we called for one of the main guidelines of the Krever and Gélineau reports, according to which exclusion measures are applied if one does not know this and if a disease only progresses slowly, as it appears to be the case with the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is expressed by a degeneration of the brain, which inevitably leads to death.
So in April 1999, no blood was taken from persons who had been in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
Well, a few years ago, it was no doubt demonstrated that this disease was transmitted over the blood.
Thus, this event has shown us that the principle of caution that we used has quite a meaning.
In 1999, a much more accurate technique for the detection of HIV appeared on the market: the nucleic acid tests (NST), which enable the virus to be detected directly in the donor's blood, and not that of the antibody against the virus, as was the case with the tests used so far.
The NST allowed to shorten the incubation period that takes place between the time when the person was infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected by our techniques in the blood, explains the specialist.
This time could be reduced to less than a week.
Thus, the risk that certain donors might be infected without knowing it, and one could not see it, was significantly reduced.
These improvements allowed a significant reduction in the risk of transmission of AIDS via blood transfusion.
Today, one out of 12 million people is in danger of getting HIV-infected blood.
In other words, this means that you have to distribute 12 million blood cans before someone is infected with HIV.
Since Hema-Quebec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood canneds each year, it would take more than 24 years for a case in which HIV was transmitted via a blood container.
I believe that these days you can feel comfortable getting a blood transfusion or writing to restore health," says the director of Hema-Quebec.
`Our challenge for the next ten years is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen can get into the system.
Only last year on the island of Réunion did the Chikungunya virus show up, which, like the Westnil virus, is transmitted by insects over the blood.
We have to monitor continuously," Dr. Décary continues before she emphasizes that besides a safe supply, Hema-Quebec also needs to provide sufficient supply.
The need is increasing because the population is ageing.
As cancer control treatments are more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing population also has an impact on the blood donor network, which on average includes only 3% of Quebec's blood donation population.
Every healthy person who is 18 years of age or older who meets the fitness criteria can donate blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average, 14% of those who supply their blood are not accepted, for example because they are suffering from AIDS or malaria, and those who have traveled to a country where malaria is spread are excluded from blood donation for one year.
With this 3%, we are able to obtain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Lack of supplies are very rare.
But you have to renew the members of this donor network when they get older and can no longer donate blood.
It is difficult to convince people to donate blood, but above all to keep them and to get them to become regular donors.
Life is so hectic these days that one rarely finds the time to spend an hour in blood donation,' says Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of 297 million dollars, Hema-Quebec not only delivers blood cannings but also human tissues, including bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs and skin, which is used almost exclusively for serious fire injuries.
These tissues are examined, processed and frozen before they are stored in Hema-Quebec, which also manages the only public cord blood bank in Quebec.
In the umbilical cord, once considered biomedical waste, there is rich blood on stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
'A few weeks ago, we celebrated the storage of our thousandth umbilical cord blood sample, and we plan to decrease more than a thousand annually.
"We should probably start making it available for transplants at the beginning of next year," explains Dr. Décary, who describes this program of umbilical cord blood loss as very popular.
'Many mothers are convinced not to have access to it', because Hema-Quebec lacks the means to offer this complex and costly program in all Quebec hospitals.
Soccer - Impact in the semi-final
Montreal's impact yesterday, thanks to a 3 to 1 victory (4 to 3 with all goals) against the Seattle sounders, has qualified for the semi-final round of the first USL league's finals in the Saputo Stadium, which included the total goal ratio.
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro shot the decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After a first half-time without a goal for both the one and the other side, the midfield players David Testo and Rocco Plancentino landed the other hits for the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who put Matt Jordan in the way of the Sounders.
Remember that at the first game of the pre- and replay series on Friday Impact, the Starfire Complex in Tukwila in a suburb of Seattle had brought in a 2 to 1 defeat.
In the semi-final, Impact will measure with the Whitecaps from Vancouver.
On Saturday evening Thunder was able to balance a 3 to 1 deficit by a 4 to 3 win, but the Whitecaps still entered the semifinal round with a total goal ratio of 5 to 4.
Impact will probably have to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be defined today.
In short - Siegestor by Kovalev
The number one trio of the Canadian team is ready to start the season.
Last night, the unit formed by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Platanec and Andrej Kostitsyn led the attack on the Panthers from Florida with a storm fire, leading to a 3 to 2 victory.
Kostitsyn, the star of the encounter, shot a goal, Platanec delivered two templates, and Kovalev turned a pass into this victory game, the fourth of the tricolors into six preparatory games.
Kovalev won by shooting the only goal of the whole shooting.
'I'm not ready yet, the Russian warned.
I need another game to make me feel comfortable.'
`In the first half of the year, he was too focused on it too much, said Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He received stormy applause. "
Charest sits on the north
The Prime Minister does not rule out launching elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the General Assembly of the Liberal Party ended, Jean Charest went to Jean-Talon in Quebec yesterday, where the new Health Minister Yves Bolduc (left) is trying to be elected in today's partial election.
'Move the course of our last big border in the north': This is the long-term goal that Jean Charest presented yesterday with visual resources at the General Assembly of the liberal party of Quebec in Levis, following the guidelines.
During his lecture, a kind of picture mill was projected behind him.
On three huge screens spectacular pictures of hydroelectric power stations, mines, viewed from Quebec in 'Google Maps', maps, etc.
Great funds as during the election period.
In the face of the press, the Prime Minister refused to rule out holding the elections this autumn, even though he had announced that his calendar was very full.
The 'Plan Nord' is the fourth element of a 'Vision' that the Prime Minister is supposed to have for Quebec, namely that of a 'new economic area', which provides for an agreement with France regarding workers, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Although it has recently been mentioned frequently in the speeches of the Prime Minister, the opening of the north - the northern region on the 49th latitude - has never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North was 'a jewel with enormous potential', but did not mention a date, a sum of investments or precise priorities for the upcoming projects.
At most some prospects of what could be worked on: water, forest, especially in the mining sector, favoured by the growth of emerging economies and the renewal of public infrastructures.
According to Mr. Charests, the North has 'nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds'.
This ` twice as big as France'` is in our vicinity, is in Quebec.
It is not only near us, it is within us', he stressed, as to show clearly that he is seeking to achieve a national incubator's dream.
Quebec has grown very much through its connection with the north, he stressed: the road to gold in Abitibi, the technique of Quebec, the James Bay.
'It belongs to us, it's our future,' he added after having taken a theatrical break to look at the huge map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes part of Labrador, which Quebec has always called for, the Prime Minister told the press.
This is a traditional attitude that all governments pursued.
There is a borderline on which there has been no agreement for a very long time, if the opportunity is given, I will take this attitude back on behalf of the government,' he said.
Moreover, 'with climate change we need to rethink our vision from the north', he explained and talked about the northwest pass, which will be possible all year round due to the ice melt.
Against this new geopolitical background, the Prime Minister believes that it is almost a duty to occupy this area.
And the inhabitants of the land, the natives and the Inuits?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would deal with them very carefully, and that they would benefit from this project, especially the boys.
Two former ministers of different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pecist Deputy of Ungava) have already begun discussions with about thirty communities.
A ministerial committee led by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (transport and land resources) occupies an important place, has taken up the work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large assembly, 'not necessarily a summit', but an opportunity where 'you will create a common vision'.
The development of the North will also be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be discussed, regulated and environmentally friendly, he promised.
Jean Charest described this 'Vision' as if it were a continuation of the liberal prime minister who was in office before him.
Like the liberals who were in office before us, we have changed our minds to transform the challenges into new changes in growth and development.
This was one of the repeatedly raised themes of the weekend, which was opened on Friday with a large cocktail party to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's takeover of the party leadership.
One of the decisions adopted is to rename the Beauharnois power plant into Adélard-Godbout-Staudamm.
'From Godbout, who created Hydro-Quebec, about lecture that has reached the silent revolution and the nationalization of water electricity, to Bourassa, who made the James Bay, our party always knew to determine the future,' explained Jean Charest.
To the press he referred to another, this time conservative project, namely the program `Roads to the North' by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
With regard to the hydropower dam Eastmain1a-Ruper project, Mr Charest stressed that its start-up was scheduled for 2012.
"That remains among us, but I intend to be there," he entrusted to his party members what caused those applause storms.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and certainly also in 2009, has not yet ruled out the possibility of holding an election this autumn, which is possible from the law.
He stressed, however, that his schedule was full, especially because of a mission of the Community Council in China and a summit between Quebec and New York.
The general meeting of the weekend provided the liberal party leader with a platform of nationalist plans, especially from the 'constitutional objectives', which were clearly accepted: The PLQ particularly demands the recognition of the 'speciality of Quebec' in the Constitution.
It also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Council of Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications, and to have a veto regarding the decisions taken in Quebec.
The opposition included the guidelines of the North Plan with scepticism.
The head of the Québécois party, Pauline Marois, has brought back the policy for the development of the North-du-Quebec, which the Landry government introduced in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, refrained from applying it.
If she had done so, 'we would have gone much further today', Ms. Marois judged alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election is taking place today) Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has expressed its support for the government's adoption of a North Plan.
'But what we want is that this will not only be a great idea,' said Party leader Sébastien Proulx, representing Mario Dumont, who is returning from the holiday today.
Letters - A deprived country
Mr. Vic Toews, ex-'Justiz' Minister (which irony) in Harper's cabinet was the one who allowed himself to say last summer about Louise Arbour that she was a 'disgusting' to Canada.
This woman, who has waged an unending struggle for justice and deserves all our admiration to cover with shame, says as much about the people around the Prime Minister as about Stephen Parker himself.
We are dealing here with a government which, as the only one from all the countries concerned, has not brought home its countryman in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that does not even take into account that Omar Khadr was still a youth when things happened to him.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, breaks its word and has a child soldier fighting there under inhuman conditions.
The only one who can go down to a judicial parody to assess the defendant's guilt.
Let us remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of Canadian Lawyers are calling for Omar Khadr to come home to get a fair trial in Canada.
It is precisely this government that closes its eyes before the torture: she is not interested in the fact that after so many years of agony, a young adult will surely be forever mentally broken.
We are not yet aware of this, but we are currently experiencing a insidious circumcision of our rights, our freedom and our 'democracy', this word that Harper is constantly carrying like a flag in front of him, and that sounds so inescapable from his mouth.
The time has come, therefore, when there is no more morality: one can arbitrarily abuse, torture and arrest a Canadian citizen, according to the opinion of a head of government, who is still supported only by the minority (may he belong to the minority after 14 October).
Many voters believe in finding their salvation in a party preaching virtue, law and order, but they do not see that this government has renounced what made up the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr Toews, lies in this ransom, and nowhere else.
Free Opinion - The Orwellian Speech by Barrick Gold
In her September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter by Patrick J. Garver, Deputy Director General of the Barrick Gold Mine in Canada.
It confirms, and pursues an orwellian logic that the world's largest gold-gathering society sought to defamatory more than six million against three authors and a small, medium-sized publishing house, with the aim of opening a 'public transparent debate'.
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, then they do not judge the truth, especially not in the case of slanders, but on the law.
As expected, this fundamental difference was completely concealed by Mr Garver.
For Barrick Gold, the best way to have a public debate is to drive everyone into the ruin that dares to represent one of the opposite views.
No matter how the process goes out, the authors and editors of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defenses and fight with very uneven weapons against an army of lawyers who are paid out of the almost inexhaustible pockets of the gold mine.
The tactics in these uneven struggles are often to ruin the defenders in order to force a common settlement that makes the opposite mouth dead and also deters anyone who dares to discuss the question again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she should have presented her view of things before public opinion.
In contrast to what is going on and going on in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, discussions are usually held in Canada through the exchange of ideas and not by bats.
So it would have been enough if the gold mine had revealed its books and files and opened up a real debate, through the newspapers, media, publications and funding of independent testing teams, which could have brought this question to light.
But Barrick Gold seems to have no confidence in public opinion and wipes out the petitions and letters to support the authors of Noir Canada with a hand movement.
Could Mr Garver perhaps explain how he can at the same time ask for a 'public debate' and, at the same time, disregard the opinions of this public?
This word in the world of vice-presidents seems to include only the generously paid lawyers, and not the community of all Canadians; a very beautifully narrow view of the term.
In a democracy, even slanderers have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - is that the public, which supports the authors and editors of Noir Canada, is doing so mainly because it rejects the brutal attitude of the gold mine.
This public is willing to listen and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not within a framework that many perceive as grievances (in the course of the 'public debate', Barrick Gold has just made a request to the authors of Noir Canada in which they demand that they no longer use this term...).
Apart from Mr Garver's surreal speech, Barrick Gold's complaint is a direct attack on freedom of academic research and the discovery of truth, which is fundamental to every democratic society.
It completely denys the right to quote credible sources and discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible in a country like Canada to explore and discuss topics that are not pleasing to the rich companies of this world, who else can do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could lead it by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to answer.
The university environment we belong to has long been able to handle debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's disproportionate complaint clearly shows that, contrary to what she pretends, she has no desire for a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the university world, as well as for the public debate, and it is time for governments to take measures that limit this kind of unjustified action.
Rescue for Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans understand themselves
The Bush administration and the senior Congressmen, Republicans and Democrats alike, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the most comprehensive economic rescue plan since the Great Depression in the 1930s.
The new version of the plan over 700 billion US dollars, which is intended to stop the financial crisis that has shaken Wall Street for months, is still to be adopted by the two Congress Chambers.
The main content is: better control of Members of Parliament over the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of public funds used, new orders to limit the number of homes spent on late payments, and the right to monitor the salaries paid to the management staff of the assisted companies.
American Finance Secretary Henry Paulson, President of the Nancy Pelosi Chamber of Deputies, and the representatives of the Republicans present at the negotiations, Senator Judd Gregg, announced yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, the good news, after a two-day negotiation marathon.
"We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be market-effective," said Henry Paulson, representative of Bush administration.
"All was done to protect the real economy and the American people from the course crisis on Wall Street," said the democrat.
"This is the fundamental point: If we don't do this, the trauma, chaos and the unrest in the daily lives of the Americans will be enormous," said the Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had accelerated over the last two hours, because of fear of the effect that a new failure would have on the mood of investors.
The deadline agreed was the opening of the market this morning.
The two U.S. presidential candidates, who were only recently involved in the negotiations, were more of a supporter of the agreement, but without failing to express their dissatisfaction at having to meet them in this extreme way.
The democratic Senator Barrack Obama insisted on the addition of certain provisions to the agreement, especially those to enable owners to keep their homes, and those relating to the salaries of the management staff of the undertakings rescued by the State.
'If one asks taxpayers to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of certain persons, that is not what one could congratulate.
But these measures are necessary," he explained on the American television channels.
When asked on another station if he would vote in favour of the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain replied: 'I would like to know the details first, but I hope so.
`The principles I have read show that this is one thing that we will all have to digest, and with which we will be able to move forward.
The option not to do anything at all is simply not acceptable," he said.
The 700 billion dollar plan is geared towards the money of taxpayers
It comes 14 months after a crisis caused by the placing of a real estate bubble, which initially led to the collapse of risky mortgage loans (subprime) before it expanded to other forms of more widespread bonds (PCAA), and finally to a freezing of the financial power and the ruin of banks and money institutions.
It was a group of Republican Members who failed the first attempt to reach agreement last week.
Since the Democrats accepted that certain 'poisonous' assets of societies in distress should only be secured by the government and not purchased, they believe that the dead end is to escape.
In order to complete the perspective for all in Congress, one has also added an order stating that if the government were to make losses with this programme within five years, it would be able to raise new taxes in order to recover its capital.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion, to which another 100 billion may be added, if the President considers it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion must be approved by Congress in a new vote.
In return for his help, Washington receives shares in the supported companies that bring him dividends in the case of profits, and which it can sell again when the storm has passed.
The Federal Government will have the opportunity to stop the confiscation procedures relating to the apartments linked to the real estate loans covered by this plan and also to set time limits for the repayment and repayments paid to the management staff of the companies concerned.
The developers of the plan would like the Chamber of Deputies to vote on it today, and the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will get green light.
In fact, yesterday there were more votes against this project, both from the Republicans and from the Democrats.
"Obviously Washington doesn't understand us," said Republican Scott Garett, member of the Chamber's Financial Commission, to his voters.
Yes, we have a big financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not those who are asking taxpayers to pay the cashier'.
Democratic MP Brad Sherman, head of a group in Congress called 'the Caucus of the Skeptics', presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred excellent economic professors, including three Nobel Prize winners, wrote to us to tell us: We ask Congress not to be pressured, and to consider carefully what way to go," he said yesterday.
At the same time, we in Europe were once again given the evidence that this is a global crisis.
At an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for EUR 11.2 billion (16.3 billion US dollars).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank announced BNP Paribas that it would refrain from buying up its competitor, who has been in great difficulty since she lost 2 billion euros ($2.9 billion) in the crisis due to risky real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
'This is not a lost money, said Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
To compensate, we are given a right to vote and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what the savers and households appreciate, now that uncertain times are announcing.'
During this time, on the other side of the sleeve canal, the British government was just in the process of overcoming another bank in distress caused by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all current loans from Bank Bradford and Bringley, of which over 41 billion (US$75.5 billion) from real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy up the UK bank's branches and customer accounts.
After Northern Rock, Bradford and Bringley are the second bank to be the British government since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of a dedicated icon
His beauty with the azure eyes was for a long time his trump, no one would say his weakness.
Was the American actor freed from the narcissistic mirror with the charming smile?
Yes and no.
His sensitivity, sensitivity, and obvious talent may as well have kept him away from a position of power that brings the truly terrible monsters to the world.
But what a long-term runner!
On Friday at the age of 83, Paul Newman, who died of lung cancer on his ranch in Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of the American cinema of his golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, to whom he resembled and for whom he had been a kind of rival on the canvas for a long time, more careful in his acting, certainly also more fragile, but just as an apostle of freedom and the explosion of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often produces wonderful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 as the son of a German Jew and a Hungarian mother.
From its European roots, one of the glorious faces of the American dream should arise.
Without excessive ego, extremely high quality feature.
Because he reflected an entire country that was in love with the self-made man, in the fighters injured in the Pacific war, who studied acting art in Yale at the beginning of the 1950s and then visited the Actor's Studio in New York before he had success at the theater, on television and soon in cinema.
This man, who fought for civil rights, was also the driver, who was in 1979 in the 24-hour race of Man's second, and also a sex symbol, although he lived in a role model relationship with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With it also disappears the unknown facets of this mysterious, restrained, committed star, who is hypersensitive to the glamour of the show business, whose mystery you will never solve completely.
A decent man, in the purest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newman put the film lovers in Taumel this weekend, while on the dark screen of the memories all his great roles were played.
More than half a century of American film art in constant change moves by with him.
Then again the charming cowboy from "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) comes to mind, and the young man who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in Die Katze on the hot sheet roof, which was filmed by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
There will be a much shorter memory (1990) awakened to his sensitive Mr. Bridge, who at his old age is disturbed by a wedding that did not fulfill all her promises.
So many other Paul Newmans were there in the course of history.
This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Somebody Up There Likes Me (A Handful of Dirty) by Robert Wise, a role that was thought for James Dean, was resumed after his death and made the Newman well known in 1956.
This sympathetic Ganove in the outstanding The Sting (Der Clou), which was awarded the Oskar for the best film in 1973.
As a bitter and vengeful billiard player in the wonderful The Hustler by Robert Rossen (1961),
This face through the times, that's what he was.
He's still here.
In his CV, epochs unite.
The youth knows him above all from the cult film Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the little orthodox coach of an ice hockey team.
His fans found him again in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the brothers Coen.
With a final role in 2003 as godfather of the Irish Mafia in Road to Perdition of Sam Mendes, the circle closed.
Unlike several cinema legends who have withdrawn from the film world early enough, Newman should stay in the saddle for a long time, betraying Hollywood, his assets, his pomp and his concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humor, as a living challenge to the 'underplaying' when he judged his all too expressive performance.
The Metier was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the roles flowed for a long time.
However, he played rare Sunnyboys as an outsider: neurotics, alcoholics, swindlers, or desperate people, with whom he perfectly portrayed his slipping and reflected his rebellion.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown sides of his true sensitivity.
His Rachel, Rachel of 1968 (after the novel of Canadian Margaret Laurence) with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, drew a fine women's portrait full of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott by an overdose, dedicated his 1984 film Harry and Son, a work full of sensitivity and sadness.
In the flood of honors that occurred yesterday about Newman egross, his close friend and former armaments companion Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said very much: 'His present has improved my life and this country.'
Generousness and joy of life were essential characteristics of the deceased actor.
Apart from his legendary career, a great advocate of civil rights, environmental protection and independent cinema, an opponent of Hollywood, is now going to go.
We have often seen him standing with his foot in bowls full of vinaigrette, in sauces, pastries or other foods, and this was considered quite tasteless, although at first we found it funny.
The profits from his sales nevertheless flowed to his foundation for children in need.
Instead of resting on his myth, Newman committed himself to the shot.
He left his five daughters a letter with these sentences: `Always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was an honor to be here. '
And for us, it was an honor to be able to pursue the life of such an intelligent and generous American actor.
An exemplary citizen, in the narrowest and in the broadest sense.
What was produced at the billing factory of Zuschlag &amp; Co.?
On 8 October, negotiations will begin in the criminal trial against Jáno's supplement and his complicity.
In particular, the defendant is accused of participating in organised crime, grossly negligent injury and fraud, and other criminal offences, including counterfeiting of documents.
According to the Public Prosecutor's Office, the funds recovered from the tenders were used for their own purposes, while the services provided were often covered by fake invoices.
State funds and grants from the self-government - a total of HUF 65 million - should partly have been transferred to the funds of the Fiatal Baloldal organization, partly to the private banks of individual.
As the investigative authorities announced, fictitious invoices were presented in the case of tendering fees, and the associations should not have fulfilled their obligations.
According to the indictment, most of the invoices have been falsified.
The bill blocks were purchased at the market of Józsefváros, and the round seals were made in Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which companies the invoices are to be issued was decided on that tour north of Lake Balaton, to which István Lados was sent by János supplement.
In the course of this "exploratory tour", Lados should find out about pensions and restaurants.
He asked for bills on consumption to be issued later on on on on on the basis of these submissions for the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the self-administration of Budapest.
These invoices are supposed to have been manipulated by István Lados and his complicity, András Iri, the latter being responsible for the constitution of the relevant reports according to our information.
One of the goals of Lados' "exploration tour" was a beer restaurant.
As two invoices issued by Supplement and Co in 2003 can be found, the gastronomy company is said to have hosted the ninety-member group of the Biztos Pont Egyesület association.
But now the head of the company states that such a large group would not have fit into the premises at once.
Another invoice issued in summer 2002 to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, later known as Egypt Évezredért, also showed serious errors in form and content.
In a guest house in Badacsonytomaj, which has only three rooms and cannot accommodate more than ten people at the same time, 130 guests are said to have stayed.
Apparently, the imagination of the counterfeiters was not as limited as it was about the Pigal Kft., a gastronomy company whose accounting documents of the customers Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá did not appear at all, according to the prosecutor.
As Managing Director Győző Farkas told the hvg.hu, it was immediately clear to him that it was fake documents when he was filed by the prosecutor during a survey.
"Our company name and the tax number were wrong on the stamp."
And more: Apart from formal defects, the fact that the company should have accommodated a hundred people after having a total of eleven rooms that are impossible to accommodate so many people was also wrong.
Also, on the invoice board, the restaurant was no longer in operation for a long time.
The serious billing forgery also failed to verify that the Budapest travel agency, which they had visited, only offers travel abroad and thus indicated Hungary's travels on the cash payment account, which also contradicted the company's accounting practice.
In addition, as was known in the course of the investigations, they also mentioned VAT on the invoices, although travel agency services relating to a country outside the EU are value added tax-free.
The amount of VAT in total was incorrect on four invoices issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, as the operation is charged only 15 percent VAT instead of 25 percent VAT, in addition, the employees issued only machine invoices, but the fake documents were handwritten.
Another mistake that had been encountered by the "accounting armies" was that in a case they had stated "goods transport" as a service provided, although this is not offered by the investment consulting company, the Public Prosecutor's Office informed.
Further form errors - incorrect invoice format, false stamps - were due to the fact that the invoices issued to Egypt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, as well as to XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyptesület and Bizto's Pont, could be exposed as counterfeits.
Similarly, in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the sports camp Kunfehértó, whose managing directors claimed never to have issued the invoices.
Another "error" is the falsifiers at the HIB Kft. from Nyíregyháza: This company was at the time (2001) precisely in dissolution, when the group of the Fiatal Városért Egyptezulet was supposed to have eaten there - the mass administrator therefore indicated that he did not issue the invoices himself.
Consciously faked
The other group of accountants are persons who were well aware that they would have to file fictitious invoices.
At the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, the Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation issued invoices for the Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Foundation, amounting to approximately HUF 4 million.
According to the indictment, the managing director of Collab Kft. was persuaded by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to issue the fictitious invoices.
The Biogate Kft, which is currently also in liquidation, is also said to have cooperated with surcharges and co. In 2003 the GmbH is said to have supplied the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány Foundation, as well as the Atlasz Egyesület and Voorösfenyő Egyesület clubs with fake invoices to the total value of HUF 5 million, which relate to unsupplyed services.
However, there was no payment traffic, since the invoices were cancelled immediately after their issue, which the parties had forgotten to note in their documents.
The third group of accountants shall include persons directly associated with the defendants.
One of them is Iván Kubatov, the postman of the Ukrainian managing director of Delta Trió Kft., a Budapest-based, but undetectable, fuel and vehicle trading company.
This company is said to have issued several invoices for the sale of computer components in the total value of HUF of approximately 18 million between October and December 2005.
According to the investigating authority, the cash investment Kft. from Kiskunhalas, which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005, is said to have been the buyer of these invoices.
The Managing Director of this company was a Romanian, to which the company documents were also to be sent by Iván Kubatov between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, Kubatov has issued invoices on behalf of the GmbH. to the associations Atlas and Hoppá, as well as to Egypt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and to have collected their own equivalent.
The companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. as well as the Jos-Investment Bt. are said to have been founded by Romanian masons on Iván Cubatov's explicit wish.
In reality, however, none of these companies were active, which according to the accused was due to lack of orders.
Nevertheless, he was able to benefit from the companies: at the request of his complicity, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who was responsible for preparing the company start-up documents, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the associations associated with the award, such as Atlasz and Y-Generáció.
A total of 15 invoices worth HUF 14.2 million on behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade have been issued to the organizations.
The Public Prosecutor's Office assumes that Cubatov may have collected 10% of the invoice sum and VAT.
Cubatov is said to have abused the company Szi-Beri Bt. for the exhibition of fictitious invoices - in this case the invoices were filed with Biztos Pont's applications.
In January 2006, Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért submitted their applications to the non-profit organisation of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány ("TMA").
Both received 500,000 forints each, but made use of these amounts.
To cover this up, they have submitted five fictitious invoices to the TMA from the Works Team Kft.
These invoices were, by the way, ensured when searching the office of Árpád Kemecsei in the Ministry of Education.
The negotiations are now expected by some defendants to confess the way in which they have been falsified, as they have already been before the Public Prosecutor's Office.
A sensation could be if the main defendant Jáno's award decided on a comprehensive confession.
His previous statements were less detailed, and although he had already promised to report comprehensively on everything, his confession is still pending.
The question therefore remains whether this is in his interest, whether the socialists have concluded a pact with him with regard to the compensation of the majority of the damage caused by HUF 50 million, and whether it is in return willing to take responsibility.
It is quite possible, however, that supplement will now play the "indignant" after his requests have come across deaf ears to ease the detention and house arrest.
While other criminals who have done far greater damage to and have not paid for economic offences are free of charge, or at least under house arrest, surcharges are not allowed to do so.
The psychology of oversupply - or why we are willing to pay more
At auctions, the buyers tend to spend more and thus overvalue the file bid.
Neurologists and economists at the University of New York have now succeeded in discovering the neurological and economic foundations of this well-known and apparently irrational behavior.
According to a study published in the "Science" magazine, people do not want to be beaten in a competition, such as an auction on eBay, and are therefore willing to pay even overly high prices.
The researchers have tried to explore the neurological scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers was supposed to play Lotto, while the other took part in a playful action - in both cases the active brain regions of the subjects were examined using functional magnetic resonance (fMRI).
At both games, the participants were able to win money, but an increased activity of the striatum, a complex below the bark of the brain, was measured in the losers of the auction, in which the oversupply of the opponent plays an essential role.
In addition to many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the "self-remuneration" of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore thought that the price increase could be explained by avoiding an overreaction of the striatum.
In order to support their thesis, the economists in the research group also carried out investigations to track the money.
In this case, three groups should participate against one partner under different conditions.
The control group was informed of the true value of the product, after which they made their bets.
Another group was also promised $15 reward in case they came out of the game as winners.
The third group received 15 dollars before the auction, which were also lost in the event of a lost game.
Thus, the difference between the two groups was simply that the emphasis was on winning, while the other was on losing.
However, as evidence of the hypothesis expressed by neurologists, the members of the "lost" group were ready to use higher stakes than those in the control group or the "profit" group.
"These results cannot be derived from any previous economic theory.
They have so far only caused the behaviour observed at auctions with the joy of winning or avoiding risks.
The contradiction between these two theories was resolved thanks to the imaging neurological methods, so that we now have a third explanation ready" - said Andrew Schotter, professor of the Faculty of Economics of the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When to see your doctor?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed among the leading causes of death.
The number of infected people is estimated at a hundred thousand in this country, but only seven thousand are treated, which is because patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the collective term for infectious liver diseases caused by various viruses.
The symptoms are often similar - liver inflammation and jaundice are common, but the pathogens and diseases differ.
Depending on the pathogen, hepatitis viruses spread in two different ways: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (e.g. contaminated food or water), hepatitis B, C and D can transmit the viruses through blood and other body fluids (e.g. sperm, secretions or saliva).
Travelers are recommended to vaccination against viruses A and B, against the virus C there is no vaccine.
The symptoms of hepatitis A show up about two-three weeks after consumption of contaminated food and are generally accompanied by discomfort, weakness, abdominal pain and vomiting.
Then the jaundice occurs on the skin and in the eyes, the chair becomes bright, the urine dark, and the recovery can last up to two-three weeks.
Worldwide, about 1 million people die each year from hepatitis B, which causes far more serious diseases such as liver cancer and cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only every tenth infected person is in medical treatment.
Hepatitis C may also have serious consequences: untreated, it can lead to cirrhosis of the liver and cancer of the liver.
Most infected people do not even know about their disease, as the pathogen secretly destroys the liver cells - in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
Therefore, timely prevention, such as regular checks, is essential.
There are three groups in which this disease is more common: those who have transfused blood before 1991, drug addicts, and tattoos.
Currently, the number of chronic hepatitis C patients worldwide is estimated to be 200 million.
Since the disease can already be detected in a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to consult the general doctor at the first signs of unknown origin.
Rightly recognized, the disease can be cured, the virus can be eradicated, thus preventing the risk of infection and preventing the development of cancer.
September 30 is the World Day of Hepatitis, held in 2004 for the first time in patient representations worldwide.
The aim of the action is to increase awareness of this virus-inflammation of the chronic liver, its origin and the importance of early detection.
Do believers have less pain?
As latest research shows, religious faith acts like a kind of "difficult" that has already facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University have conducted an interesting experiment: The British newspaper "Telegraph" reported on the extent to which belief in God influences human pain.
In the course of the rather bizarre investigation, 12 believers and atheists each received electric shocks as they studied a painting of the Mother of God.
As the results showed, the believers were able to eliminate most of the pain.
By means of a brain scan technology, it could even be demonstrated that the Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for the control of pain.
The study was the first in a research project in which philosophers and theologians from various departments of the university also participated.
When the test was carried out, a sparkling device was connected to the left hand, which gave off the electric shocks.
The participants were asked to focus heavily on two paintings: on the one hand, a picture of the Mother of God, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and on the other, Leonardo da Vinci's "Dame mit dem Hermelin".
The researchers hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary among the faithful would provoke some sort of religious trance, while they chose Vinci's image because it was hardly different from other paintings and felt soothing.
The subjects spent half an hour each in an MRI scanner, and at that time they received a total of 20 electric shocks in four stages, while they were supposed to look at either the religious, or the other painting.
The Catholics reported that at the sight of the Mother of God, they felt "in security" as if they were "carrying" and they felt "rest and peace".
During the consideration of the religious painting, they reported more than 12% less pain than they had Leonardo's work in mind.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also took part in the attempt, said that similar effects could also be caused with other, highly acting images also by the atheists, one would simply have to find the corresponding photo.
"We have to find an image that produces very positive sensations, such as a mother or a father," says the psychologist.
The Anglican bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"The practice of the faith should change our personality and do it in many cases," says Wright.
After these excellent results, the only question remains what effect a Madonna image of Leonardo or any other comparable painter would have on the pain regulation of the faithful.
Would the high-quality virgin Mary achieve even better results?
You are what you tell you about yourself
On the occasion of her tenth birthday, Google can claim with fug and right: it is to be found in people's pockets as well as above their heads in the sky: She knows where people have spent their holidays, to which specialists they go, and what moves them.
And that's still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of Google's managing directors.
Towards skeptics who are plagued by Orwell's horror visions, he lets them align: These would just overlook the essentials of the Web 2.0.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Schmidt recently said that Google's main goal is to collect even more personal data about users and thus to get closer to the company's original goal of "ordering all the information of this world".
Schmidt stated that after ten years of changing work, Google is still only at the beginning of the information collection.
Asked about the status quo in five years, Schmidt said: he wanted Google to be able to answer questions like "What should I do tomorrow?" or "What job really fits me?", but software programs are not yet able to do so because they do not know enough about the users.
Not all internet users are aware that in the course of their Internet searches the search terms are registered, as well as the IP addresses from which they were searched, and the pages visited.
For example, the "Personalized Search" introduced two years ago allows the visitor to store his own search history and use it later so that the hits can be generated much more precisely later, and the same logic is also based on the so-called "recommendations", with which the system recommends tailor-made products and services based on the previous preferences.
However, users are wondering what happens in the event of a data abuse - "If you look at what I am doing" - some are concerned about the Google data monopoly.
In most cases, however, it is more the potential power represented by the company, which has an evocative effect on fear, and less the guilt or fear of punishment, the quest for freedom, or the desire for power, which in many internet users encounters rejection.
However, it is a proven fact that the search terms are not only stored, but are also passed on to third parties in the event of an incident, and in these cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user.
A recent example of this was the action taken against pedophilia in Brazil, in which Google provided the Brazilian government with information collected by the community site called "Orkut" and also enabled the identification of pedophilia.
However, users who were concerned about personal rights were able to breathe in May when Google, together with the civil rights organisation EFF, successfully brought the FBI to justice: therefore, Google cannot be forced to release information to the FBI on a secret request even in the future with no point in the Constitution.
(However, the Federal Government has successfully produced the publication of 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms with reference to the Youth Protection Act adopted a year ago, but the list of individual users, or their web and search terms list, was retained for two months retroactively.)
So Google's image remains controversial: Those who hesitate to publish their personal data, because they fear the loss of their private and intimate atmosphere by using Google services, tease the company with the outrage that is due to the conservative companies.
Meanwhile, the American "geek culture" that is present in many countries and unites enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, the next generation of "cool entrepreneurs" in them, unlike Microsoft, which is the market leader thanks to Windows, even if both fight for the same goal.
A possible reason for this is that, unlike Microsoft, Google does not require any identification codes and provides its services free of charge, so that an open, constantly updated source code and program package seem to be far more attractive, youthful and cooler than the official practices of the software giant.
On the other hand, the geeks are looking at the problematic relationship between personal rights and the Internet - a relationship that has been brought to the heart especially in recent years thanks to the term "web 2.0".
The "Web 2.0" is about nothing but collaboration, that is, the users deliberately leave behind traces and use the available communication channels, and even if the dimensions are individually different, the main thing remains the same, namely to show themselves publicly.
An average youth can simultaneously manage his profile on several community portals - from Facebook via Xanga, they can connect with each other via other services, such as Twitter, or music services such as last.fm, and can eventually integrate all of this into a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. In addition, they can run blogs that automatically represent the latest photo galleries located on Flickr or Flickr.
And a number of other exemplary cases prove: When considering the party photos last night, the friend soon finds out with whom her unfaithful friend has enjoyed himself, or the employee is released because in his blog he is only too honest to air his anger over the management of the company - one thing is certain: The term "private" has now been completely reinterpreted.
Whoever leads an online life is what he gives of himself - for example, one could formulate the basic idea behind the behavior of today's youth.
And who tries to keep something secret, or even to bypass the Google monopoly, can do so - like with Scroogle, a tool that does access Google's search engine, but deliberately does not leave any traces.
Not a few people willfully register not on community pages, so that they can't be found, but also Google's online applications, such as word processing and graphics tools and RSS feeds, can handle alternative versions that are not linked to huge server parks and therefore do not generate the best possible profile from the user.
However, public opinion is waiting for Google to show its true face.
With its current value of USD 156 billion, the company is even ahead of IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), AdWords/AdSense's advertising sites threaten the revenue of advertising agencies, and the increasingly fast-moving services not only make Microsoft but also other software developers headbreaks.
However, critical viewers also find the disturbing counter-poles: For example, the Group management completely rejected a protest from the employees after the fees of the company's own kindergarten were doubled, and the management also said that the several times the catering of the employees is too expensive. However, all this seems to be quite mild against Google's even kneeling in 2006 before the Chinese government and agreed to an agreement that all regime-critical hits, or those that violate the good taste, would be filtered out.
The Group’s internal regulation is that no new service will be advertised in advance, but only if it is already available. Nevertheless, the events of the coming months and years could once again change a lot: While some think that Google’s book and magazine scanning or archiving project now assumes that the company will soon have to deal with the Supreme Court, others are concerned about the health system, which allows the creation of a complete health profile based on findings, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google is building up a genetic database, the next generation of Sci-Fi authors is already delivering the substance - for example "Scroogled", the famous novel by Cory Doctorow describes in best orwellian manner a future in which a human being becomes horribly approachable thanks to Google-based data.
Two young people help the double killer of Ózd to eliminate the trace
In connection with the double murder of Ózd, the police has now interrogated two young people suspected of having helped eliminate the traces, the spokesman of the police commissioner Borsod announced on Tuesday.
The young people were admitted, they are currently being charged with the aid.
According to information provided by the MTI news agency, these are two girls who defend themselves freely.
Aid is threatened with a prison sentence of up to five years.
The suspect of the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old local man, was arrested on Sunday.
The man is under urgent suspicion of deliberately murdering several people out of greed for money.
In the course of the investigations, it was found that the 23-year-old had owed a larger amount of money to a 53-year-old.
However, the suspect did not want to settle his debts, so he lured his creditor to a site in Ózd last Wednesday, where he murdered him and his nine-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the man has planned the action by a long hand - this also proves the fact that he committed the murders with a weapon hidden at the scene of the crime.
Together with experts, the police are now investigating the crime weapon and the circumstances of its use.
Warsaw Stock Exchange Sets Purchase Offer for Prague Stock Exchange
About 200 million euros, or 5 billion Czech kroner, the Warsaw Stock Exchange has offered to buy 100% of the stock packages of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer that the Poles had made despite the fact that they had previously been excluded from the Czech market as possible owners of their stock exchange.
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is wholly owned by the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish State, which, however, wants to sell more than 60% of the papers in the coming months.
According to reports by the Czech daily "E15", the offers of the Poles include the highest purchase price ever offered for the Prague Stock Exchange.
As the newspaper reports, so far the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have made offers.
Last week, Petr Koblic, head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said that the worst new owner of all the interested parties would probably be the Warsaw Stock Exchange, and he did not rule out that this could even lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange to 5-10 billion crowns.
According to the shareholders' agreements, 90% of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Patria Finance Investmentbank with a 25 percent stake, followed by the Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and the Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the point of view of European newspapers
In their comments on the ever-increasing international financial crisis, some leading European leaves already spoke of the "second 11 September" on Tuesday.
We owe the global financial disaster to the American President, for example, "La Repubblica" - the President had not even been able to put his own party to the draft law behind him, which should bring some relief to the frightening situation...
Instead of a "new Pearl Harbor", as the billion-severe investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more appropriate to speak of a "second 11 September".
Parts of the Madrid press also located the scapegoat in Washington.
According to the "El Mundo", the lack of political leadership is due to the fact that the world economy is now on the verge of collapse.
The American financial system is increasingly threatening to collapse, and the whole world will suffer from it.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but now, after the vote in Congress, the danger is that Washington has no political means of crisis management.
The world economy is in the air, just at a time when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
One can no longer ignore the threat, says the Geneva "Days-Anzeiger".
While some countries may still be able to provide rescue packages to their affected money institutions and save banks from bankruptcy with taxpayers' money.
However, if a domino effect is triggered and more banks argue, then no further financial injections or other immediate action will help.
In the long term, EU Member States would have to jump above their shadows and centralise control over money markets.
On Monday alone, more than EUR 100 billion of weaker money institutions were paid out, the Vienna standard reminds us. Furthermore, according to the newspaper, the concerns are becoming more and more realistic that according to the Americans, European taxpayers also have to take a little deeper into their pockets in order to get out of the crisis.
So far, the EU has not seriously dealt with the crisis, which is now sweeping across the old continent like a tsunami.
Although the "saviors" would not have to "bet" with several hundred billion euros immediately, it would be advisable to state in which case it would be reasonable to use taxpayers' money to avoid even greater damage.
Intelligent car imitates the flight of the Hummel
What would be the best method for developing new technologies to avoid accidents if not to imitate nature's obstacle sensors?
For example, the bees.
At the CEATEC in Japan, an amazing project was presented that inspired the Nissan engineers of Hummelen in the creation of new accident-preventing systems.
In cooperation with the Tokyo University, Nissan has built the biomimetic system of type BR23C, a mini-car equipped with the characteristics of bees, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that avoids any collisions.
In flight each bee forms its own oval "private area", which is very similar to our own "protective sign", said Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology PR and research development, at the exhibition.
The compound eye of the bee, which can see in any direction and at an angle of more than 300 degrees, plays an important role in this.
To imitate the function of the composite eye, the researchers took up the idea of the laser-controlled distance meter.
This identified obstacles before the BR23C in a field of vision of 180 degrees within 2 meters, calculates their distances and sends signals to the microprocessor on board, which immediately initiates the collision prevention process.
The obstacle is registered in second fractions, and the car robot immediately changes the course, similar to the movement of bees by turning the tires around the corresponding angle.
Unlike previous systems, this maneuver is purely instinctive.
"If it wasn't, the car robot wouldn't be able to react quickly enough to avoid the obstacles," said Toshyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the Auto robot project.
The system must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the innermost and most vulnerable part of the shield - a layer within which accidents are still considered inevitable.
The entire process must reflect the behaviour of bees if they avoid other bees.
And that must be in the fraction of a second.
However, in contrast to the bees, it can be avoided, not up, down, or even diagonally - it can only be two-dimensional, only towards the agility of the tyres.
While the bees here are infinitely open to avoid other bees, the researchers were only able to use the rotational motion, or acceleration and brakes during the car robot.
The BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and more energy-efficient and therefore have a longer service life than conventional lithium ion batteries.
Andoh explained that it was the instinctive, intelligent response, and less the processing of the data, and even less the ability to store it.
This device only needs to process some inputs per second and react accordingly to them.
It doesn't have to store them, or produce an intuitive, logical reaction based on previous maneuvers, so that it constantly uses only a handful of KB memory.
There is no need for gigabyte and megabyte heavy memory.
This is the first step in the development of immediate collision prevention technology, which, according to Nissan, will be standard production within the next ten years.
Another application could find the technology in GPS satellite navigation by deliberately directing the driver around obstacles and thus leading him to the goal.
A name for the sinful child
Now there is the written version of the 700-billion-dollar rescue package law, which will be applied in several stages and aims at purchasing the bad loans from banks.
In the first passage, half of the money will be spent.
At a meeting that ended on Saturday after midnight local time east coast, Congress members went through after several-day debates to reach an agreement on the 700-billion-dollar rescue package, Reuters reported.
"We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, democratic president of the House of Deputies, and said that we only have to bring the agreement to paper.
The compromise reached on the rescue package was supported by both presidential candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain.
Minister of Finance Henry Paulson said: The programme will be effective and it will be efficient, but more must be done. According to Pelosi, this is not about saving Wall Street, but about breaking the row of the economy around.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, i.e., Washington time Sunday evening 8 o'clock (Central European time Monday 2 o'clock in the morning), but did not trigger an altitude flight on the stock exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Deputies votes first on the draft law on the stabilisation of the economy from 2008, then the Senate is on the line.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday evening, and the White House also welcomed the news about the agreement.
We are pleased with the progress made at night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our markets and protect our economy, said Tony Fratto, spokesperson of the White House.
However, the programme deviates from the Bush Administration's initial recommendation that the $700 billion should be spent at once for the purchase of lazy securities charged with loans.
In a first tranche, a maximum of half of the 700 billion will be spent, with 250 billion available immediately after the Congress is expected to vote on the Causa on Monday, which will be spent on the purchase of credit-burdened, bad securities, and on the additional USD 100 billion the President will decide.
The programme will be reviewed by a separate Commission, which will also be owned by the President of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the 700 billion depends on a further decision of Congress.
For the purposes of the law, the Ministry of Finance can also use a combined tactic: it can at the same time purchase bad loans, mortgages, and mortgage-related securities, or other "toxic" loans.
As reported by the responsible persons of the Ministry, the purchase can be made both in an auction and directly.
The law allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme in which the Ministry of Finance guarantees the worrying funds and the companies pay the expected damages corresponding fees.
Henry Paulsen said: The law defines the necessary funds so that up to 700 billion dollars can be provided as emergency aid for the American financial system, whether for the large-scale purchase of bad funds, their insurance, or the avoidance of a systemic risk caused by the collapse of a larger financial institution.
We take the necessary steps so that we are ready to introduce the law as soon as it has been signed, says Paulson.
However, the chiefs of banks in difficulty and now dependent on state aid can expect their handlings, which are referred to as "golden handshake" in the overseas snake, to be shortened by the government.
There will only be a reduction in salaries in certain cases, and these reductions will depend on how the Ministry of Finance helps each.
The reduction essentially means that if the Ministry purchases in the course of an auction, the "Golden Handshake" will be taxed unless the served bank manager is transferred to the pension.
In the case of a direct purchase of the lazy loans, the government will take aggressive action to ensure that the manager's salaries are not exaggerated.
The picture also includes that the existing Golden Handshake contracts are not changed - the restrictions refer only to new agreements so that more people participate in the programme.
This is the first case in American history that cuts in manager salaries are regulated by law, commented the Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the Financial Committee, the measure.
The State gains equity rights in participating banks so that the risk for taxpayers decreases as they can also participate as soon as the economy and thus the rescued bank get better.
The draft law provides for the president to submit a proposal to Congress over the next five years on how taxpayers can recover their lost money from the financial sector.
However, there were skeptics on both sides who expressed their doubts about the plan.
That is not what the American citizens expect of us, the plan does not protect taxpayers' money, says the Californian Republican Darrell Issa.
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, said that the measures were driven by the same people who are also responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continued to rise
Like the Central Statistical Office, domestic sales prices increased by 0.1 percent in August 2008 compared to the previous month, and compared with August 2007, by 12.9 percent.
Export prices were 1.1 percent higher than those in July 2008, and fell by 3.9% compared to the previous year's prices.
Due to price changes in the domestic and export sectors, production prices were 0.7% higher than in the previous month, and 3.2% higher than in 2007.
Domestic sales prices increased only slightly compared to the previous month, i.e. by 0.1 percent.
Sales prices of the manufacturing industry also increased only a little - 0.1 percent - since July.
The biggest price increase in August 2008 was in leather goods (2.8 percent) - primarily in bags and belts - where the increase was 4.6%, while in shoes prices rose by 2.5 percent.
Higher prices for plastics and chemical raw materials significantly increased prices for chemicals and production (1.6 percent).
A decrease in prices was recorded in crude oil processing (1.4 percent), electrical and technical equipment (0.9 percent), and small in wood processing (0.1 percent).
Prices in paper production, as well as in publishing and printing remained unchanged.
In other branches of the manufacturing industry, a price increase was measured between 0.2 and 0.9 percent.
In the important domestic sales markets of industry, such as electricity, gas, steam and water supply, prices rose by 0.3 percent in August, primarily as a result of the increase in the price of gas introduced on 1 July.
Considering the domestic sales markets of the manufacturing industry in the annual comparison, prices in crude oil processing have risen the most (32.4 percent).
In the metalworking sector, a 13.2 percent increase was observed, while the increase in the production of food, beverages, and tobacco was 11 percent.
A decrease in prices was observed in the textile industry (2.5 percent) and in electrical and technical equipment (0.3 percent).
The rate of inflation in the other manufacturing industries was between 0.6 and 9.1 percent.

The largest price increase in August 2008 was observed in the energy and reuse sector compared to the 2007 comparison period (16.8 percent).
In sectors producing consumer goods, a price increase of 6.8% was recorded, with investment goods falling by 1.4%.
Industry's export prices measured in Forint increased by 1.1 percent in August compared to the previous month, but fell by 3.9% per year.
In comparison to the euro, the domestic currency fell by 1.7 percent, to the dollar by 7.1 percent, and compared to the August 2007 price, it grew 7.5 percent compared to the euro, while in the dollar it was even 15.9% stronger.
No more visas in the USA from 2009?
Kinga Göncz sees good chances that the U.S.-Hungarian visa agreement will enter into force by 12 January, as the Foreign Minister said before the representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
In your opinion, "everything now depends only on whether the electronic immigration or control system is introduced in time in overseas."
However, she also stressed that the new system would not permit entry, but tourists would have to register in advance.
The head of the Hungarian diplomacy is now conducting negotiations in Washington.
She meets Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, who will hand over the "Middle Cross of Merit with Star" of the Republic of Hungary, and she will also hold talks with the foreign policy advisers of the Democrat Barack Obama and the Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support bank rescue package
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two presidential candidates of the major American parties, promised on Sunday their support for the 700 billion dollar rescue package for banks, but there are also politicians who demand the resignation of the Finance Minister.
The Congress and representatives of the government, after day-long marathon consultations on Sunday morning, announced that they had reached an agreement on the bank rescue package.
The Wall Street crisis, as well as the thawing up of the frozen credit market, became the central issues of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain - both claim to be better than each opponent to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to recent surveys, Obama was able to further expand its lead thanks to the economic issues, while McCain's high, which gave him the presentation of Vice President Sarah Palin after the Republican Convention, was melted down.
At an election event in Detroit on Sunday Obama expressed his hope that Congress would quickly adopt the law on the 700 billion dollar package.
He stressed that the plan also includes those passages of consumer protection which he supported.
"We must now act responsibly (...) - your jobs, your savings, entire industries, and the stability of the entire economy are threatened" - he said before 35,000 spectators.
He did not fail to call McCain's economic vision "absolute".
In an interview given to the station ABC McCain said: "We will all have a hard time making this (...) but nothing is certainly an alternative."
The Republican Senator said that the plan also requires the establishment of a control commission for the Finance Minister, as well as the restriction of the handling of top managers - something he had insisted on.
Obama said that McCain had not played a decisive role in the negotiations, whereas he, Obama, was in contact with the minister.
On Sunday, the spokesman of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, announced that the House of Representatives is likely to vote on the draft law on Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking region
The right camp is intact, only the voters were more confident within the camp - so "The Mirror" comments on the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria.
In Austria, Haider and Co are ready to rule to prevent a red-black coalition.
The mirror (spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the German news magazine on the left, Franz Walter analyses the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article "Bayern's Revolution destroys their fathers".
According to the renowned political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took over its offices.
The Christian socialists have renewed Bavaria for decades - now the modern citizens are turning away from them.
The breakup of the epoch is at the same time a problem of Christian democracy, as it is for Angela Merkel.
Surprisingly, the disaster of the CSU did not come to an end, but on Sunday something came to an end, which was already quite exactly ten years ago: the unquestionable hegemony of a state party
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU landed at 47.7 percent, falling below the fifty-percent mark for the first time since the fifties.
Three years ago, this was repeated in the 2005 Bundestag elections, in other words in the much-quoted Stoiber era.
The modernisation of CSU in the federal state has finally destroyed its own mothers and fathers.
Sociologists had predicted this already 40 years ago, but greatly appreciated it at the pace. However, without any effect, secularization, the educational success, the entry of East and North Germans into the prosperous regions of Bavaria to the loyalty of the CSU voters could not remain.
Modernisation always goes hand in hand with the increase of options, and that has political consequences.
The right camp is intact - only the voters within the camp became more critical and self-willing.
It is striking that in the last few weeks the classic groups of citizens have expressed the greatest distance to the CSU: the liberal professions, the commercial citizenship and voters with a degree in higher education.
Here the support of the CSU dropped to less than 40 percent.
The press (depresse.com)
The conservative Vienna daily newspaper reports in its "Who With Who? Party Heads Reluctantly in Coalition Questions" articles on the chaotic domestic situation in Austria after the new elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the interference of SPÖ in internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to discussions in all directions, while the Greens do not yet want to determine themselves in relation to a coalition.
The new elections are over, and now the coalition is all about; in the debates on public television, the heads of the party hardly had their cards looked at.
SPÖ CEO Werner Faymann reaffirmed his desire to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is very possible - this is already the case in some federal states and in the social partners.
The question of whether he could introduce himself to a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current ÖVP chief as Vice Chancellor, left Faymann open.
As he said, the voters had chosen the bowl-molder course.
A repetition of this direction would not be possible.
Molterer responded carefully to red offers, however.
The cooperation could not be fruitful, he said, when Faymann tried to interfere in the internal concerns of the ÖVP.
Whether his party is in opposition, or going to the coalition, is currently completely open, and these issues should be discussed internally.
BZÖ-Chef Jörg Haider was open in all directions.
"To prevent red and black, we are ready to assume government responsibility," says Haider.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, in Paris, the European Summit on Equal Opportunities has begun, which will be organised by the European Council Presidency in France.
In its speech addressed to the Assembly, Lívia Járóka, Fidesz Member of the European People's Party, drew attention, in particular, to the educational segregation, as it is one of the most serious violations of law that happens to Roma children, and this is also the main obstacle to their need for application.
The High Level Conference was opened by French Employment and Social Minister Xavier Bertrand on behalf of the French Presidency, and Vladimir Spidla, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among the participants were representatives of governments, the European social partners, as well as the most important European legal protection and civil society organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
Járóka, as reported by the press office of the EP MPs of the Fidesz, pointed out that, in addition to discrimination in the search for jobs, Roma would be driven out of the labour market primarily because of their low level of education.
"The vast majority of Roma young people do not have secondary education, and due to poor primary education, only a small part of them can get a degree in higher education".
Járóka also stressed that education is a fundamental human right which has a key role to play in promoting other human rights.
Investment in early training of Roma children could strengthen the economy of EU Member States.
In the view of the Members, it is important that these links become as broad a circle as possible, i.e. Roma and non-Roma.
The earlier a Roma student starts school, the more his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market increase, and through income and turnover taxes they contribute to national spending.
"As a citizen of the Union, Roma must be guaranteed the right to high-quality education - poor and segregated teaching must be discontinued" - says Lívia Járóka.
As the Members said, a common, objective and action-oriented approach by the European Union is necessary in order to speed up the desegregation process in the education sector, and it is essential to ensure that the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives are complied with correctly.
"We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation, and unemployment, and give Roma children the democratic opportunity to contribute to the future of Europe as fully entitled citizens," Járóka demanded.
Since last year's Congress in Berlin, the summit is organised annually with the aim of creating a unique forum for the achievement of the objectives of equal opportunities and freedom of expression at European and national level, in the sense of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities".
CSU: Grace on time
At the end of October, the fate of the fallen duo Huber-Beckstein will be decided
Despite the election debacle, no heads are intervening, at the top of the Bavarian CSU the staff debates have been postponed.
Party leader Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein remain in their offices, the only question is how long this grace lasts.
The fate of the tandem after the catastrophic 17-percent loss of voice will be decided at the extraordinary party meeting last October weekend.
But the much-studded duo already let it see that it does not want to stick to their armchairs.
In doing so, they want to calm down the angry political group and the party base that called for personal consequences one day after the "Bavarian tsunami" in view of the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - admittedly, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber at his height of career - the Christian-Social Union reached 60.7 percent. But now, one year after the coup against Stoiber, they were able to secure only 43.4 percent of the votes.
For 46 years, the CSU was the sole director in Bavaria, which generates 18 percent of German GDP.
Although the conservatives remain the determining force in the southern federal state, which is also important for the Hungarian economy, they will have to rule in a coalition in the future.
The potential successor of Hubers, Vice-President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer is also involved as the first sign of the internal-party restructurings in the exploration team, which conducts exploratory talks with the liberal FDP or the right-wing "free voters" about a possible Munich coalition.
An irony of fate comes immediately, that Gabriele Pauli, with the list of "free voters", entered the legislation, whose anti-stubby appearance the Huber-Beckstein Duo first took advantage of, in order to serve the determined politician mercilessly.
The CSU leadership now concentrates all its forces on the stabilisation of Beckstein.
In this transition process, Stoiber, who has so far withdrawn the threads from the background, will play an active role. Former Prime Minister and CSU Chairman called September 28 the "bitter day of his political career".
On Monday, Huber made some toxic remarks towards CDU - in his opinion, the CSU would have deserved much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a signal to the CDU and hence to Angela Merkel.
Should the CSU, which also contributed much to the success at national level in 2005, not be put back on its feet by means of a joint power act, Merkel will not be able to become Chancellor again after the Bundestag elections in September 2009.
Merkel, who has not made any haze from her disappointment about the Fiasco, believes that the loss of the CSU's terrain will not have a negative impact on the great coalition in Berlin.
What is relative, however, is that the wounded CSU will not be easier to rule, and the crisis of the Social Democrats will continue.
With 18.6 percent, the SPD has achieved its best result in Bavaria since 1946.
Lukashenko opposition: 110-0
In the elections on Sunday, no member of the opposition succeeded in the Ukrainian Parliament.
Russian observers believe that this is due to prosperity and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but the OECD suspects illegality in counting the votes.
The OECD, which has sent 450 observers from 43 countries, has not recognised the elections.
De Legislature of the 10 million resident state has been in existence for decades without opposition. Nevertheless, before yesterday’s elections, the opponent, gathered under the name of the “United Democratic Forces” (ODS), has seriously hoped that Lukashenko, who had for the fourth time "allowed" his presidential mandate in the unclean elections and because of a constitutional change in 2006 would "let" some members of the opposition in Parliament.
Therefore, the ODS has even distanced itself from the previously planned boycotts.
Ukraine is becoming increasingly dependent on Russia thanks to the rising prices of natural gas imports. In order to ease price increases, loans have even been granted, and the country has also approved the sale of Beltransgas, the owner of the gas pipeline leading through the country, to the Russians. In the light of the opposition’s expectations, the hope was that Ukraine would want to improve its relationship with the EU after Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians have banned entry into the EU because of the anti-democratic political system.
The evaluation report of the OECD elections, in which emphasis was on positive movements rather than on shortcomings, such as the exclusion of a third of the opposition candidates from the elections, provided temporary relaxation.
However, the OECD's rapid report criticised the campaign on Monday - which is why oppositionists should not be in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition was not allowed to be present when the votes were counted.
Despite all of this, the opposition is able to see a improvement in the political system: political prisoners were set free, for example, and Minsk is ready to confront Moscow even smaller by continuing to deny the independence of the apostate Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, although Russia, with which Ukraine forms a federal state on paper, has considered both territories to be independent for one month.
"We have taken two steps forward and one backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," said Alexander Milinkevich on our page.
In the view of the 2006 opposition candidate of the presidential elections, a continuation is desirable, although "the powerful have been afraid to let even one oppositionist into Parliament".
The opposition does not plan protest measures in view of the results, but rather seeks to clarify the need for economic reform to voters.
"We have many problems here - the opposition newspapers have to be printed in Russia, the local authorities put us in the way of selling stones, but yet I see that more and more people are supporting change, even the older ones" - said Milinkevich, alluding to the fact that not even the most supported layer of pensioners is in agreement with the Lukashenko regime, whose only merit is the production of social security.
"Thanks to the indebtedness of the country and the rise in the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time until the "social security" directed to the silence of a cemetery begins to crumble," says Milinkevich.
Unlike the oppositionist, Russian observers have called the elections democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, Head of the Community of Independent States Mission, said the news agency Ria Novosti: "People believe in the actions, not the words." Therefore, the lack of opposition is proof of the maturity of the Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on, breakfast will be served before work."
For the first time in the history of the Chigi Palace, there are rotatable doors for the entrances and exits of the officials.
From today on, the measure will come into force against those slaumeiers who will first stamp and then go to coffee drinking during the working time.
The new anti-fading law was presented today by Renato Brunetta, the Minister for Public Administration and by Mauro Masi, Secretary-General of the Council of Ministers.
">"Treatable doors are a means of increasing work efficiency through a higher presence rate and more services," said Minister Brunetta.
"Now begins a new era of responsibility and transparency.
This is reformism," Brunetta said.
The Chigi Palace ends with the establishment in all buildings of the Council of Ministers' Bureau.
Masi says: "The choice of rotating doors is also of great symbolic value".
There was no resistance on the part of the officials, the Secretary-General assured: "This process was supported by all, the cooperation came from all sides."
All in all, there is now no breakfast during the working time anymore; end with coffee or croissant .
Brunettas advises with a smile: "A good cappuccino at 7 o'clock works miracles".
During a meeting of the General Committee of Public Administration (Scuola Superiore della Publica Amministrazione)
of Rome, the Minister announces that "within three months the absences of officials have been reduced to 50%, i.e. 60,000 people are more present at work each year".
It adds that it is necessary to strengthen the efficiency of the Italian public administration
"their wage dynamics - according to the Minister - have been twice as large as the private sector and far above the inflation rate over the last 8-10 years".
In the meantime, thousands of officials have joined forces to counter Brunetta's decree in the context of the vocation supported by Codacons.
"While the Minister for Public Service is profiled with figures on lower falls in work - according to the consumer headquarters - the people of 'active lazyness' grow continuously.
Indeed, thousands of correct and valuable civil servants of the public service have gathered to declare war on the illegal standards of the decree."
In particular, the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) will fight for additional financial compensation for work-related illness, including the planned extension of the mandatory house arrest of the sick worker, during which inspections can be made and other aspects of the ministerial's renewals are challenged.
Napolitano: "Prevention against accidents at work is crucial"
Every day 2500 accidents at work occur in Italy, three people die and 27 remain unemployed for life.
For 2007, the Inail data (Istituto nazionale contro gli infortuni sul lavoro) confirm that the fatal accidents at work were about 1200.
These figures prove the seriousness of a phenomenon that causes almost twice as many deaths as are caused by murders.
Today, the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) in all the provinces of Italy will celebrate the 58th national day for the victims of accidents at work in order to draw the attention of social institutions and the media to this dramatic situation.
"The alarming data transmitted by Anmil and the tragic news of these days confirm how crucial the question of prevention at work is," confirms the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano in his communication to the President of the Amil (Associazione nazionale mutilati ed invalidi del lavoro) Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expresses his "great appreciation for the constant commitment to the prevention of jobs, to the protection of injured workers, to support the families of victims and to raise public awareness".
"An indignant "basta" has arisen; understandably in the case of tragedies, which, measured by their magnitude, cause some vertebrae in the media and public participation. But everyday reality often confronts us with dramatic events, which can even repeat themselves in their own dynamics".
Napolitano does not hide that "there is definitely also a resource problem: education and information have to be invested decisively."
The many initiatives are of particular importance for a more direct awareness-raising in school frameworks by the young people who feed the world of work.
It is our duty to focus attention on this phenomenon and not distract from its social seriousness. We must put in place and improve a legislative standard.
On the one hand, the President of Gianfranco Fini stressed that "the phenomenon of labour-related deaths constitutes an urgent social emergency which insults the conscience of all of us and forces all institutions to work on decisive rules that aim to put an end to the problem".
"The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight improvement, but this does not exclude the fact that the number of deaths due to work is far too high," says President Anmil, Pietro Mercandelli.
"We don't want this "positive tendency" to mean less attention. That's exactly what causes the tragedy in the end."
"How do you believe that you are basically doing too little to deal with the phenomenon of accidents? You can fight against it through various actions.
In our opinion, stronger controls and inspections are necessary – according to Mercandelli, but also stronger measures to inform workers who are already beginning in school."
"An additional effort is necessary - he adds - in terms of communication and awareness of public opinion.
But above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers is required towards a phenomenon that constitutes a social emergency."
Mercandelli also spoke about "the progressive deterioration of the protection of the victims of accidents at work" and denounced the "absorbing of the social system against which we are fighting in recent years".
"The aim, therefore, is to give the worker a guarantee to insurance so that the fate of the victim of an accident at work does not depend on voluntary or random donations that are decided upon by a legislator from time to time."
Mp3 player in charge: risk of hearing damage
Loud music over a longer time span with portable music devices, such as Mp3 players, can lead to permanent hearing damage.
This is reported by the European Commission, which in a report today published in Brussels quotes the opinion of the Csrseri (scientific committee on the current and recently identified health risks) of the EU.
"The report – as it says in a note – makes it clear that 5-10 % of those who, for at least five years, hear sound music with portable music instruments for more than one hour a day per week risk the permanent loss of their hearing."
"I'm worried that such a large number of young people who usually put portable music devices and mobile phones on a high volume will irrevocably damage their hearing without knowing it," says Meglena Kuneva.
"From the scientific findings – as it is said on the part of the Eu – there is a clear risk that leads to rapid action.
What really counts is to raise consumer awareness and make this information common.
In the light of these scientific findings, we need to re-examine the existing control systems so that they are fully effective and keep pace with the new technology".
Brussels had commissioned the independent scientific committee in view of the widespread use of portable music equipment among young people.
"The scientists - as the EU Communication concludes - confirm that one is quite concerned and that the European Commission, together with the other members of the European Union and those concerned, will now examine the necessary measures to better protect children and young people from the noise that comes from portable music equipment and similar equipment."
There is already a European standard which limits the level of noise from portable music equipment to 100 dB, and concerns about the damage that could come from too much noise.
One can greatly limit these damage in which one takes on solutions such as reducing the volume and the length of the noise exposure.
In its report, the European Scientific Committee points out that if the users of portable music instruments only listen to music (according to 89 decibels) five hours a week, so that the legal boundaries that apply to the maximum noise level at the workplace have already been exceeded.
Those who cross this line of music risk the complete loss of hearing within five years.
This is therefore 5-10% of users of such devices, whose number can be estimated at between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Roma, Alemanno launches the "Commission for the Future of the Capital"
We are starting today, we are supposed to be over in March, and we are going to take stock in June.
This is the process laid down by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome". This morning the Commission met in the new seat behind the Caracalla thermal baths.
In six months' time, President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will work out the guidelines for Rome.
As soon as the project is completed, the City Council and the municipal council will evaluate the analyses and projects in order to be able to present the strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and the Mayor Gianni Alemanno in June.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented in it," Alemanno emphasises. "It will present proposals for a development plan for Rome, whose responsible person will remain the City Council and the Municipal Council.
There is no redistribution of responsibilities, only the will to have a place where one can develop a large project for Rome.
In March, its task will be completed and the Commission will re-decompose, as such a project must have a fixed time-limit.
In June - as the mayor announced - we will present the strategic plan in which we will make use of the work done by the Commission".
Whoever questions the Commission's competence as its opinion lacks liability, Alemanno replies: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will do and the quality of its proposals.
If, as in France, the Attali Commission delivers quality results – and this will certainly be the case in Rome – then its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics deals with the everyday problems and emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the other hand, want to have a longer period of time in view, so that in a deeper perspective we work seriously on the development of Rome and the future of the city".
The mayor of Rome places great importance on clarifying the following: "This Commission is neither a useless institution nor a wreck: it is absolutely free of charge, it will not cost Roman citizens a cent and it will bring us to think. It will employ the best minds of the capital."
According to Alemanno, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan that is neither hermetic nor static in order to enable our city to take a quality leap - which it really needs - and thus to take a common step into the future".
A future, according to the mayor of Rome, that "will not only limit itself to the current municipal boundaries, but will look much further", not only as regards the role of Rome as a metropolis and political capital of Italy, but also as the future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama – the first anti-American president? Here’s a statement
A well-known American politician, much to be considered independent, wrote: "Barack Obama becomes the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, through his decisions, decimated the economy of the US and used to have relations with Islam (and still does so as a private man today).
The attacks against Obama are getting more violent, right now, where the elections are approaching.
A lady from Miami wrote on an Internet page: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama is very naughty: he thinks he will be given the highest office of a nation that has seen a total of two black governors and five black senators!"
In fact, these attacks do not have much to say; they are racist attacks and they do not answer the question of voters: will he be a good president? And then there are the surveys; all say that Obama will win with a big advantage.
In this case, too, there are people who speak with the heart and not with the head.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, has written in her editorial: only in the election cabin will we know who the real American patriot will give his voice.
Here comes a mentality of the United States, which has been kept hidden up to the last.
"Tell me what you want, then we'll decide who we're going to make our cup, whether for Obama or for McCain."
There are people there who swear: if Obama wins, we will emigrate from America.
Something you never heard before – only now, where the success of the black candidate seems so safe.
In any event, despite all these considerations, the final weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were questioned: What mistakes did Bush make during his term of office? 89% have replied: the war in Iraq.
America is changing.
The nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent home with a step back in the butt.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Nevertheless, Iraq remains for the majority of Bush's weak point.
The one who will take his place is facing a huge task.
USA. The financial collapse also leaves its mark on journalists: in the newspapers you can already feel the cuts. And many accuse the Internet, the "killer" of the printing press.
Five hundred American journalists were asked about the future by the PEW Research Center about their situation and their mental control.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
Nevertheless, they did not really express any concern about the information concerning the responsible because of the general credibility.
You don't feel as alone as you used to.
The problem for the American journalists is the money.
For these journalists, the 2008 crisis is a crisis of an economic model that has been destroyed.
In addition, there are the major problems caused by the cuts in the newsroom, i.e. the space in which the editors work to put the newspaper together.
This is a problem that needs to be solved – according to the interviewed journalists – if one wants to prevent traditional journalism, as the large audience understands it, from shrinking significantly.
A clear but complicated pessimism is fulfilling the American journalist today.
Six out of ten press journalists and executive seniors believe that journalism is on the wrong path at national level.
In the local area, the executives are even 65%.
Printed vs. Broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine the direction the web is going.
The most important publishing groups are running the way to the Internet, which is considered by many to be the "killer" of the printing press.
The "economic pressure" felt by journalists has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted to want to join the new technology in the hope "they bring something good for journalism".
The biggest crack exists in American journalism today between the editor-in-chiefs of the newsroom and the reporters who work for them.
56% of editors at national level are sure, their reporters share their values with them, while at local level they are only 23%.
Some think it has to do with "security in work".
The managers who are afraid to lose their jobs within three years are 47% at national level.
The number of journalists is 30%.
The topic of "safe work" in the team (our "editors", note d. Red.) is always a current topic in the USA.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation such as the USA, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV broadcasters and Internet operators, employers like it offer them a question of taking it or leaving it.
The editors often get very high wages, while the editor can sometimes get only EUR 10000 a month, including pension and insurance payments.
As for the holiday, the thing becomes complicated: a certain amount of days in the first year, so and so many after the third, to finally reach 15 holidays after a certain number of years.
But the American journalists, as they themselves admit, will often become "sick" during the year.
It is a question of climate.
UNIPOL: COURT IN ROM: DANILO COPPOLA
The President of the second Chamber of Criminal Court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the real estate agent's request, which had asked to be transferred from Grottaferrata to Rome.
It is determined against Coppola for bankruptcy in the context of the investigation into the counter-agreement in the case of the acquisition of Unipol-Bnl.
During the trial against him during the last week, his release from house arrest was converted into a residence obligation in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked to allow the real estate agent to be moved from the provincial city to an apartment in the capital.
According to the court, such transfers (to whom the prosecutor had spoken) could give him the opportunity to influence his society and to obtain evidence indicting him.
The elite is in danger
The phenomenon had already been revealed a few days ago when the Chamber of Representatives voted against the White House's 700 billion dollar savings package: a large part of the Americans were and are more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This confirms yesterday's edition of the New York Times, which reports on how the crisis in the run-up the Republican Party splits more and more into its old and moderate East Coast soul, which always favoured the state institutions and the business community and those neoconservatives who are hostile to "the people in Washington" and the financial world and, above all, wins voters in the south and the center of the states.
This part of the party owes its rise to the voice of the one I mentioned above.
This example just mentioned, however, is only a small part of the major changes that the current economic earthquake is announcing or even already represents: not only in the United States, but also in the whole West and perhaps beyond, will be affected by them.
Both in the states and in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the long-afraid events that finally take shape and come to light under these new conditions.
The first of these phenomena is the new discovery, the unheard renaissance of the state in conjunction with a kind of renationalization of the economy.
In fact, the crisis means a decline in banking and financial institutions, which have close links with foreign countries and at the same time manage a huge amount of household assets that live in a single state.
This is a direct political problem for governments: how to deal with the families concerned, which also represent a huge mass of voters.
The crisis thus appears economically global, but politically it is almost purely national.
Political internationalism seems to have become self-evident and lost its right to speak: the EU has given clear evidence of this, which, due to its division into various national and international conflicts, does not know how to find a common way.
Therefore, everyone now expects the intervention of their own state; rescue plans, new rules, and, above all, distribution of aid funds: Since the crisis became more and more serious, only the US is in the economic position to save itself without foreign aid.
In addition to the funds, they also have the legitimacy to use them: therefore two conditions which are not too overvalued – in certain circumstances – which otherwise will not be able to use international organization and market in a similar way.
That new emphasis, which is placed on the national-state element, is also in perfect harmony with the increasing importance that is recently associated in the economy with a most closely related sector: territoriality.
Paradoxically, it is now when we were so convinced that we have long since entered a networked whole empire, into a realm of ever-differentiated technologies, of the immaterial, that at once we have to see how our future will depend more and more on the essential material things: water, harvest and oil.
These can certainly all be transported from one place to the other of the world, but are still connected to an extremely narrow piece of earth – a territory.
Therefore, the person who has such a territory is in advantage of someone else who lives in a yieldless, waterless or oil-free area.
I now come to the second innovation, which, however, requires a brief boost.
Whoever territories, who government, who says politics, says leadership.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, there is the knowledge of the need for respected leadership, that is, the need for someone who knows how to regulate things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of indignation over the existing leadership, especially those of the economy which have emerged as insufficient and full of shadow zones.
In addition, there is a deeper and, in a sense, still disturbing aspect: a loss of confidence, an indifference, an image of indifference, a feeling of distance, all aimed at an entire class of managers of the Western countries.
It seems to be the conviction among many of the population that it is not only the deeds of the social elite, but already their world of ideas, their way of life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose salary the majority of them represent as ever more alien and overwhelming.
The demand for leadership thus nourishes underground a branched but powerful movement of demage of the leading class and of the conventional political establishment. This is manifested in unforeseen "revolts" of voters and in the unmediated transformation of the collective state of mind of the past: starting with the rise of the conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, about the collapse of the Labour Party in Great Britain, towards the rebellion of American Americans against Bush (and perhaps also the victory of the right in Italy plays a role here).
One gets the impression that the old elite, its parties, its programs, but also its rites, magazines, intellectual creditors, some would say its format, more and more problems of understanding and therefore less representative value regarding what is going on in the lower social layers of the West these days and is being reinforced and driven from the financial crisis to overdimensionality.
In view of all of this, it would simply be exaggerated to speak of a "rebellion of the masses".
But keeping your eyes wide open is certainly not.
The super glue that lets go up on walls
To defeat the forces of gravity thanks to a adhesive and to be able to climb walls like Superman.
This is the subject of four American research centres, one of which seems to have reached almost the target.
With a glue applied on an area of only 2.5 m2, the researchers succeeded in fixing a 100 kg body on a vertical wall.
The STUDIO – an American magazine has published the results of the researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the research team is a further development of the adhesives already used, which use a special carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
"The principle of glue can be seen as a series of piles of spaghetti-arranged tubes," explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists have been inspired by the feet of the Geckos, which are covered by microscopic fairy tales that give the animal a perfect hold.
The tests carried out with various materials such as glass teflon and sandpaper have shown that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the durability of the reptiles' feet and at the same time "makes it easy to remove it from the wall," says Liming Dai, researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at Dayton University.
"This material could be used as a transitory adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
For example, how to get up at walls like Spiderman? Perhaps, but the researchers think of less fascinating benefits, such as the connection of electrical devices, because the nanotubes are also heads of heat and electricity.
Other areas of application could fall within the scope of space.
So for the moment, the superheroes have to wait.
THE OTHER ART OF RESEARCH – also the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to a new type of glue.
In an article of the American Chemical Society, Californian scientists present a microfibre adhesive that, like hair, cleans itself from the dust by moving on a surface and thus always retains perfect liability.
Medicines: never take with fruit juice
Beware of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, which are consumed in summer due to their refreshing quality and their vitamin wealth, can cause serious health damage if they are taken at the same time with certain vital drugs, since they can have an extreme effect on the body’s intake.
David Bailey, professor of the University of Western Ontario in London, repeatedly points to the risk of packed as well as fresh fruit juices in combination with drug intake. During the 236th meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he again called for an alarm: a glass of apple, orange or grapefruit juice is sufficient to reduce the absorption capacity of certain vital drugs to the extent that they are practically eliminated and thus endanger the health of patients.
Grapefruit juice was already suspected to be responsible for increasing the effects of some drugs such as antibiotics, antiasthmatics, cardiovascular medications, anxiolytic and neurological drugs, up to toxic levels.
MEDICAMENTS IN FAIR – The same Agency of the medicinal product in a report two years ago warned doctors and patients about the dangers of this mixture, and stressed that it should be taken into account in combination with medicines such as diazepane or metadon.
IT IS NOT GRAPEFRUIT ONLY – according to the experts, orange juice and apple juice contain substances that can inhibit the medicines.
The list of active substances inhibited by fruit juices is long.
The appeal of Michele Carruba, director of the Università Statale di Milano, therefore: "Such results are usually transmitted immediately to the various international manufacturers who are free to change the consumer information.
Therefore, it is recommended that you always read the package leaflet and, if there is still any ambiguity, do not be afraid to ask a pharmacist or a doctor," says the expert at the Ansa Agency.
Nobel Prize for Economics goes to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize is to the American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the establishment of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a Neokeynesian who teaches at the University of Princeton and is known for his regular articles for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration's economic and external policy.
A few months after the attacks of September 11, 2001, during the days of Enron's collapse, Krugman had claimed in an editorial of the New York Times that this second event was more decisive for the history of the USA than the attacks.
A prediction that received not little polemics in response and was held up to the economist even years later, but is now proven to be completely correct.
"I am surprised and also shocked at how quickly the memory of the scandals in the context of the collapses of Enron or Worldcom disappeared from the public perspective," said Krugman at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "econom of great value", but also a banalist with a "very aggressive style which is particularly directed against the excessive liberalism of the Bush government."
Open Office, it appears the third version of the "Anti-Microsoft" package
The day of release of OpenOffice.org 3.0 has come; the Open Source software is gaining an increasing number of users, both at home and in the office, both among free-lancers and public administration, as a free replacement for Microsoft's Office.
After a year of intensive work by the voluntary developers monitored by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office is now presenting itself to the public with some innovations: in addition to a revised and now more sparsely designed start-up menu, there is now finally a ground-breaking compatibility with Apple's Mac OS x operating system, as well as support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, which is the latest standard ISO version.
In addition, attention was paid to compatibility with Microsoft’s Office 2007, whose new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) can be read by OpenOffice.
Interesting are also some new features, such as those that allow to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, which facilitates e.g. sending via e-mail. This includes the possibility to import PDF files into graphic graphic graphics modules and at the same time preserve the original appearance of the page.
Thus, "hybrid" PDF files can now be generated, which expand the typical graphics of Adobe format with the elements of a table and a word processing system.
Cooperation is one of the most improved elements of the applications: tables can now be processed by different users in a multi-hand manner, thus changing conflicts in the event of changes; in the case of the word processing system, a frabe is assigned to each processor in order to guarantee a better correction process.
Some companies are just about to publish various features of OpenOffice on the Internet (on the cloud), while the final result is to be made public in the coming weeks.
The Italian version is available for download on the following link: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html. It follows the English version, which has been on the mirror since Friday.
Besides for Windows and Mac OS, the program is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, you can send the installation CD to your home or office.
However, if freedom of movement can be an incentive for the dissemination of the programme in private households, it is also particularly in the field of business where OpenOffice could succeed: after all, various public administration and schools have already passed to OpenOffice.
In fact, there is not even a lack of training, which means optimal help for small and medium-sized enterprises, and thus even opens business prospects.
OpenOffice consists of five main components: Writer, the Word corresponding text-making program; Calc, the table-based program that aims to displace Excel; Impress, to create presentations such as PowerPoint; Dbase to operate databases instead of the more familiar access; and finally Draw, a graphics module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads – a goal that can easily be exceeded with already reached 3 million and 600 thousand.
Even carbon tested positively and thus the fourth doping case
It opens up a new doping case within the framework of the previous Tour de France: it is the Austrian athlete Bernhard Kohl of the team Gerolsteiner, who is the third-classified and winner of the jersey of the best climber.
The news published the daily L'Equipe on its website.
The 26-year-old Kohl by the team Gerolsteiner is the fourth driver to be tested positively on Cera, the third-generation epoch. Previously, this was the case with the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli as well as the German Stefan Schumacher.
The analyses from the blood samples of Kohl are among those carried out in recent weeks by the laboratories Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-tests now confirm the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place and be excluded from the race for two years.
The head of the French anti-doping commission Pierre Bordry confirmed the positive epoch and, according to the Associated Press, also informed the Austrian responsible.
The 26-year-old Austrian rose to the stage behind the Spaniard Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans and also claimed the jersey of the best climber for himself.
THEME IMPLEMENTATION: THE NEW YORK TIMES QUESTION: IS ITALY RASSISTIC?
Italy, "the former country of immigrants has recently become one of the preferred countries for immigrants", which are only welcomed with reluctance.
Does this make Belpaese a nation of racists? This is what the New York Times asks in a long article dedicated entirely to the subject of racism in Italy, which is based on the case of the young Abdul William Guibre, born in Burkina Faso, who was murdered a month ago in Milan after stealing a pack of cookies.
The case testifies to what the Times call "Paradox of the North": the northern regions are those in which "most integration and job opportunities exist", and yet "the highest degree of anti-immigrationist sentiments and the greatest support of the Lega North".
As confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Times draws on further episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not only this.
The new legislation against immigration introduced by the Lega and the rapid expulsion of illegal immigrants is also cited as a sign of climate change in Italy.
A movement that also underlined the Pope and the President of the State: "Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope at a meeting on the Quirinal for a cooperation between Church and State to combat racism."
Students Victims of up to 900-Euro per room high rental prices
The market for apartments for students knows no crises.
According to the last study of the Sunia, the tenant union, a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"This phenomenon has already taken very serious steps. Whole groups of students are losing their right to study, as their families are not able to support them at this level" – according to the Sunia responsible, Laura Mariani – "in these cities the great demand of the students leads to a deforming of the market, which has also damaged the other inhabitants.
In addition, most of the rental offers include a number of infringements: free contracts, missing registrations, no rent price limit, unauthorized subcontracting.
For the Sunia, there is a need for exceptional measures, which lead to lower rent prices through a revision of taxation.
When considering the study more closely, it turns out that a bed in Milan is needed in the Brianza district about 450 euros; a single room starts at 650 euros (in the Nere district) and ends with 800 euros in the Lambiate, Udine and Fiera district or even 900 euros in the Vittoria district.
In Florence, a bed costs an average of 350/400 euros, a room 700.
In Bologna, where the students focus in the neighborhoods around the university, 250/280 euros are for a sleeping place of needs, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, prices in the districts around the university are about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a sleeping place in a double room.
Only a little deeper are the rents in the neighbourhoods around the other universities of Rome: 550 euros in Ostiense and Cinecittà.
Only those in outlying districts can save money: 300 euros for a sleeping place and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar quarters.
In Naples you need 300-450 euros for a sleeping place, for a room the price is between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive neighborhoods, the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari a bed costs 250-350 euros, a single room at least 350.
In the smallest cities, prices are lower, but they have a greater weight in the urban economy.
In the cities where the phenomenon of renting to non-European students is more common, such as Perugia, there is even another anomaly: a rental that is 25-30% higher than the average is required by foreign students.
Goodbye to the old cinema Paradiso – the cities close their historic cinemas
The historical cinemas close because of the favored multiplex kinos.
"A city without cinemas is a blind city, like a face without eyes."
This image of the director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect what is currently happening in the major urban centres of Italy, and also in the provinces.
The process of exclusion of cinemas, which began with the birth of the large multi-salt complexes in the periphery, in the long run means death for the one-salt cinema in the center. A process that not only appears inevitable and irrevocable, but also carries the traits of a cultural crime.
The most affected are historical places full of memories, "it is like losing a friend with whom one has covered a piece of street full of emotions," said the director of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso", who brought him the Oscar and the great prize of Cannes 20 years ago. It is about the history of a suburban cinema and its nostalgia, which consists of living in a cinema world that is lost forever.
The figures provided by the Anec, the central trade association, speak a clear language: over the last five years, the enormous number of 316 traditional cinemas have been closed; these series paid mostly the cinemas in the major cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
The most affected regions include Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41.
This is evidenced by the fact that the main culprits are the multiplex kinos, because they are precisely these three regions in which the largest number of these modern cinemas has been registered: at 195 in the last 5 years, Lombardy has led the lists, 81 in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"The business has developed in an irrational way," said Paolo Protti, the president of Anec, "it is useful that new structures arise, but first of all the preservation of the already existing, because a hall in the city is closed, not all its regular customers are willing to visit a multiplex cinema in the periphery instead of the old one.
And here the lack of budget for the trade association's fund remains clear: the debt burden recorded by the state is about 10 million euros.
It is a shame from the ethical-moral point of view that the government does not respect the existing laws.
To preserve the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros in the year would be necessary."
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which, due to the fears surrounding the old cinemas, has decided to protect it by an agreement between the municipality and the Anec; it is the first agreement of this kind in Italy that aims to protect and support traditional cinemas, both in the historical centre and in the periphery.
Among the measures foreseen are tax advantages for cinema operators as well as benefits for the public in relation to local transport: it will be allowed to drive to the traffic-limited areas of the centre and also to park at more affordable parking fees.
"It's a happy initiative," says Giuseppe Tornators, "I hope that other cities will follow our example and also design new concepts.
But we certainly also need better audio and video equipment in order to be able to do something against the superpower of the multiplex halls, because finally the audience of today is more demanding.
The defence of traditional cinema has always been an important topic for me: the closure of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the crucial point that led me to establish the "Nuovo cinema Paradiso", even though I had played with the thought for 10 years.
For 25 years I have been living in Rome; when I pass the Rialto or Quirinale in the Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn aside to avoid seeing the dust-covered posters.
The links between politics and 'Ndrangheta' lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to adapt the decisions of the municipality to the interests of the Piromalli Mafia group.
The accusations made by the Antimafia authorities in Calabria against the mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his deputy Rosario Schiavone of the municipality of Gioia Tauro, arrested this morning for being involved in mafia business, are serious.
Gioacchino Piromalli, the older mediator between the clan and the public administration, as well as his nephew, was also taken in handcuffs: the lawyer, who bears the same name as the boss of the clan, had already been sentenced for being involved in criminal associations of the Mafia, at that time to a compensation sum of 10 million euros.
"Every kind of moral and legal norm disregarding," the lawyers write, "had the two local administrations decided to pay the lawyer Piromalli money for advisory activities."
"This made it possible for the Mafia group – according to the judges – to officially penetrate the town halls and to determine the policy of the public administration."
The President of the Kalabrias Agazio Loiero Regional Committee does not deny that in his region "it is anything but an exception to encounter links between local administrations and organised crime." "There are places in which the concentration of mafia is greater than in which such links are practically inevitable.
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'Ndrangheta: heroes who get a white vest."
The arrests of this morning follow those of last July, with which the Clan Piromalli police decapitated.
Since the end of April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, but already in 1991 – and even then due to alleged links between organized crime and local administration – the local politicians of its municipal offices had been removed.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of the Udc, was elected head of the Middle Right Coalition in May 2006.
He shouted scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He was interested in the Deputy Minister Marco Minniti, whom he accused of inventing everything for political-strategic reasons, but the judges, in connection with the arrest warrant of this morning, declare that the Piromalli clan had even dared to apply for a change to the A3 project.
From a cut-off action in connection with the Dal Torrione case studies, the willingness to meet the wishes of an entrepreneur, who is known to be a representative of the large group around the Piromalli – making the public administration's actions identical to the interests of this clan."
When the energy emerges from the waves, suddenly the big ones run up
It is a non-defining money source that covers more than 70% of the planet's surface, and only now do these seem to understand the world's major energy companies.
Waves, currents and tides are the new renewable energy sources that are now all looking at, and also looking for occupying, such as giants like Chevron.
The possibility of extracting energy from the marine movements has been considered and examined for 70 years; these studies have not happened to be considerably intensified since the first oil crisis.
When the price of oil broke down around 1980 the idea of marine energy was gassed, but now the environmental organizations and the increased oil price are pressing for new impetus in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the global energy needs could be met by the ocean waves.
This would be equal to the double of the energy currently produced by nuclear power plants.
In addition, the currents and tides would be added.
Giants on the attack.
The first company that now relies on marine energy is Enersis, who has signed in 2005 a contract for the construction of a power plant in northern Portugal.
When this message was published, it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, there are now more and more companies from the traditional energy industry that rely on marine energy extraction.
"Chevron investigates these technologies" – according to the spokesperson of a company known to the American giant in the Wall Street Journal – and weighs the opportunity to cooperate with us."
This is about the procurement of an approval from the American Energy Commission, which is necessary to launch a project off the coast of Alaska.
This is a sign that is not to be underestimated, especially when one considers that oil is still being mined by the US in Alaska, and President Bush recently launched the plans for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey, which invest in the new industry, are also not known about the details, so observers are talking about increasing interest.
Even better technologies.
Experts are talking about a technology that is still under way, not least because the last doubts on the part of the environmentalists have not yet been resolved.
So far, projects such as those in Portugal and also Scotland have a rather small dimension and do not seem to cause any serious ecological problems.
However, to produce energy on a large scale, technologies with far greater impact on the environment are needed.
There are several possibilities: Ocean Power uses a system of interconnected bows for example.
The thrust of the waves, which moves the bows up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure within the swimmer via pistons and cylinders.
This drives a turbine, which in turn operates a generator.
The current is then sent to the coast via underwater lines.
So far, there are four planned plants of this kind that are only waiting for the government's approval, and some of the energy obtained could also serve military facilities.
However, Verdant Power is already producing energy for a department store and a parklatz with the help of underwater turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movement during the tide drives the turbines, which feed the generator through the resulting rotational movement.
According to Verdant, a long queue of potential clients is already waiting for the necessary authorizations to use these energy sources.
First the waves, then the tides.
According to the Institute for Electricity Extraction Research, a particular interest is immediately worth the potential that lies in the tides.
Although it is also an irregular phenomenon, the tides are better predictable than wind currents, sun exposure and also waves, and therefore a more trustworthy source of electricity.
It is tidal energy that led states like New York, Maine and Alaska as well as other coastal states to invest 7.5 million dollars in 2008 – up to 35 million are already planned for 2009.
