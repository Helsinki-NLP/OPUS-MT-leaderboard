No liberating amendment for Tymoshenko by Parliament
The Ukrainian Parliament today rejected the request to abolish paragraphs under an amendment to the Criminal Code, on the basis of which the opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko had been condemned.
The new regime, which could have pave the way for the liberation of the prisoned Prime Minister, rejected the second reading of the request for a reduction of penalties for economic offences.
Timoshenko had been sentenced to seven years in prison in October for concluding an alleged adverse agreement with Russia on the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not yet valid; in December the appeal of the convicted shall be negotiated before the Court.
Timoshenko himself describes the judgment as the political revenge of the regime, and also in the West the trial raised the suspicion of the bias of the court.
The request to remove point 365, on the basis of which the Prime Minister was condemned, from the Criminal Code, was supported by 147 Members.
226 votes would have been necessary for its adoption.
Libya Victory
The history of the Libyan liberation struggle or Libyan rebellion already knows its losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
Now only the winners have to be defined.
As usual in this region, in the elections Islamists prevail, the question is only which - the moderate or the radical.
The National Transitional Council acknowledged the ordinary right of the Scharīēa, of which one now has a certain idea with God.
Libya would go to the country without crime, because for theft, the hand is cut off in short.
Women too should quickly forget thoughts of emancipation, any religious rebels are executed, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, society will in future be united by the Qur'an.
In short - in Libya there will be an order which would hardly be imaginable in this country and, above all, would hardly be desirable.
Only - our lifestyle is not the only and objectively not the best and would hardly fit the mentioned Libyans.
In this way, it is rather strange that the Muslim fighters could even be helped by the unbelieving dogs.
To excuse her, it may be only the fact that NATO's air raids were directed not by any general from America, but by God himself, whose omnipotence was praised after every successful hit.
The winner in Libya, the West isn't one of them.
We only took part in a fire change, served the interests of Islam, and our politicians got rid of themselves in the person of the dictator of a political ally, without any advantage.
After the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we preferred to abandon the military occupation of Libya.
This leaves the Hiese a concern - that is, the expulsion of the crusaders.
But do the mineral oil companies also get the black gold at a spot price without occupation?
Perhaps hardly and so the West can finally boast of its unselfishness in the protection of human rights.
If they do not destroy the representatives of the Scharīāa.
Start of a new crisis era
France and the rest of Europe in the focus of investors.
On Tuesday, a statistical storm broke across Europe.
The Member States published their data on their GDP for the third quarter.
The Czech economy stagnated compared to the previous quarter, Germany and France.
But the bond market is tearing all the records today.
Investors not only keep an eye on Greece, but also Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the European Zone, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries published their preliminary forecasts of economic development in the third quarter.
As expected, Germany's GDP grew by 0.5%, compared with France by 0.4%.
At the same time, both countries corrected their data for the second quarter in which Germany recorded higher growth than originally expected (growth by 0.3% instead of forecasting 0.1%), while France granted a slight decrease by 0.1% (original data only spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew 1.5 percent in this year's third quarter compared to the previous year.
However, compared to the previous quarter, the gross domestic product stagnated, and according to the Statistical Office, this confirmed the trend of slowing down in economic performance.
The results are therefore worse than the forecasts of the analysts.

The Czech economy grew 1.5 percent in this year's third quarter compared to the previous year, but stagnated compared to the previous quarter.
Preliminary and seasonally calculated data show that the German economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter.
Over the entire euro area and in the EU, the economy recorded growth of 0.2 percent between July and September compared to the previous quarter, in line with the expectations of analysts.
The Greek economy decreased by 5.2 percent compared to the previous year.
The yield from their 10-year government bonds climbed the value of 28.45%.
The yield of the Italian and Spanish government bonds increased to their critical limits.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries are also starting to feel problems...
The yield on Czech government bonds is below 4%, although the situation in the region is worsening.
In Germany, votes are made, the ECB should become the creditor of the last instance.
The Czechs qualified for EURO
In Montenegro they won 1:0 and now celebrate their qualification for 200 million
The football selection has mastered the most difficult task of the whole season!
Thanks to a well placed goalkeeper Čech and a magnificent gate of Petr Jiráček, she won 1:0 in Montenegro.
With a large portion of luck, Czech football has been able to defend its luxurious advantage from home game and will once again not be lacking in the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the ascent in a detailed report.
Little excitement in the first half-time and a huge portion of luck in the second.
The Czech selection also won quite happily 1:0 thanks to the weakness of the home team, a brilliant Čech's and the hero of the day Jiráček in Montenegro and thus paid off their ticket for the football-EM.
Because of the precise defence play of the Czech team, they can only put more pressure on the Montenegrins in the second half of the year.
The matchbirds of the game were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who shot two huge chances.
Thanks to an excellent Petr Čech, the Czech selection will also be involved in the European Championships next year, and it is also gratifying that a premium of around 200 million will be paid to local football.
From the first minutes of the season, quite a combative football was played.
Both teams combined in a long time and were thus played mainly around the middle line.
In the second half of the year, the pressure from the home team remained, and the wide cuts in front of the penitentiary were successfully repudiated by the Czech defence.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's core programme.
They formed a living sign.
Some hundred university students formed a living sign around a core object in Iran.
With this gesture, they wanted to demonstrate their support for their country's core programme before a possible Israeli attack.
The students prayed before the object on Tuesday afternoon and then announced death to the USA and Israel.
A few hundred students from the University of Isfahan in Iran formed a lively sign around the core technology center in Isfahan on Tuesday, where uranium is processed.
They wanted to announce that they were willing to protect their country's core programme, if necessary with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently noted in its report that Iran did not seem to have abandoned all its efforts to secure a nuclear weapon.
In Israel, too, we are talking about a possible attack on Iranian nuclear plants.
Students had prayed on the afternoon before the entrance to the complex and then announced death to the USA and Israel.
According to the Israeli press, in the event of an attack to paralyze the Iranian nuclear programme, the nuclear enrichment plant in Nathan’s target from the center of Isfahan would also be the goal of the attack.
The menu of a fatty child: It does not breakfast and eats to the evening bread sausage
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 have problems with overweight, with 9 percent of all pupils and 5 percent of all children overweight.
Recent surveys have shown - obese children mostly come from families with unhealthy lifestyles.
This shows once again how important it is for a person’s healthy development to be the environment in which he grows up and is the examples that surround him.
On the tables of obese children, sausages are half more common on the table than in families where normal-weight children live.
More than 19 percent of overweight children had the evening bread on the previous day of the Enlightenment campaign under the motto "Adipositas is not a coincidence".
In families with Dickerchen, sports are not one of the favourite jobs, however, as far as the majority of today's students are concerned - only 15 percent replied that their parents find themselves at least once a week for active movement.
Survey of 900 children
The survey took place last year towards the end of the school year, with almost 900 children from primary schools surveyed throughout the Czech Republic.
This was already the second year of the action "Adipositas is not a coincidence" supported by the General Health Insurance Office and Unilever.
To date, more than 12 thousand students from 4th and 8th classes have participated in the project.
Unhealthy food and lack of exercise in the family are crucial factors that are responsible for the alarmingly increasing number of children with overweight or even obesity.
"Only half of the children surveyed suggested, for example, five times a day eating breakfast-second breakfast lunch-vesper dinner - one of the main prerequisites for a healthy diet," says one of the survey results.
No breakfast and sausage for dinner
Experts point out that relative small things, such as the regular breakfast time of the family, are also important for the healthy development of a child.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23 percent of the students' families are breakfast.
And - in most families everyone eats for themselves.
The worst finding was the fact that every tenth family does not have breakfast at all.
Breakfast is considered the foundation of the healthy daily diet.
The survey test showed, among other things, that the families of overweight children consume much more often unhealthy pommes.
And almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet lemonades every day (70 percent)
Although more than 40 percent of the children surveyed do sports, only less than half of their parents do so - i.e. only 15 percent.
Create your own menu
Another part of the survey enabled selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to make up their own food plan from available appetite and opinion.
"What Czech children between the ages of 12 and 15 prefer in terms of diet is far from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Among their favorite dishes were many flour dishes, meat dishes and, of course, sweet foods.
"Alerting is especially the great popularity of sweet lemonades," is highlighted in the final report on this survey.
At lunch, i.e. the main dish, pasta won just before poultry.
The children hardly liked legumes and the popularity of fish and vegetable dishes as lunches was very small.
Return to Health
At the same time, the survey also showed that the children are quite willing to change their eating habits if they get correct information.
"In many cases, the control group of the participants who completed the questionnaire after completing the illuminating lecture "Adipositas is not a coincidence" had a marked shift in preferences towards the principles of healthy nutrition," is mentioned in the results of the project.
This was obvious, for example, with the sweet limos, where many children began to give priority to ordinary water.
The children also crossed many poultry or fish in the questionnaire as the main dish of the day and were ready to eat less noodles or sweet food.
Pros claim - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the introductory article on how to learn stylists, I had a bit of a joke that this was a bit too much stuff for the beginning.
I didn't know what was going to happen.
Lectures by three professionals from the industry, the clothing of problematic figures and a seminar on how the "on the square" runs.
It's supposed to be worse.
The closer the examination, the more information and practical tasks are ahead of us.
But even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is still fully occupied.
This time we debated with Director Alena (no one takes part in the course), how to attract a woman who has no ideal proportional figure.
And that's what most of us are.
Some have one too short neck, others one too young figure without proper curves and others are chubby.
It is up to the stylist to optically cover wide shoulders, extend the neck or conjure up the necessary curves.
We also got tips on how to put on a woman type like Jennifer Lopez - with big busts, wide hips and narrow waist - pretty and figure-faced, without her acting too provocative.
For example, if the difference between waist and hip is so great that the skirt or pants really do not fit, you should at least have a piece cut to size.
You will certainly not regret that, because well-sitting clothes are simply priceless.
In such a tailor-made skirt one feels much better than in one of the rod that always slips up and down, in the waist, etc.
Young figures can, in turn, be allowed to wear clothes with folds, kittens, applications, embroidery or raffles.
With this amount of information and figure types, I am glad that I have a whole week to let everything go through my head thoroughly.
And yet I'm afraid it's almost impossible to do it in the face of the assigned homework.
Each of the students was assigned a Celebrities for which she is supposed to make up suitable outfits - daywear and evening cream.
We should take into account the current look, the fashion style of the corresponding star and its figure type.
I'm supposed to "put on Miranda Kerr" you might know from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
I'm happy inside, because that's much better for me personally than for example to wear Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who's probably increased to a hundred kilos in recent times (well, that's a bit exaggerated), or also the young Selena Gomez.
We should cut the clothes out of magazines or search the Internet, print them out, and then work them graphically.
In the moodboard, as the whole result is called, our very personal style and our relationship to graphic design are to be expressed.
It is very important to think about the graphic side of the styling.
The stylist not only attracts the models physically, but also designs the so-called product page in the journals (according to specific specifications, e.g. trend handbags, coats, etc.).
The stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about this.
But not until Sunday.
That means a stylist must have a good overview.
The Saturday talk, filled with information about figure types, was equally seasoned by three visitors from the industry:
by the stylist Jan Pokorný, by the fashion artist Jakub Polanga and by the fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is illusion and that a stylist should be able to exploit it.
And a skilled stylist can work with a single garment in quite different ways.
The magic word is variability.
For example, you can wear a trenchcoat as usual over the jeans, like a T-shirt or coat, but you can also wear it on the naked body, wear heel shoes and wear it as a dress.
It's enough to squeeze up the sleeves or collars and the whole look looks very different.
"Play with it," he stressed.
But most of all, I found the following advice: "First of all, you need to know the rules perfectly."
"Only then can you hurt her," said Jakub.
Finally, I realize why we have to break all these teachings, what you can combine with something, and why, even if you often see something different in fashion journals.
Not to mention fashion shows.
Thanks to the photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist must have prepared many more clothing variants than he eventually photographed.
So you have to be prepared for a fashion story with ten sides (i.e. ten outfits) to style at least fifteen.
And also that the clothing on the photo in combination with other accessories sometimes looks quite different than in reality.
So you have to expect all of this in the design of the outfit.
That image and style sometimes account for half of the success, Jan Pokorný also confirmed us.
You just need to look at Madonna, a not exactly brilliant singer, who made image and marketing a world star.
In the Czech Republic one is more reserved to the services of a stylist.
Also well-known personalities often think this is money (the main thing is that I bring something that I look like is secondary).
And if one of us can be stylized, then we should expect that he or she will most likely impose on us a very different (smaller) size than he or she actually needs.
Then you only need to googlen after that, to be sure that the boulevard press writes that the corresponding celebrity has increased or decreased again, etc.
On Sunday, Jan and Mario encouraged us not to believe that a stylist only needs to focus on fashion and then "assembly" the outfit.
In his work, he has to communicate with the people he is styling and he must be a woven psychologist.
Appreciate people without offering themselves and standing up for his opinion.
"If any manager orders us to see her wardrobe and complete it with pretty pieces, then we can't clear the entire closet and tell her - my God, that's terrible."
"You have to find at least some praiseworthy things to which you recommend what you can carry," says Mario.
He also showed us quite specifically what such a so-called "placebag" must contain.
So this is a bag that you take to the waist and carry all the necessary prophecies.
In addition to such clear things as scissors, hair removers or safety needles, it also contains such utensils as a nylon thread (so the stylist helps in photographing products such as handbags or hats), special clips with which the clothing is rubbed back if it is too large (stick needles or other clamps are prohibited so that the fabric does not break) and of course sewing.
But so that we can not only listen, but also try something practical, we learned how to stick shoes properly.
Even when photographing in the studio, where the floor is right, you can damage the shoe sole, let alone the outside.
We glueed and glued to us...
You can't even touch the shoes with the scissors, so you don't damage them.
So you really have to do it skillfully.
Mario pleased me by praising my "creation" without restrictions.
The skill mentioned is not exactly my strength.
All this was only the fraction of what we heard at the second weekend continuing course.
One thing has become clear to me now - to devote oneself to styling at a professional level is not a children's game.
V Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal race across America
Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image
The originally carefree ride is caused by a series of completely preventable, dilettant errors to travel to the early shift.
Although it was possible to fulfill the ambitions to a large extent, what is useful if no one obviously wanted to do a little more.
Even before he came to the store tables, the new part with the subtitle "The Run" raised high expectations.
After all, he promised to move the already age-old game series " Need for Speed" again into a new dimension and in the playable demonstration examples he did not seem to be just one of many action games.
We were also curious about the fit passages in which the main protagonist gets out of the car and continues walking.
But how you're used to it at NFS is a lot different in the end than you expected.
Sure - it may be quite decent arcade races, but overall the game is reduced by some superfluous errors that have been present in this series for more or less years.
So it is no longer mistakes, but rather signs of an incomprehensible laziness of the game developers.
The adventure starts very well.
For the first time, one is introduced into history, whose main character Jack has some personal problems; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, that is, on the west coast, one is on the steering wheel - with the task of being the first in New York.
The basic idea contains a whole series of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into ten stages and more than fifty individual races.
This means that each race is held on a different track and that the stages take place in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
You don't have the impression that game would always offer the same thing.
Some environments are still very nice to look at, although the technical level of the graphics does not go beyond that of the earlier parts of the series.
So nothing moving around the world.
But the journey through the desert, through autumn landscape or high up through deep snowy landscape has been very pleasant visually.
Occasionally, untypical elements bring a little variety into the individual races.
In the desert, for example, one is surprised by a desert tower, which greatly restricts the view.
In the mountains, in turn, you have to be careful not to be thrown by an avalanche.
By the way, the individual races are installed fairly well in succession.
Just a few, but they're enough.
For a while you try to overtake the prescribed number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then you have to pick up time (classical race against the stop watch), then you expect a personal duel with a single opponent.
And the police are also interfering, trying to mess up the whole thing.
A novelty are passages where Jack leaves the car.
This is more about some interactive animations in which Jack flees from someone and where the player has to help him by pressing the right button at the right moment.
So nothing complicated.
However, it is surprising that there are much less such passages in the game than one would expect (concretely only three).
In the end, this is more to the advantage of this, because this element has at least no chance of getting bored - it is in the context of the above mentioned elements that make the game more varied.
The driving model runs in the footsteps of the previous parts.
That is, from today's point of view, it does not rip any trees, on the other hand it could not be claimed that it would be bad.
If you are looking for realistic simulations, you have to look around elsewhere.
But the race will continue to be very good for an action-laden race, although one could find better in the competition.
Until then, everything is in the best order.
Real problems arise only after some time.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not quite O.K.
A game of this kind is hardly expected to calculate complicated deformities and collisions, but if you have virtually no impact on any object idea how the car behaves, then obviously not everything is all right.
Typical example: When you get close to overtaking or passing an adversarial car, you only "strip" the other car in some places easily, but in other, almost identical situation you get into the sling and turns wild pirouettes.
Or the cart's going to scrap.
Thanks to the restart system, it doesn't matter, but it's all annoying.
The restarts are solved this way: if you have total damage or if you land far away from the route, then throw the game back at the last point of reference of the route.
Only - in each race you only have five restarts.
Once you've exhausted them, everything goes from the front.
So the restarts are more like a tool, in case something fails, but one shouldn't rely on them.
Sometimes, however, the restart does not even help, there is nothing other than to learn the critical section from the mind.
The same things often happen in the same places.
Some curves, for example, have to pass through in a very specific way, otherwise you just don't fit through.
Elsewhere you always meet "civil" cars in the same configuration at the appropriate place, no matter if you arrive as first or fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is particularly annoying in situations when one sees that the opponent passes in front of a playful car, but until one arrives there, the cars are already in such a position that one has to drive or brake them.
And it doesn't matter when you get there, because everything is designed to always get close to this situation.
The contractors have other advantages.
Throughout the game there are a few places where one is always overtaken at the same place by the same opponent and also here again without consideration for the time.
The craziest thing to do is to finish the game on the long bridge that you happen in opposite direction.
The opponent must obviously pick up a devil here.
And if he's in front of one, he'll take a look at you, of course, so you start driving your own car in Klump a few times.
Of course - you just want to make the game more exciting and exciting but this intention is so clear that it quickly hires you the joy of playing.
And that's a shame, because despite a simpler driving model, the game in general is quite entertaining and sometimes also so packed that you almost don't know where your head is.
And in principle, no matter what "debt" it is - the concept with fifty unique routes, the arrangement of the races in a way that no boredom can occur, or something quite different...
An unusual idea is also the change of cars in the course of the races.
You must not overlook the gas stations on the track, because it is precisely here that you can change the car, although in most cases the car you just have is enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for the urban areas, the strong American limousines for the straight highways and exotic super sports cars for the technical rides, for example on the Serpentines in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the mode of the game history also goes the task mode (challenges) - i.e. the races in the individual locations you know from the story.
Here there are not only medals, but also points of experience for your own profile, which is common to the tasks (challenges) and history.
In order to reach the higher driver level, different items must be opened: from the car to the backgrounds for the profile.
This is at the same time connected with the online Autolog function, which compares, among other things, its own results with those of other players and also provides for other collective functions.
One of other incomprehensible carvers is a situation in the last race of history.
Here you come by car to a subway tunnel (mineway), where you race in the dark on the railways long (meine way).
On the tacho, numbers between 150 and 200 km/h (meine way), but there comes a subway from the back and goes uncompromisingly to scrap.
In our editors we will probably argue for a long time whether this was a blackout of the game designer or if the authors consider us so stupid.
The technical side is nothing overwhelming, but at least the visual overall impression is quite appealing in most cases and even brilliant here and there.
The more annoying it is that at some exciting moments the rate of the image repetition slows down and sometimes quite dramatic.
This, however, is particularly true of accidents involving a larger number of participants, where a continuous FPS is of no use to them anyway.
The sound reproduction is as far as O.K. and the soundtrack is taste.
In the effort to address a scale as wide as possible rather young audiences, a soundtrack a lá "was created by everyone" - but who buys such a game already because of the music?!
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run? The feelings are rather mixed.
If the game were not reduced by the above totally unnecessary errors, we could have claimed with the breasttone that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But that's how the game looks somehow unfinished.
In itself a great pleasure, but one should be prepared to see these mistakes with the power of airport lights in one's eyes.
Concert of the "Students of the Same Revolution" with singing ensembles of the Karlsuniversity
For the third time, the Festival Festa Academica offers the reconciling of the World Student Day with the anniversary of the Samten Revolution and this together with music experience.
In the course of the festival, the twenty professional and university choirs will present themselves.
The festival will focus on the two concerts that will take place on November 17.
"The Karlsuniversität has a large share in the festival."
"The choir of the Faculty of Education and the Faculty of Humanistic Studies is also represented among the participants and the festival committee is also the rector Václav Hampl," said Jakub Čaloun, head of the organization team.
Absolute highlight of the festival is the public concert of technical school choirs, which will take place on November 17th from 2 p.m. on the square in front of the National Technical Library in Dejvice.
On the program is the composition of the important Czech jazzist Karel Růžička "Celebration Jazz Mass".
In the evening hours the concert "Students of the Same Revolution" (Students of the Same Revolution) will take place in the gala rooms of the Volkshaus in Vinohrady, where there will also be university choirs, choirs of the University of Charles.
Festa Academica sets itself the goal not only to celebrate the World Student Day and to commemorate the 22nd anniversary of the Samten Revolution, but to present choir music to the public at the highest level and to promote the creative collaboration of young people.
The main organizer is the Association of Czech Choirs in cooperation with the Johannes-Kepler-Gymnasium.
Bohuslav Svoboda, mayor of the capital Prague and Václav Hampl, the rector of the Karlsuniversity took over the patronship of the entire event.
The festival will take place from 16 to 20 November in Prague and in Pardubice.
In addition to festival concerts, the schedule includes numerous music meetings, student events, matinees and other events.
Detailed information can be found on the website of the festival www.festaacademica.cz
EU Ambassador Vicenová:
The Czechs have the reputation of negativeists and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has made the balance felt among the individual institutions."
I didn't expect such a hard war to burn."
"It will take five or six years for the waves to be smoothed down and all to become accustomed to their new role," began Milena Vicenová, the Czech Ambassador to the European Union, quite sharply speaking at the Faculty of Law.
How seriously she takes the motto of "intelligible and open about Europe" she already showed in the first part of her lecture, in which she managed to describe the individual institutions of the EU and their mutual relations in such a clear and understandable way that she could have envyed some of the lecturers of the Faculty of Law of the University of Charles.
Ms Vicenová also praised the new permanent Chairman of the Council of Europe Herman Van Rompuy:
"At first, criticism became loud that he was too inconspicuous - a grey official who had not grown up to be such a role, but I have to say that it has struck everyone's breath as well as he has accepted the matter.
"He is a person who manages to listen patiently to twenty-seven Member States, communicate with them, and who above all has clear ideas about how to proceed with the EU.
The new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then explained it in response to the question: Who is this, the European Union? What number should I call?", which is an important step towards the agreement and readability of EU policies towards countries such as China or India.
No one wants to forbid our oil hats quarrels
Ms Vicenová also devoted herself to the agenda by which the European Union lived, lived and intended to live in the near future.
The Czech Presidency two years ago called it a success.
The Czechs had mastered the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also organised the Eastern Partnership Summit.
The case of the government during the Presidency described it as a major negative, which had seriously damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
Czech representation in the EU is currently full-fledged.
In the words of the Ambassador, it was not only with the Presidency, but also with the subsequent crisis, which has not yet been overcome, that it was quite hectic.
And the EU's seven-year budget needs to be approved, which makes things much more complicated just because of today's economic situation.
Whether it will be a slender and economical budget, which sectors will be given priority, which countries will be promoted more and which will be less - all of this is now on the agenda.
The Ambassador also recalls her own slogans, with which she came to Brussels: "Intelligible about Europe".
"If I don't like anything, then it's grey accelerators, foreign words and special jargon that nobody understands.
As a citizen, how should I know whether we really want to make up our minds in Brussels, whether we really have a curve or a round cucumber and a variety of big bananas, or whether we really want to be banned from the quarrels.
She would also have liked to use the EU's soil to get more Czechs in European institutions.
Europe of two or more speeds in view
According to the EU Ambassador, the Czechs are called to be Eurosceptics, who are more negative than the positive sides of the matter.
The more annoying the weak representation of Czechs in European institutions is.
This is due to many factors, including the restraint of our candidates, their inability to write letters of motivation and, last but not least, the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, it also stressed the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, the so-called V4.
"Believe me when a Pole or Hungarian comes to me and is a Slovak near, then the Frenchman next to me says, "Hey, what are your heads together - is that your V4 again?" and doing this makes a pretty sour mine.
According to Ms Vicenové, in the future, the EU is primarily expecting tough rules for the budget policies of the Member States.
As much real, as a "European Federation", it sees the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds.
"We have the countries of the eurozone and the countries away from the eurozone.
"We have the Schengen area and we already have the institute of enhanced cooperation."
"For the first time, it was said that only the countries that want it and those who do not want it should be silently away."
"There will be more and more of such institutions, which ultimately leads to a strong "Europe of different speeds", expects Ms Vicenová.
In this respect, she also appreciated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in the implementation of the principle, according to which all topics have to be discussed with an impact on the whole EU by all Member States and not only by the countries of the eurozone.

The Innovator IBM enters the second century of its existence
If one wanted to search for a suitable word that most accurately characterises IBM's strategy, then this would probably be the word "life.
IBM is the synonym for technological revolution for the general public, it is known as a modern company, although since its foundation a century has passed.
The basis for this longevity already laid her first boss - the visionary Thomas J. Watson sen.
Even he represented the slogan that countless worldwide problems could easily be solved if people were willing to think a little.
His slogan "Think!" thus became a trademark for the life of the future giant (and at the same time the title of the company-internal magazine, which was already published at IBM in 1935).
This was also the basis of the company culture thoroughly prepared by Watsen.
"For us from IBM, this long-term thinking means an initial movement towards the future.
IBM survived and was also successful for a whole century because it remained true to its principles and did not hesitate to change everything else all around.
This allowed us to transform the technologies, business and society in the course of our first century.
We hope that we will create even more in the next hundred years," said Samuel J. Palmisano, today's company's director on the occasion of the anniversary.
Well thought-out system
Watson already operated social care of its employees in the 1930s - in a similar way as the entrepreneurshipr Baąa in Czechoslovakia: IBM people had as one of the first American employees paid vacations, an insurance by the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms as workwear and a thoughtful remuneration system for best newcomers and dealers.
The long-term relationships of IBM with their customers are equally sophisticated.
The company was brilliant in talent promotion from the outset - as one of the first companies worldwide raised IBM any discrimination - and was able to choose accordingly.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan that Palmisan at the top of IBM next year is being alternated from a woman - from Virginia Rometty.
She has been with IBM for thirty years, so far she has taken the position of head of the company, marketing and strategy.
IBM has been making so-called online brainstormings in recent years, from which many future strategies and innovations grow.
No wonder - ideas are enough, almost half a million people are employed in the company.
An institution with a good reputation
Their unshakable position in the business guarantees the company a strong image and this to the inside and outside.
"From the beginning IBM had the concept of an institution rather than a mere technology company," said Economist professor of Harvard Business School and author of a book on IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems with technology," added George Colony of Consulting-Company Forrester Research.
As the company itself stresses, it is a difference to be only present on the market or to form it directly through this presence.
IBM - called "Big Blue" in the states of its logo because of family, has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a century.
It is one of the most versatile technology companies ever - IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructures, hosting and consulting services in an incredible product range - from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all American technology companies IBM owns most patents and five of its employees have been awarded the Nobel Prize.
His most famous inventions include, for example, ATMs, credit cards, financial swaps, bar code or the diskette.
With approximately 220 billion dollars of stock exchange value (market capitalization) IBM was the second-largest technology company (equivalent to Apple) this year, which had overtaken Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
The look ahead
Not all products and innovations met the taste of today's customers - unfortunately, for example, the attempt was made with its own OS/2 operating system, the Prodigy online service, or also the IBM PC jr computers.
"Business is based on the forward movement, so don't be emotionally bound to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
So IBM has no problem building its foundation walls on different platforms - and if they don't work to leave them again.
Unlike the opponent Microsoft, which basically stands and falls with its operating system Windows.
Promising technologies
IBM's profits are to the greatest extent involved in services, software and hardware, each involving one-fifth.
In 1990, hardware with a more than fifty percent share was the strongest represented.
Since 2000, IBM has been selling little profit-referring assets worth $15 billion, but at the same time it invested 58 billion dollars in the purchase of future-looking technologies.
In these investments IBM continues after 2008, when the modern financial crisis swept over the world for the first time like a storm.
Again, IBM remained faithful to the legacy of his first boss Thomas J. Watson, who in the midst of the great global economic crisis increased its investment volume.
So far, IBM seems to survive today's crisis unharmed.
The value of IBM shares has increased by 120 percent in rockets since 2008 and the company's net profit is growing.
IBM's company logger is: everything can be changed - only the values not.
That is why it can also be expected that this flexible giant will also address the next crisis.
IBM history: From cheese cutter to space flight
Founded a hundred years ago in New York, IBM (International Business Machines) had a rather complicated name at first - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
She took the name IBM only in 1924 - originally it was a brand name for a branch in Canada and South America.
The foundation stone for IBM's later society was the merger of four companies whose history dates back to the 1980s.
They had technologies such as the famous card watches for registration of the start and end of work.
Charles Ranlett Flint became the architect of this new company, who was also chairman of the Supervisory Board until 1930.
And it was Flint who hired Thomas J. Watson's boss to help him manage the company.
This leader then even put IBM's founders in the shadows - on Watson's ideas to this day the invincible culture and identity of the company.
Watson managed the company until 1952.
IBM, as already revealed by the name, began with the manufacture and distribution of all possible machines for trading - from sausage and cheese cutters, to cash.
In the first four decades in which Watson managed the company, he doubled their sales to nine million dollars and gradually expanded to all continents.
Watson was so indispensable for the company that he was in the head chair for forty years, only then he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence and also developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, technicians and computers from IBM helped to direct flights into space from NASA - to Mercury and Saturn and in 1969 also the famous flight of man to the moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first computer family with the same computer architecture - the IBM System/360 series.
A classic PC that set the computer standard of that time came into the market in 1981 under the name IBM 5150.
Twenty years later IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, but on the other hand bought the consultant part of the company PricewaterhouseCoopers and thereby fully entered into the business with consulting services and services with high added value.
The strategy IBM has paid out over the last three years is the concept of "Smarter Planet".
It embodies the intention to use technologies wisely in not even planned areas, e.g. to improve the situation in transport and in urban administration.
In the trade sector, IBM recently introduced the "Smarter Commerce" platform to help dealers manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
Already in 1932 IBM founded a branch in the former Czechoslovakia - as the first country ever in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today IBM ČR also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The Central for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague and here is also a world-level top researcher team dealing with the technology of poll recognition.
Darina Rychtářová about her unfaithful spouse:
Iveta - this donkey you can keep, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) says - now is the end!
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) had become her lover from the protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), Darina remained the hope that Joseph would wake up from his rosary dream and come home.
But now it is finally over with patience and for the next life it has set clear rules.
"Josef can come home, but no more than my partner," said D. Rychtářová.
When Darina Rychtářová had offered refuge to singer I. Bartošová in her own house, she would not have even come to mind in the dream of her husband.
After 30 days, when Iveta moved out and back to Łíčany, Joseph immediately went along.
Yes, he even publicly confessed that he loved her.
As time went on, Darina resigned, even as if she wanted to reconcile with her unfaithful husband again - but now she finally gave him the running pass.
Rychytář doesn't care who sleeps with his wife
If Rychtář Iveta Bartošová should leave in the future, he will certainly not receive open arms at home.
"He is the biological father of my dreams, and if he wants to decide his days in our common home, I will not drive him out."
"However, not as a beloved, lost old donkey, but as a person to whom I still have certain ties," Mrs. Rychtářová revealed, but she also said that she had already separated herself emotionally from him and insisted solely on mutual decency.
The fact that Darina has locked his back door carries Joseph with dignity so far.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'm staying with Iveta, that doesn't change anything."
"My wife wants a paper marriage and I respect it."
"The company continues, I take care of the repairs, the garden, the property, I make the purchases."
"With Darina I have a normal conversation, but we don't share the bed," said J. Rychtář (the leaf) Blesk.
If Darina wants to find a new love, he won't stop her.
"We don't sleep with each other, so I don't care if she has a friend or who it is.
It's clear to me that this is my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and that's why I take on all responsibility.
The worst female offenders: What about you?
If one asks the men to name some typical female vices, they shake out of their sleeves without exception.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, in which we let a few monsters pass over revue, which let men wall the blood in the veins?
Shopping
Does her husband accuse them of being a shopping addict?
Do you have to buy at least one of them weekly?
Do you like to go shopping and can it be a little more in action?
Then it's really about a weakness in your case.
Some women are at least aware of this and try to keep their shopping desire under control.
But hand at heart, which woman does it hold out, looking for a well-sitting outer garment just to stroll through a clothing shop and not try all (in all possible color combinations) in the cabin?
Although shopping for most women is a hobby, for men it is often the pure hell.
Think about how many times they've already told their husband - you'd better stay outside...
Permanent dissatisfaction
"Am I not too fat?"
"I would have to lose at least five kilos - should I start jogging or gymnastics?"
"Do I like you at all?"
Does that seem familiar to them?
Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image
Then you'll probably be among the women who are really possessed of what they look like.
That doesn't mean you should let yourself go, but many men are allergic to it when their wife is constantly sorry about her appearance.
The stronger sex is in agreement - with increasing frequency of complaints women are increasingly unbearable.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It's a fight against windmills.
Clean windows, wipe tiles and dust, shake the tub - and this at least twice a week.
Do you blame her partner for once again trampling on the clean tiles with dirty shoes, but do you insult the children because the just sloppy sink is dirty again and because the glass door on the living room cabinet has fingerprints again, where polishing makes so much effort?
If you suffer from this kind of "deviance", you should know that you must not exaggerate anything and that order and cleanliness in family life are not the first priority.
This immeasurable form of purity can ultimately also damage mutual relations and, above all, peace in the family.
Stricks
"Smooth gymnastics come into the laundry basket."
"Do you really want to put the old socks on again tomorrow?"
"You don't just throw a wet towel on the floor."
If your partner is exposed to such a tyrade, you must not be surprised that this brings him to the palm tree.
Of course it's not bad, they just want all of that to have its order.
If the men knew this, then the women might not need to meddle so much.
Clutter and trache
Some women like to clapping and kicking, there is a whistling behind the back or even slandering or forging alliances.
Women are now focused on relationships, so they like to dig through such issues as, for example, who, where, with whom, how and why.
Probably each of us women has a little harmless clap and prank in stock.
Hand at heart - that's probably all women's own.
But this is not to be confused with claws of coarse calibers, to whom nothing and no one is sacred, who probably despises everyone in their surroundings and who poses a significant danger, especially for women's collectives.
Jágr and Voráček helped Philadelphia win with her assistants
Jaromír Jágr, a Hockey stormer, played a major role in the NHL's Monday game with two assists on the 5-3 victory of Philadelphia on the ice in Carolina, making it the most productive Czech player in the NHL.
In both cases Claude Giroux, who added an assistant and was declared the best player of the match, was a beneficiary of the overview of the thirty-nine-nine-year-old ice hockey star.
Two assists in the same game also recorded Jágr's co-player Jakub Voráček.
After the game, Jágr told journalists that he had a great evening prophesied to Giroux.
"Just before the game, I'm telling him that he's succeeding today."
I felt that somehow."
"Hin and again such a feeling is happening," said Jágr, after whose action Giroux already scored a goal at the first shot of the Flyers.
A little later, the second hit had "a Czech track".
Voráček fought the puck behind the Hurricanes' gate and presented it between the circles to the successful Maxim Talbot.
A second before the start of the first third, home player Patrick Dwyer reached a short-hand, but the second third then belonged to the flyer again.
More specifically, Giroux.
In collaboration with Jágr, he made his third hits, and then Wayne Simmonds led his shot to the fourth goal.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't want to say that he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely one of the best three," Jágr acknowledged his center.
"I wouldn't have imagined in my life that at the end of my career I would play with such an ice hockey player as he did."
"I'm so happy."
"I cut my game to me."
"All these years in the NHL my fellow players put their play on me and now the spit turns around," Jágr smiled.
Carolina still made play a drama - through the hits of Tuoma Ruutua and once again Dwyer, who stood out from a penalty shot, it came to a goal.
Matt Read prevented any further complication in which he was in excess of two against one.
"Excellent Pronger was still in our zone."
"He caught the puck, I took a ride, and (Read) went to more distant posts."
"I tried to meet him and I'm glad it worked out," Voráček described the last hit of the game from his point of view.
This victory led Philadelphia to the head of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defence player of Montreal Jaroslav Špaček injured himself in the match against Buffalo and retired in the second third due to an injury to the upper body.
In addition to their experience Beck, the Candiens also took an unlost lead in Penalty shooting 2:3.
One of the criminal shots could not transform Tomáš Platanec.
More than the lost points probably hurt the coach of the home team the high disease-related failure in the defensive - they only played the game with five defense players at the end.
"That's bad."
"We only played the meeting with a single experienced player, the rest were young players."
"But there's nothing we can do about it, so we have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"Every time we changed, one wave of attack after another and we had nothing to do with it."
"We should have made the game easier and brought the puck out of our third."
There were still reserves here," said P. K. Subban, one of the defense players.
The Czech goalkeeper Ondřej Paveec resisted thirty shots from Tampa Bay and thus contributed significantly to the 5:2 victory over Winnipeg.
At the gates of the jets, which ended a series of five defeats, there were five different shooters.
Trends in travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, the ČSSR had only five approved public travel agencies: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
At the time, the travel agencies sold mainly travels to the socialist Eastern Bloc countries, and in the West they were only allowed to choose.
And so Czech tourists traveled to the Baltic Sea (in the German Democratic Republic - the GDR), to the Soviet Union (Sochi on the Crimean Peninsula on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea and to Hungary to the Balaton.
A slight exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when one was also allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia took a pro-Western course and therefore travel to Yugoslavia was severely restricted.
A great paradox of those socialist times was that even citizens of the Eastern Bloc (also the Czechoslovakians) were not allowed to travel freely within the framework of the socialist countries.
If, for example, a citizen of the ČSSR wanted to travel individually to Poland or even to the Soviet Union, he needed a so-called invitation letter, otherwise individual trips were not possible.
Even then the travel agencies also offered travel to the West, but then you had to buy huge snakes or stay in the sleeping bag in front of the travel agency, or at least have "good acquaintances" in the travel agency.
Even so, things had not gone well yet.
The so-called foreign exchange promise - the condition for a trip to the West - was granted only "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, so without a foreign exchange commitment it would have been impossible to raise the necessary financial resources (Western currency) for a trip to the West.
Therefore, most Czechs spent their vacation in the country, no wonder that the Czechs bought countless weekend houses and dats - a habit that continues to this day.
The whole revolution of 1989 followed a travel revolution of the Czechs.
While a holiday in the GDR or Bulgaria was the measure of all things by 1989, last year the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their holidays abroad in countries around the world.
A huge paradox, which one is no longer aware of today, is the fact that one could not travel to the most popular holiday country of the Czech - Croatia until 1989 because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
Right from the beginning of the 1990s, the foreign exchange obligation was abolished in the neighbouring Western European countries, which caused an enormous wave of short visits, especially to Vienna in Austria and Germany.
The Czechoslovakians simply couldn't get enough of their travels to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to have been there for at least a few days.
So the Czech vacationers slept on trips to Paris in the tent in the park, because who would have had the money for accommodation in the hotel or in a pension at the time.
A typical feature of travel abroad from the Czech Republic was a fully packed trunk with canned, beer and permanent sausage, etc.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the freely exchangeable Czech crown - after decades our tourists were finally able to buy the Western currency freely.
Our level of living and thus the average salaries increased, resulting in another important moment in 1997.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel, the travel agencies began to prepare regular trips through charter flights after 1997, making the flight possible to negotiate quantity discounts incredibly cheaper compared to the past.
At the end of the 1990s, with the exception of the USA, the Czechs had already had foreign exchange-free payments with all the developed countries of the world, making travel even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of "post office" travel came in 2000, when thanks to the high demand of the first direct charter flight to an exotic country - to Thailand.
Since then, every year direct charter aircraft fly with Czech passengers in far away sunny countries; this year, twelve exotic destinations are flyn directly from the Czech Republic.
To the 100th Tsd. Czechs travel every year in exotic countries!
Another significant moment in the era that marked our "post-revolutionary" development came in 2008.
On November 17th, 2008, the United States lifted the visa requirement for Czech tourists, which definitely included our country among the highly developed countries of the world.
In 2008, the Czechs spent more than half of their holiday abroad (50.3%) for the first time in their history, spending more than 15 thousand CZK per head on a single holiday stay, including the cost of the holiday destination.
The general meeting is to find a new chairman - once again a pat is threatening.
For almost five months now, the Czech football team has no chairman, threatening that Ivan Hašek's successor to the top of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) will not even be known after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday in Nymburk.
To date, there has been no agreement on which electoral order to vote.
And without these, no vote on the three potential successors is possible.
Three interested parties want to manage Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
In June, Hašek resigned from his position, asking his colleagues to agree and find a strong personality that could lead football in the future.
Only - in the era after Hašek the old crossels broke out again between the two chambers of association, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was very clear and clear on 16 September when the new chairman was to be elected.
The delegates to the general meeting had come to the People's House in Smíchov district of Prague for nothing, because the negotiation did not lead to any result, and it was not only about the election itself.
One could not even agree on who is actually entitled to vote at the full assembly - only the legal representatives or the officials equipped with a full power.
At least partial agreement was reached on this one point, including the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, which, in the opinion of the Authority, was not acceptable.
However, disputes about the electoral order continue.
Nor did the Executive Committee make any further clarification on the matter at which, in principle, meetings - whether ordinary or extraordinary - are no longer on the agenda.
Although the views on election changed a few times - the neuralistic point remained the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the 3rd round to avoid a path situation?
"The issue concerns the question of whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes, or whether to find a completely different model," said Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-chairmen of the FAČR, who represents the professional football in management.
According to the statutory model, in the third round, the candidate who receives the greater percentage of support in the chamber for which he is a candidate wins.
Moravia is said to be willing to accept the compromise that the candidate wins who receives the higher number of votes from both chambers.
The Czech side, in turn, insists that the winner receives at least a two-thirds majority in this percentage vote count.
"Then the two preliminary rounds have no meaning at all, this mode would call into question the entire two-chamber concept," Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, which it was best to choose not to bend the electoral order, but according to valid statutes.
Surprisingly, Tomáš Paclík also agrees with this, even though it is clear that Pelta is most likely the most likely to be elected by all candidates.
"My wish is to be elected as far as possible according to the statutes."
"So that no absurd replacements are invented, as at the last general meeting," said the owner (of the football club) Victoria Plzeň, who for the first time was a candidate and, in his comments, distinguished himself mainly from Pelta.
But Pelta remains optimistic.
In his opinion, the new chairman will be known in Nymburk and he believes that candidates will also cooperate constructively in the future.
"The possible qualification of the national team for the football-EM today would certainly contribute to the calming of the mind."
"If football only rides on the euphoric wave, then the willingness to cooperate is also greater," says the official from Jablonec, who brings the greatest experience from all three adepts, at both professional and regional level.
Rajchl is more hesitant.
"I hope for an agreement, but unfortunately the situation is doubtful."
"This is not a matter between the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are certain efforts to "righten" the rules for their own purposes."
"That's why a new blockage is not excluded at the Annual General Meeting."
"I hope, however, that the common sense will ultimately prevail," said Rajchl.
Just - a lot of time to agree on all sides no longer remains.
Some negotiations were supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether football generality will be complete until the qualification game at all.
The charter aircraft, with which Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl were to fly to Podgorica, could not take off in the morning due to a technical disturbance, and thus one frailly searched for a replacement variant, as one could still bring a part of the executive committee to the venue of the Barrage-Hinspiel.
Finally, the meeting at ministerial level is certainly crucial, which is supposed to occur on Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, the Minister for Education, Youth and Body Education, would have liked to have the divided parties within the country's largest sports association to reach an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: state grants, the trustworthiness of Czech football and also the upcoming general meeting of ČSTV, which is intended to point the new direction to Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclík is fighting for the position of the chairman because he sees no suitable candidate
If Tomáš Paclík, the head of the Pilsner football player before the extraordinary general meeting could have been a strong candidate who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new chairman of the football association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), he would not have taken up the fight for this top position at all.
"If there was a good candidate, I would fight for him and renounce the election."
"But in the current situation, it was not possible to find such an adept," said Paclík ČTK.
The main reason for Paclík to go to the duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl is to prevent the alleged favorite of the election, Pelta, from reaching the top of the FAČR.
Paclík also emphasizes that in the event of his victory he intends to exercise the function of the chairman only one year, i.e. until 2013, until the date of the ordinary general meeting.
In the position of the chairman he would have liked to see an experienced top manager who is not too ensnared in the football event.
"I spoke personally to some of the people in question."
"Quick to believe that some told me they didn't want to identify with the Czech football at the moment.
Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image
Most of all, Paclík is said to disturb Pelta's association with the chairman of the Pilsner District Football Association Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial reputation who is considered a powerful lobbyist behind the scenes, with the ability to influence delegates' votes on general meetings.
For Paclík, it is therefore unacceptable that Pelta should have the chairman's position.
"In his victory, today's state would be preserved and the Czech football would not progress at all."
"The support of Berbr, a clever businessman, would be twice bad for football," said Paclík.
He also suggests that Pelta's name fell back a while ago in connection with phone calls for detection in a corruption affair, but that Pelta came out of it without punishment.
"I don't know what prestige a victory of Pelta should bring to the (ch.) football."
"And how would we stand in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said řekl Paclík, who said his earlier statement, "he would sell the Pilsner football club if Pelta became chairman", but already sees a little bit more casual.
If Paclík wins in the Thursday election, however, he could imagine a future collaboration with Pelta.
Similarly, another candidate - Rajchl, who had supported Paclík before the Annual General Meeting in October, who ended up with a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first I would go to."
"He has great abilities."
"I could well imagine him, for example, as head of the national team."
"But I don't think he's capable of running the association as a manager."
"I'm not going to put my nose in matters I don't understand," said Paclík, who made it look like in September that he was at the top behind the appointment of the Arbitrator's Commission with Luąěk Macela, who replaced Dagmar Damková.
Paclík himself claims to feel the role of the union chairman grew.
And he draws on his skills in managing private companies, since last summer he is also the head of Pilsen, who celebrated the first triumph in the league with his support in May.
"I have the power to change something in the football environment and contribute to a certain cultivation of this."
"In order to limit the influence of certain interest groups that tend to influence disciplinary and appeal commissions, which extends to the present state of affairs," said Paclík, who does not make any flour out of his antipathy, for example, to the Sparta boss Daniel Křetínský.
As one of his priorities, he looked at the strengthening of relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which he would lobby to the political top politicians to ensure that more money flows from lottery tax into sport.
"This is one of the crucial things to which the new chairman should devote himself."
"If there is a tax on gambling, as the political parties declare, then I understand their argument, but they must also say clearly where the money is going," he said.
Paclík also does not regard his connection with Pilsner Klub as a handicap, although he himself emphasises that the Chairman of the FAČR must be "excessive".
Pelta, in turn, is connected with Jablonec, Rajchl with the Prague Dukla.
"That's not ideal."
"But it doesn't make much sense to transfer my shares in the Pilsner Club hypocritically to a third person to return after a year and a half," said Paclík.
Pelta promised new statutes of the FAČR, which would in future exclude a path situation.
Two days before the General Meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the presidency, Miroslav Pelta, promised that in the event of his election, he would make himself strong for the FAČR to receive new statutes that will in future exclude disputes about the electoral order from the outset.
The official from Jablonec is confident before the Thursday negotiations in Nymburk and believes that the election campaign will surely disarm in the event of a possible success of the Czech selection.
Pelta had already promised before the unrealized election in September that he would concentrate on the national team and the extraction of financial resources in the event of his election.
He decided only at the last moment to take part in the election before the last general meeting, so he was able to help him defend and present his ideas about the leadership of football in a broader context.
"People at all levels are devoted to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the chairman to be known on Thursday."
"He feels that it is high time that someone guided the association, says the man, who is primarily associated with the Jablonecer Club, but who also worked for many years at Sparta and in the Executive Committee.
He also believes that he has sufficient experience to lead the Czech football team.
He is convinced that today's problems with the election are the euphoria that prevailed at the time of Ivan Hašek.
"Unfortunately, statutes were approved at the Annual General Meeting in June, which were not as perfect as they had all assumed.
If they hadn't allowed different interpretations, we would have had a chairman from September," Pelta said.
It was precisely the revision of the most important document of the Civil Society that he used as a means of appeal for the delegates.
"If I should be chairman, then I will accept it personally and be willing to bear personal responsibility if it does not work."
"This is a fundamental thing without which he can't be," Pelta says.
Furthermore, he does not try to demarcate himself against his counterparts.
He had already announced that he could introduce himself to a collaboration with Jindřich Rajchl, whom he acknowledges because of his legal education and he well knows that his opponent was his first alternate.
He did not attack Tomáš Paclík for a long time, who in turn did not leave a dry thread to Pelta.
In football he has been moving for over a year and can already refer to certain successes."
"His attacks, however, were depressing and many people were shocked by his election campaign."
"That's why many doubt his real character," Pelta addressed his opponent, who probably remained faithful to his proclamations, which he had already expressed in September.
In his opinion, his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lower classes of games, to the national team.
And this one should be Czech football sign.
"I would also try to end all affairs - from the Causa Bohemians to the reverberations of the corruption scandal of last year."
"Just after that, I would fall into negotiations with the private and state sector to ensure sufficient funding for the whole football," said the forty-six-year-old candidate ČTK two months ago.
At that time, he also promised that his move to the top of the Czech football would not mean human cleansing.
"I would first have to familiarize myself with the work content of all employees," he said towards Strahov, where, due to the long anarchy, nervousness is evident.
Despite the catastrophic scenarios that accompany the upcoming Annual General Meeting, he believes that the delegates are not going to Nymburk for nothing on Thursday.
"If you really want to be the only disputed point, how to choose in the third round, then we'll get over it."
"The football needs credibility and it only wins it back by having a new leader at last," Pelta remains optimistic two days before the potentially decisive day of his functional career.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR under him will start working hard
If the previous Vice-Chairman Jindřich Rajchl were to be elected as the new Chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic at the Annual General Meeting on Thursday, this would supposedly lead to the loss of a lot of people in the association.
Rajchl promises to start working hard in the event of his choice.
He wants to introduce system changes and to make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to solve the case of Bohemian, to improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, to bring more money into football, and otherwise to continue the work that the previous chairman Ivan Hašek had started.
"As chairman, I want to dedicate myself to football as a whole."
From international contacts to UEFA and FIFA, to national selection, professional football, to youth performance football."
"I don't want to say that I want to do everything alone," said Rajchl in conversation for ČTK.
"I am a team player and therefore would like to distribute the competences in the executive committee in such a way that each member is dedicated to a certain area."
And I'm going to distribute hard tasks so that football can move forward with miles in every segment."
Many wouldn't be very pleased about that because instead of just criticizing the work of others, they would have to start working hard themselves," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, it was considered not to run at all.
"It's known to me that I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it makes sense and that people are behind me, who do not constantly throw clubs between my legs and question every step I take," he said as an explanation why he hesitated.
"But many people told me that I should not give up because otherwise others would do."
"That's trust you can't lose," he said.
He is also alleged to be motivated to continue the work he started under Hašek.
"In two years we've done a lot of work and I don't want to throw it away."
"Processes have been started that will only come into effect in a few years and I would hardly see anyone stop them," he said, expressing his concern that in the event that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta would be elected, the situation could return to the times before Hašek.
"I believe in systematic action and that's something Mirek Pelta doesn't bring."
"Behind him there are people above all who would make the football so that he would only be there for the elect."
I think I can be accused of a lot, but I'm not being partisan."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want football for everyone, because everyone is fine and not just the chosen," said Rajchl.
He also contradicts the claim that he is only a president of the Czech Republic.
"Even if some people claim the opposite, I really intend to do the best possible for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider whether the league should not be divided into a Czech and a Moravian part, the winners of which then went up to the first league."
"Then it could not happen that today only three Moravian clubs play in the league, which is a problem especially for the young players in Moravia," says Rajchl.
Because the head of the Pilsner Club Tomáš Paclík has now joined the struggle for the function of the chairman, Rajchl does not dare to assess his chances of being elected.
"I have strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me its deputy chairman, and now recognizes that clear successes are behind me," said Rajchl, who also sees the saving of tens of millions of crowns for unfavorable contracts, the agreement of TV agreements and the negotiations for the lottery law as his success.
On the other hand, he partly blames himself for the fact that the association does not pull on a single strand.
While he says of Pelta that "he is disqualified from the outset to help the Czech football to renewed confidence," he considers the second rival - Paclík to be a strong candidate who really has something to offer the football.
"No one can question that he has done excellent work in Pilsen in just one year."
"Should he be elected, he would probably continue the things that Ivan Hašek has initiated, and he would obviously not fundamentally change the staffing in the commissions."
He would certainly not want to bend things in his favor," says Rajchl about his rivals.
Europe's most beautiful pools
Jump into the Blue
By Julia Stanek
Planschpool in Ufo-Optik, Spunkpools in Budapest: Whoever travels through Europe can experience his blue wonder - and after a city tour or hike rest the tired legs in spray baths.
A book shows where wellness in the water is most beautiful.
If Iris Meder went on a search trip over the past one and a half years, one should not be missing in her luggage: her bathing suit.
Situated back on the water, she looked high in artfully designed domes, she swam against marble puddles waiting for her at the edge of the basin, and marveled at meticulously restored Art Nouveau swimming halls.
She liked a bathroom, she quickly included it in her notebook - including interesting details about the construction and history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools explore architectural historian Meder in this way - and now introduce her to her in her book "Badefreuden": Volkswimmerhallen in Munich, historical bath palaces in the Black Forest, "Hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
Through 13 countries she led her "Travel to the most extraordinary baths in Central Europe": In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true bathing enthusiast.
With sport she doesn't have much on her hat, says Meder - only in the water it is different.
Annoyed that swimming fans have to take off with blue tiles and chlorinated stench, while joggers can breathe the enchanting scent of spruce forests or listen to cheerful bird-swickers in the park.
"One day I wondered why swimming pools must always be so ugly," says the Vienna-based Meder.
"So I started collecting beautiful baths."
Water surface doubles architecture
The spa in the swimming pool and essential sauna oils - the wellness factor in bathrooms is so great because all senses are served, says Meder.
And if the builders have put forth effort, swimming halls can be a real eye-smout: "Instead of a floor you have a water surface in bathrooms."
"On the one hand, it is transparent, but on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything doubles visually: high vaults, colorful tiles, springboards.
The small-format image book "Badefreuden" conveys interesting information about the architectural and cultural history of historical wellness oasiss on 190 pages - but above all it makes a desire for a leap into the blue.
Remarkable specimens were discovered by the pool collector Meder during her research in Hungary.
In addition to magnificent spas such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi Bath in Budapest, it found a nitrate-containing water in a quaint karsth cave (casual bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a thermal bath filled with alkaline water and located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
Spectacular views, on the other hand, offer many heated outdoor pools in Switzerland and Austria: While the whole city is in the eye of the Zurich roof pool, you can look at the snow-covered Arlberg in the outdoor pool of a bath in St. Anton - and: There is a window in the steam bath from which you can observe the driving on the ski slopes.
The most extraordinary pool design perhaps awaits bathing guests in Längenfeld: The Aquadome Ötztal looks like a Ufo landed in the Alps.
From three bowls open to the top it vaporizes in winter, while in the background the mountains of the Ötztal rise into the sky.
Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image
Not in every swimming pool the pool collector Meder rose in the nose of the smell of Chlorine.
Many thermal baths smell of sulphur, in the Árpád bath in the Hungarian Békescsaba, it smells so much like heating oil, which one hardly believes to have landed in a health bath.
The smell comes from the alkali-hydrogen carbonate-containing healing water, which is almost black and whose slick sticks to the skin as soon as you slide into the basin - a wellness experience of a special kind.
In one place, however, Iris Meder was disappointed in her search for beautiful bathing spots: when she wanted to visit the outdoor and sun bath in the Czech bath Luhatschowice, she found a locked terrain.
The bathroom, designed by architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902, has now been closed.
When Meder threw a glance through the weathered windows of the red-white-yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw how weeds grew between the tiles.
On the other hand, one has opposed the decline in a magical swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
Three phases of construction have already been completed; one can discover not only neo-Roman elements, which originate from the times of its construction in 1844, but also a Moorish hall in the Alhambra style, which was added around 1900.
Since the careful modernisation in 1995, the Palais Thermal has been the favorite pool of the pool-kennerin Iris Meder - not only because it originated in the Black Forest.
"It's already an achievement to merge different architectural styles into such a great unit," says Meder.
In such a palace, the dive in the thermal pool is obviously only secondary.

Deutsche Bank lets raw material business light up
By Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank give up its business with agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation on the world's poor.
In January, the head of the Group then intends to produce consequences.
Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Image
The case is clear to the federal citizens: 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize, according to a study.
Two-thirds of the respondents even demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions get out of this business because it aggravates the problems of the poorest in the world.
This is the result of a forsa survey on behalf of the consumer organisation Ceutawatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In it, the author Harald Schumann shows that the bets on the global stock exchanges increase prices - and the banks therefore bear a share of the global hunger problem.
The campaign of consumer protectionists is specifically directed against Deutsche Bank CEO Josef Ackermann, even if big banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, commodity bets were intended to protect traders against price fluctuations.
But in the meantime, most experts agree that the soccer has decoupled from supply and demand - and at the expense of the poorest profits.
Unlike the U.S. competitors, Ackermann responded to the criticism: he promised to examine the accusations and said that no business was worth putting on the Deutsche Bank's reputation.
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the accusations from the Foodwatch report.
The audit will be completed by the end of the year, and the results will be presented to the Executive Board of Deutsche Bank - including a recommendation on how to deal with it.
At the end of January, the bank's top will then announce its consequences.
In the end, a reduction in the raw material business could be, or even the complete departure.
Ackermann basts on his image
Foodwatch CEO Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time reaffirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "Betting on rising prices of food shows particularly dramatically how reckless banks today are damaging the general good."
Ackermann is now the top banking lobbyist in particular.
"Deutsche Bank has to remove all investments from its portfolio where money is used for betting on food prices," said Bode.
"Whether Mr. Ackermann is about hungry people or about the reputation of Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann's insight is surprising at first sight, but it is clear that the CEO wants to give a perfect picture just months before his departure from office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the Chief Executive Officer would not switch to the Supervisory Board, unlike planned.
With a turn away from the controversial agricultural speculation, he could improve his image.
And he hardly needs to shave in order to suffer any possible loss - that would ultimately have to do his successor.
Each second would terminate raw material plants
Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager high.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users have already participated in the organization’s campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Forsa Institute surveyed 1001 people on November 7 and 8.
It is therefore only 11 percent that Deutsche Bank is legitimate to offer investments that bet on food prices.
Many banking customers would also suffer personal consequences if they learned that their bank was involved in such transactions: each second would terminate the survey on all investments where money flows into commodity speculation.
43 percent would dissuade acquaintances from such a bank, 49 percent claimed to think about canceling their account and switching to another institution.

An architectural history with heights, depths and happy ending: The Austrian World Exhibition Pavilion of Brussels won prizes in 1958, became a museum in Vienna, was empty and came out.
Now he's being reopened as an exhibition house.
When modern post-war architecture is agitated by clear shapes, glass halls, courageous swings and new building materials that are typical of belief in technical progress, the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwazer is a striking and famous example for the Brüssler World Exhibition 1958.
Schwanzer's Pavilion was given the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its lightweight and floating steel glass construction.
The construction is still considered a milestone of contemporary architecture.
He announced to the architect that he also built the Austrian Pavilion at the next World Exhibition.
With his legendary BMW four-cylinder house plus bowl-like secondary construction in Munich, he finally became internationally famous in 1973.
After the World Exhibition in the Swiss Garden at the Wiener Südbahnhof, the Pavilion planned for its temporary exhibition building was set up, rebuilt and a 20th-century museum opened in 1962 - the "20s Haus" was called.
However, the building was not suitable for spatial and technical purposes as a museum - no walls for hanging art, no good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used for so long until contemporary art in Vienna got a new house.
Since 2001 the building was empty and came down more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has converted the pavilion, now called "21er Haus" and will be used as a museum for contemporary art in the future.
Tuesday evening, the Belvedere Museum, to which the house belongs, opens the first exhibition there - a case of happiness in every respect.
The new starter Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, a graduate of art historian with considerable careers in youth as an ice-cream runner, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum, and as the founding director of the Museum der Moderne Salzburg, strongly implemented the conversion with politicians and monumentists, she obtained public funds and private sponsors' money and determined the use.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba were to be exhibited by the foundation of the same name, a café and a bookstore were to exist, and an office building had to be built.
Strict supervision, smaller budget
For the performance Krischanitz was the ideal occupation.
Not only because Joseph Olbrich's Secession in Vienna had converted and expanded and won the competition, but also because he studied with Schwazer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was a "very important place" for him, where he considered the exhibitions "almost every weekend".
He knew the original design, and he knew the problems of the building, which already lost in his relocation to Vienna and his conversion to generosity and ease.
In the current conversion, there were far greater problems: the building was "an energy sluice," says Krischanitz.
The glass facade window profiles have been replaced, fiber-optic insulating glass has been used and the glass roof replaced by special safety glass.
Cold bridge steel beams have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings have been renovated.
Two basements brought place for the new use, a lowered light pit between house and street ensures the exposure, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the light cocky pavilion.
The original outside doors have remained, the house has been painted in the old reddish-brown rust colour.
And the cinema is even the same as it used to be.
And all this under strict supervision of the memorial authority and with small budget.
"Often a material had to be found that is good and cheap and also liked the Monument Protection Office," says Krischanitz, pointing out a ruby floor in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and conversions, the building has remained flexible and easy.
It was difficult with the pavilion, "who came from Brussels," Krischanitz recently said, a typical "drop-in-the-city story".
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants "to awaken a real consciousness".
In this case, however, the 21er Haus is not in the wrong place, because there has been a city-building happiness: Around the Swiss garden, the completely new "Central Stationsquartier", with office and residential houses, is being created.
And another case of happiness may occur: the 21st house could be strengthened by another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca of Habsburg bought the Berliner Kunsthalle, and as you can hear, she is already negotiating with the city for a neighboring location in the Swiss garden.
Railway plans winter crisis package in millions of height
The railway has developed a crisis plan to prevent train failures in winter.
The number of employees should be doubled.
It's gonna cost millions.
According to a newspaper report, Deutsche Bahn is spending more than 70 million euros this year in the fight against winter-related train failures and delays.
The "Image" newspaper reported in advance on a group-internal crisis plan that investments of around 300 million euros were planned by 2015.
This should achieve better availability of vehicles and rail network even in extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, it is planned to double the internal and external staff for snow removal on railways and ascents to 16,000 people.
The aim is to free platforms from snow and ice within four to five hours until the start of operation and 90 percent of the necessary operating journeys.
Two months ago, after a summit with government and industry, Railway CEO Rüdiger Grube warned of train failures and delays even this winter.
In the past winter the railway had considerable problems in passenger transport, as it lacks reserves, among other things, in difficult weather conditions.
For example, many new regional trains have been waiting for approval from the Federal Railways Office for many years.
There is also a delay in delivery of ICE trains.
For years, the railway has also made it necessary to have axes of ICE trains examined much more frequently in the workshop, after an ICE had a break in the main railway station in Cologne.
Deutsche Bank pays million penalty in the USA
After the tumult of Chief Josef Ackermann, new chatter comes from the United States: Deutsche Bank has to pay a million fine there.
As if the problems at home were not enough for Deutsche Bank, the industry giants are still catching up on its past in the USA: the Frankfurt Institute is paying 145 million dollars (EUR 106 million) in a comparison to settle disputes over the fissure of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It's about selling mortgage papers.
The financial market regulator NCUA accuses a number of large banks of having seduced cooperative banks with false promises to buy the financial products; they would have played down the risks.
Such papers lost a lot of value during the financial crisis and took the banks to the depths.
"We are satisfied that we were able to solve the issue without the parties having to go to court," said a German bank speaker in New York.
The bank did not blame the comparison.
This also applies to the Citigroup, which committed itself to paying $2 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the presentation of the two money houses.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the U.S. cooperative banks and comes up with pleas to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to replace the billion-severe damage.
The comparisons now concluded are the first of their kind.
The regulator had also precipitated other big banks and in the summer sued JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
The mortgages in question are so-called Mortgage-backed Securities.
These are the basis of house loans.
When the U.S. real estate bubble burst in 2007, this became a disaster for a large number of financial firms.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the U.S. Investment Bank overturned Lehman Brothers.
Even though the events have been going on for a few years, banks are currently in the US with a sharp wind.
Investors and supervisory authorities have made numerous actions to obtain reparation or to suspect errors.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the biggest wave of action.
It accuses 18 major international banks of having overspend the two state-owned US real estate financier Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in mortgage transactions in the volume of some 200 billion dollars.
Deutsche Bank also has to file an FHFA complaint, which concerns several transactions worth a total of 14.2 billion dollars from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority requires that the Frankfurters stand for "substantial losses" without, however, mentioning an exact sum.
Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as untenable and declared his intention to defend himself.
Warren Buffett increases at IBM with 10 billion
Finanzguru Buffett invests heavily in IBM's IT company.
Since March, he has bought up shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
So far, the great American investor Warren Buffett has always declared that it is not investing in IT and computer companies, as the long-term development of the companies can only be poorly forecast.
However, now he has read IBM's annual reports and changed his opinion on investments in the industry.
He should have understood much earlier that IBM primarily provides services and provides computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered a knight's blow in the financial world.
As a result, IBM may now call itself "Sir IBM".
Buffett has now revealed to CNBC in the US that he has purchased IBM shares worth 10.7 billion dollars since March.
Its investment holding Berkshire Hathaway has thus risen to one of IBM's largest shareholders with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that IBM had not even known anything about the engagement so far.
He praised the management, which had made good profits even in the economic crisis.
"You've done a great job," said Buffett on the strategy.
IBM has been relying for some time on the lucrative IT services such as the operation of data centers.
The more than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consulting as well as powerful company computers.
Buffett had avoided technology companies until now.
He says he only invests in companies whose business he understands.
Instead, Buffett approached a freight railway, for example, with a lubricant manufacturer or machine builder.
In addition to around 80 subsidiaries, its holding company Berkshire Hathaway also owns shares in a number of large companies such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Municher Rück.
In the 1960s, the 81-year-old had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway and expanded it into one of the most valuable companies in the world with smart investments.
Nevertheless, his lifestyle is modest.
He is therefore a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost untruthful sense of money earned him the nickname "Omaha's oracle".
After the Buffett investment became known, the IBM share rose by one percent in advance.
"Big Blue", as IBM is also called, is worth more than 220 billion dollars on the stock exchange and is one of the most valuable technology companies in the world, along with Apple and Microsoft.
At Microsoft, Buffett said, but he doesn't want to get in.
Founder Bill Gates is a close friend.
The threat is tangible
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer Zell", Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology" that is now revitalizing.
The murders of eight Turkish-born and a small Greek entrepreneur between 2000 and 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
This news will respond with fear and concern in Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany.
For many German-Turks, this brings back a long-believed ghost: Since the fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has no longer been a comparable violence against Turks with a right-wing extremist background.
Nevertheless, the fact that there is an anti-foreigner in Germany has never been called into question.
However, the discovered right-wing extremist network reveals dimensions whose dimension is far from foreseeable.
"Is Bloody Ideology Resurrecting?" was the Internet edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
On the other hand, the newspaper "Sabah" emphasizes that one of the perpetrators is said to have been a V-man of constitutional protection, and is concerned that German authorities may also be involved in the right-wing radical swamp.
In particular, the Turkish community of Germany responded: on the weekend with a guard in front of the Brandenburg Gate, it reminded of the victims of racist violence.
It was only two weeks earlier that the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, had thought of a ceremony of the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
In happy colors, the co-responsive was staged as a story of success.
Like an earbeat, some Turkish media reports: "Germany's gift to the fiftieth" is the headline of an article in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X", which refers to the background of the murder series.
The German edition of the "Hürriyet" cannot be taken to draw this mental connection.
"It starts to stink," says the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci.
He stressed that people had been murdered, that paid taxes and that their work had made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany.
In German-Turkish Internet forums, very critically, the actions of the police and their later search success are discussed.
The authors wonder why it had not been much earlier for the German authorities to look for suspects in right-wing extremist circles.
At least one of them shows himself ready for drastic means: "If there is still slumber here, the migrants will have nothing to do with self-defense and arms."
"This will probably be the best self-protection."
"The inner peace in Germany depends very much on the goodness of the reconnaissance and appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network," writes "selen".
What it means when inner peace is in danger in Germany, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s explained.
The photo of the fire ruins of Solingen is deeply anchored in German and Turkish memory.
For no other event more clearly showed the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans that mistrust and distance can lead to right violence.
The attacks, however, sharpened the feeling of ourselves on the Turkish side.
Don't repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press, the failure of German politics after the attacks was particularly complained: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the fire attack of Solingen, he sent a condolences chart to the Turkish president, but was represented by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel at the funeral ceremony in Cologne - Kinkel counted in his speech at the time how many taxes the local Turks made.
In fact, the value of a person according to the amount of his taxes is calculated.
The current reporting of the Turkish media shows once again how deep the distrust of many German doors has been in the local rule of law since then.
In addition to the efforts of an extensive reconnaissance and re-evaluation of the extreme right-wing terrorism in Germany, it needs to be said this time.
The scandal bank of the Zürisee
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and has slid from one crisis to the next since then.
Now it's supposed to be a German.
That's certainly not how Axel Weber thought.
After his spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank in July, it became known that he would take an almost as spectacular new job in 2013: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Swiss Grand Bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step.
Axel Weber was delighted publicly, praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly gained solidity and dropped friendly remarks about the future colleagues.

"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
But already in September it became clear that everything would be quite different.
A dealer of the UBS in London had bypassed all the bank's security systems and had paid around 1.7 billion euros.
UBS CEO Oswald Grübel, a banker not only famous in Switzerland, had to go.
The UBS Chairman of the Board of Directors has also been considered to be a hit since then - and all ask: When is Axel Weber finally coming?
It has already been announced that Weber is allowed to advise the bank from February 2012.
And he already took over the Board of Directors in May - not until 2013, as announced by the Bank on Tuesday.
It's going to be hard for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, he is a professor of economics and a banker and he would certainly have needed an intervention time.
With one stroke, he then assumes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just once again proved that it has long earned the title of "the largest scandal bank in Europe".
On the one hand, the UBS is huge - until recently the largest asset manager in the world - and, on the other hand, has been slumbering from one scandal to the next for years.
Nothing, it seems, remains the once so proud Swiss bank.
It started in the financial crisis.
By 2007, the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the silent and solid but also sophisticated Swiss asset manager had combined it with ambitious goals: She also wanted to become a huge number in investment banking.
In 2007, UBS managed more clients' money than any other bank in the world with 1.6 trillion dollars.
And, on the other hand, as an investment bank, it had advanced into the league of the world's largest banks.
That made an impression.
The former banker and later long-term banking professor in Zurich Hans Geiger tells us: "My students were always the model of a good bank at the time."
"From today's point of view, you wonder, how could I be so mistaken?"
He was very mistaken.
In 2007 it became apparent for the first time that something was wrong in the UBS.
In the middle of the year, Managing Director Peter Wuffli resigned surprisingly, who until then was regarded as a highly intellectual and equally ingenious banker.
A few months later, he was suspected of why he had left.
The bank's investment division had been filled with subprime papers and had to write down billions.
To learn this, the UBS announced a capital increase of say and write 13 billion francs.
For this, she actually found investors, however, which some of them had already lost their noses: an intrusive Asian State Fund from Singapore and an Arab State Fund, which was so silent that they didn't even know his name.
But that was just the first blow.
It was worse in April 2008.
The bank had to announce new billions of losses, Chairman of the Board of Directors Marcel Ospel, the second best-paid board of directors in Switzerland, resigned in 2006.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: the UBS faced the collapse in view of its misinvestment in the financial crisis and had to be rescued by the state.
The National Bank bought out the UBS for twenty billion problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a forced-change bond that it could become co-owners of the Bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shocked - because she noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it houses so large banks.
Finally, the balance sheet total of the UBS 2007 was more than five times as large as the economic performance of Switzerland (see graph).
"Once again, we could not save the UBS," says bank researcher Geiger.
The second was followed by the first disaster.
A few months later, the UBS capitulated in the tax dispute with America and declared its willingness to publish the data of customers who might have been deceiving taxes with the help of the bank.
In addition, she agreed to a payment of 780 million dollars - as a repayment of unjustified profits from these transactions and a penalty.
Thus, the UBS declared more or less openly to have helped in tax evasion.
At the same time, she lost something that had always been her capital in the competition for rich customers: the Nimbus of silence.
After the scandal, the Swiss bank secret was no longer the same.
It followed the resignation of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board.
And the exodus of customer money.
For example, within a few months, the Bank had lost its credibility in both central business areas: investment banking through mis- speculations and asset management through aid for tax evasion.
And just as it got a little bit quieter again, just when you thought the UBS would get it back, this unsavory dealer story follows: A single dealer is paying 1.7 billion euros before the bank realizes that something is going wrong.
And it's going to be obvious: with risk management in investment banking, it still doesn't work.
"With the Adoboli case, it has been found that risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, economist and financial professor at the Bankinstitut of the University of Zurich.
The financial board of a large German bank is also sure: "The UBS problem is that it does not control risk control."
It had been precisely the idea of caution with which the Swiss bankers had long since taken up the role of being guardians of the great wealth of the world: no too great risks, no security for money - even outside the Alps the world might collapse.
The safes of Swiss banks had become a symbol of unshakable reliability, such as Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly noble chocolate.
The headquarters of the UBS in Zurich still fits the cliché of the rich Swiss private bank - it is only a little bigger.
The location is classic.
The bank has its headquarters on Zurich Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly from the main station to Lake Zurich, which is framed by the snow-covered peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are magnificent, the shop rentals are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelers like Tiffany's can be found here between Swiss traditional shops such as the Confiserie Sprüngli.
For centuries the Swiss banks have been residing here: from the National Bank to the Palace of Credit Suisse to private private banks such as Julius Bär.
The entrance hall of the UBS is entered through a heavy turning door.
Inside the walls are marble-dressed, there are thick leather chairs, next to the bank logo a large sign for the "safe".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: safety.
This idea of the Swiss bank has pushed out both Swiss big banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but at some point - or betrays how the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all, like all Swiss bankers, he also does business with the two big banks.
The UBS had become far too large, he found - especially in investment banking, where the fishing axes had also spread.
The Swiss wouldn't have anything to say there.
"And if so, they have long adapted to the customs of the fishing axles."
In fact, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed the UBS, gave its first high profits and then the debacle: No European financial institution has lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the Swiss Grand Bank.
On October 15th, 2008, the disaster became visible.
"On that Wednesday, the government coalition of the small seven million country decided to take the largest rescue action in the history of their nation," writes author Lukas Hössig in his book "The UBS Crash".
Up to 68 billion francs or some 45 billion euros, the politicians approved to save the large bank in front of the bankruptcy.
How could this happen?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss big banks merged into a huge group.
A bank was created that was too big for small Switzerland at the time of the merger - and was growing ever further.
The two different precursor banks of the UBS helped: a rich but sleepy bank with the focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer but more internationalized bank.
Suddenly, the internationalized investment banks came cheaply to a lot of money with which they could turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with this rise of the UBS: Peter Wuffli, CEO of the UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the highly intellectual, modest, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the belly man who has worked from the bank doctrine up to the top."
But Ospel had to rely on Wuffli.
And in the end, Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake: "He thought his models were reality," says Geiger.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
It's clear that overconfidence came before the case.
UBS employees clearly remember the executive meetings, on which Group head Wuffli repeatedly releases the same slogan: Goldman Sachs kicks off the throne.
The American Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She led the "League Tables", the rankings that documented the success of the banks of that time.
The UBS wanted to go up there.
Some steps had already been made for her.
In the foreign exchange business and in the stock trade, she played at the top.
However, business consultants commissioned highlighted a weakness: in the international interest rate business, in the banking language "Fixed Income", there was a huge distance to the largest banks.
The UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS went into an adventure that cost them almost the existence.
Hungry for growth, both the bank itself and a hedge fund founded before it invested in American subprime plants.
It developed into a huge machine that packaged and passed on securities on American mortgage loans - but also kept risks.
Also, when other banks have long been looking for the exit.
"Even in the summer of 2007, when the American real estate market was in flames, UBS bought there," says bank expert Geiger.
So great is the euphoria, so deep down.
One manager after another had to go as the attempts to clean up were more difficult than thought.
Posts at the UBS have become a sling seat and are still shaky.
Whoever runs the big bank now has an almost impossible job.
It needs to find a strategy for a bank that has lost all of the business models nearby.
Banking researcher Geiger already has an idea: end of investment banking, focus on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
The bank does not (yet) want to go that far.
But investment banking is supposed to shrink sharply, so much is already clear.
Next Thursday, the new bank manager Sergio Ermotti will present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italo-Switzerland was actually only intended as a transitional solution when the bank surprisingly separated itself from predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he has prevailed: he is supposed to run UBS's business permanently, the bank of Zurich announced on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to drive the investment bank back to the stand in the mid-1990s.
3500 points he deletes.
But that won't be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions Axel Weber is sure to be asking himself now.
To date, he has only publicly said that he will first look for an apartment in Zurich with his wife.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe burdened US stocks
The threat of recession in Europe has taken courage from US investors at the start of the week.
The changes in government in Athens and Rome remained without impact.
The threat of industrial production on the continent suffocated the hopes of stabilizing the debt crisis in the germ.
The general facilitation of the changes in government in Rome and Athens could not prevail.
The euro fell across from the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass had been half-full in the past week, not half-empty - but now the problems were pushed back into the foreground again, said Mark Lucini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
In particular, financial values were on sales notes.
The Dow-Jones-Index of the standard values noted at 12.078 points for the trade end with a minus of 0.6 percent.
In the course of trade, the market barometer commuted between 12.027 and 12.170 points.
The broader S&P-500 index closed at 1251 points, a minus of one percent.
The index of the Nasdaq Technology Exchange lost 0.8 percent and went out of business with 2657 points.
In Frankfurt, the Dax agreed with a reduction of 1.2 percent with 5985 counters.
Industry in the 17 euro countries has significantly reduced its production and is moving towards the end of the upturn.
In September, companies produced two percent less than in the previous month, as reported by the Eurostat Statistical Office.
The US investors were skeptical: "We are not an island, we are dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe will not be able to free itself from a recession as quickly as possible, and there will be further signs of weakness in the banks.
The investment legend Warren Buffett confirmed this caution only: It is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything for an end to the crisis, he said in a CNBC interview.
That is why, from his point of view, it is too early to invest in European government bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett threw a decades-old principle over the pile and entered the US technology industry.
His investment over ten billion dollars in IBM supported the stock price of the traditional group and initially had it recorded almost one percent higher against the trend in trade.
The paper closed almost unchanged at $187.35.
Buffett has paid an average of 170 dollars per piece, and now holds 5.5 percent.
The stock price of Berkshire Hathaway lost 1.3 percent.
Bank of America's equity securities were significantly higher than the market at 2.6 percent.
The house silicates almost the rest of its shares in China Construction Bank and cancels $6.6 billion for it.
With the net profit from the business, the institution aims to boost its capital ratio and thus comply with harder regulatory requirements.
The aircraft manufacturer Boeing increased and thus limited the losses in the Dow.
The stock won 1.5 percent after the Group collected the largest order of its history.
Airline Emirates ordered 50 777 long-haul machines on Sunday and counted the value of the order at $18 billion.
Including options to 20 other machines, the volume even amounts to 26 billion dollars.
At the New York Stock Exchange, around 710 million shares changed ownership.
719 values increased, 2281 fell, and 79 remained unchanged.
At Nasdaq, sales of 1.38 billion shares closed 630 in plus, 1913 in minus and 82 unchanged.
Intelligent crows spread in cities
In many places seed crows are considered "problem birds": But from the cities the highly intelligent animals can no longer be expelled, say experts.
Some of them like them, others want to get rid of them very quickly: crows have been part of the cityscape for centuries, but in many municipalities, local complaints about the dirt and noise of the animals accumulate.
A means against the "problem birds" has not yet been in sight.
Seed crows were no longer to be found from the cities, experts said at the first crow symposium in the East Frisian Empty.
There, experts from all over the federal territory provided possible ways out.
You are looking for alternatives in the cities
Nature conservationists also attributed the problems in cities to the rural flight of the particularly protected seed crows: Chemical use in agriculture is increasingly destroying traditional habitats.
The hunting, increasing cultivation and fall of typical breeding trees made life difficult for the birds.
Crowds are under the protection of nature.
Large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs exist, among others, in the Westphalian Soest, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project on the mass killing of crows in the district provided negative headlines.
Critics had called the trapping of the animals in bird traps and the killing with batons particularly brutal.
"The normal expulsion, the grinning, does not bring anything," noted the city and landscape planner Werner Klöver from Empty.
Nesting with water or falling trees often has undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals deviate, large colonies split up and spread elsewhere."
Enormity can only be imaginable as an exception to hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we don't get them away."
Without the surrounding area, the problem cannot be solved in the cities, said Mayor Wolfgang Kellner from Leer.
It is possible to think of a combination of growing animals from sensitive residential areas and lock offers to relocate them elsewhere.
The psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens, on the other hand, advertised "Infoboards rather than chain sawsaws" for a completely different handling of the animals: "We are best able to endure a pimple in the face with confidence."
Jürgens had co-founded in Schleswig-Holstein the Ascheberger Krahen-Lehrpfad, on which signs inform about the life of the highly intelligent seed crows.
The project has already been adopted by tourists.
Jürgens also had his own opinion on the criticism of the noise of the birds: "There is a lot of communication that have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: Seed crows not only use tools to get to a treat, but even make their own tools as a tool.
Behavioral researchers from Cambridge University recently tested the extent to which the intelligence of birds reaches four seed crows.
In an experiment, the birds quickly learned that they have to crash a scaffolding with stones in order to get to a moth larva.
Without much training, they determined what size and shape a stone needs to have in order to collapse the platform.
In a second attempt, the plump crows then had to solve a more difficult problem.
In a vertically positioned cylinder, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a moth larva.
With the beak the birds could not reach their prey.
However, the researchers had laid wired pieces on them.
From this all four animals formed a hook, with the help of which they then applied the bucket to the handle from the tube.
Three of the four seed crows even succeeded immediately.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal to the EM 2012
The hopes of the Bosnians and the Turks for a coup remained.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland are also present at the EM 2012.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have solved the last tickets to the 2012 European Championship in Poland and Ukraine in the playoffs.
Guided by double-successful Superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd), Portugal struck Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made the fifth EM participation in a row perfect after 0:0.
The Czech made a 1:0 (0:0) in the play-off replay at outside Montenegro, after the play (2:0) had been a clear thing.
There was no more burning of Croatia at 0:0 against Turkey, Ireland brought a loose 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24th), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) achieved the further hits for Portugal.
The former Wolfsburger Bundesliga-Profi Zvjezdan Misimovic with a transformed trade meter (41.) and Captain Emir Spahic (65.) had twice shortened for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic saw the yellow-red map (54.).
Bosnia had already failed Portugal in the 2010 World Cup playoffs in South Africa.
In the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal caught a tailor-made start.
Ronaldo chased a free shot from around 30 meters to the early guide in the stitches.
A good quarter hour later, Nani showed his wide-shooting qualities and met from 25 meters to 2:0.
The Bosniers, who did not take place in the first half hour, had their first clear chance through Torhunt Edin Dzeko.
The ex-Wolfsburger from the English table leader Manchester City placed a headball on the lower edge of the latte, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33.).
Jiracek meets for the Czech Republic
After that, referee Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding was at the centre.
After an attack against Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penitentiary, Stark decided on swallow and showed the Portuguese the yellow card (36.).
On the opposite side, Stark gave a controversial mercenary after an action by Fabio Coentrao, which Misimovic safely transformed.
But after the break, the Vice-European champion of 2004 made everything clear with four hits.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek also finished the last doubt in the 81st minute.
This means that the European Champion of 1976 will go to the EM for the fifth time in a row.
However, the team of coach Michal Bilek with the Bundesliga-Legionaires Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nürnberg) were also lucky and had to survive a terror second in the early stages.
Closer Petr Cech prevented a possible own gate by Tomas Sivok (9.) with a reflex at the last moment.
Montenegro had its greatest possibilities when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic shot at the 40th minute out of the rotation of the criminal room border just near the gate of Cech.
After the break the queer had to rescue the already beaten world-class goalkeeper of the Czechs, again the storm of FC Seoul had withdrawn (50.).
The gate just before the end finally made everything clear.
Turkey has missed the football miracle of Zagreb.
Four days after the 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb did not reach 0:0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink has to take his place on the bank of the 2002 World Cup third, the Croatians can rejoice at their fourth participation in an EM final round.
In front of 31,000 spectators at the Maksimir Stadium, the Turks had almost caught a dream start.
Selcuk Inan met only the post in the seventh minute with a distance shot, and attacker Kazim Kazim couldn't sink the pickup in the gate.
However, Croatia became more and more in control after the startling second.
Even after the break, the Croats did not burn anything.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic from VfL Wolfsburg, who made his way to Dortmunder Ivan Perisic in the 62nd minute, the Bundesliga-Legionaire Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schidenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were still in use.
Trapattoni drives to the EM
In Dublin the Irish celebrated the first EM participation since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward brought the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already made a preliminary decision with the 4-0 success in play, in the 32nd minute lead.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) was suitable for the guests.
Ireland pushed at the pace from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.
Only in the last moment did the Estonian rear team prevent the possible leader.
In the 32nd minute, however, it was time.
After a bad defense from Endemann Pavel Londak Ward was on the spot and pressed the ball to 1:0 over the line.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China
Europe's largest software manufacturer SAP invests billions in China in the coming years and wants to almost double the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, about two billion dollars (about 1.5 billion euros) will flow, the Dax Group announced on Tuesday.
"We will create additional research and development facilities and recruit employees accordingly," Co-Chief Bill McDermott announced at a customer fair in Beijing.
The workforce is expected to grow from around 2500 to 4500 employees.
The number of branches of the world market leader in corporate software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP has been present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4000 of the more than 176 000 SAP customers worldwide sit in the Boomland.
The growth plans in China are also an important component of the Dax Group's 2015 strategy.
SAP intends to increase sales to EUR 20 billion by 2015.
Last year the Walldorfers had redeemed around 12.5 billion euros.
Currently, the software provider’s business, which employs 55,000 people worldwide, is running almost rarely before.
SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
"Now we would like to expand our activities (...)," said McDermott.
"Our goal is to promote sustainable growth in China through comprehensive education."
Mass slaughter on a personal level
Peter Englund’s new book "Beautiful and Fearful. A History of the First World War, told in 19 destinies" begins with a long list of key persons that goes to your heart.
Here's a tip on how to proceed: Cut this page carefully and make it your bookmark.
You will get to know these people very well in Englund's romantic story, and these main people will work as your GPS, as a lighthouse in these few moments when you, like Englund's men and women, are lost in the fog of war and your illusions are robbed.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which determines the Nobel Prize in Literature.
He has written an unusual book that he does not describe inapplicably as "a work of anti-history".
It contains only a few large names, important contracts or famous battles. There are hardly any ambassadors, rapid reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It is less a book about what happened, he explains, but rather "a book about how it was". It is about "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods".
"Beautifulness and terror" almost the war experiences of 20 more or less inconspicuous men and women on both sides of the war together, from schoolgirls and botanists to mountaineers, doctors, ambulance drivers and office workers.
Some of these people become heroes.
Some become prisoners of war, lose limbs, become crazy or die.
Each of these lives flashes up like the votive candles in a church, some are added, while others are extinguished.
Englund's book differs from the usual books.
It also corrects the notion that the First World War was only the devastating war on the West Front.
"Beautifulness and horror" with expert views over other war venues: the Alps, the Balkans, the East Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book fall on beehives, a Christmas among the pyramids in Egypt, Tsetsefliegen are an insoluble problem.
This is almost a moving book from the very beginning.
The war floods the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a Hurricane Katrina, who smells of Cordit.
Imagine you're a woman who's at home with her children and hears gunfire in the distance.
Who's coming?
Hardly anyone understands what is happening or why this war is even fought.
"Feeling facts," says Englund, "were furnished with suspicions, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"Beautifulness and terror" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor.
Their stories were mainly taken from memories, letters and other material already published.
Their life accounts can be frightening or gripping, but they are extremely alive in the Englunds of the detail-losing collection of small moments.
Many of them act in want and help themselves.
In the story of a German schoolgirl, he says, "Replacement, everywhere."
"Replacement coffee, false aluminum, false eraser rubber, paper associations, wood buttons."
He tells more about the replacement dinner in Germany.
He describes "flesh made from pressed rice and baked in hammock fat (and was last served with a false bone of wood), tobacco made from dried roots and dried potato bowls, shoes that were covered with wood."
There were, as he noted, "837 registered foods that were allowed in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
An American recognizes his own urge for wildness and says about the war: "One feels that, despite all that was intended for men rather than sitting in the chair, with the evening foliage or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whisky in his hand, and so to do, as if such a facade meant civilization and as if there were no barbarism behind his own fortified and smitten shirt breast."
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he probably dies and no one will take note of it or take care of it.
"If you distance yourself from the thought of sacrificing yourself, you want to think this is happening before an audience," he writes.
Instead, it is as terrible as "a condemned man who was secretly hanged."
Other observations are about the old Europe that falls apart and about new forms of terror.
"The conflict has increasingly become an economic contest," writes Englund, "a war between factories."
He begins the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiarium of the still young century": "the word turned and ideologically convinced mass murderers in suit, who slaughters while sitting behind a desk."
People behave in an unforeseen way and there is just as frivolous behavior as heroism.
Englund is discussing the soldiers who actively tried to infect themselves with a sexual disease in a prostitute in order to escape the frontal service.
"The grotesque expression of this can be discovered in the trade with Gonoccock-Eiter, because soldiers bought and smeared on their genitals, hoping to come to the hospital like this," he writes.
"Those who were really desperate rub him in their eyes, which led them to be blind for the rest of their lives."
In this translation from Swedish by Peter Graves, Englund's poetry becomes smooth and yet unobtrusive and adapts perfectly to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, he catches the way in which the war "uncontrollable forces unraveled in a unique way: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People are beginning to wonder why their leaders are fighting them.
The best books about the First World War were mostly more falsified like Paul Fussel's "Great War and Modern Memory" or novels like Erich Maria Remarque's "In the West nothing new" than extensive comprehensive books.
Englund's band joins an unconventional hall of fame.
His book has the most devastating end I've ever read about in a book.
I'm not giving it back.
But it's like he took us this side with the main characters off his nose with his book and lit us with a match.
After an early misstep, a minutely planned attack
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them carrying helmets.
They had chosen the night from Monday to Tuesday, because at that time there are hardly any people in Zucotti Park.
The operation was kept secret and few high-ranking officials were informed. All the others believed at first to participate in an exercise.
Police President Raymond W. Kelly was in the middle of them and his presence underlined the fact that the operation was full of challenges.
The incidents of the past weeks, such as the use of pepper spray against protesters, which violates the rules of the department and gave the house-occupiers an enormous increase in public sympathy, were no longer allowed to repeat.
And so the police action was carried out to remove the protesters from the Zuccotti Park after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared them by observing how occupations were handled in other cities.
A disaster exercise had taken place with a look at Zuccotti on Randalls Island.
Officials reinforced the so-called chaos training - measures to combat terrorism, including the rapid movement of a large number of police officers - in order to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training unit took place on Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to move into the park came "in the last minute," said someone who was familiar with the orders, what a declaration said as "practice".
"The few police officers who were involved in my knowledge didn't know it was about the Zuccotti Park," said someone who wanted to remain anonymous.
"The only ones who knew that it was about the Zuccotti Park were the high-ranking officials of the resort."
One reason for secrecy was a lesson the city had learned.
On October 14th, officials wanted to clear the park, but then moved back when hundreds of protesters came together after they had learned of these plans.
Officials from various police units were involved in the Tuesday operation, including commanding officers from all over the city - hundreds of mobile officers who are usually employed in high criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that in the course of the day many people enter and go out in the park, almost like Pendler, so 1 o'clock at night is a good time to go in.
"It was appropriate to do this when the least number of people were staying in the park," he said.
Cars with Jupiter lamps and loudspeakers were available before departure at Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near Manhattan Bridge.
The lamps and the pre-recorded news that rang out of the speakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
When the public officials entered the park in their light blue wind jackets, many protesters simply got their things together and left the place.
The police said that by 1:45 p.m. no tents would be touched to give the protesters time to pack their belongings together.
Other teams of officials were seen gathering in the area to intervene, arrests in the park were needed.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, spokesperson of the President of the Police, said this had happened to his own security.
But many journalists claim that they wanted to stop them from watching the police actions in the park, and they said that the handling of the officials was very harsh.
Mr. Browne said that TV cars could have taken pictures on Church Street on the west side of the park.
When the police moved westward through the great mess of personal things of the protesters, including suitcases, artificial grasses and bags with clothes, their employees followed the city's cleansing, which had been lifted, which had been left behind.
Some protesters who refused to go were dragged outside. Images of this appeared a short time later on the Internet.
A main core of protesters involved near the kitchen area of the camp in the center of the park position.
Some built barriers and the police continued their methodical arrests.
Around 10 people in the camp epicenter joined together to their arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Civil protection officials were called to cut them off.
As Mr Kelly said, no arrests were carried out in the park until about 3:30 p.m.
The clearance was completed after 75 minutes, according to the police.
Mr. Browne said 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most arrests occurred, as he said, due to "unfair conduct and resistance to arrest".
The most prominent official on site was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the highest uniformed officials in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, Head of the Department of Criminal Officials, was also there.
Despite his presence, Mr. Kelly "did not conduct the operation", as Mr. Browne said.
In case they should access, a second group of officials were waiting on the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street.
Barricades were built on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block further south.
It could be observed how from these sites the police extended the circle further and further around the Zuccotti Park.
In one place it was observed how several officials, many of them with shields, drove people outside.
About 28 people were in the northern vicinity.
Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
Around 5 p.m. south of Pine Street, a protester jumped onto the roof of a police vehicle and other demonstrators left the air out of the tire of a police bus.
In one place, the crowd threw a piece of plywood.
In the end, an official and a protestant came to the hospital.
Trade union of supervisors will bring action against the city for dismissals
The union, which represents hundreds of school workers who lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday, as the redundancies are not necessary and discriminatory because of their inappropriate influence on the schools teaching poor students.
The complaint is probably the last opportunity left open to the union, District Council 37, in its efforts to reverse redundancies.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, support coordinators and other employees who were among the worst paid employees in the city and who had lost their jobs in a chess move on October 7, described the union leader as a political revenge for refusing access to a health fund that the working groups had maintained last year to close the budget gap.
This accusation was categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a hearing of the City Council, Dennis M. Walcott, director of the schools, said last month that the redundancies were part of the budget that was adopted in June.
A member of the City Council shot back and told him that nothing specified in the budget that staff would be released from school.
City Council officials 37 said they had and warned the Ministry of Education against a complaint. On Wednesday, there will be a press conference at which the submission of the complaint to the Supreme Court in Manhattan will be formally announced.
The complaint will present Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education of the city as accused and count eight dismissed workers as applicants, all of whom are coloured or Latin American women, like most of the helpers who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesperson of the Ministry of Justice of the city, said that the city did not present the complaint and therefore could not be commented on their individual claims.
According to a New York Times appeal draft, the union has concentrated on the number of redundancies in the city's poor districts to support a complaint for inequality, claiming that poor schools have lost more assistants because they have been under-financed chronically.
It explains that while there were no redundancies on Staten Island and few redundancies in the schools of the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school assistants in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, lost and 46 assistants in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx were released.
With the determination of the loss of five out of eight school assistants employed in the public school 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the complaint states: "This is not a neighborhood of shy parents who can organize donations to absorb budget cuts."
P.S.: The budget of the 36th district was cut by 3.26 percent this year. In addition, funds were lost when the city changed its method of calculating the extra funding for each poor school registration.
The union also complains that the heads of the high schools were led astray by the language in a memo authorizing the dismissal of the care coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the action, even if "excess" (German: transfer) in the US usually describes the change of a teacher from the paylist of a school to a pool of workers available from the central office.
"Sixty-six care coordinators were released, not transferred," says the draft appeal.
Mission ended, Congress ready to communicate with Libya
Finally, it seems as if Republicans and Democrats in Washington are already agreeing on the insurrections in Libya.
All that was needed was the success of the revolt, the arrest and murder of the long-standing dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the end of American interference.
On Thursday, the Senate's International Relations Committee will adopt a resolution under the chairman John Kerry (Massachussetts) together with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), praising Libya for the successful rebellion and the US troops for their "mut".
"This resolution honors the courageous people of Libya who started rebuilding their country," said Kerry.
"It is a confirmation of the support of its democratic efforts by two parties."
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing was easy in the Libya debate.
This summer, legislators of both parties and the White House argued on the choice of words of a series of resolutions to approve or disapprove the role of the US military in NATO's Libya mission.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution approving the restricted use of US military forces in Libya.
The law was rejected in the Senate by a wide group of both parties and there was no vote.
On the same day, however, this law fell into effect in the Senate. Furthermore, the board voted over a decision to reduce the funds for American operations in Libya.
As a result, the U.S. mission became a kind of legislative purgatory - with a congress, which, although charged enough, criticized Obama's approach within the framework of the mission, but not angry enough to finally pull away the ground under his feet.
Then the indecision of Congress was overtaken by events.
Tripoli fell among the Libyan rebels in August and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on International Relations "gratulates the people of Libya on their enormous courage and exceptional endurance in their self-liberation" and "blesses the men and women of the US military and their coalition partners who support military operations to protect the people of Libya for their exceptional courage and professionalism."
The resolution also reaffirms "the national interests of the United States at a successful and irrevocable transition from Libya to democracy".
Will the new measures be fully supported by the Foreign Relations Board, or will they divide the legislators as did the June Law?
The final version meets the resistance of Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the top republican of the committee.
Lugar's speaker said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to Kapitol, it is up to the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional change that calls for a balanced budget, a top priority in almost every Congress legislative period of the Republicans and some Democrats.
The measures under the direction of the Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional change in the budget or any other area currently coming to the vote in the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have so far tried unsuccessfully to put their changes to the vote, although they have often tried it enough.
Goodlattes amendment is just one of 68 constitutional amendments that have been presented to this Congress, covering a whole range of topics.
Some are double - the same law was presented to both Congress and Senate - others are only slightly different.
There are at least 15 versions of the budget change in the Senate alone and another dozen that would "control federal expenditure".
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their clients - especially beginners to the Republicans who want to polish their resume - the opportunity to boast that they have "conceived" such a measure.
The Budgetary Control Act, adopted in August, requires that both Senate and Congress vote on a change in the balance of the budget.
In March 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution which supports the idea of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions that members of the Congress can present, while Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wants to abolish the limit to two terms of office of the President.
Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a number of changes which, among other things, guarantee the right to good education and health care.
A change that prohibits marriage among the same sexes, as well as a change that prohibits the burning of flags, is an ever-increasing template.
Some legislators also want to allow the repeal of federal laws when two-thirds of the states reject them.
As eager as the members propose changes, they move at an even faster rate than in the past few years.
In the 111th Congress, legislators presented 77 such amendments in 110th Congress 66.
The pace fades compared to the early 1990s when members regularly proposed more than 150 changes every two years, according to the figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they were not much more successful than today.
The last amendment - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 but was actually proposed to Congress in 1789.
"Been hit, but not defeated," Giffords said in the first TV interview after the attack.
Ten months after an armed man shot at her in Tucson from a near distance during an election event, Republican Gabrielle Gibfords (Arizona) appeared on national television on Monday evening. She alone sang on the Broadway piece "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said that the desire to recover was greater than that to return to Congress.
When she appeared in the ABC messages "20/20" together with Diane Saxon, she scored in words and needed help in walking.
The mission showed the severe slow recovery of the damage that the bullet, which divides its skull, pierced the left side of its brain and crossed its head from the front to the back.
Three months ago, she surprisingly returned to Congress to give her voice to the debt brake triumphantly.
In her first TV interview after the attack in January, in which six people were killed and 13 injured, Gifford smiled, laughed and sang - and described her recovery as "silence".
When Saxon asked them how they felt, Gifford (41) answered: "Very good."
The interview with Gifford and her husband, the astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour "20/20" special recorded shortly before the publication of the new book of the couple: "Gabby: A Story About Courage and Hope."
The special follows Gifford's recovery since the attack of January 8.
In videos that Kelly recorded in the first weeks, she is seen in the hospital bed, with bare shaved head and a long scarf over the forehead.
She can only lift one or two fingers if her husband encourages her to do so.
Months later, Giffords sits in a wheelchair, while therapists show her how she performs simple movements.
A nickel with your head.
A jerk with the lips.
And then, their first words: "What."
After a few days Giffords whispers another word: "Toast". She wants her breakfast to be changed.
Videos played in the ABC show show show show that music played an important role in Gifford's recovery: You can see how the congressmen sing to Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and to Tom Petty's "Free Fallin'" together with the therapists.
In an interview with Saxon, Giffords, who spends two hours daily with therapy, said that she can't remember the day of the attack.
Her husband said that on March 12th, Gifford had read an article from a daily newspaper about the attack when she interrupted him and asked for the first time about the six people who had been killed during the attack.
The alleged shooter Jared Lee Loughner sits in a prison in Missouri and is forced to be treated medically while waiting for his trial.
"Many people have died," Giffords said.
"Heart, heart, heart."
In the course of his wife's recovery, Kelly said, "I was hit."
"So, I'd say, "Gabby, you weren't defeated," Kelly said.
You were just hit.
And you will endure this and you will recover, and you will come back stronger than ever before.
Forces feel more compassion than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that collected millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
A hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines gathered around him on a tag.
The crowd in black smokings stood up and cheered.
"The soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the donation campaign in the spring.
A high-ranking military officer on the Gala, observed, among other things, by Chief of Staff and then Chairman Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were introduced like orphans," the officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers meant well.
I know.
But it wasn't respect, it wasn't.
The harshly contradictory impressions illustrate the heavy relationship between the military and the most distant, sometimes admiring American public.
The troops are overcrowded with praise for their victims.
But the praise has its price, say servants.
The public is increasingly acting as if you were suffering people in uniform.
"We were by no means victims," said Brigade General Sean B. MacFarland, who was commanding troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But apparently the only way to support is to push us into the role of unhappy souls."
The issue is extremely sensitive to military leaders who do not want to appear ungrateful or in a dispute with the public they serve.
They have also recognized that the anger that struck the returning troops in the last years of the Vietnam War was far worse.
As a result, discussions about compassion in silence and private life take place between war veterans.
After his two sons returned from battles with the Navy, the colonel a.D. Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would consider them with a sense of awe, since they had defeated rebels and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if there was a "swallowing, violent veteran hidden beneath the surface," said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and after his return took over a raised state post in Washington.
While looking for a job, he said, he felt that some of the respondents subtlely asked if he was able to stand up to the pressure of a demanding post in Washington right after his return from the fight.
"If you speak about your ministry, you have to keep negative impressions against it," Cancian explained to his sons.
The lack of lightness of the military is partly rooted in the lack of interest of Americans in the war.
Performances in the battlefield are rarely taken as praise by a country that has little experience with the military and sees little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation, we no longer value military heroism as it was absolutely common in World War II," said Lieutenant General David Barno a.D., who ordered US troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public focuses largely on the suffering of a servant.
Forces find recognition for the number of attacks they have endured, the number of friends they have lost or for the severity of their injuries.
The military is facing the growing pressure for hard intervention in rape
This week, an important hearing will decide whether 28 women and men will be charged with non-intervention in the case of rape before the military court.
Should this not happen, hundreds of applicants will be ready for the next hearing.
Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and pregnant in the 11th week when she was raped by a fellow soldier at night.
It was in October 2008 and she just returned to her barracks in Miramar north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when she met a male colleague who carried a 12 pack of beer.
He asked her if he could accompany her for a drink in her room.
"My alarm bells went on," said Lyman.
But the Texan woman erased her concerns.
I thought, "Oh, what, he's 19.
He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I had listened to my stomach."
A few minutes after they went to Lyman's room, the man stepped behind her, pressed her down and raped her, claiming her.
This week, on November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel are anxiously waiting for a trial with a historical hearing in Arlington, Virginia, deciding whether a complaint they have brought against former Defense Minister Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be brought to justice.
The complaint claims that Gates and Rumsfeld have not acted against the widespread rape within the military and in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
In February submitted by Susan Burke, a Washington, D.C. lawyer, the action included 17 applicants, who in the following months increased to 28: 25 women and three men, all of whom claim to have been raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers, and the military failed to investigate, condemn or provide an appropriate case law according to the alleged attacks.
Burke says they're following the top military leadership, as the problem starts there.
"The military is hierarchical," she says.
"Who are the individuals who are in the position to exterminate the culture retribution of the? The leadership."
Burke also says that since February she has contacted nearly 400 other survivors, many of them could be part of future complaints.
Their strategy: Instead of all the applicants putting their eggs in a basket, as it were, they will, if necessary, file many more complaints in order to maintain the pressure.
The defense team for the Ministry of Defence, led by state attorney Neil MacBride, has submitted an application to reject the action.
The documents of the Court of First Instance, which are available in Newsweek, show in detail the defence strategy, primarily that the military cannot be charged by current or previous soldiers for violations that have occurred in the armed forces.
According to a 1950 Supreme Court law, the so-called Feres doctrine, the government is not liable for injuries committed to soldiers in active service.
"The alleged damage occurred during the plaintiff's military service," says the document.
The Ministry of Defence refuses any comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not allowed to serve in battle, the distinction is the only one: modern wars rarely have clear fronts.
Both in Iraq and Afghanistan, female soldiers’ teams play increasingly important roles, especially in contact with local women in the war zones.
The result: between these two wars, 150 soldiers died, two thirds of them in combat.
It's time for the military to be modernised, says Burke.
And she doesn't stand alone in her fight: three more complaints besides her are pending.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans' Legal Services Clinic is preparing a complaint against the four main military academies for alleged promotion of a anti-female atmosphere.
Independently, the non-profit Viet Nam Veterans of America collects a complaint against the military in which one focuses on the diagnosis of "personality disorder" that rape victims received in order to release them from service - a common practice according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
In December her group filed a complaint against the Veteran Administration (i.e. administration of war veterans) in which she accused her discriminatory practices in dealing with benefits for persons who claimed to have been sexually abused in service.
Nine laws were submitted to Congress independently of each other by a mixture of senators and representatives of both parties, which offer a number of clues.
According to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (: Office for Prevention and Reporting Sexual Abuse) of the Ministry of Defense 3,158 sexual abuses were reported in 2010.
However, most abuses are not reported at all and according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this figure takes into account about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases per year.
The report, which was published in March, also examines the law enforcement rates: 20 percent of the recorded cases in the military were brought to justice in 2010, only half as many as in civil law.
The applicants in Burke's case describe their attacks as just the first of a series of dreams.
In Lyman's case, she reported the alleged rape of the military less than an hour after the robbery.
That night, she says, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape to a whole series of police officers, doctors and commanders.
She had a rape set and the blood of her attacker, who came from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge. During this hearing, she was asked about the sex she had before the attack with her friend.
Six persons expressed themselves as character witnesses on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted.
"I remember the day the sentence was read," says Lyman.
"I thought the woes would be in, and I ran screaming out of the courtroom."
"They took me to the psychiatric department and I remember that when I got out, I said to my commander, "That wasn't his procedure. That was my procedure."
Lyman was invited to visit a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder and declared it incompetent.
In January 2010, she was dismissed, so that she did not receive any support.
Whether the complaint, the Lyman and the other applicants have filed, is pure speculation, says John Turley, professor of law at George Washington University Law School.
Nevertheless, he notes, "In my opinion, they should move forward."
What stands between them and a sentence is this doctrine, which has been criticized since it was first questioned.
I'm a contemporary critic of the Feres doctrine.
The military is lagging behind for a decade, because they do not have the same incentive and the same deterrence that liability brings.
He adds, "The odds are against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things will only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing does not follow her path, Burke, the plaintiff's lawyer, will begin with her hundreds of other applicants for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the military in this respect until reforms occur," she says.
Or until we die, whatever happens first.
Walls have eyes: how researchers watch you on Facebook
Before he became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just one of many boys who sent their anti-immigration opinion online.
On Monday, Breivik, who confessed to have committed an ambulance in Norway in July, where 77 people were killed, had his first public hearing in court.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is by far not alone in cyberspace: he has spent a lot of time on his computer until his attack and chatted with some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing extremities on the side of network networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how do you find them?
This is easy - you just have to log in to Facebook.
"We found that it was not difficult to come to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recent report from the British Ideas Factory DEMOS on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook's hiding of personal data is so encyclopaedic, Bartlett says that researchers simply need to use the site's advertising tool to precisely define their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy - as marketers have for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans of far-right groups across Europe and then visited them with add-ons, but instead of linking to a new band or a new diet product, the add-ons invited users to a survey asking for their level of education, their attitude towards violence and the assessment of their own future.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to question more than 10,000 supporters of 14 extremely right-wing parties in 11 European countries - without even having to leave their office once.
"It's a pretty new research method," says Bartlett.
Some of the results hardly surprise. Online promoters of right-wing extreme groups are mostly young, male and angry about immigration.
But in a kind of surprising twist, "those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who sit behind their computer screens."
DEMO's work is just an example of how Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Ideas factories, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study everything, from health issues to social trends such as "likes", text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding on average three content per day, Facebook's "Data Supernova" generates a research boom that has increased the number of scientific work with the name of this page in the title by almost 800% in the last five years.
For some researchers, the beautiful thing about Facebook is the fact that you can study people through this page that you don't normally reach with your clipboard on the street.
"If you used to try to question people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"They had to inform the party first and they would never have granted them access," says Bartlett.
"With Facebook all this falls away - they go directly to them."
Others say that the site offers an opportunity to identify and solve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues have found that students who discussed their total noise on Facebook are significantly more inclined to drink problems than students who are silent about this topic.
Moreno suggests that equal students, such as residential consultants, monitor the page and help a student if this posts too many status updates.
"You can't solve a problem if you haven't recognized it," said Dimitri Christakis, Morenos co-author and head of Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle, Washington Post.
"We have found a way to identify endangered children who would not otherwise have been found."
Facebook also constantly taps the data of its own population.
The page's data team has compiled statistics on the relationship status and Valentine's Day, election participation in the intermediate elections in 2010 and a national lucky index (which primarily used information that only Facebook has access to - Masters of digital freedom have long known that the site should make its large data fund pit accessible for other research purposes).
But the users of Facebook know that the site is watching them whether they want it or not. To be able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, the site allows you to share your own personal data.
But what if the users of Facebook become part of a survey they don't even know anything about?
While researchers have strict guidelines on how to collect their data offline, everything is allowed online.
"I don't think many users have ever thought about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, about a study from 2006 in which he examined the public pages of students on Facebook.
"As far as she's concerned, it was only about her and her friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline there is no guarantee that a researcher is absolutely honest.
On Facebook it is impossible to know how many of the information is true in a user profile and in posts.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things," says Selwyn.
Therefore, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn thinks that a clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools anyone can use.
"There is no substitute for going out into the real world and talking to real people," he says.
"Social research must take care of social issues - and a lot of social life is still taking place offline."
"Cold and inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik appears in public court for the first time
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who stood up to two amok races in which 77 people were killed in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance" fighter in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a temple knight in Norway," he said in front of a courtroom with more than 500 people.
"I object to the court because you have received your mandate from organizations that support hate-sideologies and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I acknowledge the laws, but I don't think I'm guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which he can express his views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who had a speech written in advance, to contact the families of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered that the Breivik police keep in detention for 12 more weeks, that he does not have access to the media for four weeks. He said that the authorities will closely control all visits and all correspondence over eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and members of the victims participated in the hearing.
Some came in the hope of seeing Breivik in the eye, others wanted to confirm that he stayed behind the castle and bars.
Everyone took part in the goal that everything would go out of the way.
"I thought he looked cold and inhuman," said a survivors of Utoya to the Norwegian transmitter NRK.
"It was unpleasant, but for me it went a bit further after I saw and heard the suspect."
Breivik wore a dark suit and a blue tie and worked calmly and professionally throughout the hearing. He looked journalists and survivors in the eye when he left the building building and left again.
Despite Breivik's bizarre suggestion that he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge came to the conclusion that he was not mentally ill and said there was no evidence that he had had any complicits.
Some may have liked that the attacks of July 22 seem to have been the work of a single extremist and not that of a group of radicals.
But does this automatically ease the grief and confusion that a whole nation still feels?
"I wish he looked like a monster, but he doesn't," said a victim's family.
"It would be so much easier if he did."
7 lessons of the interview with the deceased Steve Jobs, which was shown in a theatre this week
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5, some compared him with Henry Ford, highlighting the technique genius as a great modern inventor.
What Apple fans might find most enlighteningly in the recently discovered job interview, which was dusted this week before special film shows on the important markets, is how much this creative head understood business processes and workflows.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and self-appointed hippie, but he was also an meticulous organizer who was eagerly basking on diagrams - a man who believed that many executives suffer from "a disease of thinking," "that a truly great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] there is a huge amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995 Bob Cringenly developed the TV series "Triumph of Specialists" on the start of the personal computer. And he sat together for more than an hour with jobs in which they held one of the rare, detailed conversations.
At that time, 10 years had passed since jobs had been forced out of Apple. And he was already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, and was looking forward to the broad acceptance of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringley's interview was used in specialists, he says that the copy templates of the interview were missing during delivery.
Only after jobs were discovered a complete VHS copy in the director's garage.
This slightly revised film material forms the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview", which will come to the Landmark Theatre this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who is known to abhor detailed interviews, jobs appear surprisingly zealous in explaining his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
In the course of the interview, there are four longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds of reflection, in which jobs clearly weigh his thoughts and work for accuracy.
There are also moments when jobs' perfectionism comes to light when he seems impatient to respond to Cringely's questions and push him to respond more quickly to topics or side-handlings of greater importance.
In front of the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, the lost interview seems somehow eerie when jobs assess what other companies do make his opinion right or wrong and its own vision of the future of the computer.
It is one thing to read posthumous words of career jobs. But seeing jobs here as the covetous dreamer, who is on the jump to greatness, is something quite different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could be and should be.
Shortly after he had done all of this here, he pulled off and did it.
A quick look at seven remarkable sequences of the lost interview:
How he learned to run a company:
"During all the years in the business, I always ask, "Why are you doing things?" And the answer you always get is, "Oh, that's how it's done."
No one knows why he's doing what he's doing.
I found out.
Jobs continues its efforts to rationalise accounting at Apple.
Astonished at how costs were recorded - mostly with "standard costs", which were counted on mere presumption and which were then adjusted with "deviation" - he developed an automated factory that ensured that the business costs could be determined to the smallest extent.
How the Pope was specialised:
Jobs tells of the "Blue Box", which he built with Steve Wozniak, a device with which one could sneak into the phone company and conduct remote calls for nothing.
Much has already been written about the device, but jobs enthusiasm when he describes the Blue Box as an act of self-authorization is contagious.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a payable phone, making a call, and then connecting from an AT&T network to another, while broadcasting as many satellites as possible.
"We sent things half a dozen times around the globe, and if you shuddered into the phone, it would come out again a minute later in the phone next door," says Job Kichernd.
"We were young and we learned that we can build something ourselves that can control trillions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
We both didn't know much, but we could build this little thing that can control a huge thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don't think there would be Apple without it.
Jobs continues to tell of a glorious strike that Wozniak and he almost removed when they called through Blue Box in the middle of the night in the Vatican and wanted to talk to the Pope, while they were so good at reproducing Henry Kissinger.
Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy were called in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two had to laugh before the Pope himself came to the phone.
How he fell in love with the technology (and unprepared to call Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, when he was looking for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he looked for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after her 20-minute phone call, jobs for the summer received a part-time job at Hewlett-Packard.
"That had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only company I had seen at the age and it shaped my views on what a company was and how well it treated its employees."
Later, jobs became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever manufactured".
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen with Braunsch Tube and I fell in love with him.
I would climb up at HP as a teenager and hang on this machine and write programs for them.
How to improve innovation:
Several times in the interview, jobs talk about how to spontaneously invent new products.
Early in his career, when he built a few boards, he was asked by a customer to assemble the entire computer.
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had to think through both assembly and delivery of finished equipment.
Later, at Apple, he recalls the problems he had in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember striking arguments... they shouted that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] and I stood up, went out and found a manufacturer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could have built for $15, which was incredibly credible.
About large companies that drop:
Long before he revived Apple, jobs foresaw the ways in which so many industrial giants were stumbled with their visions and lost control of their shares.
"Let's say you work at IBM or Xerox, so do you make a better copyer or printer, so what?"
You own the stock monopoly, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [it is such people] who ultimately lead the companies and the product with which people are pushed out of decision-making.
The product genius that has led to this monopoly position is exterminated by the people who have no concept of good products vs. bad products - craftsmanship.
That happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
You could have been ten times bigger if it could have been Microsoft of the 1990s...
You've caught the defeat of victory.
About innovation as an art form:
"It's a lot of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product... when you develop this great idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot about his subtleties.
You have to make votes, certain things you can't, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You have to remember 5,000 things, these concepts, and bring them all together...
In the end, it goes out to taste, it goes beyond trying to deal with the best stuff man has created and then trying to bring these things together to what one does.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We are always shameless in stealing great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people who work there were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who happened to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If it had not been the computer industry, they would create fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas are dinning with opponents of health laws, as court adopts case
On the day the Supreme Court gathered behind closed doors to discuss the political-sharing question of whether to hear a challenge to President Obama's health laws, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, took part in a dinner sponsored by the law firm that the case is represented in court.
The incident took place last Thursday when all nine judges met for a meeting to discuss the petitions for examination.
One of the cases to be dealt with was a complaint brought by 26 states against the far-reaching reform of health care, which was decided last year by Congress, a law that has been labeled by conservative activists throughout the United States.
The judges agreed to the hearing. In fact, a 5 1/2-hour basic discussion is expected in March, which is likely to stimulate the 2012 presidential struggle, which will be in full swing at the time the court decision is announced.
The lawyer standing in court who will claim that the law is to be tipped will probably be Paul Clement, once State Attorney General under the government of George W. Bush.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of the almost two dozen companies that supported the annual dinner of the federalist society, an old-fashioned group dedicated to the defence of conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsors the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the economic associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, who challenge the law.
Another sponsor was pharmacologist Pfizer Inc., who is financially involved in the outcome of the process.
The dinner took place a few hours after the court had discussed the case, at a Washington hotel.
Among other things, Mitch McConnell, the Head of the Republican Group in the Senate and a declared opponent of the health reform
The guests of the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: the two judges have been attending federalist society events for years.
And that does not violate moral rules.
Indeed, judges exempt themselves from the Code of Conduct, which regulates the actions of the lower federal judges.
If they were, they would probably fall under principle 4c of the Code, which states: "A judge may participate in benefit events of law nearer and other organizations, where the judge shall not be a speaker, guest of honor or a guest of such events according to the program."
Nevertheless, the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the firms involved in the case and to a company with a massive financial interest in it was sufficient to alert moral and government activists.
"This amazing break with morality and the opposition to the code punishes the actions of some judges lying, the court adheres to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of the Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the United States.
"The judges won and thinned during a benefit event with lawyers with floating proceedings at the court."
Their appearance and support for a donation campaign for this event undermine any claim to impartiality and are not acceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little consideration for critics, who say that they would be court matters too easily mixed with groups that can be guided by the agenda, such as federalist society.
And Thomas' wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
On the other hand, the conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was the general prosecutor under the Obama government when the first law appeals first came to court.
Her critics urged Kagan to withdraw from hearing the case for bias, as she was too committed to defending the law to be unbiased.
Kagan doesn't make institutions to do this.
Boeing attracts record order of 18 trillion dollars ashore
Airline Emirates orders 50 two-way Boeing 777 aircraft with an option on 20 more aircraft.
Furthermore, Boeing sold six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a business worth more than $1 trillion.
It's really a rare message that a company gets an order over 50 pieces of its products.
But it's a big deal if the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the list price for these 50 aircraft totals a record sum of 18 trillion dollars.
Similarly unusual is the customer of Boeing: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines from the Middle East will need 2.520 aircraft worth $450 trillion in the next 20 years.
Boeing announced on the weekend its biggest order ever for commercial aircraft, measured by the value of the order: 50 two-way Boeing 777 Jets.
The hammer order came from the airline Emirates from Dubai.
Furthermore, in 2011, Boeing announced on the Dubai Aviation Show that it has an option to purchase 20 more aircraft that will increase the total list price to 26 trillion dollars.
On Monday, according to Boeing Oman Air, six Boeing 787-8, the so-called Dreamliner, ordered enormously improving the fuel consumption and comfort of passengers.
The list price for six of these aircraft is more than $1 trillion.
"This is absolutely positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, stock exchange specialist at Morningstar.
"The quality of these special customers is very high."
Many Middle East airlines are owned by oil producing countries.
So they don't just have the money to pay for the aircraft. Rather, an increase in oil prices, which usually harms airlines, as this is one of their biggest cost points, is not so harmful as the country deserves at a higher oil price.
This is important because they tend less than other airlines to cancel or postpone aircraft orders when oil prices rise, said Dihora.
"You have a natural security," he said.
The appointment of Emirates confirms Boeing's leadership position on the market for large space aircraft and helps to keep the Airbus competitor SAS in check, which attacks the predominance with the A350.
Boeing's victory on the aviation show comes four months after Airbus announced that it would postpone the introduction of the largest A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
The introduction was postponed to gain more confidence after customers had demanded a higher payload and reach.
The Boeing shares rose by 1.5% to $67.94.
Sister of the Mexican President apparently loses election in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that drug dealers supported Fausto Vallejo from the PRI in the race for the governor's post.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon apparently lost her application for the office of governor of Muchocyan during the violent state elections, claiming on Monday that drug dealers had influenced the race in favour of one of her opponents.
According to the preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo won the race for the governors' posts in the Western state from the institutional party of the Revolution, the PRI.
"The intervention of organised crime during the entire electoral process and especially on yesterday's day is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country," Luisa Maria Calderon said in a radio interview one day after the election on Sunday.
"You threatened our candidates, our employees in the polls ... You have occupied election cabins, set up roadblocks ... and instructed people to vote for the PRI."
The PRIs ruled in Mexico for seven decades until they lost the presidency in 2000.
But they are striving for a return and victory in Michoacan is an important step in these efforts.
The PRI is hoping for a victory in the July presidential election.
Vallejo seems to have barely beaten Claderon, who had remained in the polls before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate for her brother's conservative Partido Acción Nacional PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left-wing Democratic Revolution Party PRD, the currently reigning governor, came to third place, a severe defeat for the split and unlucky left leadership for the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to recognise the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denies links to drug dealers and urges the other candidates to accept the results.
For a long time, Michoacan was dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and amphetamines.
It is the home country of President Calderon and he has chosen Michoacan to launch a military offensive against drug dealers in December 2006.
The violence is still continuing.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election during a election event for Luisa Maria Calderon and numerous candidates have left the local elections for fear.
For the PRI a victory strengthens the party, no matter how reluctant the elections in Michoacan appear.
The man who is supposed to represent the PRI in the race for the presidential office is Enrique Pena Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory will make us look boldly into the next year."
ADB urges Asia to help rescue the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) calls on India and China to support the rescue of the eurozone in its severe debt crisis in order to prevent a long-term downward trend that will slow the growth of Asia’s economy.
Rajat Nag, managing director of ADB based in Manila, said that the two fastest growing economic nations in the world must do everything in their power to speed up the recovery of the currency block either through the International Monetary Fund or through direct mutual agreements.
He warned against the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China), who are "unpassionate" looking at the difficulties in Europe, and said that the financial support of European leadership and European resources through Asia helps to prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in the same boat."
"So anyone who can help Europe out of this crisis is helpful," he told the Financial Times in an interview on the verge of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it's not immune."
"So if China and India can help, then by all means."
Europe's monetary union has been experiencing a serious debt crisis in recent months.
In the last few days, Italy's interest costs have risen dangerously, and the Prime Ministers have resigned both from Italy and from Greece.
The emerging serious debt crisis in Europe is a source of fears that the global economy could fall into recession and led to calls for the leading emerging economies to join forces to support the eurozone.
Mr Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channelled by the IMF, but said that mutual agreements - such as the purchase of EU rescue fund bonds, the European Financial Stabilisation Facility (EFSF) - would offer greater negotiating power to European partners in Asia.
Anand Sharma, the Indian trade minister, said that "India will do everything in its power" to help the eurozone, as its own economy is now suffering from declining exports and the drying out of foreign capital flows.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We are facing major challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not an option, it's an order, because where else we find work for our millions of young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies like India have no reason to help the rich Europeans if they themselves face major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at Brown University, said that it would be very difficult politically to sell to the 1.2 trillion people in India help for Europe, of which more than 800 million of 2 dollars or less live on the day.
"Sometimes they will find out that the Greeks will retire at 50 and spend holidays on the beach. Then you have a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, managing director of the World Economic Forum, asked similarly why India's reserves should be used to maintain the numerous and well-paid public service employees in Greece, with jobs in poorly managed, loss-bearing facilities such as the railway.
Mr Nag said that the crises in the euro area will have "significant domino effects" across Asia.
ADB's forecast of economic growth of 7.5 percent in Asia for 2011/threats "the risk of gradation" due to the threat from Europe.
He said vulnerable emerging markets would have to create "crisis plans" to protect themselves from a downward trend and a significant migration of capital from their institutions.
Urgent warnings from the Pentagon about possible cuts in the defence system
Minister of Defence Leon Panetta held the congress on Monday when he warned that automatic budget cuts would unobtrusively weaken national security, triggering a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon halls to the war scenes in Afghanistan and the civilian flow belts.
The Pentagon is already imagining reductions of $450 trillion in the course of the coming decade, but is now afraid that further reductions of $600 trillion or more will be necessary if the Congress is unable to complete the expenses.
"The effects of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry," Panetta wrote in a letter to Republican senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that a failure of Congress to reach a budget agreement, which will lead to a so-called seizure, would result in 23% general reductions and a halt of numerous new projects.
"Such a high reduction, carried out in such a careless way, would make most of our ship and construction projects unfeasible - you can't buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and other modernisation efforts seriously damage," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would also be forced to separate ourselves from much of our civilian staff involuntarily and, as the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would have to leave civilians with the certainty of limited probability in order to achieve the goal."
"These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and seriously damage our willingness to be alert."
The cuts were finally met by the fighting forces," said Panetta.
"While the wartime quotas are not directly affected by the seizure in the anti-terrorist struggle, the serious intervention in the basic budget would have a negative impact on the war effort," Panetta warned.
"Personal attitudes have been shortened, which would lead to delays in attitudes and recruitment supervision that support the war."
"The staff's salaries would be reduced, leading to late payments to war time dealers and the legal and political support would be disrupted."
The two senators replied to Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details regarding the potential influence of automatic cuts on the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequences of confiscation of the Ministry of Defence would lead to a rapid decline of the United States as the world's leading military power."
"We are vehement against this draconian act," the senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
"This is a result that we cannot live with, and it is certainly not that we should be forced."
"The confiscation is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and its entry should not be allowed."
Whether Panetta's letter and the new senators' warnings will increase the pressure on a budget compromise or increase demands to exclude the Pentagon from cuts remains pending.
Panetta has increasingly boldly expressed the possible reductions, although he has been able to gain many years of experience with the budget in Congress and in the White House before he came to the top of the Pentagon, and knows that he is facing heavy decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Minister of Defence painted a dark picture of what might be ahead - a military with shell, but without core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without ammunition."
"It's an Air Force brother without a sufficiently trained pilot."
"It's a paperman, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers capable of fulfilling the mission," Panetta said in his opening address at the Pentagon.
"It is a military force that lacks morality and alertness and is unable to take it with potential opponents."
"She'll make a real anger."
In an annex to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta cited new details as reducing "significant operational risks: delays in times of crisis, conflicts and disasters, serious restrictions on our global employability and intruder, leading to unacceptable risk in future war operations."
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defence projects of the removal could fall victim to, including those that have already been tested and are already in the early planning phase.
This list includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomber, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Littoral Combat Ship and the new ground fighter vehicle that Army and Navy need to replace the Humvee.
If we stop the further development and testing of the F35, this would save up to $80 trillion over the next 10 years, but the supporters say that it is an important next step to upgrade, so that possible dangers can be opposed by China and other opponents.
How to Unravel a Lie
A look at the current headlines shows how anxious and widespread deception and lying are in daily life.
The presidential candidate of the Republicans, Herman Cain, is engaged in overcoming the accusations of sexual harassment by several women. Both sides accuse each other of lying.
Penn State's leadership is accused of perjury because it is said that one has held back reports after which a retired football coach has sexually abused boys.
Last week an open microphone was heard when French President Nikolas Sarkozy told American President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
The New York Congressman and Internet Exhibitionist Anthony Weidner became a fool when he launched denials that were quickly disproved by indisputable evidence.
The former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of infringing campaign financing, which is related to the cover-up of an extramarital affair.
And then, of course, nobody who has experienced it forgets the media circus that President Bill Clinton triggered when he lied during his second term in the Oval Office regarding his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Stories about cheating in school and college tests are widespread.
There have been incidents when teachers have given their students the answers to the exams so that they themselves were well aware of their performance tests.
Mentors who should teach the opposite should send a message that lies and cheating are okay.
How much deception do we experience?
As studies prove, we lie between 10 and 200 times every day.
Many of these lies, however, are regarded as an emergency lie.
Another study shows that strangers lie to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
Recognizing lies or "discovering lies" is one that is important for every person, for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from a game of society, such as Sharaden, in which the goal is to call "go!", detachment of deception is a serious field of knowledge, based on scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities, which carried out extensive research research, especially in the fields of psychology and physiology.
One result of the research is that most ancient myths have been degenerated about lying.
Lies look one in the eye.
They don't always stutter, stem, redden and tumbled.
But it must not be concluded that these liars are difficult to detect and degenerate.
A trained lying detachment can penetrate the truth by learning something about the structure of the claim, the fine facial expressions, about questioning and timing.
I have spent several years studying the scientific results of the comprehensive and ever-growing area of detachment, and it is clear that detachment is a modern ability that is easy to learn and helps us in finding comfort in our complex world, especially if the setting up or questioning of persons or negotiations or administration are one of our own professional responsibilities.
Good liars are very good at appreciating other people, their interest in them and their own emotions, and they feel intuitive as they are perceived by others.
Thanks to research, we know that the extroverted people lie more often than introverted people do, that men look more often "self-oriented" lies than women whose lies are more "oriented to others" - usually they want to protect the feelings of others - that married people lie to their partners less often than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are usually "fat lies".
We also know that when a person has been degenerated as an evildoer, others feel less guilty of lying to that person.
How do you know if someone's lying?
First of all, by observing the normal behavior of this person.
That's called "baselining", the starting position.
It sets a reference point for later evaluation of changes.
Watch the attitude, the laughter, the voice quality of their experimenter.
You should know better when someone normally trips his foot constantly, so that they do not unjustly accuse him when he tripps with his foot during a meeting.
Then pay attention to accumulations of conspicuous verbal and non-verbal behaviors.
Consider these accumulations as alarm bells that shriek, not as evidence of a detachment.
People who cheat may stare when they try to remember their story. Perhaps their feet point towards the door or they lean toward the exit, change their position in a significant way or show a "relaxation after the interview", this deep, relaxing exhalation and the change in attitude when all the hard questions are over.
Questioners often falsely signal that a job interview is over, just to look for this relaxation after the interview.
Also pay attention to the language of your experimental person.
Scott Peterson's slipper is famous when he used the past form when he claimed that his dead wife was still alive and triggered a national search for her.
Disgusting persons can also use a distant language: "I had no sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or if you repeat a delicate question in general.
The most common verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualifying language" when answering a delicate question: "Well... to tell you the truth ... as far as I know ... according to best knowledge and conscience."
This makes the answer more perceptive than factual, which often makes the alarm bells shriek.
There is no magic means to detach lies, but you can learn skills that make it possible to detach.

Controversial plan of an oil pipeline is revised after danger by delayed US approval
A few days after the Obama government threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada in the Gulf of Mexico, which was annoyed by the trade unions and at the same time calmed environmentalists, the pipeline-building company is trying to redesign the project so that one can return to normality.
On Monday evening, TransCanada said that the planned pipeline will be diverted from the ecologically sensitive area of the sandhills in Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Nebraska Parliamentary Building.
Alex Pourbax of TransCanada said that the company continued to be confident that the pipeline was finally approved, although with a different course.
This was followed by an announcement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs last week, after which a decision on a federal permit for the project would be postponed until the new possible course was reviewed which would avoid the area of the sandhills in Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, a large underwater supply.
"This is a real step forward," said Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, to Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs may postpone a decision until 2013, after the elections next year, even if officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama stated last week in a written statement that the decision was a task of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and agreed to his support.
The 1700 miles pipeline was connected to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would pump 700,000 barrels of oil a day from Alberta Province to the refineries in Texas.
To do this, the pipeline would have to cross six states.
Environmentalists hate them, but labour markets love them because they appreciate that the pipeline creates 20,000 jobs.
However, the legislators of Nebraska, who are against the plan, weigh the laws to force a departure from the region of the Sandhills and the Ogallala aquifer, a main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study on the impact on the environment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has found that the project has little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy industry says that the main auditor of the Ministry has requested a separate probe of the review procedure that focuses on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist who was recruited by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a consultant to Hillary Clinton in 2008, is in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company commissioned to conduct the original study was an inappropriate choice because it is connected with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle accused of allegedly forcing an infant out of fear to vomit
A New York family claims that the Disco Diva Patti LaBelle in the lobby of her Manhattan building had suffered a suicide attack that scared her little daughter so much that she gave in to fear.
The tirade of the "Lady Marmalade" singer made the 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so afraid that she suffered from "personality changes, sleep disturbance" and "enhanced fear of strangers," said her family at the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was on November 10th last year when the stage worker Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, wanted to go on a family trip, and Genevieve.
While Kevin Monk picked up the car, Roseanna Monk went with the luggage and Genevieve on her arm into the lobby in her building on Riverside Boulevard.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and left her daughter for a moment.
"Someone appeared behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said, "Yes," and went to take her back to her arm," she said.
LaBelle urged the pregnant woman to be angry.
"She said in an aggressive tone, "You shouldn't put your daughter near the door," said Roseanna Monk.
"I told her, "I don't care what you say or think."
She became angry and began to slander - she used the F-word and the A-word and became very loud...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and began to tilt water from the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve had become hysterical.
"I said to this woman, "See what you did to my daughter," said the child's mother.
LaBelle fell on the mother who was still wearing Genevieve on her arm, and had to be held back from her companion and pulled to a waiting car, said Roseanna Monk.
The baby screamed so much that it had to surrender, she said.
Later, the LaBelle family asked for an apology in writing, but received no answer.
LaBelle's lawyer and representative did not respond to calls requesting an opinion.
The complaint is based on a non-determined compensation, but the family lawyer, Sam Davis, said that he does not charge a fee and the family plans to donate the money they get to child cancer aid.
"We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her behavior," said Davis.
"This kind of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially when it is displayed in front of a nurse who is carrying an 18-month-old baby on her arm."
Climate hardships slowed the economy down
In the first year, in which Mario López Valdez is a member of the government, unemployment and undeclared work rose in Sinaloa, while foreign investment fell and the economy stagnated.
2011 will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloas. It is the first year that Mario López Valdez, who describes himself as the initiator of change and inspires great hopes of economic growth, is on the government. However, as a result of the climateic dissensions, there can be no mention of growth, but on the contrary, the main economic indicators deteriorated.
The low temperatures in February not only caused losses in millions of heights in agriculture but also narrowed the growth of the state economy and caused a general decline in economic activity by 3.6 percent in the first quarter of the year.This is mainly due to the historic decline in agricultural development by 31,16 percent, which has slowed down further economic sectors.
According to a report published by Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustentable (d. Mexican Council for Sustainable Agricultural Development) on the effects of the frost, 582,000 hectares of agricultural land were damaged, 78.03 percent of which were completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07 percent were partially destroyed.
The decline in economic activity by November has continued to increase unemployment in the Mexican state. The Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía observed a rapid increase in unemployment in the first quarter, since from January to March 55,053 people had no employment, corresponding to 4.53 percent of the working population. In the second quarter the unemployment rate rose to 5.28 percent and from July to September to 6.19 percent, resulting in 74,000 unemployed in Sinaloa. This is 18 969 people more than in the first quarter.
Less liquidity
The unemployment rate in Sinaloa in the year is based on several factors. The economist Gerardo López Cervantes, Dean of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences at the University of Autónoma (UAS), commented, the policy of the public institutions indirectly explains the growing unemployment.
"What we are currently observing is an increase in unemployment, which has to do with several factors. Among other things, with liquidity losses on the market as a result of the cutbacks in the legislation adopted to combat money laundering in Congress, it is not easy for those who are banned to have them work for themselves, to invest them or to use them for something else," he said.

López Cervantes pointed out that growing unemployment is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people leaving the country in search of work abroad, especially in the United States, has fallen. This is due on the one hand to the entry problems and on the other hand, because it is difficult to find work there too. These people stay here and are looking for work here, which makes unemployment rise," he says.
Undeclared work
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more serious if one takes into account the high proportion of undeclared work, which, according to INEGI, includes 60.38 percent of those employed in the country who work without paying into the social security funds.
Unemployment and undeclared work are the lowest wages, the lowest in Mexico, according to the statistics of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican Social Insurance Institute) and the Secretaryía del Trabajo y Previsión Social (Governmental Authority for Labour and Social Care in Mexico).
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa was 5352 pesos by September, much less the general government average, which is 7375 pesos.
ADI decrease
In addition to reducing economic activity and increasing unemployment, the largest fall in foreign direct investment (ADI) over the last ten years is recorded in 2011. According to Secretaryía de Economía (State Economic Authority), the ADI was $630,597 from January to June, which is 87.74 percent against the 5 143,312 in the same period in the previous year.
The Secretary of Desarrollo Económico del Gobierno (Government Authority for Economic Development) for its part records a total investment of 17 280 000 pesos in 2011, mainly from companies in the tertiary sector.
Debts
In the light of the economic crisis, the state government requested a loan of 3 000 000 000 pesos to be invested in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities at the National Congress in July. The state Congress approved an amount of 200 600 000 pesos, but by November no positive effects of debt could be found on any of the sectors in the country.

The first government year of Mario López Valdé's government incapacity was revealed for the entrepreneurship representatives.
Miguel Loredo López, Chairman of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (State Chamber of the Manufacturing Industry in Mexico), said that in 2011 no effort was made to harmonise the views of the different sectors, including the state government.
"The economic activity in Sinaloa was really poor this year. It has to be worked hard to recover the land lost this year and we have to put forth double effort in 2012. The efforts of all and in particular the progress of the already well agreed government team have not been sufficiently coordinated," he said.
Slow economic development
Loredo López said that events, such as the frost at the beginning of the year, made economic development of the country difficult and slowed down.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, including the frost. One of the most important effects is a slow economy that is not sufficiently moving to create an economic dynamic that could create an acceptable flow of processes, products and services. Therefore, we will conclude the year well below our expectations," he said.
Redefined appeal
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, chairman of the Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana (Micica Entrepreneur's Association) in Sinaloa, stated that the state should be encouraged to engage in more dynamic productive activities.
"In general, we have observed that work has been done. We believe it is necessary to develop a long-term programme to redefine the country's economic vocation and line, because it is important to activate all material and human resources Sinaloas," he said.
There is a lot to do
The president of Coparmex stressed the importance of developing a future perspective that will guide the government's efforts in better direction.
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas, and economic development has progressed, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He stressed that the current state power had made progress with the government.
"There are areas where it can be said that the government has acted more comprehensively. What I can say is that has been worked and that the government is aware that there is still a lot of work ahead of it," he said.
Arrest for 8 kg marijuana
Five years in prison and 100 daily sentences, a resident of Navolato was sentenced to eight kilos of marijuana.
The Republic’s prosecutor announced that the drug retailer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was punished for a crime against public health - here the trade-related property of marijuana.
According to file AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested on 7 June 2010 by Mexican military forces in the surveillance of Cipriano Valdez Street in front of watchpoint No. 80 in the village of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug retailer drove in a white van where he kept a black bag in a box in the car and on the passenger seat a small backpack where the military found eight kilos and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the seized goods were handed over to the judge of the district and the punished person is still in the execution centre.
Debt for construction work
The social structures for migrants provided for in the Hábitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 programmes are at risk of not being completed because of lack of funds or only with great delay, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The head of the Urban Social Development Authority stated that, although the construction programmes are already advanced, they are now floating in danger, as the state government has not paid for the funds allocated to them, which exceed 11 million peso for the three programmes.
He said that the total investment in these three programmes amounted to almost 50 million peso, of which 25 percent fell on the state. So far, only the Federación and the municipality had contributed to the construction work, which is why a delay in the end of the construction can be expected.
"12 million they have to contribute, and although the year is already coming to an end, they have not given us a penny, and this, although they have had to pay us a part already in July," he said. "In order not to be too late, we have already started the construction work, and they are already far advanced, but we need the money."
He stressed that under the government of Jesús Aguilar Padilla the state had failed to fulfil its obligations, which is why the municipality had to receive a loan of 7 million at the beginning of its reign. This corresponds to the amount that the central government should have raised.
"This had already happened to us in the last legislative period, because the state did not have sufficient economic resources. The programmes continued to run and this year we had to obtain the funds that the state had not raised to participate in these programmes," he said.
Although the State authorities are obliged to disburse these funds, he commented that the Minister for Administration and Finance , was requested to speed up administrative work and to pay the outstanding share as soon as possible.
"As many as 12 million have to contribute, and even though the year is coming to an end, they have not given us a penny."
The Court of First Instance approves the transition to digital television in Mexico in 2015
The switchover of analogues to digital signals has been one of the most important changes in the world in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) rejected the constitutional complaints filed by the Senate and the House of Deputies against the President's Office and ordered that the switch from analogue to digital signals be made from 2021 to 2015 on the basis of a lack of eight votes required to challenge the law.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, felt that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his responsibilities when he issued the Decree of Law with the details of the switchover to terrestrial digital television.
This decision rejected the constitutional dispute initiated by the Senate, since it did not receive the necessary qualified majority of eight votes so that the court could decide on constitutionality or non-constitutionality. Thus, the law remains in force.
The project for the action, prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed that the Decree-Law be declared unconstitutional, since the regulations concerning radio and television are the responsibility of the Comisión Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel) (Federal Commission for Telecommunications in Mexico), which is why the Decree would contradict the hierarchical principles and reserve of law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted for the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies filed constitutional complaints against the Decree of Law. Following the adoption of the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero no longer applied the Decree of Law and filed all the activities for the establishment of the digital transmission.
The Council of Ministers also rejected the action brought by the Chamber of Deputies, without entering into the debate on the project for which Minister Sánchez Cordero was also responsible.
In his contribution, the Prime Minister said that he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the country government should not regulate the measures to be taken by the public administration by means of general rules.
"I do not believe that, if you do, the independence of the regulatory body would be affected." She also recalled that the central government is responsible for the planning of strategic policy areas, such as the telecommunications sector, for constitutional reasons, because this leads the state affairs.
The replacement of analogue signals by digital is one of the most important changes that have taken place in recent years around the world, and it makes better use of the radioelectric spectrum, increased signal quality and more channels.
Moving the changeover, she said, was a postponement of the use of digitalization, which is a decision in the public interest that has not only technical aspects, "because it includes economic, social, political and security aspects."
These matters, she stressed, "made the whole system necessary, in accordance with the principle of economic governance by the state they included a group of features that put the constitution in the hands of the central government."
She recalled that many countries around the world had already carried out the digital transformation, including the government, although they had highly specialised facilities.
It could not be concluded that with the issue of the contested decree of law, the government intervened in the powers of Congress, for the laws passed by the legislative would be complied with," she assured.
The possibility of counting the voting notes individually in Michoacán is considered
According to the PREP data, the difference between the first and the second place in the election of the governor is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes of a total of 6074 not yet counted.
The possibility of single counting of the voting notes this year is a reality in the elections in Michoacán, because according to the data issued by the Programa de Resultsados Electorales Preliminares (PREP), the difference between the first and second place in the governor's elections is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes of a total of 6074 not yet counted.
To this end, the President of the Consejo General del Instituto Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, reminded us that just last November, the electoral body had adopted a series of rules on the harmonisation of local rules with the reforms of the states in electoral matters.
It should be recalled that Michoacán had not adapted either his political constitution or his election law or his law on election justice to the reforms adopted by the Congress, so that they had not entered into force during this election round. Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided their publication in the State Advertiser within the specified time limits with the argument, nor had any objections to it.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) decided on the constitutional action filed by the local legislative and judged the State representative's vote on the constitutional reforms as "ineffective and unlawful", since it has no right to "decision or veto against it".
María de los Ángeles Llanderal explained in an interview on the possibility of individual counting the votes, that, thanks to the adoption of the guidelines by the Consejo General del IEM, there is now the possibility that the local electoral authority can count the voting notes in part or in full.
Thus, the votes contained in one or more election packages may be partially counted under the following conditions.The results in the minutes do not agree; the minutes on the counting and calculation of votes are not available in writing or are not in the possession of the chairman of the electoral committee or there are obvious errors or amendments in the minutes.
In addition, the total number of full-filled voting tickets can be counted if there is a difference between the alleged winner and the one in second place, which is equal to or less than one percent, provided that at the beginning of the meeting there is an explicit request from the party or coalition chairman, who is the second of the above-mentioned candidates.
The votes may also be counted in their entirety if, after completion of the ordinary calculation, it is established that the difference between the alleged winner and the candidate in second place is equal or less than one percent, provided that there is an explicit request from a representative of the party whose candidate has become second. In this case, the voting packages which were suspended in partial counting would be excluded.
It is worth mentioning that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation where, according to PREP, the difference between the first and the second place is almost 0.16 percent, although the votes of 129 out of a total of 923 voting protocols have not yet been counted.
His last will
His ashes will be scattered over the Zapalinamé Mountains, confirming the family.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés settled on Saltillo, his birthplace, this Sunday evening. On Monday the Totenschau and a Death Fair took place.
According to family members, the Colonel Lieutenant's last will was that his ashes be scattered over the Zapalinamé Mountains.
After an honor, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital of Coahuila together with the other people who had died during the accident in an aircraft of the Mexican Air Force. The most closest persons attended the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At noon, the ash of the Colonel Lieutenant landed on the mourning hall, which is located on the boulevard of Nazario Ortiz Garza, and where the family members and friends came from.
At 5.30 p.m., his remains were examined at the Institute of Technology of Saltillo. This body show was initiated by his former fellow students by the technical college and his American football team, to which Felipe Bacio belonged during his preparation for the Abitur.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and that his ashes would be scattered over the Zapalinamé Mountains, which he had always said to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, sister of the pilot.
From her point of view, the Lieutenant Lieutenant had fulfilled all his dreams and she felt that he had stood in the fullness of his life. "He was a successful man, extraordinary as father and son, a loving brother and he always stood up for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left Saltillo very young to enter Zapopán Air Force School, Jalisco.
Some could not grasp it because they thought it would even dizzy him on a truck. Nevertheless, he always sought to realize his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembered him as a good person. "He had barely arrived in Saltillo, and already the whole family wanted to greet him as on the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man remembers that even at the age of seven he had gone to Zapopán to graduate his family member. Therefore, he knows that his uncle died when he did what he liked best: flying an airplane.
A Last Farewell
The Chief Lieutenant of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, was approved with all honour under the direction of Governor Jorge Torres López. Her honor was awarded to him by the people and the government, the Mexican army of the sixth military area, the Mexican air force, head of school and students of the Saltillo technological educational institution, where he studied in 1985 and was well aware of both in studies and in sports.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago, when the helicopter flown by him, in which Secretary of State José Francisco Blake Mora and six others from the same authority, also crashed.
At 6.05 p.m., the cremated remains of Bacio Cortés, citizens of Saltillo, arrived to be handed over to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, on the barracks of the barracks, where his family members, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, siblings and other relatives, students and teachers, were already expecting him.
The abandoned body was found on a plot at the Cadereyta NL
A few hours before the find, military personnel presented to the media 11 persons arrested in the same locality in connection with organised crime.
Three men were found murdered by shots in different body parts and a grace shot in an abandoned finca in Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The event had taken place at the kilometre point 1.5 of the road from Cadereyta to Santiago at the height of the municipality of El Castillo.
Several transients saw that the door of the country house, surrounded by a beige-brown wall, rose widely.
As they looked into the house, they found the bodies of three persons about three meters further inside, which they immediately informed the competent authorities.
One was wearing a yellow t-shirt and dark pants, without shoes; another was dressed in a white top next to him.
Almost a meter away was the body of another person with red t-shirt and blue pants.
All three were on the abdomen.
According to the information received on the spot, the three persons must have been murdered in another place as no cartridge shells have been found.
On the wall of the country house are inscriptions to read, one organized criminal band writes to another, and several shots were found in the wall and door.
11 persons arrested in Cadereyta
The Secretary of Defense Nacional (State Secretariat for National Defense) introduced 11 persons, including a minor who was part of a criminal course mainly in the town of Cadereyta, and who were associated with kidnappings, murders, halconeo (huncher hunt) and secret funerals.
According to the information made public, eight persons were first arrested in the Los Alveros settlement on 11 November and a prisoner was released.
Three properties and a mobile phone were secured. The arrested confirmed that they were members of the criminal group "Los Zetas".
On November 12th, at 6:00 p.m., soldiers found a car with no numbers with two inmates in the town of Rancho Viejo in Cadereyta.
When the car was inspected, the soldiers found a long weapon, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Later, on November 13 at 2:00 p.m., one of her complicits was arrested in the municipality of La Frauda, who tried to escape when the military saw it.
They are charged with secret funerals in the towns of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
On Wednesday, education of the new Italian government
The Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present to him the new government which is supposed to be facing the crisis that led Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
The Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present to him the new government which is supposed to be facing the crisis that led Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
A statement from the Presidential Palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm the formation of the government.
It is expected that he will present a most of the cabinet composed of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new Prime Minister will take office.
Monti said that he would present to the President the results of the talks with the political parties on the formation of government.
"I would like to confirm my absolute confidence in the ability of our country to cope with these difficult times," the former EU Commissioner told the journalists.
Monti did not expressly confirm the formation of government, but his comments show that the obstacles have been overcome.
The "frame is well set now," he added.
Monti has managed to form a government in less than three days, that is much less time than normal. Meanwhile, Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has driven the cost of debt to an unbearable level.
The new government led by the former EU Commissioner Monti must adopt a tough austerity package called for by the Europolitics to regain confidence in Italy.
The pressure on Monti's hastened because of the changing market situation, which caused the Italian government bonds to be taxed at 7 percent interest for 10 years, which corresponds to the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to apply for the European Rescue Screen.
Emma Marcegaglia, President of the Italian Industrial Association Convindustria, told the press after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government at all costs."
We believe that this government is the last chance to get Italy out of this emergency situation.
Montis' chances of success were greatly increased by the support of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party, who had to resign on Saturday as a result of the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are intended to produce good results," said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the Middle Law Party.
The support of the PDL, the largest party in Italy, is essential, because so far many of its members have spoken out against a majority of technocrats-based government that is making up Monti.
Support from Parliament
The new government of Monti needs strong parliamentary support to implement the probably unpopular austerity measures.
Resistance to its efforts or delaying reforms could again lead to a devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks, with its suggestion that a failure of Montis is a disaster, also exerts pressure.
Monti started his debates on Monday with political parties, trade unions and business associations, as well as youth and women's organisations.
Tuesday evening will be the end of the session.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who launched an extremely rapid change of government in response to the crisis.
After a short breath towards the end of the last week, when it became known that Berlusconi would resign, the uncertainty about the success of the new Prime Minister reached the cost of the Italian government bonds again critical limits.
A saving of Italy with a sovereign debt of 1.8 trillion euros would be too much for the current EU rescue shield.
Monti said that his government should continue until the next elections, which are expected to be held in 2013, despite the predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms instead of preferring the elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that this should consist only of technicians, an indication of their concerns in view of the procedure imposed by the pressure on financial markets.
Political sources point out that the mutual distrust and disunity between the parties complicate the involvement of people from political life.
Spanish have more play opportunities than the Ticos
Of the 22 players from Spain, ten have more than 50 international games on the bump.
From Costa Rica's side, only one of the 22 convened 50 games is behind.
A huge difference for Costa Rica when the 22 players from both countries are compared to each other for the friendship game, which takes place today at 15.05 a.m. in the San José National Stadium.
While the world and European champions, the number one on FIFA's monthly ranking, can look back on a considerable number of Class A selection games, the three-colored team only has the defense player Michael Umana as the only one with over 50 international games.
He scored this number last Friday with the game against Panama (0-2) in the Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish players who play in the League de las Estrellas (Starliga) and influential clubs of the Premier League of England have the opportunity to participate every year in numerous home games (liga and cup championships) as well as high-ranking Eurocups such as the Champions League.
In addition, the experience of the Spanish Furie with complicated excretions at the Eurocup and the World Cups.
The Tico football players, on the other hand, have few international encounters in the context of the Concaf, which is on the FIFA ranking at the very bottom.
We will see how the Spanish team draws their last register: the goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who reached a match with the former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta on the last Saturday against England (low 0-1 in London) with 126 foreign matches.
Today Casillas will play against the three-colored team and Spain will record a new record of 127 foreign games.
Xavi Hernández, player of the football club Barcelona, owns 106.
Casillas and Xavi even received recognition last week from UEFA, along with others of the Iberian team who had reached the magical number 100: the quoted Zubizarreta with 126 and the middle towers of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
The number of hundreds is also approaching Carles Puyol with 97 games.
He followed Xabi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos both with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Cesc Fábregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
From the sides of the Ticos and close to Michael Umana are the left side storm Júnior Díaz with 48 games and the storm Bryan Ruiz with 45.
From there only five came on more than 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofefa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The ones with the least games.
Less than 30 games feature the Spanish team Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
From the national team there are fewer than 30 games, Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest doesn't even approach the 20s limit.
While Nacho Moral has only four games and Jordi Alba has two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson had not made her debut yet.
The historic goalkeeper of Spain is David Villa with 50 hits, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica Bryan has shot Ruiz with nine most goals, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The quintet included Costa Rica in its tour to celebrate its 20th anniversary
"Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that comes true"
In the exclusive conversation with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam says that the band is prepared to give one of their best concerts at the National Stadium next Sunday.
They were expected for more than 20 years, but the band assures that they realize a dream when they play in Costa Rica.
This was ensured by the bassist and co-founder of the group, Jeff Ament, who gave Viva an exclusive interview from Brazil last week.
The band is located in the South American part of their tour to celebrate its 20th anniversary and on Sunday, the 20th, they make their only stop in Central America.
On that day they will perform at the National Stadium from 7.30 p.m. along with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
You can read an excerpt from the conversation, whose full copy can be found in the online edition of La Nación.
For your Costa Rican fans, a dream comes true when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Are you aware of what that means to your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that also comes true for us.
This is just the second time we've been playing in South and Central America, and so far it's been great.
I've only been to Costa Rica once for a vacation. It's such a beautiful country that we will definitely stay there for a few days.
It's exciting for us to take our music there.
I'm asking you this because the fans of the band are totally devoted, and they experience the days before the concert most intensively.
What do you say to your most enthusiastic fans?
Thank you for standing by our side all these years.
We took almost 21 years to come to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we're sorry to have taken so long to get here.
Some people even think that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Isn't that a little pressure from your visit?
Some of the greatest shows we've had over the last 21 years have been taking place in the last two weeks.
We have played on some giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that they have made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we want to play there.
We love this country, we like to surf and are enthusiastic about the jungle, and Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you get to know Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are simply unimaginable.
My friends always went surfing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Together with Mexico are the excellent areas for surfing. In this way, we have learned about people who love surfing.
With a view of the tour you offered giant shows with many songs.
What plans do you have for the Costa Rica event?
Since we've never played there, we don't set any limits either.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from each album and offer our fans a good and versatile repertoire.
You never repeat your repertoire.
Why?
I think this is partly because we have nine records and can play over 120 songs. Each one likes another song, so that the decision we will play will not be easy.
If we add two or three songs that we haven't played for a long time, we can better maintain our concentration and they surprise us because they remind us of the reasons why we liked these songs. Otherwise, they might be forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and I believe, therefore also for the audience.
With this tour you celebrate your 20-year history.
When you look back, is it hard for you to believe in your success?
Yeah, totally.
First of all, I think that no one of us has imagined playing in a great rock band for more than 20 years. This seems like a dream.
We also continue to put on this blessing and find it great to be able to make music together even now.
We like ourselves and are enthusiastic about producing music.
We are lucky to be able to drive to the places of the world that we have always wanted to visit.
Things couldn't stand better.
What did it mean for you to take an active part in the grunge’s hour of birth?
It has always been an honor to belong to this group of large bands.
We are well friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and abundantly unusual when a movement emerges from a group of friends.
Every now and then a band emerges from a city, but it is unusual when five or ten groups come from the same city at the same time.
We are proud of it and feel honored to be part of the Seattle Group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Soundgarden on their tour. We are happy to be still friends with them all and it honors us to be part of this emerging Seattle sound.
It is also very unusual that a band like yours has remained with the same musicians for so long.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) met us 13 years ago. This alone is much more time than many bands last.
First of all, I believe that we all appreciate being alive and we also take care of each other.
We are all close friends, which is why musical paths have opened up, giving each individual freedom to experiment.
One trusts the other and his music. We could not be any better.
Your relationship to fame has not always been easy. On the other hand, thanks to your success, you have always been able to do what you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
The way we grew has made it easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure not to be on tour too often, because it is too easy to fall off this game with huge crowds of people who love your music.
As long as you think people have come because of music, remember that you have to pay attention to the music and to what she has created, without losing your mind to being a famous rock star. We have never been interested in that anyway.
What are your memories of your other Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote very good songs and at the beginning it was great.
For three years we were a band that had never released a record until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
We were disappointed to have needed so long. We are still good with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who built up the band with us. When I hear a song or see photos, I think about what an incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh. It was always a pleasure to go to work, to laugh together and talk about music and football and many other topics.
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The local band Las Robertas is responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you knew their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why the band chose for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos from several groups and this band liked us best. That’s why we’re curious to see what Las Robertas can offer live. This will certainly be exciting.
Why do you always change the text of Yellow Ledbetter when you play live?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.
He sings him, and I think he sings the first thing that comes to his mind.
Who influenced you as a bass player?
From so many+
One of the first to come to mind is Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bass players I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grunge alive, although it is no longer a fashion phenomenon?
I think we all don't feel very connected to the word grunge.
When I think about it, I think of the bands I mentioned before, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others who came up at the same time. If they are still important today, I think it's great because it's worth listening to this music and bands like Mudhoney are doing better music now than ever before.
At first, her music was darker, now she's more positive.
Why?
This is interesting, because I think there are a few songs on the new album that could work a little lightly. But there are also other songs like The End or Just Breath that are classified as very dark songs, although they also have something positive in themselves.
The tears came to me when I heard Ed playing them. They are very dark songs.
I believe that when you get older and something tragic happened in your life - e.g. if you lose a family member or a friend - that influences your artistic work and your music and these two songs clearly embody it for me.
But I also believe that you can be a happy person and still make dark music.

Fujimori returned to hospital for medical examination
Former President Alberto Fujimori was sent to a public hospital on Tuesday to investigate the muscle loss of his legs, informed his family doctor.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who is 25 years in prison for violation of human rights during his reign (1990-2000), has several diseases, including tongue cancer, which is operated on four times and is under control.
Alejandro Aguinaga, Congressman and his personal doctor, told TV that Fujimori would be examined for three days in the Peruvian hospital Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplásicas to determine the reason for his pain and muscle loss in the lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that he felt Fujimori could be pardoned for humanitarian reasons. Nevertheless, he did not wish it because he considered him innocent.
It has been operated on four times in tongue cancer and has lost 18 kilos of weight. In addition, there are other diseases such as severe erosive gastritis, a cyst in the pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure and blood circulation problems in the legs, the doctor counted.
Fujimori has been in the Dirección Nacional Nacional de Operaciones Especiales de la policía detention centre since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 persons by the death squad of the Peruvian army, which was secretly active during his reign.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations
An official delegation led by Uruguay President José Mujica and consisting of several ministers and entrepreneurs will start their visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and discuss political issues of the region
The next Wednesday, Mujica meets his Mexican counterpart Felipe Calderón. According to the U.S. President, this will be the highlight of his booked schedule with politicians, businessmen and a meeting with the collective of Uruguayians living in Mexico.
The meeting of both presidents in the city of Guadalajara "is suitable for the exchange of information on all policy areas between the two countries", announced the Presidential Office of the South American country on its website.
According to local media, Mujica is looking for support from Calderón regarding the incident with France when French head of government Nicolas Sarkozy put the South American country on a list of tax havens at the G20 summit in the French city of Cannes.
In his discourse, Sarkozy threatened to exclude those countries that still act as a tax haven from the international community, which was rejected by Uruguay and led to a request from its ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has been chair of the G20 since November, a group consisting of the most powerful emerging and industrialized countries in the world. Since January this year, there has been an agreement on the exchange of tax information to avoid double taxation with the South American country.
In recent years the Government of Uruguay has tried to speed up the implementation of agreements to exchange tax information in order to be removed from the "grey list" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which includes countries which have not introduced all international standards for cooperation in tax matters.
There has been a free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay at business level since 2004, which has contributed to a growing exchange of goods between the two countries.
The corded installer enters the third dimension with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought tirelessly for the rescue of Princess Peach for 25 years from the claws of the evil Bowser, but never so far in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he fights for the love of the girl in stereo technology.
The game, which this month comes to the store counters around the world, has been tailored from the beginning to the features of the portable console Nintende 3DS, with which without a special glasses can be played three dimensionally.
"Mario is the figure that has to say how the stereoscopy works without glasses," said Omar Álvarez, the responsible for the Nintendo-based press in Spain at the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" was "the first video game of Nintendo that has been developed for this console from the outset" , because up to now, successful articles like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" have been adjustments of already existing titles.
Nintendo's speaker underlined that, although it was three-dimensional, "Super Mario 3D Land" was an "affordable" video game that allows for a fast, liquid game.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contained two games in one: the first part is "light" to capture the less skilled users.
After that, the experts can turn a "second round" over the different levels of the game, which are becoming increasingly difficult.
In addition, users can choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action. However, to overcome the obstacles, without being victims of the "optical effects", always have to be played three-dimensionally.
This trip to the three-dimensional world also means the return of the figure to a portable console, which has not been the case since 2005.
With this video game Nintendo dangles the fans of the Saga and repeats the recipe for success of the last editions: The hard-headed installer must overcome risk-stricken platforms to free Princess Peach.
However, the player encounters news in the movements, the environment, the disguises and the enemies - and a "playable" Luigi.
Colom guarantees the extradition of Portillos to the United States
The President of Guatemala, Álvaro Colom, announced this Tuesday that he would accept the extradition of the former governor Alfonso Portillo so that he would be responsible in the United States for the conspiracy for money laundering of $70 million.
Thus, the trial ends on the US's request for Portillo to be extradited so that it can be brought to justice there.
At a press conference, Colom confirmed his decision based on independence from judicial authority and government, taking into account that a ruling court had already ordered the extradition.
He stressed that during his government he had not interfered in court decisions and had granted all the extradition requests he had been informed of.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín is extradited for murder and serious physical injury, Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Coloms is a government act that takes place when all judicial and constitutional bodies are exhausted to condemn the former President of the State (2000-2004).
According to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Guatemala Constitutional Court, Portillo must be extradited if its legal situation in Guatemala is clarified and its human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted for the defeat of 120 million Quetzales in the Ministry of Defence during his reign. This trial preceded extradition, but the minister objected and revived the case.
Trinijove has helped 6000 young people threatened by social exclusion
The organization was created to prevent the marginalisation of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of life of the social assistance organisation Trinijove have led to important results: 6000 young people threatened by social exclusion were supported in this quarter century to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, more than a hundred jobs created for this social group.
On the occasion of the anniversary yesterday, an event was held in the former factory buildings of Fabra i Coats, in which more than 300 people participated.
Trinijove was founded in 1986 in the Trinitat Vella district with the aim of helping young people with low levels of education, without work, with drug problems threatened by the risk of marginality.
At yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu, numerous representatives of institutions and institutions who have worked with the association during these 25 years took part.
The participation of political representatives of different directions in election times demonstrated the impartiality of the work done by Trinijove.
In addition to the President of the Generalitat (Parliament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol participated in the celebrations of former socialist Education Minister Ernest Maragall and the former mayor and currently left-green city councillor Ricard Goma.
The large hall of Fabra i Coats was also visited by the current Catalan Minister of Social Affairs and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director-General of the Sozialwerk of the Sparkasse La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas stressed that Trinijove was created in very difficult times and that today’s times are no less complicated, but he added that the work done so far is “a good basis”.
For the President of the Generalitat, Trinijove is a model that knows how to fight difficult circumstances and gives hope to people in trouble.
"The economic crisis is nothing new for the association and the work it does," he explained.
Occupyed house, where giant parties were organized, was cleared
The homeowners had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building on Balmes No. 51 (Barcelona).
The twelve house-occupiers left the building yesterday afternoon without any resistance.
Everything points out that the nightmares of the neighbors of House No. 51 on the road Balmes have ended.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building, which they had been illegally occupied and in which they organized huge festivals that had driven the neighborhood to despair, yesterday afternoon. The room was taken on judicial order without police intervention.
After the clearing, the door lock was replaced to avoid a similar situation.
"From now on, entry will be controlled," said the house manager.
The house-occupiers, who had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest were inhabited - took along the entire electrical system and part of the water supply. Moreover, they had painted the walls and left all kinds of garbage, especially cans with alcoholic beverages.
In the three lower floors, huge parties were celebrated, which lasted up to two days and drove the tenants to despair.
Next to the building there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which also suffered damage.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that her business had fallen by 80% since the beginning of the house occupation.
The owner of the discotheque pointed out that the house-occupiers made their unfair competition, because they sold the drinks to three euros, while they cost 10 euros in the discotheque.
In addition, the owner of the leisure area had been indicated by the neighbors for restlessness, while according to their statement the noise did not come from the visitors to the disco, but from the house-occupiers and especially from the guests of the festivals that were organized there, and according to statements of the angry neighbors became more and more and longer in recent weeks.
The responsible for the disco said that the harassment had been so great that it agreed with the owner of the building not to have to pay rent for the last nine months.
The Guardia Urbana (urban police) also confirmed that she had received more complaints from the neighbors in recent weeks.
Last week, the chairman of the PP (Partido Popular - People's Party) in Barcelona City Council, Alberto Fernández Díaz, asked to clear the building immediately and to deal with the problems of bourgeois cohabitation as well as the downfall of the district.
He explained that before the summer only one floor of the building had been occupied, but that the house-occupiers had been in all floors of the building in the last few months and almost all of the apartments had moved forward. In some there had even been thefts.
In this sense, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and take action against the social actions in the building."
Yesterday, another building in the Nou Barris district was cleared by the Catalan police.
At 3.30 p.m., the police approached the street Montral No. 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who had watched four people penetrate the building.
The Four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
The architects agree to the invitation to tender, except for the dispute over the fees.
The urban tender on the 16 gates opens the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the recently disappeared Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published its insult about the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona city.
He was even compared in numbers with the Central Park of New York.
With the collapse of the CMB in 1987, the park in the eyes of many became once again the top of Barcelona, because the capital of Catalonia is one of the few that does not spread in the north-south direction, but up (mountains) and down (sea).
The classification Collserolas as a nature park plays with this idea.
As a model, it was no longer the Central Park, but Yellowstone with wild boars in the role of the yogibar.
So far, when the city issued a giant invitation to tender in September, consisting of 16 competitions, for further access to Collserola.
Without a doubt, a gate refers to the concept of a park.
Either it is, or someone's planning to put gates in the country.
The question arises of itself: Collserola, Park or Mountain?
The invitation to tender is not only from an organizational point of view, but also with a view to a reflection on the city the topic of conversation in the mouth of all architects from Barcelona.
It is almost a recurrent topic, on which two members of these old-fashioned caste, who meet in the elevator, can resort to.
And this very fact provides the substance for one of the rare similarities between what three architects from Barcelona think about it and some university professors who have applied for the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The tender is appropriate.
For Roldán "it is necessary to speak about the "front on the mountain" after the attack on the coast, as far as the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, which has been spread over the green apples, has not been carried out.
"One should assume from the principle that Barcelona's largest park is the beach.
Among other things, because it is well accessible.
Collserola is more complex," concludes the architect, for whom the title "Tore of Collserola" holds a "lexical trap": It is not allowed to "imagin itself as access to a park, but as a limitation of areas on which to act."
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with urban experience, considers the proposal to be a "intellectual challenge" that poses "some dangers".
Dangers resulting from the "insecurity that the design of a public space nowadays brings with it" following the experience of the 1980s, which had their "swan song" in the area of the forum.
The first fear is its own limitation on what can be built.
"To limit something always means to define the next step", i.e. to exceed it.
"You have to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current [relating to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM) ] can lead to a real disaster."
Modol, who is closer to the question, says that the side of Collserola, which goes towards Vallesana, "can be understood as a park that does not go towards Barcelona", for purely topographic reasons.
Modol recalls that there is already a study by the Patronat de Collserola, which should not "get deaf ears", although he is grateful to the city administration for giving his body the opportunity to participate in this project "from the first moment".
In addition, he notes that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the guide letter, which allows architects to participate in the debate, although he expresses his "questions" that this technical profile should guide the multidisciplinary teams ("precisely the right thing," he says. "We architects should only be a tool."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the heading of this article is complex, as in the terms of the tender a global view of Collserola was missing: "There were 16 competitions in the cross-section," he says, "on the axis mountain lake. But there is no longitudinal perspective that the area as a whole looks at."
At least in his case, this led him to participate in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the program and the definition of a project for a gate would collide with that of the architect of the gate.
In his opinion, the city should ensure that the strip is equipped directly above the Ronda de Dalt in its length in such a way as to create a soft transition between the city and the green areas.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal, who comes free
After 72 days of silence, the agent of Casino Red liberated the brother of the mayor of Monterrey from the trial, which is led against him for alleged extortion.
After 72 days of imprisonment, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the agent of Casino Red has granted him the second criminal court of the district leading the trial against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey for extortion.
After the attack on Casino Royale, Sergio Gil García, the owner of Casino Red, published a series of photos and videos on which Manuel Jonás is to be seen, probably forcing him to pay a sum of money to allow the city administration to approve the secret operation of the bethouse.
After the prosecution, the prosecutor opened a criminal trial against the brother of the Panist mayor, who was arrested for 30 days on September 2nd.
After four hours with the officials of the Ministerio Público 3 en Delitos Patrimoniales, he was taken to Casa de Arraigo 1 in the Barrio Antiguo of the capital.
In this place he remained 49 days after a second arrest warrant after the ministerio Público had rejected the crimes for bribery and organized crime.
On October 19th, he was transferred to Cadereyta Detention Centre because he had probably bribed the owners of Casino Red with a million and a half pesos. On the other hand, he stayed only a few hours in the middle security tract, as there were threats of murder against him.
The authorities allowed him to take part in the trial as a prisoner of the San Nicolás de los Garza City Prison.
On 25 October, a decree was sent to him by the secretary of the Second Criminal Court of the District, Jorge Yánez, who found that after the nearly two months of investigations there was sufficient evidence to convict Jonás for the payment of 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the bethouse in order to open it in return.
This Monday, the agent of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, asked Judge José Luis Pecina, the mayor's brother, to release the sentence, which is why he will be set free in the next few hours.
During the court hearing, Ramiro Arias, the official of the Ministerio Público, García Gómez, assigned to the court, asked if he had fixed the damage and which the owner of the bethouse had declared his forgiveness. However, the lawyer held back the name.
According to the case of 197/2011, Jonás Larrazábal is free to speak. Nor can any opposition to the trial be filed, nor will any compensation be required.
After hearing the bethouse's agent at 3.50 p.m., Larrazabal Bretón was immediately set free.
The secretary of the court, Jorge Yánez, went to the San Nicolás de los Garza City Prison to inform Jonás that he had been acquitted and that his case had been filed.
He also informed him of the judicial order for immediate release.
The secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome provides details of the aircraft accident in which government secretary Francisco Blake and another seven people were killed.
The Secretary of Comunicaciones y Transportes - SCT (Secretariat for Communication and Transport in Mexico) informed that the results of the investigation on the accident that killed government secretary Francisco Blake Mora and other seven people indicated that the helicopter with its entire unscathed structure had hit the ground directly without the pilot being able to launch an emergency landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary for Communication and Transport, mentioned that the pilot had confirmed prior to taking off that the weather conditions had been suitable for the flight.
"The fact that the propeller wings had contact with trees at a height of 25 metres, with the helicopter losing the hull, seems to indicate that the helicopter had several ground contacts."
He also explained that the helicopter was built for 19 inmates, so he met all the requirements for the transportation of the personnel.
In addition, he said that no helicopter parts were found during the investigations in the area on which the machine had come down.
"In the search, no aircraft parts were found elsewhere, the extra charge concerned the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 inmates, so it met all the requirements for passenger transport.
The area has an angle of 7 to 30 degrees.
At present, it is priority to obtain the results of the investigation as soon as possible, but it may take several months, perhaps even a year.
On the other hand, Gilberto López Meyer, Director-General of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (Secretariat for Aeroplanes and Auxiliary Services in Mexico), assured that the helicopter from Estado Mayor Presidencial was flying at a speed of travel and the plane fell on a soft slope.
"This information strengthens the assumption that at the time of impact it was a normal flight operation."
At a press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant points that should be taken into account in the investigation:
Visible flight:
In accordance with the flight standards, this was a flight in accordance with the rules of the visual flight. This means that the crew must have had sufficient visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The AICM recorded appropriate weather conditions at takeoff. During the next flight towards the border area between Mexico City and the Mexico State, some deep clouds pulled up.
Selected flight routes:
It is possible that the team had chosen a lower area with a better view towards the Cuernavaca valley because of the clouds.
Hit-up point:
The impact coordinates and the last radar recording of the helicopter agree. There may not have been any loss of control over the aircraft or a deviation from the flight route before the impact.
Scattering the remains of the aircraft in a limited area:
The information available until now indicates that the helicopter was impacted from a straight and lateral direction.
The pattern of the scattered aircraft remains suggests that the helicopter with its unscathed structure was impacted on the ground.
No evidence of fire or explosion:
The remains of the aircraft offer neither fire nor explosion at the site of the accident.
The latest findings indicate several soil contacts.
In the on-site investigations, aircraft parts were found at a height of 9200 feet above sea level. The terrain is abject and has an angle of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter was probably broken.
Some information suggests that the helicopter could have had several ground contacts.
Following a minor search in an area that went beyond the restricted area at the site of the accident, no scattered aircraft parts could be found, thus increasing the assumption that the unscathed aircraft structure was impacted against the ground.
MSS announces a research protocol to find the gene for obesity
She Social Insurance Institute in Mexico leads a research project to find the gene for obesity among children and adolescents supported by IPN specialists.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS ( Mexico Social Insurance Institute) announced that it is leading a research project on the discovery of the gene for obesity in children and adolescents under the title "Genetics of Obesity in Childhood and Youth" with which the genetic markers are to be found in connection with obesity.
Miguel Cruz López, Head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (Department for Medical Research, Biochemistry) at Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Sigo XXI, stated that an interdisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, nutrition specialists and social workers was built up.
This team is supported by specialists and students from the postgraduate course at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The population is invited to participate in the study. Interested persons can come to the sports grounds of the IMSS in the valley of Mexico, where tests with children and young people are conducted every Saturday from 8.00 p.m.
He stressed that the investigation started at the sports field of Cuauhtémoc (in the west of the state of México) and continued since October 8 at the sports field of Nezahualcóyolt (in the east of the state of México).
Once the target has been reached from 500 to 600 researchers, the study will continue at the sports field of Independencia (in the south of the capital district) and will be completed on the one by Morelos (in the north of the capital district).
He explained that the aim of the study was to learn about the factors and the role of genetics in the development of obesity and to identify risk factors of Mexican children and adolescents for chronic chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the world day of diabetes, he stated that it was intended that three thousand children and young people aged six to 14 should fill in with the consent and under the supervision of their parents' nutrition-related questionnaires.
They are also asked questions about their physical activity and family history to control risk factors that could result in diabetes or renal failure.
He also pointed out that on those Saturdays the subjects surveyed (weight, size, waist size), controlled blood pressure and determined blood levels such as glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (trying to identify genes associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz López stressed that this study would be carried out on the occasion of the concern of the health staff about the alarming weight gain of young people.
"Health surveys from 1999 and 2006 showed that the proportion of obese boys increased by 77 percent in just under six years and that of obese girls increased by 47 percent. Obesity has also increased dramatically," stressed IMSS's specialist.
He claimed that the search for genetic markers was justified because the genetic history of Mexico’s population was different from that of other peoples.
He stated that an average Mexican (in) was 65% Indian-American, 30% European, and 5% African, reflecting the genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
In general, he explained that the genetics of obesity are expressed in the inability to burn the excess of the energy taken to us (calories), so that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit to the examiners would be in a comprehensive study of the children who would determine whether they had a degree of obesity or obesity.
It would even investigate the occurrence of dark skin folds in the neck and the inner arm (Akanthosis), which indicate the likelihood of metabolic disorders and diabetes in the preceding stage.
All information would be treated confidentially and communicated to the parents in writing by the doctors, and the doctors would explain to the parents all the measurement results and suggest changes in the lifestyle appropriate for the prevention of diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three fundamental factors responsible for obesity, obesity and other chronic diseases: lack of exercise, that is, lack of exercise in everyday life, most of the time spent in front of the TV and use means of transport, instead of walking short distances.
The high intake of calories, i.e. increased consumption of sugared beverages and carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.), together with a high intake of fat and protein as well as the genetics to be analysed in this research project.
Asphalt from the UNAM prevents impact holes
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at the Mexican University UNAM, develops modified asphalt with polymers to make the mixture more resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
It would not be necessary to repair nearly 200,000 pits if the rainy season in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (City Area of the Valley of Mexico) broke out, said Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at the University of UNAM, warning and assured that if the design and maintenance of the asphalty floor were properly seen, the number of holes would be significantly reduced or even completely avoided.
In his lecture "Technical Gaps", which he gave on the occasion of the International Year on Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible is developing asphalt modified with polymers to produce a mixture similar to the asphalt, but which has greater mechanical resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera said that this type of modified asphalt should be used in areas with extremely hot climates, such as in some cities in the north of the country, to improve the behavior of the street floor and thus avoid the occurrence of impact holes.
He explained that the asphalt - the heaviest part of the oil - is a hydrocarbon compound, some of which have a high molecular weight - the so-called asphales - and the other part a low one - the so-called malthenes. Together they give the street floor its characteristic toughness behavior.
The toughness of the asphalt means that it behaves like a liquid at high temperatures of almost 180°C, at 120°C it is very tough and almost solid at 50°C, while it breaks at very low temperatures.
"This means that the resilience of the asphalt on the roads is not uniform, but changes in one day depending on the weather conditions and temperature fluctuations," said the chemical engineer.
The researcher of the FQ noted that the streets of Mexico City had mostly a flexible street flooring composed of six layers of materials, the last three of which included asphalt.
Between the top layers lies a wear layer made of asphalt, which is made of small, asphalt-washed stones and then solidified.
Every single stone of this wear layer had been bathed in asphalt.
When the vehicles move on and forces are generated, this layer allows a good distribution of forces in the street floor.
"If it were modified asphalt, the forces would spread even better," said the chemical engineer.
"On the wear layer," he said, "is designed a final layer, the so-called supporting layer, which is made of tiny stones, i.e. sand, which was also bathed in asphalt.
As this layer is in contact with the vehicle tyres, they need a greater mechanical force than the wear layer and they have to produce friction.
Moreover, that which receives and distributes most of the forces in this street floor also requires an appropriate thickness and the material it consists of must be maintained.
The weather conditions, in particular humidity and temperature fluctuations, are other important factors to consider, above all the water," he said, "because it significantly affects the behaviour of the wear layer.
When the terrain gets wet, water penetrates into the layer and only comes out difficult. This causes a softening of all layers of the street floor and, as a result, the appearance of impact holes.
When a impact hole is created," he said, "the cover layer will be removed first, while the wear layer will only be affected after that. But the damage does not arise immediately, but it is a process that would have to be maintained during the first signs by appropriate maintenance programs."
The member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (National Research System of Mexico) stated that the vehicle load is another important cause for the occurrence of impact holes. Therefore, the thickness of each layer of the road covering must always be in relation to the vehicle load and it must be ensured that this regulation is complied with in order to avoid frequent impact holes.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that a lot of research was still pending, for example about asphalt emulsions that were already on the market in other countries, and with which the impact holes could be repaired simply and without application high temperatures.
What was the candidate del Valle missing to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that affected Melina Ramírez Serna's failure to get the crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle gets his 14th title.
Once again, Valle del Cauca went empty in the award of the crown for Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied with standing on the winner's platform, showing a silver crown and the band that she identified as a new Miss Colombia.
With the result obtained this night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico took the crown and the cedar, the department already came to 14 abuses and Melina joined the legion of women from Valle del Cauca who had held the crown almost in their hands. Among the declared Mises are Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Monica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000)(2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The big question that many are asking today is: What was missing?
The result corresponds to the decline of a great favorite, who had shown at every performance that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia. Not for nothing had she been elected Queen of the Police and Mejor Rostro Jolie of Vogue, titles that also the beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro had received, and which took home the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that is considered to be crucial for the jury's decision to appoint her as First Miss is that she had not convinced the answer to the question "What book has influenced you most and why?" that Martín Murillo Gómez had asked her by the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca replied to the questioner:
"I read a lot, I believe pretty much in literature, I think it's a way to civilize, in the end, I believe that the book, which was most shaped for my childhood, 'The Little Prince', is a rather profound book.
At the moment I am reading 'guilt and atonement'. It is a book of universal culture that we should all read. I am just reading a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called 'Leidies'.
An answer that encountered little reluctance, first because of the concept of 'civilizing' and second, because it had not specifically explained how each book mentioned it had influenced it.
But after completion of the ceremony, Melina said to feel calm and happy with the result: "The universe is wise, it happens what must happen.
And for all people, please read a little 'The Little Prince'. It's a great book.
Among other things, it is said that El Valle's darling is burned out.
A journalist from Bogota indicated that the fact that she was the preferred one, who received all the applause and who had received all the prizes in advance (Gastronomy Competition Easter, audience vote on the best hand-crafted costume and Reina Madre), "the other candidates had made jealous, which was most stressful to the queen who could not shine on stage."
And this was noticed in their first performance in the swimsuit on the beach of the Hilton Hotel and in their two lifts at the coronation celebration.
Although she was certainly performing with both, she lacked the strength and momentum shown by the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program "Como en casa" at the RCN channel, said that the fact that Melina was crowned Mass "shows that the candidate who wins the most prizes during the competition, after all, does not become queen".
In addition, Valle went out of the way at the end of the press - an error.
Another hypothesis is that Valle could not convince the law of its interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
It will already have his reason that two days before the composition of the international jury Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman who was engaged in the social affairs of her country.
"Beautifulness alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia. You have to look beyond the physical and focus on the social feeling that she had worked on projects before she participated in the competition," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle had sinned with her defects of Derriere and Fibrosis, which were noted in her stomach area. But that is contradictory, because the jury chose her as a candidate for 'natural beauty' with a healthy body, good eating habits and responsible physical work.
The Queens' Trainer, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina didn't have the best body, that there was better, "but her problem with the fibrosis on the abdomen, which I honestly couldn't see, pushed her score the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of Cromos magazine believed that the mistakes of the woman from Valle del Cauca had been the surgical interventions she had undergone.
"The operations are ok, but Valle didn't know how to make her do it right.
Her body has never been her strong side, and this place she had to pay."
Because of this prize, which is awarded for the first time by the National Beauty Competition, a cruel prediction arose after the appearance in the swimsuit, which was to come true at night. It was deluded that Raymundo Melina had given a consolation prize in order not to make her enjoy the crown.
Whether that is true or not, the fact is that Melina is starting her reign today, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent at one of the international competitions on the appointment of the National Beauty Competition Colombia.
However, as one of the queens who had missed the crown despite her overwhelming appearance for Cartagena, she will go into history.
So was the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A California Lophoscopician went into history when the man who identified Alfonso Cano.
The work of these officials plays a key role.
Last November 4th, a lophoscopic officer of the CTI from Cali, who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolutionarias de Colombia – revolutionary forces of Colombia), entered: "Alfonso Cano" by comparing the fingerprints.
Of the seven lophoscopicists in the CTI department, this week Eliazar González had been on the stand-by duty, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in criminal investigation proceedings for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in communities of Chocó, where he often had to go to the jungle for five days to reach the place where the bodies he was supposed to identify were located.
In 2000 he settled after Valle over and after completing the necessary courses he specialized in lophoscopy, which is the examination of the skin which is exposed to friction, i.e. the palms and feet.
In the week of use against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was told to pack clothes for at least three days.
Something big expected him.
Friday night he flew in the helicopter from Palmira to Cauca.
He knew that he should identify two bodies, and that there was a suspicion that one could be the one of the man who led the oldest guerrilla in the world. Therefore, he should take with him the ten-finger sheet of Guillermo León Sáenz (his actual name).
However, when he reached the place where the body was located with the most examiner, he could not identify it because of its physical appearance, because this was similar to the illustrations he had seen in the mass media, not least.
He had no beard, was dressed like a farmer in the area, wore no glasses and was much thinner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Armed with a magnifying glass, ink, a planter and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the body with those on the imprint.
He had seen it right: it was Alfonso Cano.
The same night, this man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for telling the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that it was actually the head of the FARC.
In Search of Traces
For a dactyloscope from Sijín in Cali, the appreciation given by President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González at a press conference on the use of "cano" was very important.
Many people don't know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science without error rate, which can be a key factor in resolving a crime.
Lophoscopicists not only identify bodies, they also support investigations into murder and robbery and confirm the identity of the arrested persons.
When they are arrested, many offenders present false identification documents or they have none.
We'll take their fingerprints and find them in the database.
The researcher told us that when he was stealing, he had to tear a piece of wall out of a house, because the thief had just raised his hand with his hand when he pulled out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"Walks are difficult because their surfaces are inappropriate for the acceptance of fingerprints. But in this case we could take the print of the whole hand and identify the criminal who had participated in several thefts," he remembered.
With the help of the fingerprints, murder suspects can also be relieved or burdened.
Recently, a dead person was found surrounded by snap bottles.
In the investigation, it was suspected that a family member might be suspect, and in fact a fingerprint on the bottle agreed.
Although this does not guarantee that it is the murderer, it is linked to the place where the crime was committed.
A Dactyloscopeist of the CTI stated that "the fingerprints with chemical or physical reagents would be taken from the object."
When they appear, a plant cell or a band is used to take away.
After that, the prints are sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the staff office.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without identification papers," said CTI's expert.
He said not everything was the way it would be in the TV series SCI.
Just as not all the gold that shines is not all you touch, it's a fingerprint.
But it can still be used if you make a similar comparison.
The "enraged" challenge the authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators pushed themselves together in tents on the Zuccotti square.
Most of them followed the space warrant and moved to a nearby park.
The members of the Ocupy Wall Street movement challenged the authorities of New York on Tuesday when they tried to enter the Manhattan Square again with a judicial order after they had been cleared from the square in the morning gray and tried to occupy another place at Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators pushed themselves together in front of the Zuccotti Square, to which they wanted to gain access with a judicial arrangement that allowed the "enraged" to again tents at this point. Meanwhile, another part of the movement adhered to the eviction order and occupied a park further north of the city, where there were nine arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp in the square, we will meet in another place and continue the battle with legal means to return to Zuccotti, with sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, one of the speakers of the movement "Ocupy Wall Street".
Bray pointed out that the response of the "enraged" to the clearing of her camp camp, which had been ordered directly by Michael Bloomberg, mayor of New York, came to court, where the judge Lucy Billings issued an order that prohibited the square's violent clearance and allowed the demonstrators to tent.
In addition, the "Employers" occupied a new park that is located at the junction of central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the New York tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and is owned by Trinity Church.
They were able to occupy the place for at least one hour, but after that the police arrived and arrested some of the demonstrators, although Bray cannot give precise figures. He assured the news agency Efe that he had also seen several journalists with handcuffs.
The organization assures that hundreds of people had arrived at this point where a delegation of religious leaders had also arrived as a sign of their support for the members of the movement and for mediation with the police.
In the meantime, the Zuccotti Square (a private property site) remains closed in expectation of a judicial hearing scheduled for this Tuesday, which will analyse the legality of the room in the morning grey.
Some of the protesters driven by the place carried photocopies of this judicial arrangement and distributed them. They even gave them some police officers who guarded the place, which resulted in "some small clashes", as Bray reported, who had indicated that some policemen had beaten demonstrators.
The court order prohibits the authorities from clearing members of Occupy Wall Street and the application of "laws adopted after the occupation and prohibiting the demonstrators from returning to the park with their tents and other things they had previously used."
Mayor Bloomberg made it clear to the press that, because of this judicial arrangement, the reopening of the public traffic space and the demonstrators had been lifted. He pointed out that city laws did not allow them to re-establish themselves with tents and sleeping bags in this place.
The mayor personally defended the clearance of the Zuccotti Square, which was carried out in the morning gray, in which almost 200 persons were arrested, and which was decided because the demonstrators were "infringing the law."
Bloomberg stated that he had given the order for the space to be spaced because he had "turned into a place where people did not come to demonstrate, but to break the laws and in some cases to harm other people", for "some business would have received threats" and the residents were "fearing for their quality of life".
"The oeuvre in the dawn was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is basically interested in protecting the financial interests and not in protecting the interests of North American workers," added the speaker of the movement who accused the mayor of "not respecting freedom of the press".
The responsible for "Occupy Wall Street" informed that they were thinking about organizing "great actions" for Thursday, together with community organizations and trade unions, to commemorate the two months that the protests have already lasted since September 17.
Pamela Anderson is the Virgin Mary in the TV Christmas Show
Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, she will appear on December 1st in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas"
The Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Alle's assistant in "Home Improvement", lifeguard in "Baywatch", rabbit at "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary at a Christmas broadcast of Canadian television.
The private TV channel CTV announced today that Anderson will appear in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" together with the "crooner" (balad singer) Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities on December 1st and will breathe a very special Virgin Mary life.
CTV today distributed pictures of the television program, in which Anderson - which also appears for the distribution on the Internet of a self-smooth porn, in which she together with her former husband, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appears as a virgin Mary with a doll in the lap that Jesus should represent.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently worked as a presenter on the show "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" by Charlie Sheen, appears as a Jesus child.
The Christmas program of CTV is based not only on Anderson and Peters, but also on the Canadian singer Bublé, who married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato at the end of March in Buenos Aires, who is not far from this controversy.
At one of his concerts in New York, Bublé recently called North American Kim Kardashian "Hure".
Japan is born again after the earthquake
GDP increases by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the spiral of freefall from early March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralysed, which is still in the process of recovery after the destructive earthquake that led to an atomic crisis, and the worst disaster that Japan had experienced during World War II.
The first estimates of the Tokyo government evaluated the property damage to $300 000, a blow that seems to weaken despite the difficult global economic situation.
After three quarters of the case, gross domestic product data were used to conclude this chapter from July to September: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% to the year-to-year figure.
The value measured in the second quarter - starting in Japan in March 2012 - also means the fastest growth since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery can partly be explained by the sale of machinery for the reconstruction of areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1% compared to the decrease by 0.9% for investments recorded from January to March, the first decline after six months of unstoppable increases.
Nevertheless, the real transformation of the Japanese economy is not based solely on keynsian instigations that use the crisis to build up or rebuild infrastructure.
Japan has been awakened especially thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable rose by 1%, driven by growing expenditure on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The Stigma of the Yen
Tokyo has entrusted itself to the domestic market, after the yen - the Japanese currency - has fled into one of the "residence currencies" of the investors who flee from the debt crisis of the eurozone and the cloudy forecasts for the U.S.A., a privilege that is like a gravestone on the accounts of the export companies.
With a harder currency, products abroad are more expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of the major technology producers.
Toyota and Sony, for example, attributed their weak business results from July to September to the listing of the Yen.
While markets continue to besiege the peripheral EU countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government remains alert.
"You have to pay attention to the continuing risks, for example the deterioration of some foreign economies, the effects of floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the Yen," said Motohisa Furukawa, Secretary of State for Economic Policy.
The perspectives are really not very upsetting.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated that in September most Member States had shown clearer signs of slowing economic development.
The indicator, which anticipates the turning points of the world economy, revealed that the brake would have been pulled at the greatest economic potential.
Because it dropped by four tenths to 100.4 points compared to the 100.8 in August.
The eurozone is even below this average, which is 100, after it has dropped by eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens Again Matters Doubts
Papadimos says the austerity measures would be adopted, but the conservatives will not sign a written agreement
With the increased risk premiums of the peripheral countries and widespread uncertainty, Greece continues to be lost in the labyrinth that results from the great European debt crisis.
The impression that the "consensus" of the new Greek transitional government is more of a reaction to the pressure from Brussels than a real conviction of the political forces is slowly demonstrated by facts.
During the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday pointed out that there would be no alternatives to structural reforms and that the hundred days agreed upon during his appointment might be too short for their implementation, the leader of the Conservative Party Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would support the new austerity measures and not take back his call for new elections on the scheduled date of 19 February.
"The most important task of this government is the implementation of the decisions taken at the summit of 26 October," said Papadimos yesterday at the opening of a parliamentary debate, which will culminate tomorrow with the vote of confidence for the new government.
A package of 24 employment promotion programmes, the reform of disciplinary law for officials and new measures against tax evasion are the first initiatives.
Nevertheless, Samara's communication does not raise doubts about his attitude: "We have committed ourselves to supporting the transitional government, but otherwise to nothing."
The conservative leader took a step too far with his challenge of the EU and the IMF, the organism that urgently needs to unlock the 8,000 million Athens needs. He made it clear that he would not approve a commitment on the fulfilment of austerity measures.
But the European Commission, which is still irritated by the effects of the poker game with Papandreu referendum, reaffirmed yesterday that its demand was not to be shaken: economic aid would not be signed if the new government and leaders of the main Greek parties signed "a clear written agreement as soon as possible".
The spokesperson of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, said that the inspectors of the Troika "very soon" came back to Athens to discuss with the new government "what kind of payment of the sixth section" amounting to 8,000 million euros, although there is no final date yet.
The Greek kid still has threads for a while.
Queen Sofía: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen stressed Spain's "predominant" position in relation to this type of financing
Spain "has achieved a dominant position worldwide in the role of microfinance".
Yesterday, Queen Sofía of Spain recalled that Spain has become the second donor to international cooperation in the last two decades. His "being" is based on the fact that it is an instrument for social progress, justice and the hope of a better future for all mankind based on trust in people."
Yesterday, the Queen opened the fifth World Summit on Smallest Loans in Valladolid. She was convinced that there was "no doubt" about this kind of business being "absolutely indispensable" in order to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations by 2015 and "in particular the goal of the number of persons who have to live with incomes of less than one dollar a day, that is, below the "poverty limit".
Spain continues "to work" on extending the beneficiary network "to the last corner of the world and carrying out this task responsibly", said Queen Sofia, hoping that the initiatives and contributions that will take place from the summit which lasts until Thursday will be "creating new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and, in particular, for women" as the main beneficiaries of these loans.
"We have recorded many successes" and "are facing many challenges."
The summit on micro-credit is not only a forum for debates but also a platform for "two fundamental objectives".
The Queen stated that by the end of 2015, the aim would be to provide 175 million poor families with access to these financial services and that ten million of these households would cross the poverty line.
The concept of microcredit goes back in Spain and the rest of the world to the way initiated by Muhammad Yunus years ago, which Queen Sofia considers to be a "act of justice and recognition".
She described the father of this financial instrument as a "acquainted idealist who committed herself to the fight against poverty" and her work for 15 years when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to get to know the loan strategy on the ground.
This experience followed a year later the first World Summit in Washington and further meetings on the Côte d'Ivoire Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006. "All of us have been able to observe a continuous development," said the Queen, whose commitment to this project yesterday presented her assessment as "the head of the family" in Valladolid and as "the advocate of the poor".
Finally, Queen Sofia finished her lecture by animated the participants to participate in the debate and seek solutions in the fight against poverty.
Ethical Commandment
Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity is "an ethical commandment" for the entire democratic state.
In this sense, she stressed that it was a mistake to bind development aid to economic booms, because it was a "permanent commitment".
Jiménez felt that micro-credit was a "serious and rigorous policy for the eradication of poverty" and that the governments of the developed countries now had to work "more than ever" according to solidarity criteria, and should not allow the solidarity of the crisis to fall victim to.
For Spain, micro-credit is one of the most important forms of development aid.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, lamented the "success", "marginized" people who "are always in front of closed doors" to give "hope" and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present in a city who opened "their gates, infected by the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the EU President on the basis of a general vote
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democrats (CDU on Monday 14 November in Leipzig was for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and Chairman of the Christian-Democratic Party, without any real difficulties.
The future of Europe was not originally planned in the programme, but it has prevailed in autumn, in particular in order to ensure that those activists who regard government policy with regard to the Greeks today and possibly Italy tomorrow as too lax.
The European Commission's proposal for a Presidency was adopted almost unanimously.
Among 1001 delegates, only nine had voted against, ten had abstained.
The standing ovation, which lasted several minutes, which was initially considered by Angela Merkel and a few hours later Wolfgang Schäuble, did not leave any doubt on the part of the three ministers of finance in Europe.
The chancellor's main idea - as well as the applications - is the following slogan: the answer to the crisis is "not less, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because "nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro".
For the chancellor "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe".
This could be reflected in a modification of the Lisbon Treaty, which would strengthen the control of the European Union, with regard to the budgetary policies of the countries of the euro area, but this could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of a general vote", in order to give Europe a face".
However, this is in any case one of the proposals adopted by the Congress, which clearly stood Wolfgang Schäuble Pate.
Certainly it is little likely that the 47 quickly agree on this revolution: Great Britain is opposed to the matter, and the leaders of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is of the same opinion.
The milestone, however, is laid.
Similarly, in an overwhelming majority, delegates rejected the proposal of each country's weighting on the ECB's Board of Directors in line with the weighting of the individual economies, which obviously entailed a strengthening of Germany's position.
The chancellor, determined to calm down the climate within her party, has therefore strengthened the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. However, she has no longer tried to win her congress at the expense of the "small" or the European countries in difficulty that would immediately criticize arrogant Germany.
As far as the European proposal for the significance of "German-French friendship" is concerned, Angela Merkel does not call France to mind.
At least not directly.
This reminds us that Leipzig was at the centre of a bloody battle two centuries ago.
Factically one of the highest humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does the fraud represent in the event of illness?
According to the family allowances, UMP and the government are now attacking the disease reports.
Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux on Tuesday, 15 November, to visit a family aid fund and to present a speech on the issue of the fight against social fraud and economic dependence on the state, which has been recurring since 2007.
In order to accompany this attack, which is based on the desire to make a hard test of the economy, but on the other hand, it is no less a prelude to an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, the majority wants to focus on workers' health reports.
First, with budgetary objectives: the government is looking for the introduction of a fourth day of work before taking into account a health report to private sector workers.
In good German, this means that a sick worker would lose the wages of four days without the approval of the specific company, i.e. at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure which, according to the newspaper "Les Echos", threatens to provoke anger, but would help to bring in 280 million euros.
And the more symbolic character of another measure: to give the state officials an unremunerated day of care in the case of illness (so far, unlike the three days of care in the private sector, there is no time limit for them to do so).
In the meantime, these issues are being discussed, the majority are also re-initiating the issue of fraud, this time aimed at the abuse associated with work abstinence.
"Controls will be much more important, and in addition, they will be refundable if this is required," warned Xavier Betrand on Sunday, November 13th, in front of the RTL transmitter's microphone.
As in other cases, the impact of this report on the reality of fraudulent acts in the field of health reports seems to be somewhat unproportional.
Indeed, this has been the subject of permanent observation and political offensives since 2002 which have been the most fruitful.
The French are no longer more sick than people elsewhere in Europe.
However, let us first of all dwell on the national figures.
According to the National Hospital Fund (CNAM), more than 237 million euros of daily payments were paid in 2006.
According to the Institute for Economic Research and Documentation of the Health Service, daily payments in 2008 amounted to 11.3 billion euros, 5% of health expenditure.
This amount covered 46% of maternity leave and accidents at work and 54% of sick leave, i.e. 6.2 billion euros.
And then 2.5% health expenditure.
In 2010, compared with the 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study conducted by the Alma Consulting Group, the French were granted an average of only 14.5 sick days.
A mean that covers up certain differences: another one published by Monster.com in 2007, career planning website, showed that 75% of the 40,000 surveyed French workers did not take a single sick day.
Another study, this time covered by health insurance, makes it clear that 37% of the health reports in 2010 were of shorter duration than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% above.
Thus, compared to their European neighbours, French workers do not tend to be incapacity for work any more than elsewhere.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two researchers from the French State Science Research Centre (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the global abscess ratio (founded sickly or otherwise) was oscillated, ranging from 10% to 11% in France compared with 20% to 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Fraud in the event of illness is a fadingly low proportion of undeclared work.
With regard to fraud, only a weak outcome is achieved here.
Strengthening legislation since 2002 implies that there are systmatic checks in cases of disease reports that exceed 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (public college of training of technicians and engineers) found that 13% of the 285,000 short-term health reports realized, i.e. in 37,050 cases, were "unjustifiable or too long".
In the systematically controlled cases of disease of more than 45 days duration, less than 1.2 million 11% were "unadapted or unjustified" cases, i.e. 132.000.
A total of 169.000 "unwarranted" cases involving several million workers who have filed a health report.
A number which represents only a weak outcome to, for example, those of blackmail.
According to UMP deputy Dominique Tian, author of a physical report published in July on this issue, this represents between 9 and 15 billion euros of tax loss per year, i.e. more than the total cost of daily allowances, and thus much more than the defraud of the latter.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adaptation plan
Greece needs a new adjustment programme to stem its economy.
On Monday, 14 November, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos announced this to Parliament, adding the fact that those given to his government by the Union for a hundred days were not enough to accomplish this task.
"In order to continue the efforts to strengthen the economy, we need support from our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme," said the head of government in his first public speech in opening the debate on Parliament's vote of confidence on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Euro Summit on 27 October was the "main task" of the new government, as the country's participation in the Eurozone would be "at stake" as it added.
Accordingly, M. Papademos has planned to reduce the state deficit of the country "to the 9%" of the gross domestic product from today to the end of the year, after it was 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
Rights reject the new austerity measures
On Monday, Antonis Samaras, head of the right wing, had given his consent to the measures already approved in respect of an attempt to escape from the debt crisis, but had pre-sented that his party would not be prepared for an additional austerity.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said on the occasion of a Assembly of Members of his New Democracy Party.
He had declared himself prepared to reduce budget deficits and debt, as well as to combat waste, however, was hostile to any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, Commissioner responsible for economic and monetary affairs, who had prevented IMF and EU from releasing the necessary loan of EUR 8 billion without written guarantee from all parties about their support for the planned measures, had Antonio Samaras replied that his word was sufficient and he would not sign anything under pressure from outside.
Euthanasia and accompanying free death must be legalised, according to an expert body
Canadians live in refusal of death, as evidenced by a report by the Royal Society of Canada
The committee stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors worked together to provide the best pain relief drugs, and this went beyond the cancer cases.
Canadian society lives in a refusal attitude toward death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually agree to talk to their doctor about conditions under which they would like to die and make dispositions for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, involving six experts in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
This body recommends that the government amend the criminal law in such a way as to allow accompanying suicide and euthanasia where this choice takes place, in patients who are considered able to make such a decision.
The experts cite a recently published survey of the independent society EIU, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the globe.
Although Canada has placed itself in the 10th place, the study notes that "medical death care in Canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid to cut the subject of death".
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians do not have access to painkilling drugs, the experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada tell us.
And despite the majority of Canadians' desire to die at home, 68.6% of those in the hospital eventually die.
From the country as a whole, the rate of death in Quebec is highest at 86% of hospital deaths.
In the delicate question of euthanasia and accompanied suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions which are opposed to the position of the federal government, which has already stated that it does not want to make any changes to the criminal law regarding euthanasia and accompanying suicide.
But now, according to experts who have equally inspected all those countries whose approach has legalized or decriminalized euthanasia and accompanied suicide, there is no evidence that such decriminalisation would lead to abuses in their application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or accompanied suicide of uncompetent or non-consenting persons.
On the contrary, there are much more cases of such violations, particularly in countries where euthanasia and accompanied suicide are not legalized, as was confirmed yesterday by Jocelyn Downie, co-signatory to the report, in a teleconference.
"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Accompanied suicide is also practiced in Canada, although it is clearly illegal here," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians support Euthanasia
Let us remember that, according to an Angus-Reid survey conducted in 2010, 85% of Canadians had already responded in favour of euthanasia, since they believe that these allow people at the end of their life to alleviate their suffering.
And 66% believe that the fact that euthanasia is legalized does not mean that the message is that the lives of older or disabled people are of less value.
With regard to those who have already practiced an accompanying suicide, 41% of respondents believe that they should not be prosecuted.
As far as maintenance or withdrawal of drugs in patients is concerned, it is less clear, according to the authors of the report.
They also suggest in their Recommendation List that the criminal law should specify that the decommissioning of the funds for which there is a legal rejection should not be considered criminal.
In addition, the expert body calls for health professionals to be trained to respect a withdrawal of the means at the end of life, and to fear this without criminal prosecution.
The committee stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors worked together on pain-relieving treatment to provide the best pain-relieving drugs, and this went beyond the cancer cases.
The Committee calls for pain relief or life-consuming measures to be taken at least in respect of those already widely used in the Canadian institutions for health care, as they did not serve as a means of reducing physical pain and to delay them to the same procedures.
Reservations of other experts
Some healthcare experts have already expressed reservations about the conclusions of the Royal Society of Canada expert report.
RA Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has described the attitude of the rapporteurs, among other things, as "extremely", as it does not limit euthanasia practices in the final phase of the disease.
"This opens the doors to a situation in which everyone who is tired of life and over 18 years of age asks another person to help him with his suicide," said RA Deschamps, who had seen a summary of the report yesterday.
RA Deschamps also emphasises that the authors of the report seemed to place individual responsibility over all other values involved in social affairs of society.
But now, he says, there would be "guidelines and obligations in a society".
Margaret Somerville, a specialist in health law, has also expressed "a strong resistance" to the conclusions of the report, which she claimed to be "pro-euthanasia manifesto".
Margaret Somerville, who is himself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, particularly doubts the reports on the non-existence of abuses in certain countries where euthanasia and accompanied suicide are legalised, such as the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Assad to relinquish power
Damascus extols a "computation"
Syria is increasingly isolated
The partisans, Baschar al-Assads, demonstrated yesterday before the authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The diplomatic pressure on Syria's Bashar al-Assads, which, thanks to the support of Russia, opposes and opposes a "computy" directed against the country, has intensified yesterday.
Two days before Syria's exclusion by the Arab League, the European Union intensified its sanctions against Damascus, although Turkey and Jordan, the neighbouring countries of Syria, had taken a position in favour of a resignation from President Assad.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was yesterday the reigning Arab Prime Minister who had called on President Bashar al-Assad to "put down his official power in Syria" in which the forty civilians and members of the government were already killed.
"If Bashar were to be interested in his country, he would relinquish, but in addition, he should also create the necessary conditions for a new era of political Syrian life," said the King of Jordan, neighboring Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
The Turkish diplomat chief Ahmet Davutoglu, in turn, complained that the Turkish mediation attempts addressed to the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year had not been successful.
"Those in the Middle East who are not at peace with their people and cannot please them must go," he explained in allusion to Syria, the neighbouring country, where Turkey is becoming increasingly rough.
The United States, for its part, welcomed the "enhancement of the Consensus against Assad and the machinations of the Syrian regime" as a result of the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"International Community, United States, EU, Arab League and countries such as Turkey have hit an ever sharper tone in the face of the repressions in Syria," says Mark Toner, a spokesperson of the State Department.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the government in the Dar'a region of southern Syria have died, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights announced OSDH.
Two other civilians were killed in the besieged city of Homs, according to this NGO, during "screwing changes and heavy bombings around Jobar".
At a press conference, however, the Syrian Foreign Minister, Walid al-Muallim, believed that the country "taxes on the end of the crisis".
By the way, he has responded emphatically to the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus from its duties, which he considers to be a "hazardous step".
Syria"will not give in", he added, stating, "the plots forged against Syria would fail."
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently investigating a " civilist protection mechanism" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organisations, the media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé had also spoken out in favour of sending UN observers to assist civilians against the repression of the regime, which he felt encapsulated in his "Paranoia".
An extra-planned new meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the crisis exit plan adopted on 2 November, but in particular the controversial, anticipated withdrawal of the military troops from the besieged cities and the liberation of detained demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lawrow classified the decision of the Arab League yesterday as "uncorrect" to prevent the support of any sanctions against Damascus, although China had already urged Syria to implement the crisis exit plan.
Italy
Monti calls on the markets to be patient and Italy to be ready to sacrifice
Mario Monti, future Italian head of government, has required a little more time from the markets to form his staff and implement a programme that requires "sacrifice" to regain the creditworthiness lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former EU Commissioner held a negotiation with the political parties yesterday before the present meeting of trade unions and employers.
It was his task to convene a cabinet in Parliament, which is relatively strictly composed of external technocrats.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with a number of victims," said Francesco Nucara, Member of one of the many smaller parliamentary groups participating in the talks after meeting with the President-in-Office of the Council.
Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Deputies, had said that Mario Monti was giving Parliament a vote of confidence until Friday to ensure that the new government had sufficient support.
The agreements will culminate in the presentation by M. Monti of a list of deletions, which will undoubtedly range from a dozen ministers to the head of state Giorgio Napolitano.
M. Monti commented that yesterday's nervousness of stock exchange and bond markets required their time.
In "a democracy, there are certain deadlines" to prepare a government and a government programme, he stressed that it was "certain that the markets will show themselves dubious and discreet".
His appointment by the President was welcomed by the markets in the first place, but the unrest had increased again, especially after an unexpected industrial decline in the eurozone in September.
The Prime Minister should set up a staff consisting mainly of technocrats, although he had stressed that he would also like to include "politics".
The new government should only exist by 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections, he estimated.
According to Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Deputies, the new government should receive Parliament's confidence by Friday.
M. Monti has committed himself, since taking up his duties, to work in all urgency in the sense of the objective of making Italy a "new protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesperson of Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "our diagnosis towards the Italian economy itself does not change, taking into account the new government".
The EU, which is convinced that Rome will not achieve its goal of fiscal compensation in 2013, despite the austerity plans taken up in recent months, has asked for new challenges in particular.
Emma Marcegaglia"Chief of the Chefs" of Italy, which will meet in Monti on Tuesday, also insists on the need for economic incentives"because a country that has no growth to show that deficit indicators cannot respect".
M. Monti, who is known for his competence and his independence as EU Commissioner (1994-2004), stands for a "temporary change" of Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconism"; the "Professor" symbolizes the "challenge of trustworthiness" and a "other Italy", according to the editorial authors.
The great unknown here is the durability of his staff.
President Napolitano would like to prevent early elections, as Italy will now have to stand for 200 billion euros of government bonds by April 2012.
Russian scientist helps the Iranian nuclear programme
A Russian scientist, Vyacheslav Danilenko, helped Iran to develop a bomb capsule that can be used with a nuclear weapon, confirmed on Monday an American NGO specialized in nuclear risks.
The Institute of Science and International Security ISIS is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Safety Agency AIEA and other documents based on this UN agency to identify this scientist.
The AIEA announced its "serious concern" last week on the occasion of a "potential military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to an in-depth study of AIEA documents by ISIS, Danilenko, born in 1934, apparently had worked for over three decades in a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Ural) since the beginning of the 1960s and was involved in the explosion-produced production of synthetic diamonds.
In 1989 or 1991, he is said to have left the centre to set up a company in Kiev that manufactures nano-diamonds.
The economic difficulties of his company led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Before returning to Russia, he then participated in an Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002.
In its last report, the AIEA mentioned "strong indications that the Iranian development" of a nuclear explosive system had been supported by the work of a foreign expert, who was not only applied in this technique, but also, as one member of the Agency reported, that his entire professional career had worked directly on this technology via the military nuclear programme of his country of origin."
Anti-Islamic crime and crime have increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have risen by 50% from 2009 to 2010, whereas other racist or religiously motivated crimes of violence have either decreased slightly or increased slightly in the same period, according to the FBI statistics published on Monday.
According to this data, the total number of crimes committed against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. by 49%, whereas a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crimes against Jews, and a global increase of 14% in anti-religious crimes and crimes had occurred.
The total number of "hatched crimes" had risen to 6,628 cases in very weak proportions, including 47.3% due to racial differences and 20% due to religious differences in crimes, said the FBI.
"After a weakening in 2009, it is alarming to see these crimes and crimes growing again," said Human Rights First.The increase in anti-Islamic violence is particularly significant," the organization added in a communiqué.
"Human Rights First had for a long time stressed that the violence directed against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights," added Paul Legendre, a responsible for the organization.
"The American government can and should do more to combat these attacks," he added, adding that this could be done by improving the police's attitude towards "hate crimes".
The "hate crime" is an inheritance from the age of the struggle for civil rights in American federal law.
This legislation had been passed after the death of Martin Luther Kings to punish acts of violence directed against race, skin color, religion or descent, and now also includes crimes of sexual belonging.
Twitter changes the platform and is increasingly similar to Facebook
On Monday, the Microblogging website Twitter introduced changes in the presentation of its platform to enable its users to observe the activities of those who follow their entries, which makes the service look like Facebook once again.
The new tab "Activity" and another "Name" enable better-reading live perception of the activities of other "Twitterers", the Internet user whose messages ("Tweets") you follow and track your messages.
This allows them to find out if they allow them to track their messages, subscribe to new posts, favor certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter menu offer had been tested at a low percentage of users before its general spread on Monday" in August", said the Twitter spokesman Carolyn Penner before the French press agency AFP.
Twitter was known for its little instinctive functioning, equipped with a somewhat esotherical appearance (RT for the referenced repetition of another person's contribution). followfriday pour recommander de supre un autre utiliseur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ainsi aun public plus large avec un maniement plus comparable a celui des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
In the network, users discussed this innovation with the help of certain "Tweets" via the Internet.
"This is useless, inconspicuous and resembles too much Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The Activity function" will help me to better track certain elements of my Flux twitter," @dannykronstrom announced.
Austria
Entry of a Golden Budget Rule into the Constitution
On Tuesday, the Austrian government of the Great Socialist/Christian Democratic Coalition decided to include a "Golden Budget Rule" in the Constitution in order to reduce public deficits and to avoid any degradation by rating agencies in Austria's top bond (AAA).
It was the social-democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who announced this decision of the Council of Ministers, although the Austrian public debt is 74.6%, well above the 60% criterion laid down by the Maastricht Treaty, but well below the debt level of the countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's ability to pay had not fallen at a stroke from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay additional three billion euros each year," argued Michael Spindelegger, Vice Chancellor and Christian Foreign Minister.
Austria is also calling for the Brussels Summit of Eurozone Member States of 26 October: Heads of State or Government at that time would have demanded the inclusion of the reduction of public deficits by the end of 2012 as well as a return to the public balance of accounts in the constitution or the adoption of an equivalent law.
The measure taken by the Austrian government is similar to the "German model" because Germany had been the first European country to include such a "rule" in the constitution.
By 2017, the structural budget deficit should fall by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, while from 2017 onwards, the structural budget deficit of the state should not exceed the 0.35% limit of GDP, whereas the regional states and municipalities should have balanced households.
The aim is to eradicate budgetary debt under the 60% criterion laid down by the Maastricht Agreement in the 2020/21 horizon.

Noda is threatened with a new intervention in the monetary markets
The Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that if the Yen continued to rise, the Japanese authorities would again intervene in the monetary markets.
"If we are to establish an excessive volatility in the yen's exchange rate", we will intervene just as we did the last time," said M. Noda in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the Yen was speeded up close to the historical levels that had forced the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo sold Yen against dollars to lower the Japanese foreign exchange value, which is in the process of setting a new record value against the dollar since 1945.
However, the Yen has regularly risen above that, baptized by purchases from investors who view the Yen as "a refuge" in these uncertain times of world economic downturn and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar fell on Tuesday under 77 yen, the euro has slipped under the symbolic latte of 105 yen near the levels that had triggered the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar recorded around 120 yen, the euro more than 160 yen.
This strawfire of the Japanese currency is damaging the exports of the archipelago, as it increases the cost of "made in Japan" products and reduces the income value drawn by Japanese companies from abroad, as they exchange them in national currency.
"Japan is fighting for its reconstruction after the earthquake and the tsunami on 11 March, which devastated the region of Tohoku (northeast), for its reconstruction," stresses M. Noda, who fears that this price of the Yen could kill the weak upturn already in the germ.
With growth in the third quarter-1.5%, the third world economic power has again gained momentum in comparison to the previous quarter-for the first time this year, thanks to the sharp increase in exports and consumption of households "plombed" by the disaster.
However, the Prime Minister estimates that the price of the Yen does not reflect "the economic foundations of Japan".
The Finance Minister, Jun Azumi, for his part, asked the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy committee on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to disarm the yen.
However, Hirohide Yamaguchi, Deputy Governor of the Institute, has informed that the BoJ had already taken "appropriate measures", which he stated that no additional currency relief could be expected on Wednesday.
On the occasion of the last meeting at the end of October, the Bank had increased its government bond purchases by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) in order to clear up the 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) of cover that it had spent on various purchases of financial instruments to flood the liquidity market.

Interest rates fast up, stock exchanges make withdrawals
The risk of infection of the debt crisis constantly undermines the European key figures.
Despite the take-up of the new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy and the best growth rates in France and Germany, the rates of the weakened countries are increasing steadily.
The stock exchanges, which are still concerned about the stability of the euro area, are also drifting a little more into negative filters this Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris the CAC lost 1.4% at 10 a.m. and fell to 3.064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt fell by 0.4%, London by 0.1%.
"Because of the new tensions in government bond yields in the euro area in difficulty, the global stock markets continue to issue some of their recent profits.
"The investors are nervous and only too well aware of the risk of infection," explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by the press agency Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange, which, in turn, suffers from the renewed fear of market participants regarding the capacity in Europe that the debt crisis continues, had closed with a Baisse of 0.7%.
""Japan, like the rest of the world, has focused his eyes on Europe, and commerce is moving towards a limited variation corridor, as long as investors have no evidence that the situation has stabilised," estimates Mitshuzy Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This resurgence of concern about the future of the euro area is damaging the single currency, which continues its Baiss on Tuesday.
The euro has been moving at its lowest level for a month and a half.
By 10 a.m., the European currency was worth 1.3570 dollars, so it fell by 0.4%.
According to the stock exchange agents, after the CDU, the Chancellor Angela Merkel's party, who had gathered in Congress on Monday, had accepted an application which, in particular, provided for the possibility for countries in difficulty to leave the euro area without leaving the European Union at the same time.
The Italian and Spanish rates are well below the 6% limit.
The loan interest rates of Italy and Spain remain at a very worrying level.
This Tuesday morning the yield of the Italian bonds reached 6.85%, which matured to 6.2% in the Spanish titles.
These tensions of interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to feed the fears of investors.
The future Italian head of government Mario Monti called for more time from the markets to restore the situation threatened by the debt burden in Italy.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, for his part, confirmed that the decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October were "the main task" of his government.
Spain is in the vis-à-vis the markets, as the parliamentary elections take place on Sunday.
The spread between the German and Spanish 10-year bonds has once again reached a new, historic high.
In expectation of growth rates of the eurozone
Statistically speaking, France recorded an economic growth rate of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than the expected 0.3%.
However, the Federal Statistical Office INSEE had revised the number of figures for the second quarter, with a minus of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of a stagnation.
In fact, it is the fourth quarter that is most worrying to economic experts.
Germany, for its part, had a growth of 0.5% over the same period.
A first upswing of the entire eurozone is expected at 11 a.m., with the EU Commission warning of the risk of a renewed recession.
Energy policy:
Facts should win over dogmas
If there is a subject that cannot be dealt with on the basis of short-term considerations or emotions, this is certainly energy policy.
The availability and costs of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is reasonable to hold an election meeting to reflect on this subject and on the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only bear fruit if it explores the overall economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although 7 billion people are on this planet, demographic evolution is driving a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, it should not be a huge proportion of the world's population to abandon a vital element.
At the same time, we must reduce the shortage of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity, without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, an issue that has disappeared from the ecological debate, in order to combat climate irregularities.
The accident of Fukushima does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany continued to remain isolated in its decision to refrain from nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which is subject to its decision to find a substitute source, nor in Switzerland, which is currently planning to build only nuclear power plants of the last generation.
On the other hand, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name just a few countries, continue to follow their projects with determination.
The United States, in turn, has decided to attract another unit to Fukushima's park by re-establishing the Three Mile Island plant, which was shut down after the nuclear accident.
Although the German model, based on renewable energy sources, is occasionally set as a model, the reality contradicts the discourse.
The Berlin election will result in an increase in the price of electricity, an increase in energy dependence on imported gas, in particular on Russia, a rise in CO2 emissions caused by gas and coal power plants.
The whole of these unpleasant effects will be felt within a few months.
The case of Denmark gives reason to think.
Denmark is, on the one hand, a European leader in wind energy, from which it draws 30% of its electricity, on the other hand, one of the strongest users of coal and gas, alternately using wind energy; on the other hand, its CO2 emissions and its electricity price are 65% and 50% higher than the corresponding European average.
Thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill in contrast to our French households.
As the energy price in the globalised economy is a key factor in competitiveness and a pledge of stability to industry on national soil, the French companies have an advantage due to the cheapest electricity in Europe.
Any significant reduction in nuclear power would therefore lead to a strong increase in the energy price, which would lead to the noble statements on the re-industrialization of our country and the defence of purchasing power to illusion.
Surveys have shown that this is a price that the great majority of French people are just as willing to pay, as it shows resistance to the principle of this energy source.
Let us remember that our country's energy policy has made it possible to build an industry with 125.00 direct and 410,000 induced jobs.
Due to its strong export character, it brings a large number of specialised small and medium-sized enterprises to the international markets and makes them creators of countless jobs.
If France took the decision to withdraw from nuclear power, a large part of these SMEs would fall victim to it, and the annual EUR 6 billion of investment goods and nuclear energy exports would shrink more and more.
If the decline of its producer is pre-programmed, which electrician would commission an EPR designed to function for sixty years?
In order to solve the energetic equation, it is necessary to admit that there is no miracle means of generating electricity, just like a devil's work.
The CO2-poor solutions developed by Areva for the use of nuclear power and renewable energy testify to the complementarity of energy sources.
Maintaining the highest possible level of safety is an absolute imperative for nuclear power.
In France, we have a security authority that carries out uncompromising and transparent controls in existing works such as construction in Flamanville.
Their work teams, who have made a name for themselves because of their professionalism, are just possessed by the safety concept.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious incidents.
Only a single one, in Three Mile Island, occurred under normal operating conditions, so it went without any consequences for man and the environment.
In Chernobyl, the drama was conjured up by reactor construction as well as infinity, human failure.
At Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident of two natural disasters has never been caused by the mass that has caused the death of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will draw its lessons from this accident as it did after the two previous ones.
As a result of this approach and a cooperation between the safety authorities of the French and German operators and engineers of nuclear power plants, the EPR represents a draft that enables it to be resistant to such phenomena.
Since it is considered desirable among the electric engineers to build a nuclear power plant, a stopover in Flamanville would be a fabulous gift to the competition of Areva and EDF by letting them go free to travel the leadership position in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is essential and legitimate to look for the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and party maneuvers dominate a debate that equally determines the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy was criticised from many angles - overload of police, judicial and administrative bodies due to a policy subject to figures, compatibility of this policy with the status of a "country of human rights", as France itself had titled.
Recently, the harassment directed against foreign students on the official side had shaped the weekly shows, and the Interior Minister had stated casually (see Libération of 23 May) that France "does not need any talents, masons or waiters from abroad".
But this policy was rarely analysed from an economic point of view.
On this issue there is a wide consensus between the right and the left.
On the right hand, Jacques Chirac's tone, which had declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed, including over 2 million immigrants, are not likely to present a problem for a country", said Michel Rocard, who explained in 1990, "can't take up the whole world's poverty."
The only difference is the degree of greatness.
The fear of invasion of the national soil by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared by both right and left in 2005.
The immigrants were perceived by both camps as a burden on the economy and the French society.
The only difference is the extent to which immigrants are exposed to.
In his programme, Francois Hollande is limited to banalities which indicate that partnership development allows us to solve our "migration problems".
This idea of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may have an impact on the elections, but it is economically expensive.
How business experts Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron present us in a recently published work that summarises the latest findings on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among the specialists regarding the positive impact of the immigrant flood on economic growth, wages and jobs in the immigration countries.
Limiting immigration would reduce growth and damage the labour market situation.
The fears about the influence of migrants are based on the idea that they threaten to replace the domestic labour force, in particular the less qualified, by exerting pressure on their wages.
Experience shows, however, that immigrants are, in fact, much more complementary than local wage earners, since they are mainly employed in sectors which are technically untied.
The low-skilled immigrants are working in sectors which are less attractive to local wage earners, the more qualified among immigrants are working in dynamic sectors where training is not adapted to the labour supply.
Positive wage effect
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, this complementarity also has a positive effect between locals and migrants on the labour market.
Giovanni Peri has calculated in this way that a 1% increase in the flood of immigrants results in a co-related, long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And without taking into account the fact that the diversity of the creation of ideas and economic growth brought in by immigrants is conducive (high share of indigenous immigrants among American Nobel Prize winners; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also contribute net to the social systems, and in the European countries, on average, about 1% of the total budget.
The World Labour Organisation estimates, for example, that a person who immigrates to Germany at the age of 30 averages a net contribution (income minus expenditure) of around 150,000 euros to the public budget over his lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy wished to achieve the missing intersections "with the teeth" at the beginning of his mandate.
However, these said teeth, which were intended to deter immigrants, achieved exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, now remains to think through European democracy
Democracy is a valuable asset; it is also a sensitive asset.
The European continent should be able to remember for itself who, after their invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, had passed over the entire 20th century over the tragedies of the First World War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Francos in Spain, Salazars in Portugal and the Supreme in Greece.
Some believed that it was enough to exercise the right to vote in the most possible way possible to see democracy once and for all over their enemies.
One knows since Napoleon "the little one" that it was a characteristic of mental attitude.
The universal right to vote, which is the necessary condition of democracy, is not a sufficient condition for this and can also become an "oppression instrument" as expressed at the time by the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, separation and control of the forces, a training, education, an economic and social community spirit, a case law.
The crisis in Europe in which we are in is an economic crisis, but it is just as serious and first and foremost political and democratic.
The change of mind of the Greek True Falsch referendum would have had a double-disciplinary character in this regard: once the need for a powerful return of politics, but also that of the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, its inadequacy.
This ambivalence should be considered obsolete.
Truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have shifted today, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, are no longer in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain in order to press for the success of the national referendum, which has been organised according to the needs and the wrong order.
A license for the European sole ruler or a leap with interconnected eyes into the emptiness of the nationalist withdrawal: a great choice for the citizen!
No, we want hackbeil, but a collective task, with full justice, clarified and steady, an election and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - we already do not know where to end the list - because there is only one crisis, and this is in Europe.
It is all Europe that is bowing down to the dictatorship of markets and rating agencies, which suffers from its inadequacy and its lack of solidarity.
It is all Europe that is humiliated at international level.
One is concerned about the transfer of sovereignty towards Europe - it is all of Europe that is gradually losing its sovereignty, and thus each of the nations it is associated with.
The urgency is to give popular sovereignty the leadership of the European project back to the hand.
For it is up to the general public whether Europeans can reduce the burden of their debt, free themselves from the markets and start a future through investment.
The exit from the crisis has decisions at European level on the condition that cannot be taken without total democratic legitimacy, without surely ruining us.
After Jacques Delors and the Socialists have been fighting over this proposal for a long time, everyone today is pushing European economic leadership to do so.
I agree.
But to imagine this without political integration and a stronger democracy - as it proposes to the citizens - would be a further folly and a further deadlock.
We must take on a new stage of European integration.
In order to create the Republic in France, it was necessary to "create" Republicans.
The revolution of interests alone could not afford here enough.
This instruction remains valid.
We need to create a more integrated Europe at economic level.
This can only be achieved by creating a more politically democratic Europe, a truly European national sovereignty.
We need Europeans to create Europe.
"Contactless" chip cards become a general good
The World Chip Card Fair opens its doors on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris in an optimistic attitude.
According to Eurosmart, 2011 should end with an 11% increase in worldwide sales of microprocessor chips (EC cards, SIM card phones), with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most important segment here is contactless technology, which allows payments in public transport or payment of purchases by simply holding the card to a reader.
Compared to the 320 million previously sold a year, 460 million contactless smart cards were to be sold worldwide!
Its market share should increase further in 2012 (580 million expected units) and represent over 10% of the global smart card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe is gaining ground in terms of contactless payment after being behind the Asia-Pacific region for a long time.
Some 26 million visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept them.
In France the beginnings are rather modest: only 400,000 contactless visa cards were distributed.
However, consumer markets are making steam.
Carrefour has therefore issued 2.5 million contactless Pass MasterCards this year.
In order to move at a higher speed, it is necessary that banks equip their customers with these cards.
"Two large French financial institutions have committed themselves to systematically handing out their customers bank cards that are equipped with contactless chips in the future," announces Gérard Nébouy, Director-General of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payment by mobile phone
However, this is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
A fadingly low percentage of devices has so far been equipped with the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology necessary for carrying out these transactions.
"They're late."
"But at least next year they should have a real upward development."
"We expect to sell 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks are taking an initiative.
The Crédit Agricole announced yesterday the start of a test run in Caen, which will run from December to June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees are to be equipped with a capsule that allows contactless payment.
The BPCE operates a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseilles.
And the Société Générale also announced yesterday that it would prepare the launch of an offer that would allow its customers to pay without contact by mobile phone.
Terrorist front understands, from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the relations between al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long suspected relations between the terrorist group al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and Nigerian sect Boko Haram seem to have been confirmed.
On Sunday, the Algerian Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Abdelkader Messahel himself, confirmed that Algiers had now "acquired certainty".
"The way in which both organizations deal with and the relations of the intelligence services indicate a clear cooperation," he explained.
Paris seems to be making a similar analysis.
The investigation of the kidnapping of two French people in Niger last January promoted interfaces.
The Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory, who were kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by Aqmi's followers, are said to have been killed at the same time as several of their kidnappers on the occasion of an operation carried out by the French special units.
French and Nigerian investigators want to have found in the ruins of the site several telephone chips that belonged to the terrorists.
Terrorist Axis
The analysis of the guided telephone calls leads to several interlocutors who are stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigators are particularly interested in the numbers of two interlocutors: one number leads to a Nigerian who for a long time had stopped in Maiduguri, a city in the north of Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram; the other leads to a man who is considered close to the Aqmi and the sect.
"This is a step forward, but there is no doubt that we have to wait for more clear evidence before we can talk about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem."
"But it is imaginable."
"For years, it has been known that the cult involves financial and intellectual support from outsiders and that it is increasingly active," says Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo.
In recent months, these "support services" have become more and more obvious in their course, as have the speeches and operating modes of Boko Harem, which now point to the moving of suicide offenders and the use of increasingly complex explosives carrying the same handwriting as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, to begin with Washington, has since then exerted pressure on Abuja to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have for a long time considered the group to be a community of Illuminati, who should not be given particular attention.
Quick success
The Boko Haram, founded in 2002 in Maiduguri in the vicinity of a mosque, a school as well as the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf, which in Haoussa means as much as "the Western education is a shame" - follows the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this mediocre region, the concentration is experiencing rapid successes.
It politicizes itself and claims strict compliance with Sharia, while its associate activists fight against the godless central government.
The activists first have churches, bars and authorities in sight.
In 2009, the activists of Boko Haram, with their increased attacks on the Commissioners, became particularly active.
The reaction on the part of Abuja, however, is indifferent as usual.
The army surrounds the city, it counts 800 dead.
Muhammad Yusuf, who is imprisoned, is killed in prison.
As a result, the sect is becoming more radical and leaves its fortresses in the north.
Last Christmas, she confessed to an attack in Jos that claimed 80 people's lives, then another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram is assigned the blame of a suicide attack that took place in the secure police headquarters in Abuja - the first of its kind.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations became a priority international target.
The formation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which is intended to lead from Mauritania to Nigeria to Somalia, has troubled all security experts since then.
While the Aqmi Mali and the Niger have occupied the Somalis of al-Shabaab in Kenya, Boko Harem seems to be a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, Alain Juppé warned against Boko Harem on the occasion of a conversation with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria and showed himself ready to share all the information."
The world according to the Republican presidential candidates
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry rival in simplicity and ignorance of China, Iraq and the assistance to Israel.
Can a crisis-deficit America lead a complex world with simple, not to say simple ideas?
If you listen to the Republican presidential candidates in this way, the voters could almost get this impression.
For a few days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their associates have repeatedly made their thunderous statements as well as their statements on foreign policy, traditional republican focus.
On China, Iran and the Israel aid - often supported in no way - slogans fall.
With regard to the appointment of the "Grand Old Party", Mitt Romney threatened to quote the Chinese in front of the WTO and to accuse them of the "currency manipulation" - the leading theme in an America that is the first to be irritated by the departure of entire industries to Asia.
He said that if this were to imply the initiation of a trade war, it would be stupid.
Jon Huntsman, former Ambassador to China under Obama and the only candidate who seems to have a sophisticated vision of foreign policy, has curtailed the air with regard to his flattering gesture.
He had called for a firm but constructive exchange of views with Beijing (also the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman is not heard as he stagnates in the depths of the polls.
Reagan's Map
Romney had also praised military battles against Iran if the sanctions to stop the nuclear programme failed.
"If I'm elected, I'll stop Iran," he said.
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll get the bomb."
He also promised Israel increased military aid and charged Obama with remaining guilty of this partner's obligations.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, second highest placed candidate, has a shameful record ignorance on his part.
Recently, he called on the Chinese military threat to counter it, because Beijing "trying to develop a nuclear power" - and seemed to pay special attention to the fact that China has been in possession of military nuclear weapons since 1964!
Texan Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and calls for military battles against Iran, says that he is prepared to take up the American army in Mexico against drug cartels.
Obama's use of torture was also supported by Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann.
One is far away from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, an extra-political gravity.
The current presidential counterparts to Reagan also had simple ideas and despite all of this won the Cold War.
They call to mind that Obama himself was an amateur and had to pour water into his wine, which involved the issue of antiterrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive conversation with Iran, the hasty withdrawal of his "boy" from Iraq, his indecisiveness in Libya, which also brought him the reputation of weakness.
This hostility, however, is not quite so unenforced.
The population estimates more of the positive balance of national security under Obama, which Bin Laden has switched off.
Since Iraq, it has been guarded against military intervention that leads to paralysis.
And Obama surprises more appropriately by arguing that America must be rebuilt economically to bring its leadership back to life.
Nord Stream, new gate to Russian gas in Europe
The North Stream gas pipeline, which runs on the seabed of the Baltic Sea and connects Western Europe directly with Russia, has been put into operation.
It is intended to supply gas to an equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to commit this event with glory and gloria.
Over 500 invited guests, including four heads of state and government, attended last Tuesday on the Baltic Sea coast under orchestral sound and at the fine tasting buffet the inauguration of the new North Stream gas pipeline, which connects Russia and Germany directly under sea level.
German chancellor Angelika Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his colleague Mark Rutte from the Netherlands have symbolically turned the control of the valve, which carries the Russian gas into the Western European network.
With the new gas pipeline, 27.5 billion cubic meters of additional Russian gas per year will be delivered to Western Europe by a first pipeline of 1.224 km long that connects the region of St Petersburg with Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
A second pipeline allowing a total supply of 55 billion cubic metres of gas - the equivalent of French total consumption - will be completed by the end of 2012.
And one already lets the possibility of building a third line sound on its own track.
For Gazprom, the timely and precise completion of this huge building looks like a victory.
The project was highly controversial in Poland and the Baltic States.
The Nord-Stream Pipeline will enable direct gas supply to Germany, while avoiding any route through third countries (Poland or Ukraine) on the country route.
For this reason, these two countries are losing a little of their power: for them, it is now more difficult to put pressure on Russia by threatening to close the door to Western European markets.
Warsaw, most engaged in the debate, was not backfired to compare the Nord-Stream pipeline with a "new German-Soviet Pact" in connection with the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is extremely sensitive politically.
Western Europe has gained even greater security of supply by supporting this Russian project.
This, however, is at the expense of decommissioning European energy, as the project has broken between Western and Eastern Europeans.
Russia has managed in barely five years to enforce its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries that have strong gas consumption and whose gas reserves are underway.
"This gas transmission is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us in an organic way," said François Fillon at the initiation of the gas transmission, pointing out the extent to which the large gas contracts are also important from the political and economic point of view.
All of this explains the broad smile of the numerous Gazprom managers represented in Lubmin regarding the gas supply.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also an outstanding technique.
The underwater line consists of steel with concrete coating to protect it from ship anchors.
It rests on the bottom of the sea, about 200 m deep.
In their construction, minefields dating from World War II had to be eroded.
"Approximately hundreds of mines had to be removed or destroyed with caution," said Jens Müller, spokesman for the Nord Stream company.
In addition, increased measures had to be taken to protect fauna and flora.
The line is a long metal snake, heavy as 242 Eiffel Towers, which is not interrupted throughout the length: neither through valves nor maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned off the coast of Sweden, but the project managers have distanced themselves from it, since the Sweden had little desire to see a Russian state company settled in a permanent manner at the level of its coasts.
"In the case of a hawk, we close the gas throughput in less than a minute," Jens Müller explained.
In the case of a leak, the gas contained in the gas pipeline escapes into the air.
However, this case is considered by the constructors as little likely, since the welding of the welding is estimated to be one leak per 100,000 years.
State monitoring of the gas transmission is ensured by an underwater robot controlled for external observation purposes from a seaship, as well as by a device circulating inside the gas transmission.
It has the shape of a cigar, measures a meter diameter, is introduced into the interior of the pipeline and moved through the gas pressure.
After three full days of moving through the line at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device provides the most accurate information on any deformities of the metal upon arrival.
The gas transmission was designed to work for fifty years without even having to undergo the slightest repair.
Gas circulation is simply guaranteed by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the entrance, 100 bar at the exit point.
Five societies have united their forces to achieve this project.
However, the management remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
Furthermore, the German companies E. ON and BASF are affiliated here (each 15.5%), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (each at 9%).
These five companies have formed a company community called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
It has its seat in Zug in Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased the entire capacity of its gas transport to renewable twenty-year contract.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, no matter how large the volume of gas actually transported is, Jens Müller specified.
The financing of gas transmission was secured to 30% by shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
Total labour costs should amount to 7.4 billion euros for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amounted to 240 million.
However, minority shareholders are able to recover their expenses, as Gazprom alone bears the risk of liability.
The gas pipeline is displayed on a sandy, pine forested coastline near Lubmin from the Baltic Sea.
The 4.5-metre-high valves form the gas outlets.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the incoming gas before it is transferred to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been supplied with one million cubic metres of Russian gas per ostensible hour.
With full capacity, these would be 3 million cubic metres per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a brand notebook.
Launched by an Italian company about fifteen years ago, Moleskine now wants to give the letter a new style.
It has a flair of adventure, with candlelight with the writing done hours.
The notebook of Moleskine is easily recognizable again, with its black, rectangular cover, its rubber band, the eggshell-colored sides, as aged over time.
However, the Moleskine notebook, as one knows it today, was created in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, which has its headquarters in Milan, decided at the time to place a distinguished design notebook on the market.
Maria Sebregondi, then specialist consultant to the company, is responsible for the launch of the new product.
The notebook was inspired by an old-fashioned production technique called Mole Skin (Mule Cast Skin), which designates a cotton bag, which is used, for example, for covers of upholstery benches.
This kind of notebook was very popular among writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has revived an old and almost forgotten object that was regarded as an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century," explains Maria Sebregondi, now responsible for the brand at Modo Modo.
The success occurs.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales rose by 26% and became established with a sales of 12.7 million pieces.
This is far from the usual production of the first years in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine passes the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to create a phantom image of the buyers, as the notebook inspires business people as well as students and professionals.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitan, cultured and open-minded customers.
The small Italian company, which counted 12 employees in its beginnings, now employs over 100 people and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan, the other in New York.
The company distributes its notebooks in bookstores, on internet portals such as Fnac, in small boutiques of the city centres and is committed to maintaining its identity.
"We followed the Zeitgeist and his new need for writing, which exists despite the upsurge in the e-mail," explained Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural trait is accompanied by the development of Moleskine: Recently the brand launched an exposure called "Detour (detour) ", in which architects and artists exhibited their own notebooks.
In August, at the film festival in Locarno, the company also launched a cover with leopard patterns.
Moleskine benefited from his success and this cultural spirit of time and understood to diversify his products: bags, schedules, fillers, computer envelopes... The brand has the full range of articles.
A success that brings envy: In autumn 2006, Modo Modo was bought up by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, which today's Syntegra Capital, and thus opened a new chapter in the history of Moleskine.
Why does the unemployment rate of disabled workers remain at such a high level?
About 19% of disabled people are looking for a job.
Today the "15th week of work for disabled people" begins.
Despite a deliberate public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate among disabled people is always twice as high as the average mean: 19% compared with 9% unemployment in the total population.
Discouraging?
"No, according to Éric Blanchet, Director-General of the Adapt Association, who is responsible for the "week of work for the disabled."
"The progress made within fifteen years is significant."
"At that time the unemployment rate was not double, but three times as high."
"Nevertheless, there is still a lot to do."
However, it must be said that many obstacles remain for disabled people before they get a job.
The elderly are more common: 37% are over 50 years of age (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualifications: 80% of them have no qualifications and there are only 10,000 disabled among the 2.3 million students with higher education.
Finally, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% of the disabled compared with 38% on average.
In short, there are so many criteria that make it difficult to start work again and that make up the "core of the problem", says Christian Grapin, Director-General of Tremplin, an association founded in 1992 that helps companies to recruit disabled people.
So much for the physical brakes.
Stay the unpronounced, the attitudes that, although certainly, develop slowly.
A study carried out in April by the association IMS-Entreprendre for the magazine La Cité stated that the surveyed managers have "a weak level of knowledge regarding disabled persons", which "represented" is "by persons in wheelchairs, psychological or intellectually disabled persons".
As a result, private companies with more than 20 employees still have a long way ahead to achieve the employment target of 6% disabled workers, which was set out in a 1987 law.
These latter figures from 2008 refer to a quota of 2.6%.
"We are now around 3%," reports Pierre Blanc, Director-General of Agefiph, the organization responsible for making contributions from companies that disregard this law.
The proof: The number of "paying" establishments has decreased, as has the sum of the amounts paid in between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which provides for increases in contributions, created a strong pressure on the companies, said Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement also reflects a real knowledge, especially among the large groups of companies."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of establishments between 20 and 49 employees employ disabled persons, while companies with 100 to 199 employees employ 82%.
Hazard: "What a luck."
Before they offered the "Blue Tuesday evenings (20:45) the forehead, Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens had not hidden their pleasures, which brought them the game of friendship.
It would have taken too far to claim that there had been a secret agreement between them, but the picture speaks symbolic volumes.
Sitting side by side on the spectator stage of Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden Hazard could have made peace well and gladly.
Five months after the temperamental gesture of his attacker against Turkey, the Belgian national coach had reaped nothing but praise for his person.
"I am very pleased with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian."
"I want to look forward," the native Liller assures him.
As for the contrast between his representation in Club and National Self"It is a unity that justifies everything."
"I've been in Lille all year, which is not the case in Belgium."
"It's time for me to start."
Hazard will come to Saint-Denis, led Friday evening against Romania regarding the match against France, to finally "shine".
However, without giving up the note of "pleasure".
He has been firing the French national team since the age of 7 years, leading his victorious campaigns between 1998 and 2000.
"I was always supported," he confirmed.
This necessarily contributes to further strengthening the "unique" character of this encounter.
So much in advance:"Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there," he presents.
"We just walked along the way."
"To be allowed to play means great happiness!"
Leekens, in turn, made it sound with kindness "stolz".
"The pride of carrying a galamatch."
"Stolz" also to confirm - in its capacity as "Neighborn" - that France "has again become a very high-level team", and that little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc did a damn good job," he said enthusiastically.
Although Belgium will be missing in the next European Championship, the technician sees himself very likely to share the plane with the Blue (the French National Self) ... in the direction of Brazil in 2014.
"We little Belgians come out big," he stressed.
"We're planning one thing, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You will notice this in the upcoming games" The game against France included.
Portugal very confident
With great optimism, the Portuguese team of Paulo Bento is looking forward to the replay against Bosnia (22:00) this Tuesday in Lisbon.
At play, both teams had missed the reality.
"At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento already sees itself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no doubt that "La Selecçao", his national self, for which he has been responsible since September 2010, will qualify for the European Championship 2012.
For Portugal, this means only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there's a match to play and serve an opponent, Bosnia.
In view of the play (0-0) on Friday in the hell of Zenica it seems obvious that the dice have not yet fallen.
Portugal clearly dominated the game for more than an hour, but the team was unable to put the thing on the so important stamp that had taken the pressure from it.
"This is a good result, but it poses a certain risk, as we have not achieved a far-off goal."
At home, however, in their brightly shining Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to strike in front of an audience that is just as likely to be at stake, even if the game was of course announced as "very scarce", said the optimistic but clear Bento.
"We expect a very tight match, but are perfectly convinced that we can win the upper hand," said 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance to be in the 2012 European Championship," however, the successor of Carlos Queiroz relativized.
On Friday in Bosnia, the decision forces the Portuguese to reach and win a goal.
A decision can already be sufficient for the Bosnians who also need a gate.
"This is a good result, but it poses a certain risk, as we have not achieved an outward goal," Bento laments.
"We will compete against a team that has high technical qualities and has players with many individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese would have intended to exert maximum pressure on the Bosnians already at the beginning, to "don't give them time to think."
A good idea, provided that it is actually implemented this time.
