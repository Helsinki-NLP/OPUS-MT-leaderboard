Fire deleted in French chemistry
The big fire in a chemical work that is considered particularly dangerous in the northern French city of Rouen has been deleted, which told the prefecture of Normandy on Friday. The fire broke out on Thursday at night. No one was injured in the incident. The firefighter was used with about 200 extinguishing vehicles.
The fire could be stopped
Anrainers were called not to leave their homes. Buildings in the radius of 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens were closed on Thursday. In the chemical plant on the shore of the Seine, additives for lubricants are produced. The factory belongs to the company Lubrizol of U.S. billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called Seveso Directive of the EU, which prescribes particularly strict safety requirements.
About 400 people are working at the plant. The chemical factory has already provided headlines in the past, for example, when a leak caused the gas methane thiol in 2013 and the environment was far reaching for lazy eggs. In 2015, after an operating accident, about 2,000 litres of mineral oil flowed into the wastewater system of the city.
Woman announces her job to search for her missing bitch 57 days
For two months a woman from Washington was looking for her missing dog - and announced her job for that. Seven-year-old Border Collie had left the hotel room during a short vacation in Montana. 57 days was missing from the dog every trail - but Carole King did not stop.
“It was terrible. I was angry, said Carole King to the “Daily Inter Lake” you and her husband had left Hündin Katie in the hotel room while they went to dinner. When they returned to the hotel, Katie was gone. They looked for the animal, but without success.
Donner had put dog in panic
In the hope that Katie could still stay somewhere in the hotel, Carole King went to the reception. “The employee says: “She left about four and a half hours ago,” Carole King remembers, “Daily Inter Lake, when the automatic entrance door opened, Katie was immediately kicked out. Probably a loud thunder had left the dog in panic.
With flyers and calls from Facebook groups, the kings searched for their beloved dog. However, from days I never gave up. I never lost hope, said Carole King to the “Daily Inter Lake” who announced her job as a postman in order to continue her search for Katie.
‘The tears flow
57 days after Katie's disappearance, Carole King received a call: A man reported himself and said that Katie was in his yard. But when Katie arrived there, Katie had already disappeared again. She looked for the neighborhood and suddenly her bitch was standing under a tree. “I just hugged her. I didn't want to let her go. I remembered King loudly, “Daily Inter Lake” “The tears flowed. People stopped in their cars, got out and hugged us. I thought the whole neighborhood knew that we had found them “
Losses in the Bundeswehr: Machine guns disappearlessly
Friday, September 27th, 2019
Six MG3 machine guns have disappeared.
In recent years, the Bundeswehr has lost many weapons and tens of thousands of shots of ammunition, including three machine guns. In most cases, the remains are unclear. The opposition speaks of a \"fearing\" extent.
In the case of the Bundeswehr, weapons and ammunition disappear again and again - many of them without trace. Since the beginning of 2014, the Force has recorded the loss of 39 weapons, 39 parts of weapons and almost 20,000 shots of ammunition. This results from a list of the Federal Defence Ministry, which the German editorial network reports.
According to the paper from the Secretary of Defense Peter Tauber's Office of the CDU, two weapons, one gun part and 3474 shots of ammunition have appeared again. Among other things, six machine guns of type MG3, eleven G3, four G36, six signal guns and two P8 guns are also missing 30 gun pipes for MG3 machine guns.
The scope of arms and ammunition losses in the Bundeswehr was “fearingly - said the left-wing Federal Congressman Martina Renner. This was all the more so because, in the course of investigations, little had been found again. The left-wing politician said that a “durable balance sheet” racer was criticised for not recognizing whether under the missing ammunition the person who was found in connection with the investigations against the terrorist federal military officer Franco A. “And that although a supporter of Franco A. was recently condemned for the possession of this ammunition,” said Renner.
Oil tanker - Stena Impero - left Iranian port
More than two months after its establishment by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker, Steina Impero, left the port of the city of Bandar Abbas on Friday today. As shown by the ship observation data of Refinite, the tanker set off and left the Iranian port. Port Rashid was stated as the destination port in the United Arab Emirates.
The tanker had actually been released by the Iranian government on Monday, but he remained in Iranian waters at first. It was from the shipping company that an official meeting was scheduled from Tehran.
The \"Stena Impero\" was imposed on 19 July by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards on Hormuz Sea Road under the pretext of violating security provisions. However, Iran was suspected to have responded to the controversial temporary fixation of an Iranian oil tanker in front of the UK's Gibraltar.
The road of Hormuz is one of the most important sea roads in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the global oil exports are shipped through the seas. The tensions in the region have been enormously exacerbated in recent months. Trade shipping has been brought into the conflict between the US and Iran. Several incidents have occurred with tankers and drones.
Merkel appreciates the courage of the people in the Peaceful Revolution
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel appreciated the commitment of the people in the GDR who went on the road 30 years ago during the Peaceful Revolution. In the fall of 1989, courageous citizens had turned the then GDR regime into a whack, Merkel said in a celebration of the Thuringian CDU Group on the upcoming day of the German Unity in Erfurt. Among other things, the Chancellor remembered the occupation of the Stasi headquarters. “The state security was taken by the horrors,” she said.
Musk strives delivery record
Tesla's quarter may keep record. Despite the delivery boom, there were recent losses in the electric car company.
Tesla-Chief Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong drive on the stock market with the prospect of new record figures. “We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries,” Musk wrote in an e-mail to Tesla employees published by the industry blog Electrek.
The demand was strong, so Tesla could book 110000 orders, it was further mentioned in Musks Newsletter. The challenge was to quickly bring the cars to the customership. In addition, Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible to the quarter end.
Investors liked this: Tesla's shares went out of trade with a plus of more than six percent. As strong as the price has not been achieved for almost four months. In the second quarter Tesla had delivered well over 95000 cars and thus reached its top value.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400000 cars. For this, six-digit numbers must come in the current and next quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is required, but here the profit margins are small. Despite the boom, there were losses.
Puzzle solved: That's why we can't kick ourselves.
A kind of brake in the grand brain prevents people from tickling themselves. Scientists at Humboldt University in Berlin, with the help of experiments at rats, found out how they shared on Thursday evenings. There were also progresses in the question of why children are so fiercely resisting the hustle and bustle, only to demand more.
Finally, it has also been shown why only the closeness of a kittling hand triggers laughter before the touch. This lies on a deep layer in the big brain, which already triggers laughter when waiting for the kickle.
According to the data, previous research showed that rats react with “laughing” in the ultrasound area when they are tickled by humans. This “laughing” is conveyed by the part of the large brain, which serves the central processing of haptic perception.
Laughing is suppressed during self - touch
Until now, it has been assumed that the brain can distinguish between self- contact and contact by others - that is, people cannot tickle themselves. However, the Berlin researchers now found out in the experiments at the rats that laughter and the activity of the area in question of the large brain is suppressed during self-infliction. This is also true when living beings are self-inflicted. While the foreign contact and the tickle by the scientists, the activity in the brain and the impulse have been enhanced.
However, if the self-infliction and contact by others happen at the same time, the laughter is also suppressed. This suggests that the rat's brain cannot distinguish between self-infliction and contact by others. The new findings indicated that people cannot tick themselves, because self-infliction activates a brake in the large brain.
The rats had also been trained to tickle themselves. They broke this initiation in the experiment therefore sometimes prematurely, showed flight behavior or terror. This ambivalence was similar to the behavior of the children. The ambivalence of the kitzeln was a behavioral reaction similar to that of rats and humans.
Disaster turned off: Great fire in French chemical work deleted
The big fire in a chemical work that is considered particularly dangerous in the northern French city of Rouen has been deleted, which informed the prefecture of the Normandy of the news agency AFP on Friday. The fire broke out at night to Thursday.
According to government information, no hazardous substances should have escaped. The samples taken give no cause for concern, as Prefect Pierre-André Durand said at a press conference on Friday morning. No one was injured in the incident. The firefighter was used with about 200 extinguishing vehicles.
Schools and kindergartens were closed
Residents were called on not to leave their homes. Buildings in the radius of 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens were closed on Thursday.

Brexit: Johnson criticized by his own sister
The Premier's sister commented on Boris Johnson's speech at the first meeting in Parliament after the suspension of the forced break on Wednesday evening. The Premier threatens to lead the country without EU agreements on 31 October should not rely on Brussels' demands for amendments to the Brexit Agreement, but how he wants to do so is unclear.
Regarding Cox, who had been working for the UK's stay in the European Union, the prime minister said: \"The best way to honor Jo Cox's memory and return to that country would be to carry out the EU's withdrawal - Cox had been murdered by a right-wing extremist in 2016 during the referendum election.
A reminder to attack Oslo and Utöya is revealed
More than eight years after the raids in Oslo and Utöya with 77 dead people, a memorial will be revealed to the victims on Saturday in Norway. The monument “Jernrosene” (German: the Iron Roses) consists of about 1,000 iron rose replicas. They recall the roses that thousands of people had left in the days and weeks after the attacks before the Dom in Oslo.
In the same place, the project of the artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud is to be revealed - the roses have been forged by people from all over the world, including survivors and members of the victims. At the opening, among others, Kronprinz Haakon and Kronprinzessin Mette-Marit are expected.
On 22 July 2011, Legal Terrorist Anders Behring Breivik first set off a car bomb in Oslo's government district and, following the island of Utöya, killed dozens of participants from a youth organization holiday camp of the Social Democratic Workers' Party. In total, 77 people were killed in the attacks.
Iran release British tanker
The UN General Debate did not bring a solution to the Iran conflict. But now there is a problem less. The British oil tanker “Stena Impero” in Iran was able to get into the lake again. It could be a puzzle piece in the peace plan of Iranian President Ruhani.
The British oil tanker “Stena Impero” has been held in international waters since mid-July in the road of Hormus in Iran. After the release by Iranian authorities, the ship is on its way to Dubai, as the Stena Bulk shipping company told.
The “Stena Impero” left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew now drive for medical investigations to Dubai, among other things, said ship owner Erik Hånell. By noon the ship had left the Iranian waters. “Beautiful that it is over, he told Swedish television station SVT.
The Foreign Ministry in London referred to the determination of the ship as illegal. “This is part of a pattern of attempts to undermine the freedom of the seas. We work with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law,” it said in a communication on Friday.
On 19 July the Iranian Revolution Guards had ordered the tanker to have disregarded the rules of maritime law in the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released at the beginning of September. 16 crew members who had remained had to deal with the situation, Hånell said. They had been professional in the face of the difficult and excruciating situation in the past ten weeks. The shipping company was now working to bring them back to their families as soon as possible.
The British government suspected a reaction to a similar incident in the British Gibraltar: in early July a super tanker with oil from Iran intended for Syria was placed on the chain. According to the delivery, the authorities defeated EU sanctions against the war country Syria. The ship had received the British from the United States.
Iran spoke of \"piracy\" and threatened with consequences. In mid-August, the \"Adrian Darya-1\" was finally released. Suspects that it was a trade-off to get rid of the \"Stena Impero\", London vehemently rejected.
The road of Hormus is one of the most important sea roads in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the world’s oil exports are shipped through the seas. The tensions in the region have been enormously exacerbated in recent months. Trade shipping has been brought into the conflict between the US and Iran. Several incidents have occurred with tankers and drones.
The nuclear dispute between Tehran and Washington is behind the tensions between the two countries. The Americans blame the Iranian leadership for wanting to build nuclear weapons. Iran backs that. In 2018, the US had just stepped out of the international nuclear agreement, which would prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb and at the same time end its political and economic isolation. Since then, the U.S. government has put pressure on the leadership in Tehran with massive economic sanctions against the country in order to force a more stringent and extended agreement on other areas. Iran has resisted pressure so far.
Due to the dispute over the “Stena Impero” and other incidents involving tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil plants in Saudi Arabia, the United States is working on a coalition for military protection of commercial ships in the region.
At the UN General Assembly in New York, Iranian President Hassan Ruhani had presented a plan for security and peace on Hormuz's road. With the initiative “Coalition of Hope” for the Persian Gulf, Iran, together with the Arab Gulf states and without foreign protective powers, wanted to ensure the safety of the Persian Gulf shipping.
India is building a better future with its protectionist economic policy.
India would actually be predestined to be a war winner. In view of the criminal duties imposed by US President Donald Trump against Chinese manufacturers, foreign producers in the People's Republic are forced to re-dispose themselves. The financial leaders of Asian companies, who consider moving their production from China to another country, call India in a survey of the UBS as one of the preferred alternatives. This has, of course, not only to deal with the inevitability of the Chinese-American trade war. With a huge pool of young workers and a single market of 1.3 billion consumers, India seems to play a more important role in the globally branched production chain.
But now India itself has become the focus of Trump's focus. Devalued by the Haudegen in the White House as the “Kingdom of Customs” title, America has removed the emerging country from the trade favors for 2000 products at the beginning of June. The United States prohibits high tariffs from India and calls for better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles and more.
On the world map of trade wars, the frictions with India are, of course, just a side-view. Furthermore, America also views the world's largest democracy through the security-political glasses. Delhi and Washington combine the concern about China's claims of power in the South Indian Ocean. Against this background, a Salve American criminal tariff against India is unlikely to appear. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has just entered a second five-year term, is therefore likely to weigh safely.
The problem lies in another place: The empirically hardened thesis that open markets speed up economic development has a heavy standing in the Socialist Republic of India. Also under modes. Its reformer mainly aims at bureaucratic error, which in the multi-people state has been suffocating every entrepreneurial spirit for too long. Firms now receive faster construction permits for builders. They benefit from a better energy and transport infrastructure, and a more restrictive insolvency and bankruptcy law creates conditions for it, seems to liquidate high debt companies more quickly.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. In India, economic optics has turned a lot to better people in the first five modes. However, in trade policy this does not apply. In order to protect non-competitive companies from foreign suppliers internationally, the national conservative government has even created new barriers.
In the West, Modi the Nimbus of the energetic reformer, who radically renews his land, is not least to blame for the fact that the charismatic Prime Minister only knows too well what vocabulary western managers like. At the core, however, the “India First”advokat never turned away from a protectionist economic policy, which prevents Indian companies from being forced to abandon anachronistic processes and thus become fit for global competition. Business people who survive through the demolition of their industries are among the tribal voters of Modis nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and complain about this short-sighted policy.
Resumption of Jacques Chirac on Monday in Paris
The former French President Jacques Chirac was to be accompanied by a report in Paris next week. On Monday the former head of state will be buried at the Montparnasse cemetery in the south of the French capital, the AFP news agency reported on the Chiracs family. The funeral will take place in the close family circle. For Sunday a public mourning ceremony was held in Paris's disability, as media reported.
The competitor is carried to the goal: Dabo is the first secret hero of athletics World Cup
The world’s peak had long been in the target, when in the chilled Khalifa International Stadium, the men’s first run of 5000 metres, Jonathan Busby, from Aruba, started to swing dangerously. He could hardly keep himself on his feet for about 300 metres before the goal, ran into an unhealthy attitude when Braima Suncar Dabo from the West African country of Guinea-Bissau suddenly undercut him and, as if the scene had not been enough for the last half of the stadium round.
“I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same thing,” said Dabo after the race in Mixed Zone, when he was totally unaware of the attention of the assembled journalists. He only wanted to talk about his hero. After all, he wanted to set up his personal best time and when he realized that this would be difficult, he wanted to help only a suffering companion. And anyway, he would be proud to represent his country, which was invited for the World Association. Under normal circumstances, he should not even have started. “That’s why I’m proud to run here for my country,” he said.
He did this with emphasis the evening - and much more intense than he might have thought. Because this herotat will be remembered. Since Dabo even let his competitor Busby take the lead and voluntarily took the last place - by the way, about five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this lead. At the end, it had nothing to do, because the busby only came to the finish with much help was disqualified at the very end of the world's light athletics association.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and studies there in Lisbon, had taken part in setting up a personal best time at the World Cup in Doha. According to official data, at 18:10.87 minutes, he himself was disappointed: “I wanted to run 17:55 minutes. I had been in the course of 18 minutes, however only in training, there are best times not count.
Million Masch: Egyptians equip themselves for wild protest day
In Egypt, security measures have been reinforced in advance of possible government-critical protests. In the centre of Cairo there was an increased police presence on Friday. Several subway stations remained closed, roads around the central Tahrir square were blocked.
Already in recent days the police had reinforced their street controls and partially searched the phones of pedestrians for news and photos related to the protests. Hundreds had been arrested according to two non-governmental organizations.
Opponent of Al-Sisi
Last weekend there had been protests in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura with hundreds of participants. They had opposed the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the critic of corruption and mismanagement. There had been no such open protest against political leadership in Egypt for years. The Egyptian builder and actor Mohammed Ali, living in Spain exile, who took part in the demonstrations with video messages on Facebook, has called for a “million march” in central places for today’s Friday. Ali called for a “Volksrevolution” The man is not a ‘good man’ for most young Egyptians, because he was a subcontractor for the army, but his messages arrive.
The number of arrests related to the protests continued to increase. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) was more than 1,570 arrests by Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECSR) and the Human Rights Watch (HRW) human rights organization spoke of more than 2,000 arrests. These figures were not confirmed at first. The government also did not comment on the figures.
Random arrests
Many people had been “willfully arrested” because they were ‘in the wrong place’ at the wrong time, when HRW appealed to lawyers. The accusations against the arrested were according to their lawyers of ‘proliferation of false information’, until membership in a ‘terrorist association’ in Cairo, Alexandria and other cities questioned and searched security forces in uniform, but also in civilian clothing, according to HRW’s arbitrary passports.
HRW also criticized censorship in the North African country. Therefore, the government blocks websites and online services in Cairo to prevent further protests against Sisi.
Online dealers: shipping dealers should be able to donate returns more easily
For online dealers, many returned packages are lost goods. Around 20 million returns thus land on the garbage. However, there is an alternative.
The Ministry of Finance has shown online traders such as Amazon and Zalando a way to donate back products instead of destroying them.
While it was not possible to exempt the companies from the VAT on property donations, the Ministry stated on a question of the Green-Bundestag Group, about which the newspapers of the Funke media group reported on Friday. However, traders could use the market value of the unsellable returns so low that they would not have to pay any or only little revenue tax.
Scientists at the University of Bamberg had determined that the federal citizens would send back every sixth package on orders on the Internet. About four percent of the goods - around 20 million products - then ended up in the garbage. To donate, the companies would also cost money after the current legal situation, because the financial authorities would rate material donations such as a turnover, which would then affect sales tax.
The Green Group Chief Katrin Göring-Eckardt called on Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to clarify with a decision that companies can evaluate non-cooperable products accordingly and donate free of charge to non-profit organisations. Companies should be able to rely on not to be penalized for donations. This was not only valid for online trade, but also for other businesses from fashion shops to the construction market.
Banksy art for auction: there was never a better time selling this painting
The well-known work of Streetart-Star Banksy, “Devolved Parliament,” will soon be auctioned.
For Branczik, Banksys' work \"understands the restitution of the world's oldest parliamentary democracy into the basic attitude of animals and tribes - from Saturday the painting will be exhibited at Sotheby's in the British capital until it is auctioned on 3 October. It will be estimated at 1.5 to two million euros.
The work was first exhibited in 2009 at the Bristol Museum in the southwestern United Kingdom, where Banksy lives. This year, the artist once again exhibited the painting - at the same time as the original Brexit date on 29 March. On this occasion, the work, formerly called \"Fragundunde\", was renamed \"Devolved Parliament\" -\"Delegated Parliament\"
The picture could change the owner for a million.
Finally, on Wednesday at the first meeting of the lower house after a forced break by the Supreme Court imposed by Johnson, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had supplied himself with a hard-shock exchange with the opposition. Johnson wants to carry out the Brexit already moved twice on 31 October, without any agreement with the EU.
It is not the first time Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, interferes in the Brexit debate. In Dover in southeast England, he painted a picture that is a man who breaks a star of the European flag with a girl. The work sees thousands of truck drivers and other visitors daily on their entry into the United Kingdom.
Brexit debate is like a walk in the park
The fierce verbal attacks of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Brexit opponents in Parliament do not contribute to a climate of hatred, according to his top advisor. In comparison to the election campaign before the 2016 Brexit referendum, the current controversy is a “spattering in the park” Dominic Cummings said on Friday at a book presentation. “We enjoy this. We will quit (of the EU) and we will win,
In the last few days, Johnson had attacked Brexit opponents in Parliament and had told them, among other things, “treasure,” to the people. He was accused that he could put the Members at risk because they could be targets of murder threats, he was acting as “Humbug”.
Cummings said that the only way to get back to rest would be if Members finally respected the British decision to leave the EU. It was not surprising that people were told that Britain had not yet left the EU three years after the referendum.
In view of the mood charged on Friday, even the bishops of the Anglican Church called for restraint. \"We should talk to each other with respect, it was said in a statement. \"And we should also listen\"
Pakistan's Prime Minister Khan calls for Uno intervention in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan's Prime Minister, Imran Khan, once again called on the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict in his first appearance before the Uno General Assembly.
Otherwise, a new war between the nuclear powers of Pakistan and India was likely, said Khan on Friday at the Uno General Debate in New York. \"If this is going to be bad, one would hope for the best, but be prepared for the worst, the United Nations would have a responsibility for Kashmir. \"You would have to prevent that,
Since its independence from British colonial rule in 1947, India and Pakistan have waged three wars, two of them around the divided Kashmir region. Both nuclear powers are part of Kashmir, another part of China. At the beginning of August India had withdrawn its autonomy status and thus increased tensions in relation to Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
The demonstrators in Cairo call for the overthrow of the Egyptian President al-Sisi.
Against the current protests in Egypt, the government reacts with a hard hand. It shoots the population with a sharp ammunition, more than 2000 arrested prisoners join the 60,000 political prisoners who already reside there. Protesting in Egypt has never been inconceivable. However, since the takeover of General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in 2013, the state apparatus has done everything to avoid a scenario such as at the time of the Arab Spring.
But one of the triggers for the protests in 2011 was the poor economic situation. Poverty, prospectslessness and the feeling of being choked by one's own government drove millions on the road. And this is a problem that also the El-Sisi regime does not get into control, no matter how hard it is against opposers. The situation has even deteriorated.
Today, every third of Egypt lives below the poverty line. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half of its value, the inflation rate is ten percent. Anyone who wants to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket has to decide who he is funding: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for the suppression but also the biggest economic actor. The military builds roads, houses, football stadiums, produce food and much more. That has been the case before el-Sisi. With authoritarian regimes, the Egyptian people have a lot of experience, even the dilemma in the supermarket is an old one. It will always be critical if large parts of the population have difficulties to make themselves a bottle of water at all.
Tüv checks in the terminal: BER-Chief: No ‘Showstopper’ - more for capital airport
Two months has been tested to see if the complicated system interplay works with BER fire protection. The operators are satisfied with the course. However, the Tüv is not yet finished at BER.
After large-scale Tüv tests in the terminal of the future capital airport, the operators confirmed the planned opening in October next year. This is certain, said Supervisory Board Chief Rainer Bretschneider after a meeting of the control body.
Chief of Airport Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke about a successfully completed test, but also said that there were still shortcomings in the terminal. “We have many detailed topics, but we don’t have a real show stopper - He assured that the schedule until commissioning still contains buffers.
However, there are indications that the temporary reserve is no longer expected to be too large. The construction production indicator is now to be submitted to the construction office in the course of the first quarter of 2020, at the beginning of the year it was planned for this autumn.
Hundreds of defects in power cables are still to be resolved; the Tüv wants to examine them until February. \"In order to create the conditions for the take-up of the flight operation, intensive work must continue to be done on the completion of the defects, it was stated in a written notice.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases there is a lack of evidence, less of new cables. There is also no release for all the doubles that the cable tracks are hanging on. The airport manager expects this to be available by the end of the year.
In addition, fire protection at the transition to the station under the terminal is not yet functioning satisfactory. The problems had already led the project to another crisis three years ago. This time it is about smoke bursts that run down like a canvas in a fire so that the smoke does not spread. They drive too far. 36 engines must be exchanged. Then there should be new trials with hot gas smoke at the beginning of the year.
Problems with fire protection and other tree stings as well as planning failures have been delaying the opening of the airport for years. Originally, it should be operating in 2011. Since the start of the building in 2006, costs have risen from two billion to approximately 6.5 billion euros for the next year.
Since the passenger numbers in Berlin have increased significantly since then, the controllers are planning to expand the airport. Therefore, it is planned to take place in a special meeting of the Supervisory Board on 18 October, as President Bretschneider announced.
The airport company is now looking for two new managing directors. Chief of Finance Heike Fölster is changing to Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, Chief of Staff Manfred Bobke-von Camen will be retiring next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster.
Chemnitz: Automatics Bubbling for Drugs - Police Detain Man
He needed money for drugs, and he took several machines in the city area of Chemnitz! Now the perpetrator is finally in custody!
Over the past two years, the number of blown cigarette and parking lights in Chemnitz and the region has increased significantly. A million damage has occurred!
After two detonations, the police took a 33-year-old German at the end of May on the Bürgerstraße and the Further Straße in Chemnitz.
Police spokesman Andrzej Rydzik said: “In the course of the investigation of explosive explosions in crime with particularly severe cases of theft carried out by the Chemnitz criminal police, not only did this suspicion of the 33-year-olds confirm themselves,
Confronted with the new evidence, the 33-year-old Chemnitzer now had a total of eight deeds.
The police spokesman said: \"The prey apparently financed its drug dependence - the bomber had blown parking lights on the Bürgerstraße four times between 20 August 2018 and 31 May 2019.
The total damage caused is at least EUR 60 000!
The Automatic Bomber is now in investigative. Police investigations against him continue.
It is possible that he was also responsible for further automatic speeches in Chemnitz and adjacent counties.
AUA takes over Eurowings flights from Vienna
The Lufthansa Group is reversing its strategy for Vienna Airport. In the midst of the price struggle with cheap aircraft like Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, Lufthansa subsidiary AUA, which is the commercial control of all Eurowings flights from Vienna, confirmed on Friday a press spokesperson from Austrian Airlines to APA. Previously, “AviationNetOnline” had reported.
The Vienna base of the Lufthansa-Billigflieger Eurowings is thus de facto dissolved. Four of the currently seven Eurowings aircraft will remain in Vienna. The AUA will take over from January 2020 in the “Wetlease” including Eurowings staff. In Salzburg, three Eurowings-Jets will be stationed in the future, which will fly from Salzburg and Innsbruck as charter machines to holiday destinations. Routes from Vienna to Germany will be taken over by Eurowings Germany.
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA circuit and network planning, the spokesperson said. The flight times are to be agreed on connecting flights. The aim is to strengthen the Vienna hub and, on the other hand, to expand decentralized transport from the federal states.
As AviationNetOnline writes, Eurowings in Vienna is only serving as a “Production Company” for the Group’s sister AUA. For example, Barcelona and Rome would be operated with AUA flight number, but mainly with Eurowings. The boarding product should be adapted to that of Austrian Airlines, but the pilots and flight attendants are from Eurowings. According to the report, Eurowings flights starting under AUA flight number are no longer produced in Terminal 1, but the AUA in Terminal 3.
At the airport of Vienna, after the Niki-Pleite, a prize fight broke out. The Ryanair subsidiary Laudamotion announced on Thursday that the fleet in Vienna would be increasing to 16 aircraft next summer. The Irish low-cost aircraft sends four Ryanair machines and crews to Vienna, also in the so-called \"Wetlease\", which criticized the trade union as a conversion structure to the collective agreement.
Ryanair Chief Michael O'Leary's campaign statement that Lauda will have overtaken the AUA in five years, replied on Friday AUA boardman Andreas Otto: \"We stay the number one at the site, in five, six or ten years,
Queen Single Princess Beatrice is engaged
Beatrice, Eugenie, William and Harry: As children the cousins were the best friends. Now the last of the four marry. Beatrice is engaged!
Wonderful news from the British Royals: Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi (34) will have stopped around the hand of his friend Princess Beatrice (31) at the beginning of the month. This is what the palace announced on Thursday.
“We are very happy to announce our engagement. We are both so happy to start this adventure together and can hardly expect to actually be married,” said the couple, who, according to British media reports, has been working together since October 2018, in the official announcement.
And further: “We share so many similar interests and values and we know that in the coming years, love and happiness will be very helpful,
Sister Eugenie cut the pictures
The official engagement photos took her sister Princess Eugenie (29), and also immediately published on her Instagram account.
A royal feast
The wedding will take place in 2020. More information about the date, place and everything else will be announced to the palace in the coming months.
It is certain, however, that the embodiment of the number nine of the British Throne and the Real Estate Mogul will be a similar great festival to the wedding of Eugenie on 12 October 2018 with Jack Brooksbank (33).
Study on causes of heart disease
Smoking, obesity, unhealthy diet - there are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. But what really causes heart failure or infarction? Hamburg researchers now want to see the heritage of 9000 healthy and sick people exactly.
About the analysis of the heritage of 9000 people, Hamburgers and Swiss scientists want to focus more on the causes of cardiovascular diseases.
The research project is the largest of this kind in the German-speaking area, the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) announced on Friday. The Kühne Foundation supports the project with EUR 12.5 million. The high mountain clinic Davos, which belongs to the Foundation, and the University Hospital Zurich is involved.
Overweight, smoking and unhealthy nutrition are among the main influencing risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Genetic factors determine the risk. However, the interaction between genes and external influences is not known enough. Now, scientists want to compare the complete inheritance of 8000 healthy people with the 1000 former patients of the University Heart and Vascular Center at the UKE.
Currently, more than 4,000 of the approximately 20,000 relevant human genes are known for possible disease-related changes in DNA - so-called mutations - it was said by the hospital. About 200 were added each year.
The objective of the five-year project is to develop new options, such as the prevention, detection and treatment of heart rhythm disorders, heart failure and heart attacks. Data could also be used in the study of other human diseases, according to Stefan Blankenberg, Head of the University Heart and Vascular Center. New findings on the interaction between the heart and brain, heart and kidney as well as cancers are possible.
The chairman of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also stressed that there was a strong desire to use the data to investigate other diseases. The Davos Foundation's clinic has so far been primarily treating allergies. Now a Center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine should be created and a professorship for bioinformatics should be created at the medical campus there. In order to establish his commitment, the logistics contractor living in Switzerland said that he had been operated at the open heart in Hamburg three years ago and was very grateful.
The bioprobes of the healthy participants come from Hamburgers, who also participate in the ‘Hamburg City Health Study’. With 45,000 subjects, according to the clinic, this is the largest local health study in the world. In the case of inheritance encryption, strict attention is paid to the protection of the anonymised data, the scientists assured it was a petabyte (1000 terabyte) of data, said Holger Moch from the Zurich University Hospital.
According to UKE, a person's heritage can be decrypted within 24 hours. The cost of this is 1300 euros. The first gene sequencing worldwide, whose results were published in 2001, has cost several hundred million euros. The study is due to start on 1 October, as early as 2020, all 9000 samples are to be analysed.
Nigerian police release hundreds of abused boys
In Nigeria, the police have freed more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Qur'an school. According to information from residents, security forces searched the school in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered the victims, some of whom were still under-age, as Yakubu Sabo told. “The victims were abused. Some of them reported being raped by their teachers,” said Sabo.
The boys were held under the pretext of being taught and improved in the Qur'an. In fact, the shooters were detained by their teachers under the most humiliating and inhumane conditions, said Sabo. About a hundred pupils, including children aged nine, had been chained in a small space.
According to the Qur'an School, the information was given for about ten years. Residents would have made the authorities aware of repeated irregularities in the establishment. Parents would have been shocked when they were informed of the conditions in the Qur'an School, Sabo said. They had not known about the sufferings of their children. The operator and six employees were arrested according to police.
In the mainly Muslim north of Nigeria there are many private Qur'an schools. They replace the often inadequate state institutions. The people in the region suffer from frequent attacks of armed gangs. According to the UN refugee aid work, in the past ten months, more than 40,000 people have fled across the border in the neighbouring state of Niger.
Chained and tortured: Nigeria's police free 400 children from school
In a school in northern Nigeria, police officers freed almost 400 pupils from terrible conditions. “Many of them were chained and some had visible injuries that indicate torture,” said police spokesman Yakubu Sabo in the city of Kaduna.
The children had been discovered in an Islamic school on Thursday after an indication. The conditions there were \"humanly unworthy.\" The officials arrested the headmaster and six teachers after the liberation action.
The children, all boys, were kept in their schools like slaves and put on chains, some had been sexually abused. TV shows showed tired and injured students in a recognizable poor state of health.
World Football Choice: More Suggestions for Messis and Klopp's Short
Football ‘Signature not valid’
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe awarded
With a gala in Milan, the Fifa World Football Association is the best player, the best player and the best coach in the year. Lionel Messi is the sixth honor and thus record.
After Nicaragua's captain declared that he never voted in the World Football Election, accusations to the Fifa come from other countries. Egypt was not even appreciated - with a curious justification.
In the past years, a lot of the fifa has proven to be quite correct: the World Cups, the dubiose plans of their President Gianni Infantino, the general behavior of various corrupt officials. However, the Fifa World Football Election has not yet been suspected of running out of air - if one fails to see that the voting-right national trainers and national team captains of member associations often vote more in sympathy than according to objective assessment.
However, after having already complained to Nicaragua's captain, he did not vote at all, further disagreements now occur: Egypt complains that the votes of National Trainers Hossam El-Badry and Captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account. In fact, they do not appear in the official and publicly available voting supervision.
The Fifa apologizes in so far that “the signatures on the electoral forms have been filed in capital letters and therefore not valid. You have contacted the Egyptian Association several times to clarify the situation without reply.
Sudan's coach also surprised
The Sudanese association also states that Trainer Zdravko Lugarisic did not agree as it was finally evaluated: with Lionel Messi in place one, Virgil van Dijk on two and Sadio Mané on three. According to Fifa, the vote was the same, with signatures and official stamps of the Sudanese Association.
Nicaragua's captain Juan Barrera had also raised allegations: \"Haven't voted for the #TheBest2019 Awards. All details about my vote are wrong, thank you. In his case he was suspected that the Nicaraguan football association simply voted in his name.
The association now came to the news on Friday: Voted, but of course it was not intended. The completed electoral documents had been “irrtually,” with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan selection, it was mentioned in a notice of the association. However, the second captain Manuel Rosas had chosen. “We assume responsibility for the administrative error,” said the announcement. Both Rosas and team coach Henry Duarte had voted for Messi, “all the way it is in the official list of FIFA,”
The other cases now allow the fifa to be examined in a survey, but stress that the election process was externally supervised by the PriceWaterhouseCoopers consulting firm. As long as Lionel Messi remains the undisputed winner of the World Football Wahl - and Jürgen Klopp World Trainer of the Year.
Ukraine case: Ranghohe Republicans speak out for official investigation
Two senior Republicans have openly spoken out for an official investigation against US president and party friend Donald Trump. “I think the investigation is important,” said the Republican Governor of the U.S. state of Vermont, Phil Scott. “Where this is carried out from here, it is determined by the facts that are being found - he wants to know more about the Whistleblower cases before measures are taken. An impeachment procedure can lead to the resignation of the president.
Scott said that he was not surprised by the revelations, which showed that Trump had repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj to investigate the activities of the democratic presidential and former vice-president Joe Biden in Ukraine. Scott observed Trump Biden for years.
To date, the Republicans have held back criticism of Trump because of the whistleblower affair, but few have shown discomfort for this. Scott's statements are now a first sign of this in Trump's party. The moderate Governor of Virginia had already repeatedly opposed Trump's policy, for example against the locking of environmental protection regulations and the tightening of immigration regulations.
As another high-ranking Republican, Charlie Baker, Governor of Massachusetts, also spoke out for the investigation. “It’s a very disturbing situation,” Baker said. “The right approach and responsibility for the congress is now to investigate the matter and to get to the bottom of it,
Scott and Baker, as governor of U.S. states, do not have a formal say in proceedings against Trump, which is decided in Congress. Their statements are therefore particularly symbolic. Nevertheless, the first senators of the Republicans have also expressed themselves critically about the situation. For example, mid Romney, representing the state of Utah in the second Chamber of Parliament, said that the case was “extremely disturbing, deeply disturbing, U.S. media also reported that there were internal first cracks among Republicans.
The affair could lead to an investigation in the launch of an official defence procedure against Trump, the Democrats in the House of Representatives have announced an investigation, and they accuse him of abuse of power for the purpose of foreign influence for their own political benefit.
With its majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could strive for a so-called impeachment. However, the decision on an actual term of office fell within the Senate where Trump's Republicans had the majority. Therefore, the prospects for success of such a procedure are low. So far, no US President has been deposed by an impeachment procedure of the Office.
Were torturers on the board of Racketes Sea Watch?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily, they are to have raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rackete (31) was arrested in June after she had unauthorisedly headed the port of Lampedusa with the rescue ship Sea Watch 3 and 53 Libyan refugees on board. After fierce protests and international criticism - also by Austria's Federal President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was rescinded after a few days by an Italian judge.
Now, new heavy accusations against Rackete are becoming loud. Three men who were accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps could have arrived in Italy with \"Sea-Watch 3\". The suspects were arrested in a detention camp in Messina, Sicily, after migrants had recognised their tormentors in Italy. \"We can't exclude this, but we don't even have any secure information about it - said \"Sea Watch\" spokesperson Ruben Neugebauer der Deutsche Presse-Agency.
The police said in mid-September that the suspects in the North African country had raped, tortured, and even murdered. Muhammad C. (27) was from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). \"The migrants were systematically harassed and the atrocities were exposed - by repeated and constant physical violence - it was then mentioned in the announcement.
NGO and aid organizations now point out that they can't know exactly who's coming on the ships. \"We can't scan who the people are. They come without passports, said Neugebauer. Torture is one of the main reasons why people flee Libya. It is therefore quite likely that there are also perpetrators on the ships. \"It is therefore very important that this is done,
Italy's judge ex-Minister of the Interior Matteo Salvini called for an immediate apology from Rackete, against which aid for illegal immigration is still being found in Italy.
Musk aims delivery record at Tesla and
Tesla-Chief Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong drive on the stock exchange with the prospect of new record figures.
“We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries,” Musk wrote in an e-mail to Tesla employees published by the industry blog Electrek.
The demand was strong, so Tesla could book 110,000 orders, it was further mentioned in Musks Newsletter. The challenge was to quickly bring the cars to the customership. In addition, Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible to the quarter end.
Investors liked this: Tesla's shares went out of trade with a plus of more than six percent. As strong as the price has not been achieved for almost four months. In the second quarter Tesla had delivered well over 95,000 cars and thus reached its best value.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. For this he has to produce six-digit numbers in the current and next quarter years. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is required, but here the profit margins are small. Despite the boom, there were ultimately losses.
US budget dispute: Renew only one bridge financing
The new financial year will begin in the United States on 1 October without a proper budget.The Senate will be following the House of Representatives on Thursday and will have a transitional funding until 21 November.
Although the American Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August on an increase in the spending ceilings for the financial years 2020 and 2021, the United States has once again no plans for expenditure before the new fiscal year beginning on 1 October. The Senate has followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and has decided on a transitional financing (Continuous Resolution, CR) until 21 November. Without such a decision it would have come to a Shutdown at midnight, a division of the federal administration. President Trump still has to put the decision into force.
Shutdown turned off
In the meantime, the federal administration will be financed at the level and according to the priorities of the expenditure plans for the financial year to end on Monday, 2019. This is because the Congress has not been able to agree in time on the 12 spending laws that allocate the funds to the various departments and authorities. Therefore, the federal administration cannot benefit from the $1.4 Bio. extended expenditure framework for the new financial year.
The Democrats have completed ten of the twelve laws in the House of Representatives, where they have the majority, but the spending laws reflect priorities of the Democrats, who have little chance in the Senate dominated by the Republicans. Conversely, the Senate also has more or less prepared ten of the twelve spending plans which are hardly majority capable.
In the Senate, the Republicans are apparently trying to force $12 billion for the construction of the walls, one of the major priorities of President Trump. Democrats interfered with the wall construction plans and their financing, which is actually intended for other military buildings and projects. The dispute over the construction of the walls had already escalated in December 2018 and had led to a 35-day Shutdown.
On the wall building the spirits separate
At the moment it is unclear how the parties intend to approach this question. More likely than agreeing on all 12 spending laws over the next seven weeks, there is an extension of transitional financing beyond 21 November. Also, a Shutdown is not excluded at this time.
Against the background of Congress' continued inability to agree on the twelve spending laws in due time, and the resulting risk of a Shutdown gain ideas for automation of the process of popularity. Template p. 1877 to avoid Shutdowns would automatically continue the funding of the federal administration at the previous year's level, stop the travel activities of parliamentarians and stop their wages until the new annual spending plans are submitted.
France allows artificial fertilization for lesbians and singles
In France, the artificial fertilization of women and lesbians will be open in the future: the National Assembly of Paris voted by a large majority for a bill by the government, which allows all women to use in vitro fertilization, which should significantly increase the demand for anonymous seed donations.
The presentation still needs the approval of the Senate. In the three-day emotional debate critics in the right camp had warned that in the future numerous children without father could grow up. The French Bishops Conference is also against the innovation.
The new regulation is the core component of a bioethics law, which the health minister Agnès Buzyn defended as a chance for society. It depicts the modern family in which children with only one parent or with homosexual parents are born. After their idea, the cost of artificial fertilization for all women is to be borne by social security.
Fertilisation with sperm from dead husband further prohibited
In Belgium, Spain and the United Kingdom, the artificial fertilisation \"post-mortem\" was allowed. In Germany, in the past, there were cases in which women complained in vain about the release of the sperm of a deceased person. The opponents of the incident in Paris argued that a child so witnessed would then bear a \"especially serious fate\"
On the other hand, many members of the La République en Marche government party (The Republic in Movement, LREM) of President Emmanuel Macron and members of the opposition had expressed themselves in favour of artificial fertilization with the sperm of the deceased partner. They stressed that a widow would experience a “double grief” if her husband’s death left her unfulfilled child’s desire.
The initiators of the now failed amendment consider it unfair that a widow may be fertilized with the sperm of an unknown, but not with her own partner.
Until now, artificial fertilization in France is permitted only heterosexual couples who cannot bear children. They must be married or live together for at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in the summer that the limbation continued to be prohibited.
In Germany, artificial fertilization is theoretically open to all women - for single or lesbian couples, it is still often difficult.
Compensation for climate: Calls after air service charge for unis are becoming louder
A lot is being flown at universities. That is why the country wants to have a climate levy there in the future, too. Rectors say they have no money for it. But now they are under pressure internally.
The universities should also limit themselves to flying. Photo: dpa/Julian Street School
The debate on a climate levy on flights from universities and universities, which was delayed before the summer break, is remedied. After the Landesrectorenconference had scepticalally responded to a corresponding advance from the green-black coalition, the plans now receive support from the universities. In a joint declaration, the doctoral students of six Baden-Württemberg universities and an educational university advocate for compensation of service flights. This is the first step - urgent need - at the same time, there must be a broad debate on the avoidability of flights, it is in their opinion. The initial Kabinett decision, originally planned in July, is still on ice, because the CDU has still not approved the presentation of the greens.
Russia again captures North Korean fishermen
According to the FSB intelligence service, the arrested people are supposed to have fished illegally in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. At that time there was a shift between the border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and a North Korean were injured, and the fishermen later suffered serious injuries. This time there were no casualties, it was said.
Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages. The North Korean fishermen were therefore on their way to Russian high-waters, where Russia's coastal guard runs according to its own data to protect its marine biological resources patrols.
Decapitated 30,000 ink fish
During the re-testing, 30,000 inkfish had been discovered and seized on the boats. In addition, three fishing and two motor boats were seized and brought to Nagodka and Posjet at Vladivostok.
Russia's fisheries authorities had not issued fishing licences to North Koreans this year, even after complaints by local entrepreneurs. Thousands of North Korea fishermen have already been arrested there for some time this year.
The head of the Association of Russian Fisheries Companies in the Far Eastern Region of Primorje, Georgi Martynow, recently also charged high ecological damage by North Korean fishermen. They fished with narrowly meshed synthetic nets banned in Russia. With these also small creatures would be taken out of the sea. Furthermore, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea, where they would take 200 years to be destroyed.
In the future, only 18,000 more: USA decreases Asylum upper limit
The largest nation in history: Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police representatives in the White House.
The richest country of the earth is shooting against those seeking protection: As the Foreign Ministry in Washington confirms, the upper limit for the legal withdrawal of refugees is further reduced. In the future, the majority of those who are under threat will receive asylum.
The US government wants to reduce the already historically low limit for the reception of new refugees again. In the economic year 2020, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, a maximum of 18,000 people are to be left in the country, as explained by the US Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In the now almost completed marketing year, the limit is still 30,000 people.
The government of President Donald Trump has drastically reduced the willingness to welcome protection seekers from all over the world in recent years. Barack Obama's predecessor government has had far higher admission limits.
The leveled upper limit of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the introduction of the U.S. refugee program in 1980. Nevertheless, the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs referred to the US as “the most merciful and generous nation in history,” a formulation that is strongly reminiscent of the language use of the U.S. President.
A “responsible handling” of refugees aimed at allowing refugees to return to their home countries to help rebuild them, Trump explained. For his hard course in migration policy, he received a lot of attention from followers, but there is also massive criticism.
A major point of contention is the border with Mexico, which Trump wants to shut down. To finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had imposed the national emergency. Whether there is a temporal link between the current measure and the current domestic political developments in the US capital is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure because of the Selenskyj affair and a possibly threatening official detention process.
According to the U.S. government's description of the foreign office, the future focus will be on the inclusion of two refugee groups: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the U.S. military in the country and are thus in danger, as the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reveals. Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, on the other hand, are expected to capture a maximum of 1500 refugees.
The United States wants to achieve that, in particular, people from this northern triangle are applying for asylum in other countries in Central America. Against this background, the United States has only concluded with Guatemala and now also with El Salvador and Honduras migration agreements in order to curb immigration at the U.S. southern border with Mexico.
Court orders the release of Orang-Utan from Zoo
An Orang Utan female has been transferred from Buenos Aires to a human monkey in the U.S. at the request of the Argentine judiciary in the former zoo in Buenos Aires. Born in Rostock Zoo in 1986, Sandra was granted the rights of a non-human person, so her release was compulsory. The animal was brought to Dallas by direct flight on Thursday evening - not as a passenger, but in the cargo room, as lawyer Andrés Gil Domínguez explained.
Since the 53 kilograms of heavy mansaffin is not capable of adapting to life in the wilderness, it is intended to live in the open air of the Center for Great Apes in Florida. 21 more orang-utans and 31 chimpanzees are already housed there, among them \"Bubbles\" formerly pet of Popstar Michael Jackson. Before entering Florida, however, a 40-day quarantine in the Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita has to endure in the U.S. state of Kansas.
After her birth in Rostock, Sandra spent several years in the former Ruhr-Zoo in Gelsenkirchen before moving to Buenos Aires in 1995. The 2014 process of animal conservation efforts for “Sandras” has contributed to the conversion of the Buenos Aires Zoo into an eco park. By 2023, a research and education site will be created to preserve biodiversity.
Record for Swiss extreme climbers: 550 meters in 46 minutes
The Extrembergeiger Dani Arnold has succeeded a new hussar ride on the almost 3000 metre high Big Tin in the Italian Alps.
Without a net, double floor or other tools, the Swiss forced the 550-metre-high North Wall of the Great Tin in a new record time.
Dressed with jeans, T-shirt and only supported by absolute dizziness, Arnold needed 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the climb. He thus offered the old best brand by almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now record holder in the Free Solo Speed on four of the six most important European northern walls.
Nike benefits from new online marketing strategy
Despite the trade conflict with China, U.S. sports product manufacturer Nike has recorded a significant increase in profits. Net profits rose to $1.4 billion in the past quarter (at EUR 1.3 billion). This is 25 percent more than in the previous year, as reported by the Group on Tuesday. For this reason, the new marketing strategy “Nike Direct” with which the Adidas competitor turns directly to its customers online.
The sales increased to 10.7 billion dollars in the three-month period until the end of August. The most powerful were the Nike sales figures, with a plus of 22 percent in China. Thus, the company from Beaverton in the U.S. state of Oregon also benefited from its approach to directly addressing consumers via the Internet or smartphone apps.
Chief Financial Officer Andy Campion announced that with strategic investments, Nike will continue to advance the \"digital transformation\" of the sports product manufacturer and thus expand its competitive advantage. The investors responded with joy to the quarterly figures - the sports product manufacturer's shares increased by more than five percent.
Lifelong study ban on racism in Italy
Because of racist comments about football pro Juan Jesus of AS Rome, the association from the Italian capital has imposed a lifelong ban on a fan. The defenseman who came from Brazil had been harassed by the fan on Instagram. Jesus then published the private news and urged his club to take action. @officialasroma You already know what you should do with such a fan. #NoToRacism. Be proud to be who I am - wrote the 28-year-old who has been playing with AS Rome since 2016.
The club responded on late Thursday. He reported the fan's account to Instagram and the police. Furthermore, the Roma supporters would never have to go to a game of the club again, the club wrote on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in Italian football. Regularly, Italian fans are scanning racist insults against black players of rival teams. “We can’t have racism in society or in sports. In Italy, the situation has not improved, and this is very serious. You have to identify and throw the responsible people out of the stadiums - Fifa President Gianni Infantino had said on the weekend. As a result of the speech, racist singing was performed at the First League party between Atalanta Bergamo and AC Florence on the last Sunday.
But there had also been discussions about the supporters of Juventus Turin. The Italian authorities have now committed 38 rival fans of record champion Juventus Turin with stadium bans. Four of them are expected to stop entering the stadium for a period of ten years, the police told them. For the rest there are therefore prohibitions of four to seven years.
The fans are associated with ongoing investigations against twelve leaders of ultra-fan groups in the context of Juventus. Among other things, the twelve are accused of heavy extortion, money laundering and private violence. The club had put the investigations into role with an advertisement last year.
The Ultra leaders are supposed to be behind the black trade with tickets according to Italian media reports. They would have controlled the ticket trade for the fan curve \"militaryly\" and would have pressured Juventus employees to get on cheaper cards.
Generation Z: Are they really different from Generation Y?
Millennials are narcissistic, the Generation Z is political - all of the years are covered with gruesome names. If you look more closely, the awards are full of contradictions. So how well do these labels describe the individual life feelings of young people?
“The crabs are coming - this call officially started on September 21st at the Gucheng Lake in Gaochun, with the opening event of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival, as announced by the Department for Public Relations of the Nanjing-Gaochun District Committee.
Gaochun, which forms the southern foothills of Nanjing in Jiangsu Province, is one of the national environmental zones. The city is the first international Slow City - in China and here is also the Chinese seat of the international Slow City Movement. The city has ecologically ideal conditions with a mix of “30 percent mountains, 20 percent water areas and 50 percent fields - The great natural environment of Gaochun offers its inhabitants all the conditions to become rich.
In the early 1990s, the people in Gaochun started her crab breeding. In the course of time, the crab industry has developed into a well-informed industry that has been responsible for high incomes and has become an important part of Gaochun’s economic development. In recent years, Gaochun has actively sought to develop a large, ecological and scientific development of hermitage, as well as a technology-supported hermitage. And the city has been concerned about promoting more efficiency in agriculture and the income of farmers.
In recent years, Gaochun has put forward a reform on the “distribution of power, optimization of administration and public administration services” and carefully established the service network for “approvals under a roof, a team for law enforcement, a network for services, a platform for lending. This aims to optimize the environment for approvals, for services and for development.
Gaochun makes full use of the development zone and its position as an international “Slow City”, as signposts for intelligent high-end production companies, companies for biomedical and medical technology, for energy storage and environmental protection, for the cultural and health sector, as well as for organic farming that are leading in the “3+2” area. At the same time, Gaochun has promoted the construction of a national tourism zone, all areas of comprehensive tourism and tourist routes of national importance. In this context, Gaochun’s ecological and cultural resources have been integrated, the state of the civil services buildings and for public service, the areas of tourism and tourism developed vigorously and the development of cultural tourism at high quality. It is worth looking forward to the future of Gaochun.
Conflict between Iran and USA: Ruhani speaks of the end of sanctions - Trump contradicts
Following his return from the UN General Assembly, Iranian President Hassan Ruhani spoke of an alleged offer by the United States to abolish sanctions. In return for talks with Tehran's leadership, Ruhani stated on his official website.
U.S. President Donald Trump, however, contradicted the Iranian colleague on Twitter: “I wanted Iran to remove the sanctions imposed on him so that there could be a meeting. I said, of course, no,
Ruhani describes the case this way: Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron had been present in New York and had insisted that a meeting be held. “And America says that I raise the sanctions - complemented Ruhani. The kind of punishment that should be ended has stood for debate. “And they have clearly said that we shall impose all sanctions,” he said.
However, this incident did not take place in an acceptable manner, criticised Ruhani. In view of the criminal measures in force and the poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure, no one could predict the outcome of negotiations.
At the beginning of the week, Chancellor Angela Merkel met Ruhani in New York. Background was the hope of Europeans saving the nuclear agreement negotiated with Russia and China with Iran, which is to stop the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. France's President Emmanuel Macron, like Merkel, had expressed the hope that Ruhani would meet with US President Donald Trump.
Heavy earthquake near Istanbul - Almost 200 aftershocks
After Western Turkey was shaken by two earthquakes within a short period of time, the fear of a disaster grew. 34 people were injured during the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the earthquake in the morning there have been nearly 200 aftershocks, Turkish Vice-President Fuat Octay said on Friday. This has increased the concern about a disaster.
14 schools in Istanbul had been closed for safety reasons. Hundreds of buildings were thus damaged. The 5.8 earthquake had shaken the Marmara region in front of Istanbul on Thursday and caused panic in the millions of metropolises. Now the government wants to use a Commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, Octay announced.
Over the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for quakes, said Istanbul's mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. In the city itself, the latent danger is ignored again and again. Every year, poorly constructed homes are being stormed, among other things, by the many smaller earthquakes that regularly shake Istanbul.
City planners such as the well-known architect Mücella Yapici have for years warned that large open areas registered in the centre as a refuge are long growing. Only on the 20th anniversary of the Gölcük earthquake in August, the Istanbul Civil Engineering Chamber had warned that an estimated one million buildings in Istanbul were not earthquake-proof.
The epicenter of the earthquake of Thursday was located in Marmarameer in front of the district of Silivri and in about seven kilometers deep, as told by the disaster protection authority Afad. A small aftershock caused even greater panic on the streets a few minutes later.
The Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu reported on Twitter that injuries or damage had not been reported at first. The TRT state transmitter showed people who were panicking from the houses. Students were brought out of the buildings in the district of Silivri for security reasons. Some students cried, as shown on pictures.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly dangerous. Under the Marmara Sea lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian disorder that marks the border between the Eurasian and the Anatolian Earth Plate. Turkey is repeatedly shaken by earthquakes. One of the most deadly was the earthquake in 1999 near Istanbul. At that time more than 17,000 people were killed.
Researchers fear that an earthquake of the strength of 7.1 to 7.4 could threaten. But when it comes to the earthquake, it is unclear. During the earthquake on Thursday, the west of the country and Istanbul met again.
Companies design emergency plans, private people have so-called Go-Bags with everything needed to be packed in addition to house doors, and schools teach children how to behave when the Earth wakes up. When the next big quake comes, be unclear.
After his return from New York, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that eight people had been injured. Some buildings had suffered slight damage. Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu followed the developments of Istanbul's disaster coordination centre (Akom). According to his information, two minarettes of mosques collapsed in the districts of Avcilar and Sariyer.
Warning about follow-up in Istanbul
In the social networks, many users report panic. Buildings wobbled. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Telephone lines had been interrupted. It was harder than that of Tuesday, a user writes. The chief of the Turkish Red Halfmond, Kerem Klinik, warned of the aftershocks via Twitter. He called on people to stay away from buildings that had suffered visible damage.
According to CNN Turkey, the date of the tremor is given at 13.59 (local time). Only a few minutes after the first quake, there was a afterlife indicated with a strength of 4.0 on the Richter scale, according to CNN Turkey.
Only on Tuesday had an earthquake of strength 4.6 shook the Turkish Marmara region - it was to be felt to Istanbul. Also its epicenter has been located in the Marmara Sea to the west of the millions of metropolises, the disaster protection authority Afad announced on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that hit headlines this Tuesday: Pakistan was also hit by a severe earthquake.
Researchers believe that there could be a catastrophic earthquake in Istanbul sooner or later - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that it will eventually discharge itself - and cause massive damage.
Earthquake researcher Sükrü Ersoy reckons that the earthquake is now a warning. As a result, it is more likely, he said to CNN Türk. “This could be the signs to a greater earthquake, according to Ersoy as the transmitter. “Before or later, the great earthquake will also occur,
A few weeks ago there had been an incident - the earthquake caused great anxiety in Istanbul as well. In Albania there had also been a violent earthquake only a few days ago - there were 68 casualties. This year, too, the Earth had been quaked at Lake Constance.
Parliament: New fuel in Ukraine
Two brilliant documents provide new ignition in the Ukraine case for possible abuse of power by U.S. President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible official defence process, the US Democrats see themselves strengthened: the complaint filed by an anonymous notifier about Trump and his controversial phone call with the Ukrainian presidents raised important points of evidence for investigations against the president. Trump himself sees himself once more as a victim of a \"hex hunt\" - He also doubted the whistleblower's credibility.
USA: Air passenger locked in toilet by United Airlines - Flyer redirected
Because a passenger had been locked in the board toilet, a flight had been redirected by United Airlines. The toilet door had been blocked from Washington to San Francisco during the flight in 1554, the airline reported according to US media.
In the case of an out-of-plane landing on Wednesday evening (local time) in Denver, the woman could finally be freed from the tight cabin. About an hour had been locked in it, US media wrote to other passengers. To continue the flight towards San Francisco, the passengers had to change the machine.
A video on the Internet, which according to US media is intended to come from Flight 1554, shows how several people are trying to free the woman. “We are currently working on opening the door, Ma’am. We are getting you out soon, Okay,” says a man in it. The airline apologized to all passengers. It was obvious first that the woman was receiving compensation.
The cockroache: inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit-Roman
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with the whole Brexit chaos? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is unrecognizable.
Inspired by Franz Kafka's famous narrative \"The Transformation\", the British successful author Ian McEwan (71) wrote a book on Brexit chaos in the UK.
The novel \"Die Kakerlake\" (Original: \"The Cockroach\") will appear in German on November 27th, the Diogenes Verlag (Zurich) informed. In it is about the transformation of a man named \"Jim Sams\" who was ignored or hated in his earlier life, but is now at once the most powerful man in the UK. He sees it as his mission to put the will of the people into action and is determined to let nothing and no one stop.
McEwan was quoted as saying: \"When Parliament is closed, so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment when ministers lie shamelessly as the Soviet leaders once did, when Brexiteers in high positions are experiencing the catastrophe of a no-deal precisely - then a writer has to wonder what he can do. There is only one answer to this: write - by McEwan was only in the spring of the novel \"machines like me\" about artificial intelligence.
Kafka's 1915 story, published for the first time, is written by Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning and sees himself, looks, looks, and eventually is excluded from family and society, and finally dies. \"Ian McEwan bows down to Kafka to describe a world that stands head on, it was called by the Diogenes Verlag.
EU invests 9.5 million euros in Austria's rail infrastructure
11.200 Wagons in Austria and Hungary receive whisper brakes to reduce noise pollution through freight trains. In addition, sections of rail connections between Graz and Györ and Wiener Neustadt and Sopron are upgraded and electrified.
This is to make travel more comfortable and reduce CO2 emissions according to the EU authorities.
Thomas Cook: All trips cancelled until 31 October
The German travel operator Thomas Cook cancelled all trips until 31 October 2019 one day after his insolvency application. Travels could not be made for insolvency reasons, the company announced on Thursday evening.
There are also bookings of the brands Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Reisen, ÖGER TOURS, Bucher Reisen and Air Marin, which are already paid or fully paid. As it stands for travel from 1 November 2019 onwards, the company left open. In agreement with the insolvency insurance, the further procedure will be examined, it was called.
Thomas Cook in Germany had been in the Sog of the British Mother Group and had applied for insolvency on Wednesday. The company, which includes Neckermann Reisen, Öger Tours and Bucher Reisen, employs about 2000 people in Germany.
Insurer wants to transfer hotels money from now on
On the other hand, as of this Friday, hotels abroad, which are currently home to Thomas Cook, are supposed to receive money from Zurich insurance. Payments to the hotels are, according to Zurich, linked to the condition that holidaymakers are no longer asked for extra payments.
On the basis of booking information and separate invoices, the hotels in the resorts are now expected to receive 50 percent of the outstanding payments, as a Zurich spokesman from the German Press Agency said. “This applies immediately and subject to the condition that Thomas-Cook travelers from these hotels are not immediately requested or otherwise required for individual payment of hotel bills,” said Bernd Engelien.
As a result, the insurance responded to reports from hotel guests who had been forced to pay their own accommodations on site. Some had to put more than 1000 euros on the table. The German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centrals criticized this.
How many hotels are affected will be coordinated with the insolvent travel provider on Friday, said the insurance spokesperson. According to Thursday, 70,000 Thomas-Cook holidaymakers from Germany were on their way. Zurich Germany has secured holiday and return of the Thomas-Cook customer.
Insolvence managers want to try to continue the three Thomas Cook companies in Germany and find a future solution.
However, the disbursements announced to hotels by Zurich insurance only help the travellers who are still on the move. For Thomas-Cook customers who want to fly on vacation, it looks bad. On the late Thursday evening, the company told us that all the trips would be cancelled until 31 October. This was also true for such reservations already paid.
As it stands for travel at the start of November 1, 2019, the company left open. In line with the insolvency insurance, the further procedure will be checked, it is called. Basically, insurance Zurich is also responsible for these cases. The sale of new travel is stopped. dpa
The company refers to the insurer Zurich, which can be represented by the company Kaera. Customers could be informed on the Kaera website about the possibility of refunding the travel price and claim their claims via a web form.
Prince Harry destroys explosive mine in Angola
For a long time, Prince Harry has continued Lady Diana's engagement. In Africa, he now walks directly on the tracks of his mother.
With a blue split protection vest, the British Prince Harry in Angola has fired and destroyed a explosive mine.
Close to a camp of British Halo Trust at the village of Dirico, on Friday morning before running TV cameras, he created the ignition circle. At a safe distance, the explosives exploded in the savanna landscape without causing damage. Although the Halo Trust alone destroyed more than 100,000 relics of the decade-long bloody conflict in the African country, there are still more than 1000 minefields that threaten the population.
After that, on the fifth day of his African trip, Harry wanted to walk directly on the tracks of his mother Diana (1961-1997). With the same jumpmaster, who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to go back the way she went at that time. The pictures on which Princess Diana went through a cleared minefield in 1997 were also around the world. She also demonstrated support for the Halo Trust.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a ten-day African trip since Monday, which began in the South African tourist metropolis Cape Town.
Stocking Brexit negotiations: The danger of a no-deal remains acute
Premier Boris Johnson had clearly stated: With him there will not be a third drop in Brexit negotiations guaranteed, but what statements are already of eternal duration with the polarizing British. The recent ruling of the Supreme Court in Great Britain floats like a damocles sword above the Blondschaff. His suspension of Parliament, in order to be able to continue its Brexit course until the date of departure, was cancelled at the beginning of this week. And a law passed by Parliament required Johnson to continue the bilateral talks in case of failed negotiations with the EU until 31 October.
Boris Johnson still thinks deal is possible
But the pressure does not seem to pass by Johnson. Meanwhile, when visiting a hospital, he indicated that in case of non-agreement, he supported an extension of the negotiations by the end of October:
You know, we're gonna keep the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU by 31 October.
And best with a deal. I'm cautiously optimistic that this works.
And the time is running away from the Brexit traffickers in Brussels. The EU and the British negotiators have had time to prevent Britain's withdrawal from the European Union without any agreement. However, even the recent talks have again failed. An agreement until the end of October seems rather difficult to imagine. If the British Prime Minister does not break the law, a further shift in the date of departure is in force. The opposition is not true to the words of the Prime Minister. She fears that Johnson could somehow enforce Brexit in case of a no-deal.
US authorities: Other deaths by e-cigarettes
The number of deaths related to the use of e-cigarettes in the United States has increased to twelve. In addition, there have been 805 confirmed and probable injuries in this context, the US Health Authority has informed CDC. According to a study in the New England Journal of Medicine, there have already been more than 900 affected, around 500 confirmed. The cause of lung damage is still completely unclear. No similar increase in lung damage has been known in Europe. The complaints seem to be limited to users in the US.
The fear of new protests in Egypt is growing
Mohammed Ali's videos have been divided into online networks millions of times. The Spanish builder and actor has called for a \"people's revolution\" for today's Friday. He has called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military, which accuse critics of corruption and mismanagement. Ali expects mass announcements with a million participants in central locations of the country.
The security authorities in any case are alarmed. In the centre of Cairo there was already an increased police presence. Several subway stations remained closed, streets around the central Tahrir square were locked. Even in recent days the police had reinforced their road controls and partially searched pedestrians' cell phones for news and photos related to the protests.
On 20 September the demonstrators also gathered around the Tahrir Square.
Last weekend there had been protests with hundreds of participants in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura. There had been no such open protest in Egypt for years. According to the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW), almost 2000 people were arrested for the past week. Many of them were arbitrarily arrested - only because they were in the wrong place for a time, HRW told them to appeal to lawyers.
The organization also criticized censorship in the North African country. Therefore, the government in Cairo blocks websites and online services in order to prevent further protests against al-Sisi. Since 2013, the general has ruled the country since the collapse of democratically elected Islamist president Mohammed Mursi. Thousands of Islamists, government opponents, bloggers and activists have been imprisoned and partially condemned in recent years.
‘Ocean Change’: Arved Fuchs of Greenland expedition back
The polar researcher Arved Fuchs returned on Friday from his Greenland expedition. Upon arriving at the port of Hamburg, he was welcomed, among other things, by the skipper Boris Herrmann, who had brought climate activist Greta Thunberg across the Atlantic with the race yacht “Malizia”.
With a team of scientists in the past few months, Fuchs has investigated and documented the consequences of global warming on its sailing ship, Dagmar Aaen, on the coasts of Iceland and Greenland.
The Fridays for Future movement was a blessing, the polar researcher said. He had been waiting for years for the young generation to speak up. One knew for decades that the Earth was warming. Yet many acted as if it were a planet B.
“What happens on the sea often takes place under public exclusion,” Fuchs said. He and his team wanted to inform the people about the effects of global warming and the waste of the seas. During the expedition, among other things, a drone of Greenland’s glacier ice had been measured and fished with nets for microplastics, it was said.
The polar researcher from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the “Seadevcon Maritime Award” during the Hamburg Climate Week. “For all of us, the survival of the oceans is a great example of Arved Fuchs,” said skipper Boris Herrmann at the award ceremony. “He is a witness to the changes that have been made in the Arctic in recent decades.
Teaurs Spaghetti in Rome: Tourists paid 430 Euros for noodles
430 Euro for two plates of spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant not far from Engelsburg in Rome: This seemed to be too much for two Japanese tourists. The invoice with 80 Euros drink money included was paid by the two women, but they posted the receipt on Facebook, which triggered hot reactions.
“These cases are damaging to Rome’s reputation. We call on the police to investigate whether this is a fraud,” asked a spokesman from Federagit, the association of travel guides in Rome, according to the Roman daily Il Messaggero (Friday Edition).
The owner of the restaurant was promptly responding. The Japanese women had ordered not only spaghetti, but also fresh fish, the local owner justifies themselves. However, this is not to be taken from the bill. Also, a drink fee of up to 20 percent of the invoice was normal, said the host.
A call in Ukraine, and everything is broken? U.S. President Donald Trump, after the turbulent revelations of the past few days, may actually be confronted with an official detention procedure, the Democrats want to examine this with their investigation at the House of Representatives as soon as possible - the speech is from weeks until a decision is taken.
At the beginning of the scandal, the phone call with Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj is supposed to be the start of the scandal. The allegation of the Whistleblower, who has finally brought the debate about national security and about the United States democracy with his complaint to the public, is monstrous: the President has abused the power of his office to instrumentalize the government of another country for an influence on the election of 2020. He has exploited Ukraine's dependence on it and has so forced it to become active against a political opponent.
The core of this project is also to be understood in the now published consultation with Selenskyj, although it does not reflect the full wording. However, the telephone call of July 25 is only an episode of a much larger history, in which center next to Trump stands above all his personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
From the public's point of view in May 2019, the story begins when the New York Times of Rudy Giulianis reports on travel plans to Ukraine. He wants to meet with the president Selenskyj in Kiev, and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions are delicate. “We don't mix ourselves into an election, we mix ourselves into an investigation of what we have the right to do,” he says to the newspaper. One could think that it is inappropriate, but “there is nothing illegal,” Giuliani wants to be pursued in Ukraine, for which there is hardly any basis, “because this information will be very, very helpful to my clients and could be exposed as helpful to my government,”
The lawyer and former New York mayor seems to have been infected with right-wing fantasies, which are fixed on Trump's opponent in the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton had conspired with actors in Ukraine, then critics said to construct an occasion for Russia's investigations into the US. This accusation was never taken seriously.
This is precisely the investigation about how Trump will speak so prominently on the phone with Selenskyj in July. The version of Giulianis and the President is: The former Vice-President and currently prospective candidate for the presidential candidate of the Democrats, Joe Biden, as Ukraine's representative of the Obama government, has pushed for the dismissal of the then Ukrainian general prosecutor Wiktor Schokin. In order to stop the investigation of the gas company responsible for him, in whose supervisory board his son Hunter Biden was active.
In fact, the process was somewhat different. When Joe Biden demanded that the Ukrainian general prosecutor had to go, the investigations against the gas company had already been completed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected by it. Schokin was also strongly accused of corrupt gestures himself, the U.S. government was not the only Western partner who pushed for his release. Furthermore, the Obama government even expressly supported the investigation against the company.
Interferences with Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp: Social media are down
Users worldwide report massive disruptions in Instagram and Facebook. Consequently, Germany, the UK and Spain are affected. The website allerstörden.de reports users that Facebook has not been charging since about 15.30 a.m. Also Instagram reports the error message that content could not be loaded. Also, whatsapp seems to be affected by the disorder, if not to the same extent so far.
Instagram and Co. frequently affected by disorders
It's not the first massive crash this year. Already in March and July the services were out for several hours. And as in the previous cases, users also use twitter this time mainly to make their trouble.
Polish scientist saved in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists have been rescued from the Antarctic ice from the Chilean Air Force. They were on a boat and several miles away from their base when their engine failed. They were lucky in the accident - less than an hour needed by the Chilean rescue helicopter for storage.
Eduardo Mosquera, Commander of the 4th Chilean Air Brigade:
“At 9:30 a.m. we received the message, at ten a.m. we started, and we were good 20 minutes spàter over the hose boat,
Poland has been running Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station on King George Island since 1977, 19 scientists are working there. The frozen researchers have certainly been brought back to their research station.
Attention: Smartphone NOT wirelessly charge
Practical but harmful
Inductive technology via Qi standard is extremely practical, but should not be used anyway.
As several new smartphones have recently come onto the market, which support wireless charging and sell themselves very well - all in advance the new iPhone-11 models, we want to recall a study from the beginning of July. The wireless charging of mobile devices is extremely practical, but not necessarily recommended.
Higher temperature adds battery
Researchers warn against the wireless charging of smartphones. According to the findings of the University of Warwick, this is extremely harmful for the devices. The reason for this is the significantly larger heat development. If you load a mobile phone normally by cable, the battery rises to 27 degrees within three hours. In the case of wireless charging, the researchers have even measured over 30 degrees at the perfect alignment of the smartphone on the charging pad. If the phone is slightly next to the coil, the temperature increases. Furthermore, the watt strength of the loading pad increases, which in turn drives the power consumption to the height.
Capacity and life
According to the researchers, the temperature for the durability of batteries is a crucial factor. Each degree plays a role. When charging at higher temperatures, the battery not only consumes capacity, but also does not last as long. Thus, the lifetime is reduced. The researchers therefore recommend that the smartphone be always charged by cable. Since an battery exchange with modern smartphones is always associated with high costs, this should be a helpful tip. Finally, Apple has increased the cost of battery exchange even once more - for all iPhones.
Practical
The technology is extremely convenient:Simply put the device on a suitable loading pad - these are already already installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is charged without any annoying cable salad and heavy plug fumes. As Qi (standing for inductive energy transmission) has a global standard, with which Apple is extremely involved, there are hardly any restrictions. However, according to the researchers, the technology should only be applied in exceptional cases.
Everest-Stau photographer: 13 Eight-thousanders in six months
According to its own data, a Nepalese mountaineer has climbed 13 of the 14 highest mountains in the world within just six months. Nirmal Purja (36) reached the top of Manaslu in Nepal and thus set up a record, informed its expedition organizer.
The former soldier wants to climb all 14 eight-thousands in seven months. Purja calls his project “Mission Possible - He has already made international headlines: from him comes a picture of mountaineers who are standing on Mount Everest Snake in spring.
The image of the mass rank triggered a debate about stronger security measures on the 8848 meters high mountain and highest peak on earth. In May, eleven climbers had died during the climb within a few days.
A problem for Purja could be the climb of the 14th eight-thousander: Chinese authorities are currently blocking the Xixabangma mountain in Tibet. For this reason, among other things, it is called bad weather. At the beginning of the week, Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal's government wanted to speak to China to allow it to rise.
Four dead elephants discovered in Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals was also a tenacious elephant cow, a police spokesman told us on Friday. “We suspect that the elephants were poisoned,
The four cadaver were found in a protected area near the famous and many tourists visited former rock fortress Sigiriya. According to the police spokesman, the animals were probably between 15 and 25 years old. An autopsy was arranged to detect the cause of death.
In Sri Lanka nearly 200 elephants are killed each year. The perpetrators are often farmers whose land the animals had previously kept themselves harmless. At the same time about 50 people are killed every year by elephants. This usually happens when the animals move through villages built near their habitat.
According to Sri Lankan estimates, only about 7,000 elephants live. Their death is theoretically the death penalty.
British oil tankers leave Iran
The British oil tanker \"Stena Impero\" leaves the port city of Bandar Abbas more than two months after its capture by Iran. This was announced by the Maritime Office Bandar Abbas, according to the news agency IRNA. The Iranian revolution guards had set the tanker under British flag on 19 July under the threat of disregarding the rules of sea law in the Persian Gulf.
Management by Thomas Cook in the critique
The competent Economic Committee of the Lower House wants to examine extensively the pleasure of the travel giant Thomas Cook. It is intended to address the salary packages of the Board of Directors as well as the question why the British government did not want to contribute financially to the surviving company. \"Our interest is to take care of the company as well as to control it by external book reviewers - said committee chairman Rachel Reeves in London. \"Provely we have to do so with a bad example of management greed,
According to experts, genes are overestimated at intestinal cancer risk
The role of genes in familial increased intestinal cancer risk has apparently been overestimated so far. Researchers from the German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ) Heidelberg have concluded in a recent study. Other risk factors such as family eating habits are likely to be more severe than previously assumed. This has consequences for calculations of individual intestinal cancer risk, the DKFZ scientists stress.
Elon Musk causes Tesla's shares to rise
Musk wrote this in an email to Tesla employees published on Thursday (local time) by the industry blog Electrek. The demand was strong, so Tesla could book 110,000 orders, it continued in Musks Newsletter.
The challenge is to quickly get the cars to the customership. In addition, Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible to the quarter end.
Investors liked the information: Tesla's shares went out of trade with a plus of more than six percent. As strong as the price has not been achieved for almost four months. In the second quarter Tesla had delivered over 95,000 cars and thus reached its best value.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360'000 to 400'000 cars. For this, six-digit numbers must come in the current and next quarter years. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is required, but here the profit margins are small. Despite the boom, there were losses.
Will British government bypass Brexit law? Johnson refraining
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is concerned about whether he is looking for ways to circumvent the last law adopted by Parliament against an unregulated Brexit. On a question of this kind, he simply told journalists on Friday that his government would adhere to existing law.
The law provides that the government must apply for a shift in the exit date, should not have reached an agreement with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticises this as a \"capitulation law\" that makes negotiations with the EU difficult.
On Thursday, former British Prime Minister John Major had expressed the suspicion that Johnson could try to use \"political Shicans\" to circumvent the law. Johnson could use a procedural trick that would shift the law's entry into force after the EU exit.
Johnson said he wanted to reach a treaty with the European Union. “We are confident to leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is by agreement,” he said.
Iran appears to drive up uranium enrichment
Iran's President Hassan Rohani has raised the pressure on the European contractual partners in the dispute over the rescue of the historic nuclear agreement. \"The European States are sorry to show inability or lack willingness when it comes to concrete actions, said Rohani on Thursday at a press conference at the United Nations General Assembly in New York. In the event that they do not stand by their promises, he \"further steps\" were in view of the agreements of the difficult negotiated agreement of 2015.
The background is the conflict around the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, which, as a counter-performance, contained the commitment to Tehran to normalize economic relations. In 2018, the US justly stepped out of the agreement to force Iran with \"maximum pressure\" into a change of course in the post-host policy considered aggressive. President Donald Trump's government intends to negotiate a new agreement with tougher conditions and now again imposes severe sanctions against Tehran. Iran finally responded with a resurgence of the limited uranium enrichment in the Treaty.
The International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic has now also used or prepared at least for use the centrifuges installed in early September. According to IAEA, Iran also prepares the construction of more than 300 additional centrifuges.
Perhaps the Europeans were not willing to carry their part of the deal and therefore left the Iranians alone with the costs and burden of U.S. sanctions, suspected Rohani, but there would still be further talks, which would hopefully be a solution.
Rohani continues to dispute Iran's involvement in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, after an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia, the joint situation changed in mid-September: Germany, France and the United Kingdom followed the US estimate on Monday that Tehran was responsible for the attack. Originally, the Huthi rebels in Yemen, supported by Iran, had known themselves about the attack, but what the US was judged to be false confession. “We have nothing to do with it, Rohani confirmed his position on Wednesday.
“Those who raise such accusations have to present evidence for this,” Rohani said. However, European leaders would not have been able to do so in the discussions with him during the UN General Debate. Instead, they would have only called for the rebels in Yemen not to carry out an attack like this. Rohani had met with Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, France’s President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in recent days.
Before possible talks with U.S. President Trump had to be held, Rohani demanded that the US administration be removed from the far-reaching sanctions, calling for the government in Washington to re-enforce a policy of dialogue and reason.
Comet from other star crossed solar system
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the depths of the universe. This has been achieved before. Comet allows conclusions on other solar systems.
What was at first just a guess is now confirmed: an interstellar guest crosses through our solar system. The comet from the depth of space was baptised on 2I/Borisov after its explorer and has awakened the interest of astronomers around the world.
The more advanced comet was discovered on August 30 by the amateur astronomer Gennadi Borissov at the Margo Observatory on Crimea - with a self-built telescope of 65 centimetres diameter. After-watches from various observatories confirmed not only that it was an unknown comet, but also that it did not come from our solar system.
2I/Borisov is only the second interstellar object, after 1I/'Oumuamua of 2017, that was sighted when we passed through our solar system.
2I/Borisov offers astronomers the rare chance to get insights from the vicinity into a foreign solar system before disappearing on take-off. First observations show that the interstellar comet resembles those of our own system, as reported by the astrophysical institute of the Canary Islands. “The current speed of the comet is high, about 150,000 kilometers per hour, which is clearly above the typical speeds of objects orbiting the Sun, reported by Davide Farnocchia of the U.S. Space Authority Nasa in a communication.
According to the analysis, the comet is on a so-called hyperbole path that leads it out of our system - and clearly interstellar origin, as the International Astronomical Union (IAU) has communicated. It is also responsible for naming and categorizing heavenly bodies. In honor of its discoverer, the interstellar sulphur star, which was first conducted under the catalog number C/2019 Q4, was named 2I/Borisov, with the first part of the name indicating that it is the second interstellar object discovered in our solar system.
The astronomers are lucky: In contrast to 1I/'Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov was already sighted in the approach. Thus, the researchers remain for many months for investigations. \"The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then be seen with medium-sized telescopes by April 2020, explained Farnocchia. \"Then it will only be possible to observe with larger professional telescopes by October 2020,
Several observatories have already taken the visitor into the visor. Thus, a team around Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, which had already led the characterization of 1I/'Oumuamua, in a first examination of the diameter of the celestial object at 2 to 16 kilometers. Records of the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii show a clear tail of the comet.
Researchers from the astrophysical institute of the Canary Islands (IAC) have already gained a first so-called spectrum from the interstellar sulphur star, which offers a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. “The spectrum of this object is similar to that of comets of our solar system, and this indicates that their composition must be similar, reported by IAC researcher Julia de León. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form through similar processes as in our, added de León's colleague Javier Licandro.
The discovery of two interstellar visitors within just two years, according to IAU's assessment, suggests that these objects could open up a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems. However, how often such stipping visitors are, is still difficult to estimate. One of the next interstellar visitors could possibly intercept a planned satellite mission of the European Space Agency Esa.
By 2028, the agency wants to station the three-part space probe “Comet Interceptor” (German comet catch-up hunters) at a waiting position of 1.5 million kilometers away from the earth. According to Esa Science Director Günther Hasinger, it is supposed to run on an even unspoiled, fresh comets from our own solar system, or on an interstellar visitor such as 1I/'Oumuamua.
First landing on Beijing's new mega-airport Daxing
Punctually before the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic it is so far: On the new mega-airport south of the Chinese capital, a first passenger machine of the China United Airlines has landed, a special honor for captain and crew.
By 2022 about 45 million passengers will be completed annually at the new airport, and it will be 72 million in 2025. China's President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion expensive project. China's most recent prestige project is also called \"sea stars\" because of its six-armed building structure.
The complex has four runways and runways to be extended to seven and is equipped with the world's largest automatic air traffic management system. A new subway transports passengers in just 20 minutes to the city center of Beijing.
Even during the construction, the Chinese had repeatedly announced that Berlin could learn from Beijing. The opening of the capital airport in Germany, which had been under construction since 2006, has been postponed ever again and again. In Beijing, on the other hand, a first passenger machine had already landed after four years.
New superplane to fly in 2030: in four and a half hours from London to Sydney
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - the British space agency UK Space Agency is dreaming of that. It is supposed to make it possible, for the 2030's flight in the oversonic pace, a special drive (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre), which the company Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire developed, the U.S. transmitter CNN quoted the agency. \"This is the technology that could definitely achieve this, said agency chief Graham Turnock to the transmitter. \"We are talking about the 2030s for commissioning, and the work is already very advanced,
In order to advance the project, the British space agency wants to cooperate closely with the Australian. A flight from the British capital to the Australian metropolis takes about 20 hours. The Concorde had covered the New York-Paris route from 1976 until its construction in 2003, and used it for three to three and a half hours. In 2000, an accident occurred during the launch of a Concorde at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, where all 109 inmates were killed. Last year, U.S. aircraft manufacturer Lockheed Martin announced plans to develop, together with the U.S. space agency Nasa, a superintendent, the \"X-Plane\" Virgin Galactic also has such developments in the programme.
“Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport,” writes Reaction Engines, among other things, on its homepage. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient travel at a speed of Mach 5 - which means five times as fast as the sound. In addition, such aircraft could also be used outside the Earth’s atmosphere and thus allow the “first generation of truly reusable frame gears” to be used,
Retirement in Washington: Trump wants to track anonymous tippers in Ukraine-affairs
In the Ukraine case of possible abuse of power by the U.S. President, Donald Trump wants to detect possible evil spots in the White House.
\"I want to know who gave the whistleblower the information, said Trump on Thursday before U.S. staff at the United Nations in New York. The person concerned was almost \"a spy\" and with such being in the past \"a little different\" than today.
This was rated as an intimidation attempt against tippers. The event was not actually public. However, several U.S. media spread audio tracks on Friday from the speech. Democrats responded with the President's statement.
On Tuesday, the Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives had announced preparations for an official detention proceedings against Trump. Their allegations were based primarily on the written complaint of an anonymous intelligence officer who raised serious accusations against Trump and his government headquarters. On major public pressure, the signator's signs had been made public on Thursday.
As part of his work, the Whistleblower wants to receive information from several government employees, according to which the U.S. President \"uses the power of his office\" to achieve that another country is joining the U.S. election in its favor in 2020.
In the centre of the allegations is a controversial phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his fellow officers to investigate what could harm his political rival Joe Biden. In doing so, the former business of Biden's son Hunter in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his spokesperson from Ukrainian justice. Biden is in the race for the democratic presidential candidate for the 2020 election.
The Whistleblower accused the White House with a view to the Ukraine Telefonat of being suspicious: leading government employees would have tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under cover. As usual, an electronic wording protocol had been made, but this would have been removed from an ordinary database after the White House's appointment, and instead stored in a particularly protected system. So far, only a rough discussion protocol has been published.
The identity of the notifier is not publicly known. The New York Times reported that it should be an employee of the CIA foreign intelligence service.
Trump again questioned the credibility of the source on Friday. In a series of tweets on the subject, the president wrote, among other things, that the \"so-called whistleblower\" has spread information from second hand, which would have turned out to be incorrect. Therefore, there may be no tippers or spies at all.
However, as Trump expressed himself in New York about those who were supposed to have access to whistleblower information, he triggered outrage. The chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, was worried and complained that Trump's statement was once again undermining the integrity of the government.
The House of Representatives has been conducting several investigations against Trump and his environment for months in various committees. In view of Ukraine's allegations, Democrats are now pushing forward investigations with new force to initiate a possible official detention process against Trump.
“The Whistleblower gave us a roadmap for our investigation,” said the head of the secret service committee in the House of Representatives, Adam Schiff. Trump attacked the ship sharply, presented him with a misrepresentation of things and demanded the resignation of the committee chairman again. Trump regularly reproached the ship and had already requested its withdrawal months ago.
More than 300 former U.S. government employees from the security and foreign policy field, who were mainly active under democratic, but also under Republican presidents, were in a statement published on Friday, behind the investigation initiated by the Democrats for a possible process of office. If the allegations were to be true, it would be \"a gross abuse of power\" by Trump, it was said.
There is no precise timetable for the further trial. With its majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could strive for a so-called impeachment procedure. However, the decision on an actual term of office fell in the Senate, where Trump's Republicans had the majority. Therefore, the prospects for success of such proceedings are low. So far, no US President has been deposed by an impeachment procedure of the Office.
VW operating council: jobs are being depleted
The plans of the VW brand to further reduce the cost of production could go to the cost of manufacturing in Germany and Europe. This concern is driven by the Autobauer's Works Council. The brand wants to reduce its annual factory costs by two billion euros from 10 billion euros to 2023. 500 million euros are to be saved this year.
A key to this is the staff costs. The 2016 \"Future Pact\" negotiated between the company and the Works Council already provides for the reduction of 14,000 jobs in Germany by 2020. In principle, a job can only be dismantled by the car builder if it is almost proved that the related activities are no longer necessary. In addition, employment insurance applies until 2029.
However, as our newspaper has now learned from business council circles, jobs in production, which are not actually for disposition, are being “screwed down” by another way, so are going to pass the official course. Thus, free regular places would often not be re-occupied.
In these cases, the Works Council has no way of forcing the resumption. Meanwhile, in many places staff fail to accept the burden of labour, which would increase the concern about the gradual blood outflows of the vehicles. This also raises the fear that vehicle production could gradually be withdrawn from Germany and Europe, because it is more favourable in other parts of the world. VW only said: \"Adaptation of the volume of employment is done as agreed socially along the demographic curve \"
The VW brand wants to further standardise production worldwide and control new projects centrally. It also aims to reduce costs and speed up decisions - the aim of which is to increase productivity and thus competitiveness. Production Board Andreas Tostmann said at a management conference in Berlin: “In times of uncertainty, from Brexit to the threatening trade war between the United States and China, we are well advised to make ourselves crisis-resistant,
On this path, success has already been achieved: For example, this year, for the first time since 2013, the cost of production per vehicle would fall in comparison to the previous year. Before journalists, Tostmann said that the production time for the Golf 8, which is to be presented in Wolfsburg on 24 October, will be reduced by 1.1 hours.
20 hours.
In our region, the Wolfsburg Stammwerk is the only VW factory in which vehicles are produced. The Braunschweig and Salzgitter works manufactured components. For Wolfsburg, VW-Intern applies the Faust rule that 800,000 cars must be built there every year to ensure that the factory is profitable. In 2018, however, the charging in Wolfsburg was only about 700,000 vehicles - due to the declining diesel demand and the problems in converting to the new WLTP consumption and exhaust testing process.
As the production director, Tostmann, announced last year, a million cars are supposed to roll off the band in Wolfsburg. This is to make it possible for golf production to be bundled in the trunk - because the Zwickau plant is producing golf by upgrading it to the location for e-auto production.
The SUV Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are also being produced in Wolfsburg. However, the sales figures of Golf and Tiguan have decreased recently. Therefore, expectations now rest on the Gulf 8. Despite all the efforts to build e-mobility, it is intended to remain the bread and butter car of Wolfsburgers.
Forced by Voodoo to prostitution: traffickers condemned
Young Nigerian women have been put to the test, dragged into the Ruhr area and forced to prostitution. Six alleged human traffickers have to go to prison for this.
Six alleged traffickers from Nigeria were sentenced to imprisonment and imprisonment for up to eight years and three months on Friday in Bochum. The defendants had dragged young women from Nigeria into the Ruhr area and forced them to prostitution. In order to force their obedience, the foreign-born Nigerians still had to make a ritual oath in front of a Voodoo priest in the home.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years of age. They were brought to the Mediterranean using Libyan lockers. However, the dream of a better future did not come true. In Germany, they were distributed to various brothels in order to complete the alleged locker costs of an average of 25 000 euros.
The defendants - four men and two women - had admitted the enrolment and the subsequent distribution of the young Nigerians on brothels in the trial. \"The work made it physically and mentally difficult for women to create - Judge Isabel Hoffmann said in the verdict. \"Some were right to object -
The judgments are based on commercial and labour-related inclusion of foreign nationals, trafficking in human beings, insurrection and heavy-duty prostitution.
UFO calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
FIn the ongoing dispute with the Lufthansa Group, the Ufo airliner union has again threatened with strikes.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the trade union will report on the work campaign measures in the LH Group on 14 October, with Daniel Flohr on Friday. Lufthansa and her daughter Eurowings have been refusing to conduct collective negotiations with the UFO for months. This also raises the question of whether the union has legally terminated collective agreements with Lufthansa.
On this point, Ufo now sees itself strengthened following a decision of the Arbeitsgericht Frankfurt. Lufthansa wanted to find that the collective agreements were not terminated. The court dismissed the applications. The company confirmed the decision and checked to submit legal remedies. \"That a second court sees the matter completely differently, I consider it unlikely - said Ufo Board Flohr.
In August Lufthansa also filed an application with the Landes Arbeitsgericht Frankfurt to review the status of the UFO as a trade union. The company argues that the trade union has not established a representative board for months and is thus unable to fulfil its role as a collective partner.
Prior to this, a heated leadership dispute in the divisional trade union, in which numerous members of the board as well as the advisory board, including the long-standing trade union chief Nicoley Baublies, had resigned. Ufo had put forward an already-started Urab vote on strikes by cabin staff at Eurowings at the end of July because of the doubts about their leadership.
Facilitated entry: Saudi Arabia announces new visa system
Until now, Saudi Arabia has not just been known as international tourist magnet. But that is to change. The country on the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visa destinations.
In the future, Saudi Arabia wants to attract international tourists with a new visa system. By 2030 the number of international and local visitors will be increasing to 100 million per year, the tourism commission announced.
“The opening of Saudi Arabia for international tourists is one-historical moment for our country,” said the chairman of the Tourism Commission, Ahmad Al-Chatib.
Saudi Arabia has so far been difficult for tourists to access. Visas are usually only available for short business trips, religious pilgrimages or visitors with relatives in the desert state. With the new rules, the Austrian Conservative Kingdom expects more revenue from the tourism business. Riad wants to reduce its dependence on oil trading according to its own views.
In mid-September several rockets and drones had hit two of the most important oil plants in eastern Saudi Arabia: the largest oil refinery in the country in Abkaik and the oil field Churais. In the follow-up, national oil production drastically collapsed, the oil price shots in height. It should take several weeks for the oil production of the Kingdom to reach its old level again.
Justin and Hailey Bieber are in preparations for wedding party
Singer Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) are preparing for their wedding celebration. On Thursday (local time) the model posted several party photos in their Instagram stories, on which she can be seen in the white wedding look. Reality Star Kendall Jenner (23) and others had organized a youth farewell in Los Angeles, according to the People magazine.
Justin posted several colorful suits, including those printed with bananas on Instagram and asked his followers: \"Help me choose my smoking for the wedding - according to media reports, the promi pair wants to marry churchly on the next weekend.
The Biebers gave themselves the yes word a year ago in a New York state office. A larger feast had not occurred at that time.
In an interview with the Australian Vogue, Hailey recently stated that the two had found a common level after initial problems: \"If you don't want to compromise, you can't make a relationship.\"
Two dead at plane crash in the Czech Republic
Two people were killed in the crash of a small plane in the west of the Czech Republic. The wreck was discovered on Friday in a forest area near the city of Mecin (Methin), the police told him. The dead were a 38-year-old woman and a 64-year-old man.
The authorities had been looking for the machine since Thursday evening after the GPS crew issued an emergency signal. In the search there was also a military helicopter in operation. The accident case still needs to be determined. The crash site is located about 30 kilometers south of Pilsen (Plzen) and 100 kilometres northeast of Regensburg.
Half of European tree species are threatened with extinction
In addition to pests, diseases, alien species, non-sustainable logging and the growth of cities are also causes of the threat, the IUCN World Nature Conservation Union reported on Friday in Brussels. It has investigated the stocks of all 454 species known in Europe. 265 of them are not present on any other continent. Of these 265 are 58 percent threatened. 66 are already at the highest level of danger and thus before extinction.
The IUCN divides endangered species into six categories: from “potentially endangered” to “hazardous” - severely endangered - from death to extinction - and “extinctly extinct - to death - In total, it lists more than 28,000 species of animals and plants worldwide as endangered.
Eberian and wild roscastania threatened
In Germany, Ebereschen (Sorbus) was mainly threatened, said one of the authors, David Allen, the German Press Agency. “Most of them are threatened because the populations are small anyway, or because of the transformation or weakening of their habitats,
Bad it also looks like the wild ordinary Rosskastania. Since 2017 it has been regarded as a \"dangerous\" stage two of the IUCN scale. The biggest threat is beside a mushroom of the Balkan mining moth. It has spread from south-eastern Europe throughout the continent since the 1980s and has hardly any natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild Rosskastania (Aesculus hippocastanum) in Europe to less than 10,000 specimens. Not taken into account in this assessment are the trees in cities, parks and alleys.
Straw species and moose also in danger
At the same time, IUCN scientists created new European red lists for molluscs, shrubs and moose. More than one-fifth of molluscs and moose and almost half of all shrub species were threatened, according to IUCN. This was mainly due to the destruction of the wilderness, to introduced species, agricultural practices and climate change. molluscs such as snails played a key role in the recycling of nutrients in the soil and were an important food source for birds and other animals.
“This report shows that the situation for many species that are overlooked and underestimated is precarious, species that make up the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet,” said Luc Bas, IUCN Director of the European Office. “We need to limit the impact of humans on our ecosystems and make them a priority for the protection of these species,
Earthquakes before Istanbul: 34 injured reported
During the recent earthquake in Turkey, 34 people were injured. The death was not reported. Hundreds of people had to leave their homes, 14 schools in Istanbul had been closed for security reasons, said Turkish Vice President Fuat Octay on Friday.
Hundreds of buildings were thus damaged. Since the earthquake in the morning there have been almost 200 aftershocks. The 5.8 earthquake had shaken the Marmara region in front of Istanbul on Thursday and caused panic in the millions of metropolises.
Now that the government wants to launch a Commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, Octay announced that Turkey had not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes over the past 20 years, said Istanbul's mayor Ekrem Imamoglu.
Istanbul is considered to be a particularly dangerous earthquake. Among the Marmara Sea is a section of the so-called North Anatolian disorder that marks the border between the Eurasian and the Anatolian Earth Plate.
One of the most severe earthquakes was one of the 7.6 strength in 1999 near Istanbul. The epicenter was then located in Gölcük southeast of Istanbul. More than 17,000 people were killed.
As early as Tuesday, an earthquake of the strength of 4.6 had shaken the region around Istanbul. The authorities called on the residents to stay away from damaged buildings.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira perform in the mid-term show
The Latin pop singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will perform the half-time show of the next American football final Super Bowl. The singers announced that at Twitter. “It’s not going to be great,” Shakira wrote to a photo of herself and Lopez. She’s so excited to stand on the super bowl stage. On February 2, 2020, it will be in Miami.
Jennifer Lopez explained that since 1996 she has dreamed of performing at the Super Bowl - at which time she saw Diana Ross fly in the sky at the mid-term show. “Now it’s even more special because the NFL is 100 years old and I’m going to perform with another Latina - she can’t wait to show what we girls can do on the world’s largest stage -
Shakira pointed out in a statement that she felt honored to stand alongside another artist on one of the largest stages worldwide and to represent Latinos and Latinas from the United States and all over the world. “And then on my birthday too, the main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter that it was the first time that the two ‘kings’ were on stage together.
Shakira comes from Colombia. Jennifer Lopez was born in New York, her parents come from Puerto Rico.
Fight against sinking viewer numbers
The Super Bowl is the highlight of the American football season. The game and the half-time show are among the most popular TV broadcasts in the United States. Even if you last fell audience numbers: In this February, the spectacle attracted the least viewers in the United States for more than ten years. Nevertheless, there were still almost a hundred million people on average.
In the run-up to the half-time show of the previous Super Bowl, there had been riots: In the dispute over dealing with Quarterback Colin Kaepernick, the top stars such as Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B were not wanted to appear last February. Finally, the Maroon 5 pop group led the semi-time show - the criticisms were little friendly.
Kaepernick, then quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, had gone on the knee in the 2016/17 season before NFL games at the national anthem for protesting police violence and racism. With his protest Kaepernick triggered a movement, many players took over the gesture. This caused great excitement, U.S. President Donald Trump attacked the most African-American football stars sharply. Kaepernick himself has been uncompromising since March 2017 and has no longer fought NFL party. He accuses the associations not wanting to hire him for political reasons.
Cook-Pleite: Hotels receive money from insurance
According to a press report, some banks may find the travel provider Thomas Cook's plea to be expensive. There are high depreciations on outstanding bonds and loans. Credit Suisse is also concerned, writes the Financial Times in its Friday issue.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit or Credit Suisse would probably have to make total depreciations of up to 1.8 billion UK pounds (about 2 billion euros) on their books, according to the report.
The creditors of bonds would have to purchase depreciations of between 900 million and 1 billion pounds and the creditors of between 550 and 825 million pounds. The actual depreciation amounts would be more likely to be at the upper end of the bandwidths, said an expert to the sheet.
How great the losses of the creditors will be at the end will be shown after the insolvency process has ended. A person close to this procedure did not have too much hope. For example, Thomas Cook's 40 aircraft in the UK were \"old\" and many of the real estates were in poor locations. Most of the money could probably be picked up with the sale of the airport slots and the brand Thomas Cook, it continued.
Rackete is supposed to have brought suspected murderers to Italy
The Sea-Watch Captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy to have tortured and killed people in Libya. “We can’t exclude this, but we don’t even have any secure information about it,” said the spokesman of the refugee organisation Sea-Watch, Ruben Neugebauer, the news agency dpa.
Other migrants would have recognised the three men in Italy. They were accused of having raped, tortured and killed people in Libya. The alleged perpetrators were arrested in the reception camp in the Italian Messina. Neugebauer emphasised that the refugee organisations could not check who they had left on their ships. “They come without passports”
Carola Rackete had illegally brought migrants to the port of Lampedusa on 29 June and had rammed a ship of the Italian financial police. On that day, the three suspects were also to have arrived there. Against the captain, investigations are being carried out for aid to illegal immigration.
USA warn federal government against Huawei
The head of the U.S. Internet Authority Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, warned the federal government to trust the Chinese network provider Huawei.
We believe that the risks are too large - Pai told the trade sheet - with a view to the construction of the new 5G mobile network.
China has committed a ‘national security law’ which each company, under Chinese case law, to follow instructions from the security bodies.
Furthermore, the applicable law prohibits companies from informing third parties about such requests, according to the FCC chief, which makes it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
The Federal Government has now agreed to demand from suppliers a declaration of trust.
At first Berlin wants to try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, reports the \"Handelsblatt\" calling for its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. The 5G technology is not just from the hardware:
Just the software is important to keep the devices up-to-date. This software consists of billions of lines of program code that change over time - said Pai.
It is very difficult to imagine that a government authority, no matter where, would be able to check each individual update in real time in order to detect security risks, continues the FCC chief.
To the Chinese group Huawei, he proposes close contacts with the Chinese state apparatus:
The ownership relationship is opaque. The employee company, which is said to belong to the company, is not necessarily independent of the government - Pai said the \"handelsblatt\"
The U.S. presented findings that government employees were placed within the company. Pai was recently for talks in Berlin to advertise for the position of the United States.
Chemical factory in northern France fires: schools closed
During the night, residents hear explosions. A gigantic wall of fire illuminates the sky above a north French chemical factory. The fire is removed after hours - however, the clean-up work may take days.
After a fire in a chemical factory in the northern French city of Rouen on Thursday the schools and children's cribs remain closed in the region.
In twelve municipalities the facilities would not be opened on Friday, the responsible prefecture informed. The Ministry of the Interior had asked the citizens to stay as far as possible in buildings and do not put themselves out of smoke. The injured did not exist. Farmers and breeders were called on to bring their animals in, to protect their feed and to stop the harvest first.
The fire could be completely deleted on Thursday evening, as the prefecture reported. There was still the risk of spreading smell after the deletion, so the prefecture on Twitter. According to the prefecture, 240 fire fighters and 90 police officers and gendarms were in use at the place of fire.
A huge black smoke column had previously risen from the chemical factory. French media reported huge flames and explosions in the factory of the Lubrizol company, restoring the additives for oils. The production plant is located a few kilometers from the city center.
The Normandy factory, according to government information, belongs to the so-called Seveso category of dangerous sites, which are particularly monitored. In the Italian Seveso near Milan, a devastating chemical accident occurred in 1976.
The prefect of the Normandie region, Pierre-André Durand, told the news channel BFMTV that it had not initially been found “high toxicity” in samples. However, a pollution of the nearby seine could not be excluded. In the river, dams were built against pollution, the prefecture explained.
The fire broke out at 02.40 a.m. early in the morning, reported the authorities. The cause remained unclear at first. Rouen is a regional metropolis located at the Seine between Paris and the port city of Le Havre.
French Minister of Finance: \"Germany must invest and now,
The French Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs Bruno Le Maire has called on Germany to make greater investments in order to boost economic growth in the euro area.
Germany has to invest, and now, the sooner the better - Le Maire said on Thursday evening in presenting the French budget for the coming year.
The euro area economy was weakening, the minister warned.
We must not wait until the economic situation worsens to make the necessary decisions,
Those countries that had budget spaces for more investment would have to act, said Le Maire, among other things, with regard to Germany.
France did not have these spaces, added the Minister and referred to the high government debt of its country, which is more than 98 percent of the gross domestic product. French government debt had to be \"stabilized\" and \"reduced\", said Le Maire.
Over the past few years, France has repeatedly come up with appeals to Germany to make more public investments in order to revive the European economy. In return, German politicians have repeatedly called on France to overcome its budgetary deficit.
The French budget for 2020, presented on Thursday, provides tax relief of more than nine billion euros for households.
The French government is responding, among other things, to the protests of the yellow-west movement. The new debt is expected to fall to 2.2 percent, as expected 3.1 percent this year.
Is he still trying to trick?: Johnson weighs question about Brexit tactics
British Prime Minister Johnson criticises the \"capitulation law\" adopted by Parliament.
Parliament is back, a law prescribes to the British Prime Minister to avoid a chaos brexit. However, critics fear that Boris Johnson could still use a loophole, but the Tory politician objected to this possibility.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is concerned about whether he wants to enforce an unregulated Brexit - despite the last law passed by Parliament to prevent exactly that. On a question of this kind, Johnson told journalists only that his government would adhere to existing law.
The law provides that the government must apply for a shift in the exit date, should not have reached an agreement with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticises this as a \"capitulation law\" that makes negotiations with the EU difficult.
On Thursday, former British Prime Minister John Major had expressed the suspicion that Johnson could try to use \"political shicans\" to circumvent the law. The Premier could use a procedural trick that would shift the entry into force of the law to the time after the EU exit. Johnson said he was striving for a treaty with the European Union. \"We are confident of leaving the EU on 31 October, and the best way is to do so with an agreement,
Johnson’s chief advisor Dominic Cummings explained that he felt the political conflicts around Brexit as a “spattering tour in the park” and was confident that the EU’s efforts to exit still exist: “We are enjoying this, we are going to win, we are going to quit (Anm. d. Red.: from the EU), no worries, according to Cummings of the British newspaper “Telegraph” in a book presentation.
Cummings, who led the Brexit campaign “Vote Leave” in the 2016 EU referendum, is now acting as the chief street in the UK's Downing Street government. He is to be behind the uncompromising policy that led the Premier into a rather remote situation.
“The Polaroid Diaries - by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all stood in front of Linda McCartney's camera, which has become one of the very big rock photographers. But it doesn't always have to be the big glamour. The photo book \"The Polaroid Diaries\" (bags) dives deep into the whole private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married to Lindas from 1969 to 1998, was clearly proud and touched when he presented the picture band \"The Polaroid Diaries\" in mid-September at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison and Pretender's front wife Chrissie Hynde were among the most illustrious guests.
After the launch event, McCartney wrote to Instagram: \"#ThePolaroidDiaries is a fleeting look into the life of an extraordinary family from the time before Instagram, a celebration for the legacy of LindaMcCartney as a committed artist and the sofortmagy of the Polaroid film \"
At Linda McCartney, who had studied art history at the University of Aizona until she was photographed, the camera was always there. Thousands of Polaroids made it, several hundred of which are now published in \"The Polaroid Diaries\" for the first time.
They are portraits, still lifes, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 70s to the late 90s. “She wanted real moments,” writes art critic Ekow Eshun in his foreword. Of course, there is always one in the center: her husband Paul - how he may never have been seen.
As he dances on his shoulders with his daughter Mary, he telephones in the bathrobe with a bag on his head or wears unshaped moonboats. Certainly, the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but who, beyond the headlight light on their farm in southern England or Scotland, also led a very normal life. Thus, according to BBC, Mary McCartney said that she had slept as a baby in a bed, which her father had baked from old potato boxes. And it was not always cleaned up with the McCartneys.
Like hardly any other medium, the poloraid camera captures the immediate moment. Linda McCartney's recordings are certainly a kind of family diary, but they are much more than pure snapshots.
It's about deciding Click: You have to recognize when a great photo is happening before you. And then you have to cut it at exactly the right moment, said Paul McCartney. \"If you cut it two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it could be a completely different photo - And Linda would have had the gift to always catch the right moment. \"She just knew that she had it - said Paul in the Eshun essay.
This is where the light, composition, image cut-out and colors, which makes “The Polaroid Diaries” not only an entertaining picture book for Beatles fans, but also anecdotal and a great aesthetic pleasure, where landscapes seem like abstract paintings. The perfect addition to the Beatles album “Abbey Road” that appeared just 50 years ago.
“We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran,
Despite the US sanctions imposed on Iran, Turkey wants to continue importing oil and gas from the neighbouring country. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey could not stop imports of oil and gas from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there - Erdogan said in New York where he had participated in the UN General Assembly.
Erdogan admitted, however, that Turkey had problems importing Iranian oil, as some companies had withdrawn because of the US threats.
Nevertheless, Turkey will continue our relations with Iran in particular and in many other matters, said the Turkish President, who had repeatedly criticized the US sanctions against Iran in the past.
The United States has been pursuing a policy of “maximum pressure” against the Islamic Republic since its departure from the international nuclear agreement with Iran. According to the United States, Iran is secretly pursuing a nuclear program and is not in compliance with the agreement.
Their sanctions have led to the collapse of Iranian oil exports and a serious economic crisis in Iran. In recent months, tensions in the Gulf region have increased significantly.
US government wants to restrict reception of refugees
The US government wants to drastically restrict the reception of refugees. On Thursday, the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the annual ceiling of a resettlement programme should be reduced from 30,000 to 18,000 refugees, which represents an average of 40 percent.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that while the United States would continue to feel obliged to support refugees, it was important to protect and serve U.S. citizens. Currently, the U.S. immigration system is overloaded.
In the future, the U.S. government will focus on the inclusion of two refugee groups: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the U.S. military in the country and are thus in danger, as the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reveals. Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador are to be admitted to a maximum of 1500 refugees.
In 1980, refugees from UN camps are selected and re-established in the United States. The upper limit of 18,000 refugees for the budget year 2020 would be the lowest in the history of the program. Already the current ceiling of 30,000 is low. As the predecessor of U.S. President Donald Trump, Barack Obama, the White House left, the number was almost 85,000.
Aid organizations responded to the announced lowering of the upper limit. “This is a very sad day for America,” said the head of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband. This would further damage the US’s leadership role in protecting the most vulnerable people in the world.
Trump tries to strictly limit immigration to the US - legal and illegal - and according to his own data, the US government expects 350,000 asylum applications for the coming budget year. These figures are separate from the resettlement program.
Donald Trump - \"Comes Close to a Tiple\"
U.S. President Donald Trump has issued a statement in the Whistleblower case of espionage. Anyone who has always given appropriate indications to the informant who accuses him of abuse of power, “is approaching a peak,” said Trump in a recording of a private event on Thursday in New York. This reports several U.S. media in agreement.
Trump then spoke to employees of the American UN mission. When asked about the person who informed the whistleblower about controversial transactions in the White House, he replied: “This is close to a peak, then Trump added: “Do you know what we’ve done in ancient times when we were smart? Right. The spies and betrayal, we used to deal with it a little differently than we do now,” he said.
On the other hand, the President of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Secret Services and the Supervisory Board of the House of Representatives wrote to the Presidents of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and Security and the Supervisory Board of the House of Representatives.
The Whistleblower proposes to the President in a complaint now published to have his office misused in order to request another country's interference into the US election 2020. It is concrete, among other things, to have his controversial phone call with his Ukrainian colleague Wolodymyr Selenskyj in the summer: In the conversation Trump told him to initiate investigations against his potential democratic challenger Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine. Trump contends with any misconduct.
It is still unclear who are both the whistleblowers themselves and their informants. However, as the New York Times reports, the Whistleblower is intended to be an analyst of the CIA's foreign intelligence service.
Refugee boat cracked: Babie and young children drown in Aegean
Again and again, people try to get across the Aegean Sea from Turkey to Greece. They regularly know too much too little boats. At the sinking of a boat, seven migrants have now come to life - including five children.
Before the Greek island of Chios, seven migrants were killed at the sinking of a boat. Among the deaths were also a baby and four other children, the Greek Coast Guard reported. Four children, three women and five men were then rescued from the floods of the occupation of a passing ferry.
Among the victims was also a locker, reported the local news portal of Chios, Alithia.gr. The migrants had broken up from Turkey in the morning. They had tried to reach the small island group of Inousses in the northeast of the island of Chios. Inousses is located between Chios and the Turkish mainland.
The countries from which the migrants have come are not known until now. Currently, hundreds of migrants from Turkey are crossing the Greek islands to the east of the Aegean, mostly in far too small boats. Last year, according to the United Nations Refugee Aid Office (UNHCR) 174 people were killed on this route.
The Who Cancels Concert
A U.S. concert of the rock band The Who, due to an inescapability of lead singer Roger Daltrey, found a real end. In the middle of the Wednesday evening (local time) in Houston, his voice failed. At the eighth song, Daltrey told the audience: “I think I should leave it as long as it’s still running,” he said.
Lead guitarist Pete Townsend asked for apologies and added that Daltrey could \"not speak now\" to the audience, promising Townsend to come to his expense at a reparation concert. However, an appointment is not yet fixed.
For Fridays in Dallas and for Sundays in Denver, The Who said they should be picked up at a later time. The 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74-year-old bandmate Townsend are the only remaining founding members. The British cult band formed 55 years ago.
Rented suddenly: WeWork lets real estate markets sit down
WeWork has risen to the largest office rent in New York.
Within a few years, WeWork rises from small startup to driving power on the world’s most expensive real estate markets. But now the company is in crisis. Owners have to fear billions of revenue.
The crisis of WeWork's office landlord threatens to disrupt the balance on the world's largest real estate markets. Just a few days ago, the company had dismissed founder Adam Neumann as head, moved the planned stock market and started selling subsidiaries and securities such as the private jet for the executives to gain financial space for the coming weeks and months. In addition, the UK Financial Times - WeWork, among other things, has stopped the conclusion of new rents with immediate effect. This, among other things, is the biggest renter of office space suddenly out of the market in New York and London.
WeWork hires large office space in the long term and rents it in some small units to members in the short term. This can be individual freelancers, small startups or entire departments of large corporations. So far, WeWork burns money at a stunning speed with this business. Last year, the company committed a loss of 1.6 billion dollars, with sales of 1.8 billion dollars. This year alone, renting costs by renting will always be estimated at 2.5 billion dollars. In order to limit the loss, the new management should now have the emergency brake pulled and the rental of new areas with immediate effect stopped.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has now concluded rental contracts with maturitys of up to 15 years, with commitments of more than 40 billion dollars. These huge liabilities could become a problem not only for the company itself and its investors, but for entire real estate markets.
According to economist Dan Alpert of Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork rented in Manhattan, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, nearly 300,000 square meters of office space in the past 24 months. WeWork's new contracts alone ensured that the demand for offices in New York was greater than the new ones in the market during this period. Without WeWork's expansion, office lending in the US metropolis would have risen at this time, as Alpert wrote in the business insider. It looks similar in London, where WeWork now runs several dozen office locations in the best location.
Even in the UK capital, the balance on the real estate market could be felt without further expansion of the aggressive startup. Among other things, WeWork is the main owner, in a office house, which was purchased last year by the Sparkasses fund provider Deca for almost 100 million euros, in the center of the financial metropolis.
Many landlords have converted their properties for the demands of WeWork with high investments. If WeWork fails to make its business model profitable soon, the real estate owners would probably have to write down some of the expected billions of revenue. Access to WeWork’s reserves does not have them despite long-term rental contracts. As a rule, weWork’s individual locations are rented by additional established subsidiaries, called Special Purpose Vehicles, for which the parent company is only liable within narrow limits.
Russia again captured numerous North Korean fishermen
The Russian Coast Guard has again taken action against North Korean fishermen, and in recent days a total of 262 wilders have been arrested who had illegally fished in the waters, according to the Russian National Security Service FSB of Interfax Agency announced on Friday.
Only ten days ago 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. Previously, the border guards were shot and three of them were injured. This time there were no casualties, it was said. Communist North Korea suffered from chronic food shortages.
The North Korean fishermen were therefore on their way in Russian high-waters. Russia's coastal guard, according to its own data, was on the protection of its marine biological resources patrols. In the re-tests, 30,000 inkfish had been discovered. In addition, the data for three fishing and two motor boats were seized and brought to Nachodka and Posjet at Vladivostok. According to the Ria Novosti Agency, the coast guard in 2018 identified more than 8,000 violations.
The Russian Fisheries Authority had not issued any fishing licences to North Koreans even after the lawsuits of local entrepreneurs. Thousands of North Korea fishermen have already been arrested there for some time, according to media in 2019.
The head of the Association of Russian Fisheries Companies in the Far Eastern Region of Primorje, Georgi Martynov, recently also charged high ecological damage by North Korean fishermen. They fished with narrowly meshed synthetic nets banned in Russia. With these also small creatures would be taken out of the sea. Furthermore, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea where they would take 200 years to be destroyed. Even the ships themselves do not correspond to the hygienic and technical regulations.
According to Moscow's three members of the Russian Coast Guard were injured during the arrests in the previous week. According to a also wounded North Korean, the FSB later died of its injuries. On 17 September, Russian border guards first established a North Korean boat and then a second one after it opened the fire.
USA imposes entry ban on ex-president Castro
The United States has imposed bans on former Cuban President Raúl Castro and his children's entry into the country. The U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs established this in a statement on Thursday with Castro's participation in gross human rights violations, as head of the Caribbean Communist Party, it has a system in which thousands of Cubans would be arbitrarily arrested and there are more than 100 political prisoners.
As chairman of the armed forces, Fidel Castro's brother, who died, was also guilty of human rights violations by supporting the President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. “The disregard for human rights and the use of violence by the Cuban regime to support the former Maduro regime is responsible for the ongoing crises in Cuba and Venezuela,” said American Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo.
On Wednesday, President Donald Trump had banned entry, among others, against members of the Venezuelan government and the military. In Venezuela, for months, there has been a bitter struggle of power between the government and the opposition. The United States has imposed a number of sanctions against Maduro's government to force him into the knees and to help the opposition leader and self-proclaimed interim president Juan Guaidó to power.
Cuba is considered one of the closest allies to Maduros. Venezuela's socialist Caribbean island receives oil in exchange for the services sent to doctors. According to the US and the Venezuelan opposition, Cuba has also sent numerous intelligence agents to Venezuela to help the government suppress government opponents.
New climate protests from Fridays for Future
A week after the largest international climate protests, thousands of people want to go on the road for more climate protection.
At the conclusion of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement again plans actions and demonstrations in dozens of countries around the world. It is expected that New Zealand and Australia will start out in time before the protests take place across Europe to North America. There, climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to participate in a large-scale tour in the Canadian Montreal. Even in front of the White House in Washington, protesters wanted to gather.
How great the global commitment on this Friday will be after the record participation of the previous week is relatively unclear. Thunberg himself was good things. “Last Friday has striked over four million people for the climate. This Friday we make it once again,” she wrote on Twitter. So far, during the strike week, 6383 actions in 170 countries have been added.
Especially in Germany last Friday the run was very big. A good third of all the world’s demonstrators - around 1.4 million - had participated in the protests in 575 German cities according to estimates of Fridays for Future. This time a list of the movement is planned in at least 65 cities. Among them in metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt, people want to go on the road for climate.
At the age of 15, Thunberg had put himself in front of the Swedish Parliament in August 2018 to call its country's politicians for a stronger commitment to climate protection. This led to the Fridays-for-future movement within a short time. In the climate protests mainly students and students participate, but increasingly also scientists and other adults.
Together, they call for more ambition from politics in the fight against global warming and the threat of climate change. In particular, global warming, according to the Paris climate agreement, has to be restrained to a lower degree than in the pre-industrial period.
Thunberg arrived in New York about a month ago after a two-week Transatlantic Terror with a New York High Sea Rennjacht, where she had recently participated in climate protests and summits of the United Nations. On Monday, she gave an emotional speech to the UN, in which she had been deeply familiarised with the Heads of State and Government of the Earth. In her home country Stockholm, she was assigned to the Alternative Nobel Prize of the Right Livelihood Foundation on Wednesday for more climate protection.
Russia prohibits smoking on the balcony
In the future, people in Russia are no longer allowed to smoke on the balcony. This is a change in fire protection. “This also applies to smoking,” said a spokesperson of the Ministry of Emergency in Moscow of the Agency Tass on Thursday. The ban is due to enter into force on 1 October.
Anyone who smokes must therefore expect a fine of 3,000 rubles (42,46 euros). If the cigarette should light a fire, then the penalty will be higher. According to the Ministry, the ban will also fall on burning candles. Also to grill meat pies on the balcony is no longer allowed.
Battle Against Cybercriminals - investigators elevate servers
In the fight against crimes on the Internet, German investigators have for the first time raised a large server provider for illegal business in the Darknet.
A total of 13 perpetrators are suspected of having hosted numerous websites at the Mosel as the operator of a data center in a former Nato bunker in Traben-Trarbach, through the internationally operating criminals.
This was communicated to the General Attorney General in Koblenz. Seven suspects were arrested on Thursday evening in a major action. The Darknet is a shielded part of the Internet.
Customers of suspects, among other things, should have been the operators of the world's second largest Darknet marketplace for drugs, \"Wall Street Market\", which had crashed investigators in spring. The attack on 1.25 million Telekom routers at the end of November 2016 was controlled by a cyber bunker server, according to the Attorney General.
Such a host would have been removed for the first time in Germany, it was called. A web host provides the infrastructure for an Internet presence.
The Access Action, with the support of special units such as the GSG9, has provided searches in Germany and abroad. It has been the result of nearly five years of investigations. In the afternoon, the investigators want to provide further details.
New global climate protests from Fridays for Future
A week after the largest international climate protests, thousands of people want to go to the streets for more climate protection.
At the conclusion of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement is again planning actions and demonstrations in dozens of countries worldwide.
Protests are planned in at least 65 cities in Germany, such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities like Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wants to participate in a large association in the Canadian Montreal.
Climate protests - Who are Thunberg's Hintermen?
Justice sense and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that warm the climate. So much more amazing that a 16-year-old girl keeps the power of this time in front of the nose. But what is behind it? Is it helpfulness or smart marketing of a climate activist? Historical master performance or manipulative tactics for his own sake?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg puts the masses in motion and brings young people to stand up for a better climate-friendly world. It is historically not the first time in Europe that a young person can win a collection of children and young people for himself. Already in 1212 a child named Nikolaus from Cologne felt himself out to work for a more just world. At that time, he has also been able to win a pair of young people for himself, and this one convinces them to cross the sea to reach the Promised Land, just as Greta Thunberg has recently made a trip to America with a sailboat.
However, there is a shadow side to this? Why does it need a share called “We don’t have time” to save the world? In addition, Greta Thunberg has rich PR managers at her side. Alongside, her mother has published a book that has been widely sold, thanks to the daughter in the spotlight. Even old-fashioned followers of Greta Thunberg were a little disfigured over the last PR show, or the trip with the boat was probably also too thick. This is also not unfounded, because the action came into the media very well and it ran a lot of money thanks to the imposing action.
Here the spirits separate now: Is it morally right to enrich themselves financially at the world's Red? Is it still authentic if certain groups of people work together with stock market agents during the World Rescue Action? No matter what the position is ultimately involved, a critical and reflective point of view is increasingly important in a democratically shaped society, because democracy is alive by different opinions and discussions. Therefore, it can make sense to question seemingly pious projects from certain trends sets critically.
Comet discovered: Interstellar guest crossed by our solar system
A strange comet is crossing our solar system right now.
The assumptions of astronomers have been confirmed: A strange comet is crossing our solar system at the moment - it is only the second of its kind.
Garching/Washington - For a long time the researchers have only suspected it, but now they have certainty: a comet from another star crosses our solar system at the moment. It was baptized after its explorer 2I/Borisov and employs astronomers around the world.
2I/Borisov: Comet was discovered by amateur astronomers on Crimea
The said body was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borissov on the Crimea. He looked at heaven with a self-built telescope and further follow-up confirmed his first suspicion. It is actually an unknown comet that does not come from our solar system. He is only the second of his kind that was seen during the journey.
The great chance for astronomers is now to gain insights into a foreign solar system from close proximity. Apparently, the comet resembles those of our own system, as the astrophysical institute of the Canary Islands reports. The comet, according to the International Astronomical Union (IAC), is clearly interstellar origin and is currently moving on a so-called hyperbole track that leads it out of our system.
Comet has already been sighted before arrival - and can be observed for several months
But before it is so far, astronomers can observe it in detail. In contrast to its predecessor, 2I/Borisov has already been sighted in its approach, which means that it can be examined for many months from Earth. “The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then be seen with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020,” explains Davide Farnocchia from the US Space Agency Nasa. “Then it will only be observed by October 2020 with larger, professional telescopes,
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 -Oumuamua
First findings about Comet 2I/Borisov awaken hopes in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated to be between 2 and 16 kilometers in diameter. At the same time, the celestial body appears to be similar to our comets - because as IAC researcher Julia de León expresses it, the spectrum of the floating star is similar to ours. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form through similar processes as in our, complemented by León's colleague Javier Licandro.
However, the observation goes beyond individual knowledge, and that two such objects have already been discovered within just two years, may allow a new way of exploring certain processes in other solar systems.
Again and again, asteroids employ the researchers. Only recently did a giant asteroid rush past the Earth and approached her dangerously.
“Absolutely contemptible: Rachel Johnson displeases her brother
To Boris Johnson it becomes more lonely. First, his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister, in clear words, casts the warlike language of the Premier as \"smoothly-less\" It's not the brother she knows.
“Capitulation “Betrug” Treaty”: Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and continues to stir up - at least verbally. During the Question Time in the Lower House on this Wednesday, this was a massive insult to the opposition, and in the meantime other critics have spoken: Dozen of Bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author told the broadcaster Sky News that her brother was using words like capitulation, as if the opponents of an EU exit were to be \"hanged, lengthened, quadrupled, tethered and fed\" and that they thought this would be extremely confusing. They did not recognize their brother's version again, Rachel Johnsons said, who had joined the EU Parliament elections for the anti-Brexit party \"Change UK\".
She was particularly impressed that her brother Jo Cox mentioned an EU-friendly deputy who had been murdered by a neonazi a few days before the 2016 withdrawal referendum. Their memory could be best honored by passing the Brexit, Boris Johnson had said in the lower house. “It is very tasteless to refer to a member who was murdered by someone who called 'Britain first' - now criticized Johnson’s sister. The perpetrator obviously came out of the right-wing camp, which, through this type of language, felt strengthened. For all those who mourned her, it was very tasteless.
The widower of Cox also strongly criticized the Prime Minister. “It makes me sick when Jo’s name is used in this way, he tweeted. The best way to honor it is if one enters passionately and decisively for what one believes - no matter what one considers to be. But never should one “demonise the other side - he also complained that an atmosphere has arisen, in which the attacks have become more likely.
Just a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson had established his office as Secretary of State and his mandate as Tory's deputy. “I was torn between loyalty to the family and national interest in the past few months - it is an unresolvable tension - and Jo Johnson took the step.
Johnson’s language also came up with harsh criticism in the church. As reported by the Times, all 118 bishops and Archbishops of the Church of England criticize the language that is not worthy of this country. In a joint statement they stated: “In the past few days, the language, both in debates and outside Parliament, has not been acceptable. We should speak with respect to one another,
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez perform at the Super Bowl
In the year of its 100th anniversary, the NFL has a strong mark: in the mid-term show of the upcoming Super Bowl, two women perform with Latino roots. The promise of an explosion of fun and energy -
Latina Power at Super Bowl: The Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the half-time show at the upcoming finale of the US Football League NFL. This was announced by the organisers on Thursday (local time).
“I feel incredibly honored and humble to represent the Latino community in addition to JLo, because it has an incredible strength in the USA, Shakira shared in a video.
The finale of the American football league, which celebrates its 100th birthday next year, will take place in Miami on February 2. In the metropolis at the southern tip of Florida, many people live with Latin American roots. Shakira -Waka Waka - comes from Colombia, Lopez -On the Floor - is puerto-rican origin.
“I love that the Super Bowl is putting two women on stage this time, and two Latinas,” Lopez explained. This sends an important message to all Americans and the world. She promises for the show “an explosion of fun and energy.”
The 50-year-old was born in New York after her parents emigrated from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s she ended up with songs such as \"Waiting For Tonight\" or \"Let's Get Loud\" and later published songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as an actress and can be seen in the drama \"Hustlers\" in German cinemas starting in November.
Shakira became known in Colombia as the star of a Telenovela and singer. In 2001 she created her worldwide breakthrough with her first bilingual album and single-language, Whereever.
The announcement of the half-time guests is expected in the United States every time. This year, many value the selection as political gesture. Finally, the country, not least through President Donald Trump's immigration policy, is deeply divided.
The Super Bowl is the largest US sports event and at the same time a huge advertising spectacle. Musicians such as Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones provided furores there. As a rule, the NFL finale is watching well over 100 million television viewers, it is also very popular in Germany.
Last year there was political controversy in advance. The dispute over the quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had refused to stand up for police violence against blacks, during the play of the national anthem, and had been hard hit by U.S. President Donald Trump, among other things. Out of solidarity with Kaepernick, some musicians rejected a super bowl performance - including Rihanna and Pink. That the Maroon 5 rock group was finally criticized by many.
An actor and Youtuber joins Egypt's ruler: Mohamed Ali, for the first time, prefers to stay abroad.
The two men, who had an influence on whether or not blood flowed on the streets of Egypt again, spent the past week abroad. One of the two of them returned to the airport of Cairo on Friday. President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly. Ex-General, who praised Muslim brother Mohammed Mursi in 2013, the country's first freely elected head of state, had spent a pleasant time in New York: U.S. President Donald Trump had pledged action against political Islam and lost no syllables about the human rights violations at the Nile - in a week when Egypt's security forces arrested hundreds of people because they had dared to protest against the president. He had \"no cause to worry\" Sisi at the airport in the microphones of the state television. \"The Egyptians don't let themselves be carried into the wrong\"
Mohamed Ali, of course, remained abroad, where he escaped the access of the security forces who would immediately arrest him if he tried to enter the Egyptian soil. Weeks ago, the 45-year-old was known as an actor only a minority of the Egyptians. Today, he is the tone-giving voice that dominates the political discourse in the cafés, the living rooms and tea-stubs of the country: with his Youtube channel, Mohamed's secrets, Ali calls upon his countrymen to raise himself against Sisi.
He goes directly to the head of the state and in quite a rustic language. While the people hunger, the president swung in luxury and let himself build magnificent new palaces, it is there. The military leadership, based on Sisi's rule, accuses Ali of corruption and enrichment. Because in his second occupation as a construction contractor for 15 years with exactly these gentlemen, he seems to know quite exactly what he is talking about - that is, the impression of many Egyptians, as shown by the click figures that have just exploded.
Last week, after Sisis Griff had demonstrated thousands against his rule for the first time, and almost 2000 citizens, among them prominent figures of civil society, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, had been arrested, Ali called for a “million march” this Friday. It was unlikely that so many people would venture on the streets. However, there were smaller protests, for example in Giseh near Cairo, as well as in the city of Kina near Luxor. Videos in social media showed protests that Al-Sisi took place and demanded his departure. During these protests, the police also set up tear gas and rubber shots. These videos were initially not independently verified. The police called them to end the protests.
From the city of Mansura in the Nildelta, where demonstrators broke banners last week with the portrait of the president in pieces, massive police presence was reported on Friday. Security forces built checkpoints in the city and on the road to the exits. Several subway stations in downtown were closed because of maintenance work, most of the streets around the Tahrir Square, the heart of the 2011 Revolution, were blocked. And on the Rabaa Square, on which in 2013, followers of the fallen Muslim brother Mursi were disbanded, until the army took them under fire and killed up to 800 people, another measure was to prevent that discontent: Sixs Zukunftspartie wanted to hold a large announcement for the president.
Mohamed Ali made these precautions to change his tactics: “Our goal must not be the Tahrir Square,” said Ali in Barcelona in his video camera. “Let us not clash with police officers, but as a retreater this is not to be understood: “All Egypt is the Tahrir Square”
If the provider promises too much performance
The Internet connection seems to be always much slower than the provider, there are different testing possibilities.
Those who conclude an Internet contract do not blindly need to trust the speed data of the providers. Customers can check for themselves how much of it is actually achieved.
Finally, the previously promised transfer rates are a part of the contract and should therefore also be achieved, explains the customer centre of Bavaria.
If the connection is always much slower than applied by the provider, there are various testing options. Thus, the measuring tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transmission rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the contract.
\"The tests carried out by the providers are, however, based on specific specifications and are therefore not uniform and objectively calculated, giving Bayern the consumer centre the opportunity to consider them.
If the connection is much slower than announced, customers can set a reasonable time limit for the provider, usually 14 days, to produce the promised performance.
If this does not work even after multiple calls, customers can cancel and may also require compensation. However, in the event of remaining success, only the appeal will help.
First ranking Republican for investigation
As the first ranking Republican, Vermont's Governor has expressed himself for an impeachment investigation against US President Donald Trump. “I think the investigation is important, yes, and where it is carried out from here, is determined by the facts that are found, said Phil Scott at a press conference on Thursday. He wants to know more about the whistleblower cases before measures - an impeachment procedure can lead to the resignation of the President - are taken.
Scott said that he was not surprised by revelations that Trump had repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj to investigate interventions by the democratic presidential and former vice-president Joe Biden in Ukraine. Trump observed Biden for years.
Republicans have so far held back criticism of Trump because of the whistleblower affair; few have shown discomfort for this. Scott's statements are a first sign of this in Trump's party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has already repeatedly opposed Trump's policies, such as the locking of environmental protection regulations and the tightening of immigration regulations.
Spider-Man remains in MCU: Further Marvel film planned
It was a shock to all Spider-Man fans: At the end of August it was announced that Sony and Marvel will go separate paths in the future. Tom Holland's Spider-Man would therefore no longer be part of the \"Avengers\" universe. Completely unclear how to proceed with the films around Tom Holland.
Now the surprise: Spider-Man receives another final third film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) after \"Spider-Man: Homecoming\" and \"Spider-Man: Far From Home\" (MCU), which several US media report in agreement. Therefore, the film is already scheduled to start in the United States as of 16 July 2021.
In the magazine Screenrant, Marvel-Boos Kevin Feige is quoted as saying: \"I am pleased that Spidery's way is continued in the MCU. I and all at the Marvel-Studios are very pleased that we can continue to work on it ... He is the only superhero with the ability to play in different universes, as Sony continues to work on his Spidery verse. You never know what the future will bring.
But how does it come to the sudden good news? Suppose Sony Marvel should have made an offer. According to industry magazines, the Disney Group, which also owns Marvel, would participate in the revenue of Spider-Man films with 30 percent. However, the message is not confirmed.
So Duchess Meghan and Prince Harry appear in the Suits finale
After nine seasons, the series “Suits” has reached the grand finale in the United States. In the last episode, there have been many happy ends and as many Cameo appearances. And also the royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who participated in the series for many years, have been awarded tribute in a charming way. Attention, the following sections contain spoilers for the series finale.
For one thing, Duchess Meghan did not return for a final farewell as Rachel Zane did, at least not for new scenes. Instead, a few reviews once again showed the most memorable scenes with today's Duchess. For example, the moments of the failed and the failed wedding with Mike or how she welcomed him after his absent sentence.
But also her real husband, Prince Harry, was mentioned in the “Suits Finale”, of course, in a wedding scene. When Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) was shouting straight towards Altar to marry his fiancée Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51), Harvey Specter (Gabriel Power, 47) makes a striking remark about his suit. Whether he actually threw himself over a gown, the disguised Harvey wants to know about the groom, only to note snippishly: “Louis, you are not the Prince of England, but you are not the Prince of England.”
Aegean: Baby and four other children drown at boat crash
A baby and four other children were drowned during the querning of a refugee boat in the Aegean. A total of seven people died in the accident, as the Greek Coast Guard announced on Friday. Nationalities were still unclear.
The boat sank near the Greek island of Inousses, located between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland. Four children, three women and five men could be saved.
Currently, hundreds of migrants from Turkey are transferring to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean. Last year, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) 174 people were killed. Federal Minister Horst Seehofer has now announced that both countries will want to visit.
Together with his French colleague and the competent EU Commissioner, he wanted to \"inform himself in Turkey about how it is about the refugee situation - said Seehofer on Friday. Afterwards, he wanted to learn more about the \"administrative problems of the Greeks\" in Athens to help deal with the problem.
A spokesperson for the EU Commission confirmed on Friday the planned trip of Seehofers with EU Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and France's Minister for the Interior Christophe Castaner.
In Greece, there are still an unusual number of migrants from Turkey. On Tuesday alone, 654 people were transferred to the Greek islands, it was mentioned by the Greek Ministry of Civil Protection on Wednesday.
Is the Turkey deal still working?
The increase has led to doubts about the functioning of the EU-Turkey Agreement, concluded in 2016. This means that the EU will be able to send back all refugees and migrants who illegally enter the Greek islands through Turkey. In return, the EU wanted to take a Syrian refugee from Turkey for any Syrians who had been deported.
The processing of asylum applications, however, is difficult due to the lack of personnel on the Greek side. Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos , according to the Ministry of Civil Protection, account for almost 29 400 people. The worst is the situation on Lesbos: 5200 migrants are currently housed in a warehouse with capacity for 650 people.
Since the entry into force of the EU-Turkey Refugee Pact in March 2016, there have never been so many, reported the State Round Radio.
Climate change: Heat leads to more heart attacks
According to physicians, climate change will test the health system in the future. Climate change is \"very safe\" one of the biggest challenges for the health system over the next 20 to 50 years, said Andreas Zeiher, President of the German Society for Cardiology. In particular, the cardiovascular system created high temperatures and high temperature springs within a short period of time and caused increased heart attacks. In particular, people with cardiovascular diseases, elderly people and diabetics were affected.
Green politician must be responsible for embarrassing photopane
The head of the Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, in the election campaign - was the cup manipulated for this reason?
The Canadian Green Chefin holds a multi-way cup in a photo. But now came out: The cup was manipulated.
Ottawa/Canada - It has remained unnoticeable for quite a long time - and finally it appears. Elizabeth May, the head of Canadian Greens, never kept in hand with the reusable coffee cup with metal straw. On the party's website, she was seen on a photo with this cup, in conversation with citizens. However, the photo had already been published and also distributed to the media - and there the cup was still a sneaker (paper) cup, as the Canadian National Post reported.
Green Chefin must be responsible for photopane
The National Post then suggested manipulation and that the party produce Fake News in order to appear more credible in the issue of environmental protection, and this in the middle of an election campaign for the Lower House election, in which Trudeau also has an increasing difficulty because of a bribe scandal.
The photo went viral in the social media and facilitated the discussion about Fake News. A user shares a counter-translation of the photos and writes: “The Greens manipulate a photo of their presidents to hide their disposable cups,
In order to emphasize this, she immediately posted the original: you, in conversation with citizens, put a cup in her hand. However, the one she did, was from bamboo. She always did. A speaker of the party said that it was just about putting the party logo in the picture, and not hiding something. The photo is just another section of the website.
May writes that she is sorry for the employee who did. “I don’t want to call him stupid, but there wasn’t anything to hide,” she says to the Guardian, and at the same time she asked herself something about her team, “if they’d like to edit an image again, they wouldn’t be able to do anything with my face, so that I look younger,” she says.
The German Greens have also been told about their use of one-way plastics or flight trips in Shitstorms - but their pictures were not photoshopd. So the boss of the Bavarian Greens, Katharina Schulze, reported on the holiday ice with plastic spoon, as mercur.de*.
Influencer wants to upgrade: Lifelong flight ban at Cathay
In fact, Jaqueline Ng was granted an upgrade via email from Cathay Pacific. However, when she asked for it, she was not allowed to fly on board and she should never fly with Cathay again.
Spontan gets an upgrade for the Business Class - many passengers dream of it. Sometimes they are lucky, and the staff at check-in offer a change from the Economy Class for free.
However, this case shows how not to do it: A self-explained influencer has actively asked the Airline Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade. On Instagram, Jaqueline Ng is following more than 65,000 users. On May 30 she flew back from Taiwan to New York and on June 7th.
On the flight, staff Jaqueline refused an upgrade, even though they showed a mail in which her Cathay Pacific allegedly offered an upgrade. The letter was intended to have the influence of an airline marketing employee. On the other hand, the airline accuses Jaqueline of having faked the mail.
On the return flight, Jaqueline tried again to get an upgrade for the long-distance flight. This time the woman should have shown the same mail, but with another reference number. The employees at the JFK airport were skeptical: they were following up at the headquarters. And indeed, the employee from whom the mail is said to have rejected the mail contact with Jaqueline. This also confirmed the mail system in which the messages did not show up.
The airline employees at the airport canceled Jaquelines Ticket and imposed a lifelong flight ban with Cathay Pacific. For $1,400 (about EUR 1,280) they had to buy a new airline ticket to Taiwan.
In her case, the influencer turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company representing consumer interests, because Cathay had paid her the price for her original ticket, but Jaqueline also demanded the cost of the new ticket back.
But as long as Jaqueline does not submit the metadata of the mail, the case remains clear: Cathay has committed fraud to the influencer, she remains locked for future flights. Airline’s terms of use also state that she does not have to pay for the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to be satisfied with this and now turns on a lawyer.
Oil prices, according to the report on the ceasefire in Yemen,
Oil prices fell by more than one dollar on Friday afternoon. Recently, a barrel (159 litres) of the North Sea variety Brent $61.83 - about 1.4 percent less than the previous day. The price of a barrel of the American variety West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell by 1.3 percent to 55.77 dollars.
A report from the Wall Street Journal on a ceasefire in Yemen was a trigger for the course slide. Saudi Arabia is supposed to have agreed to a ceasefire in four areas.
A drone attack on the oil plants in Saudi Arabia had caused five percent of global oil production in mid-September. The Huthi rebels in the civil war country Yemen, allied with Iran, had declared the attacks for themselves. Saudi Arabia, like the U.S. government, is responsible for Iran. A ceasefire would defuse political tension in the region.
If an agreement is actually reached, one could focus on growth and demand, said Ole Hansen, Head of the Raw Materials Strategy Division at the Saxo Bank of the Bloomberg News Agency.
The oil prices continue to move down the last few days. A barrel of WTI oil cost up to nearly $59 a week ago, Brent almost $65.
Finally, Bloomberg had called on insiders to report that after the attack in mid-September, repair work on oil plants in Saudi Arabia was progressing faster than expected. Therefore, the production volume had again reached a volume of eight million barrels per day and moved back towards the original quantity.
Recently there were multiple press releases calling on insiders who reported rapid progress by the government oil company Saudi Aramco in the repair work. However, raw material experts pointed out that Saudi Aramco currently wants to plan a stock market and avoid negative headlines.
At the same time, some relaxation was apparent in the conflict between Iran and Western countries: the British oil tanker, Stena Impero, is more than two months after the capture by Iran and the recently issued release on the way to leave the port. The crew are now preparing the departure, while the ship is still lying in front of anchors, ship owner Erik Hånell informed Swedish radio in a SMS on Friday morning.
However, the U.S. announced to move defence missiles and soldiers to the Iranian archenemy to Saudi Arabia. The fear of escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom had significantly increased oil prices over the past few weeks.
Suggestions against Trump intensify
In the case of possible abuse of power by U.S. President Donald Trump, allegations against the White House have become loud. Several leading government employees had made an intensive effort to prevent access to the text of the conversation after a controversial phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July. This declared an anonymous announcer. The spokesman of the House of Representatives, the Democrat Nancy Pelosi, explicitly accused the White House of being “tutored”. Trump spoke of a “hex hunt”
North Korea considers third summit of Trump and Kim questionable
North Korea has raised doubts that the nuclear dispute will soon lead to a third summit of power of Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump. The sense and prospects of such a meeting are questionable due to a lack of progress in implementing agreements from the first summit in Singapore, said top diplomat Kim Kye-gwan on Friday according to the KCNA Agency.
The US had not done anything to implement the summit decisions in the previous year, said the consultant to the North Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He also criticized intensified US sanctions and the joint military maneuvers of the United States and South Korea. However, he hoped that Trump's decision, both wise and courageous, would come to an approach again.
Trump had said on Monday that he only wanted to know what a third summit with Kim should bring before he was ready to explain. The negotiations on the disarmament of the North Korean nuclear and rocket program have been held since the failed second summit of Trump and Kim in Hanoi in February. In June, both met in the demilitarized zone between the two Korean states. They agreed to revive the discussions, but so far without great success.
Prince Harry: Weapons manufacturers are supposed to help with mine clearance
The British Prince Harry in Angola has symbolically fired and destroyed a explosive mine with a blue split protection vest. He created the ignition circle near a camp of the British Halo Trust at the village of Dirico. At a safe distance, the explosives exploded. With a view to the goal of getting Angola free from mines by 2025, he later asked for running TV cameras: “I call on all the countries whose names are on those weapons, but who have not helped in the way of getting away to help,” he said.
Pound under pressure - interest rate reduction expected
British Pound Under Pressure
In view of a short-term reduction in interest rates, the pound loses value compared to the euro.
Frankfurt Speculations on a fast interest rate reduction of the Bank of England (BoE) are increasing the sterling pound. On Friday the UK currency paid up to 0.4 percent to $1,2269.
The sellers were statements by the note banker Michael Saunders. This led to a reduction in interest rates, even if a chaotic brexite could be turned away, as the uncertainty would affect the British economy for a foreseeable time. This statement was surprising, since Saunders was a champion of a restrictive monetary policy, said Ricardo Evangelista of the ActiveTrades Broker House.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed out the burdens on the economy by the Brexit Hickhack without directly signaling a reduction in interest rates. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to lead his country out of the EU without divorce agreement on 31 October.
More: With his provocations, the British Prime Minister was at high risk, but it could pay off for him, says Handelsblatt editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: Other Russian manipulations
Material from the Moscow analysis lab is manipulated - this confirms David Howman, former director of the World Antidoping Agency (Wada) and current integrity leader of the Athletics World Association.
New details of the doping scandal in Russia are coming to light at the start of the athletic World Cup - and they destroy the little credibility of what Russian sports had gained at the beginning of the year and also only slightly. In January 2019, the Moscow Doping Lab finally delivered the required samples from 2012 to 2015 to the World Antidoping Agency (Wada). Now it turned out: They were faked.
In December 2014, systematic fraud had been revealed in Russian sport. Wada had not completely banned the Russian Antidoping Agency (Rusada) for three years. During this time Russian athletes were not completely banned from the world stage. After individual examination at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio in Rio, the International Olympic Committee launched some 270 athletes under neutral flag, with 168 Russian athletes at the start of the Winter Games in February 2018. They were also allowed to attend World Cups in the various sports, in the summer, even the football World Cup with the host.
Missing positive findings
In the following September the Wada raised the Rusada banner again, but requested access to the laboratory and the said samples. The data should provide information on the extent of the confusion of doping cases during the state doping. They should help to penalize athletes afterwards. Three months later they were finally delivered.
However, the Chairman of the Independent Integrity Commission (AIU) of the Athletics World Association (IAAF) has now confirmed that the Doping data was manipulated from the Moscow Analysis Laboratory. “Yes, we have received the data nine months ago. We should check whether the Task Force has received the right data,” said David Howman in the interview of the “Frankfurter General Newspaper” of Friday. “We have found numerous discrepancies between the data that Wada received from a Whistleblower and those that she received from the Russians in January, many positive findings that were mentioned in McLaren’s report.
The World Cup is not affected
This confirms IAAF's attitude: The athletics association holds as the only organization in Russia. At the World Cup in Doha, 30 Russian athletes start under neutral flag. They have had to prove that they train outside the Russian system and undergo tests.
At the beginning of this week, the Wada had already put the manipulations in place and asked Russia to respond to the allegations within three weeks. Russia is now threatening the new Rusada locket and, in the worst case, the exclusion of the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.
