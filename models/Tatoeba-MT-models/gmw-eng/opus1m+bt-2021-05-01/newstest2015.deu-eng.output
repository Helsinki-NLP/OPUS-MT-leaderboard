According to reports, India also hopes for a treaty on defence cooperation between the two nations.
Karratha Police arrested 20-year-olds for fast motorcycle hunting
A motorcycle was seized after the driver drove it at 125 km/h in a 70 km/h zone and through Buschland to escape the police in Bilbao.
Traffic police in Karratha tried to stop a blue motorcycle this morning after observing how it left a gas station on Bathdate Road at 125 km/h.
The police report that the driver then ignored the stop signals and continued on the Burgess Road before moving to the bush country where the officials lost sight of it.
The motorcycle as well as a person who corresponded to the description of the driver were later seen at a house in Walcott Way in Bulgarra.
Karratha's police accuse a 20-year-old man of not respecting a stop signal as well as careless driving.
He was to appear in Karratha on 23 September.
The motorcycle was secured and seized for three months.
George Webster charged for hotel rapes in Naim and Pitlochry
A man is in court for rape of women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was read the charge at a hearing by the Supreme Court in Glasgow.
He is accused of having raped a woman at Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry in Perthshire on June 7, 2013.
The charge is that Webster attacked her while she was “conscious, asleep, and unable to signal an agreement”
Webster is also accused of having raped a second woman at the Golf View Hotel in Naim in the Scottish highlands on May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Rae established the negotiating term for November 17 at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh.
Recalling the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
Congress members Keith Ellison and John Lewis have submitted a bill to establish the organisation of unions as civil rights.
“As trade unions die, the middle class jobs also die,” said Ellison, a Democrat from Minnesota and deputy chairman of the Progressive Caucus in Congress.
Therefore, I proudly present the employee empowerment law together with the civil rights icon John Lewis.
This pioneering law gives workers the same legal possibilities for discrimination because of the organisation of trade unions as with other forms of discrimination - and thus stops anti-union forces.
The addition of the national law on labour law to create a possibility for workers exposed to discrimination to organize a trade union representation in order to sue a civil court for justice - and to obtain damages or penalties - is a sensible and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis, and the other sponsors of their bill suggest is the connection back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks imposed by trade unions in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other countries throughout the country - Americans have once encouraged countries around the world to recognize, extend and uphold labour rights.
There was a time when millions of Americans were still remembering democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right of association.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution to ensure that the militarized autocracy would replace Hedki Tojos with democracy.
Conscious that workers and their unions took on a role in creating a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly acknowledged that “the rights of workers to union and joint bargaining and action are guaranteed,
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff pushed the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that Fascism would replace Adolf Hitler with a strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that workers would have to organize themselves and raise their voice in the new nation, the Germans introduced a clause that explicitly stated: “The right to establish associations to secure and improve working and economic conditions is guaranteed to every individual and every profession or trade.
Agreements which restrict or aim to narrow it down are null and void; measures aimed at this are illegal.
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Human Rights Commission, from which the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was designed, as adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a worldwide agreement, Roosevelt and the other authors added a guarantee that “everyone has the right to form or join trade unions to protect their interests,
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labour rights are human rights.
When this country discussed how civil and democratic societies could be formed, Americans stated that the right to establish a trade union - and that this trade union should then be protected in collective negotiations as equal partners with companies and government bodies - must be protected.
After these rights are seized in America, it is indeed very wise to bring the American ideal back to mind, according to which the working population must have the right to unite and be heard in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. fifty years ago said:
The story is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the labor movement did not limit the strength of the nation, but increased it.
By raising the standard of living of millions of people, work has wonderfully created a market for industry and raised the whole nation to unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but the story preserves them.
History remembers, and we should do so too.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of civil rights protection as protection against discrimination in the creation of employee representatives - has long been overwhelming.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that have made America great in the past and triggered the promise of democracy.
Judge stops temporary law that all abortion clinics in Louisiana could force them to shut down
A U.S. federal judge temporarily stopped the implementation of a law in Louisiana on Sunday, the lawyers say that it would probably have led to the closure of all five abortion clinics of the state.
This measure, taken by Bobby Jindal, Governor of Louisiana, in June to the law and to enter into force on 1 September, would force doctors performing abortions to acquire a patient's right to take a hospital within 30 miles radius.
The judge's decision, however, means that doctors may temporarily continue to carry out legal abortions while applying for such a right.
\"The plaintiffs can continue to work in accordance with law while striving to obtain these rights,\" wrote Federal Judge John deGravelles in his judgment.
Within one month, a hearing shall be held for the judge in order to make a more lasting decision for the law.
Abrogation advocates welcomed the decision, the latest in a series of judgments against similar measures and said that doctors would spend so much more time obtaining hospital admission rights.
\"Today's decision means that women in Louisiana are missing a deteriorating law that wants them to take their health and rights,\" said Nancy Northup, president and chairman of the Centre for Reproductive Rights, who had complained on behalf of three of the five clinics of the state in order to stop the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the ruling also extended to doctors from the two clinics who had not joined the appeal and had also applied for admission rights.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have passed similar laws, with courts recently declaring such measures in Alabama and Mississippi unconstitutional.
Key points of a Texas law that would have forced most of the clinics remaining in the state to shut down were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
The American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association agree that admission rights of doctors require unnecessary restrictions.
Abrogation opponents oppose the fact that the measures serve to protect the health of women, although some also welcomed the effects of closure of clinics.
Only a doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has a right to admission, the Center for Reproductive Rights informed.
If all the other doctors in the state are forced to stop doing abortions, this doctor would be afraid of his safety no longer performing the surgery, the group said.
In their argument against the verdict, the State of Louisiana's representatives said that they would not punish doctors for carrying out abortions while their requests for patient admission rights were still pending.
Delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment methods lead to higher death rates for eggstock cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have posted a video homework for her mother online, who died of eggstock cancer in 2007.
For women in rural areas of Australia, there is a higher risk of dying of eggstock cancer than for women in cities.
Researchers analysed the medical data of more than 1100 Australians, where eggstock cancer was detected in 2005, and found that only 25 percent were still alive five years after diagnosis.
Research director Susan Jordan of the QiMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.
STUDIE: New medicines may slow down lung and eggstock cancer
The researchers studied the medical care of women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman in the diagnosis, type of ovary cancer, pre-diseases and social and economic status also affected her chances of survival.
For older women and those whose cancer was already advanced at the time of diagnosis, the survival rate was lowest.
For those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.
Although the study did not investigate why women living outside the city died of higher likelihood of ovary cancer, Dr. Jordan suggests a delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centers as possible factors for this.
“This disease is best treated by gynecological oncologists, and these are usually found in larger cities,” she said.
Despite the improvement of telemedical services to counter the distances, as a possible remedy, it proposed a strengthening of the service of inflected doctors to enable specialists to provide women closer to their place of residence, as well as treatment programs for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that the study, regardless of geographical status, showed a poor long-term survival rate in ovary cancer women and underlined the need for better treatment and precautionary strategies.
The study financed by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a young mother of 33 years from the Gold Coast, learned that she had an aggressive form of eggstock cancer.
Garden centres regret sinking house owners' numbers
The decline along with an increased decline in the number of homeowners below 35 years could result in garden centers losing tens of thousands of pounds per year if today’s young consumers reach the “core age group for garden products” after a study by HTA, as reported in the Financial Times.
The report states that tenants spend an average of 55 percent of the amount that people with a home spend on their garden.
The increase in people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popular method of asphalting pre-garden for parking purposes, and the declining garden size are other factors that threaten the industry in which an estimated £5 billion is implemented annually in sales.
In London, where the share of homeowners has fallen from 61 to 43 percent over a period of 6 years, the lowest expenditure on garden products per household is mentioned.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that living for rent or small gardens does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, chief garden consultant for the RHS said: “Container gardeners, for example, are very popular with tenants because they can take their plants with them in a move.”
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the \"golden age\" of garden retailing due to increasing domestic property and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-90s.
He also predicted an improved market situation for this year due to the better weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement in Pakistan led by the opposition politician Imran Khan and the clergy Tahirul Qadri continues.
In the capital of Islamabad, about 1000 demonstrators stormed the state television station PTV.
Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said soldiers could have pushed the protesters out of PTV buildings again.
The transmitter set up its operation for about 40 minutes, but now sends it again.
At the same time, some 3000 demonstrators tried to reach the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
About a kilometer away, they supplied themselves with sticks and stones equipped with security forces.
The police used tear gas.
The demonstrators demanded Sharif's resignation, but he rejected it.
The army of the country is therefore calling for a political solution to the conflict, “without wasting time and without using violence”
After a meeting in the headquarters on Sunday evening, the military announced: \"The army remains committed to ensuring the security of the state,
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has already been more frequent.
The opposition politician, Imran Khan, proposes Premier Sharif to have been involved in the parliamentary election last May.
The protests were escalated on weekends after Khan and Qadri had called on their supporters to advance to Sharif's residence.
Three people were killed.
Turkey appoints US-Diplomat for spying reports
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has sent out information to the country's oldest U.S. diplomats on a report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent said that the executives of the U.S. Embassy and Turkish officials had discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept reported that the former U.S. analyst Edward Snowden showed that Turkey was a major activity area for U.S. and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was down the importance of the report and said that all the important countries were spying on each other.
An earlier report, which also had the most important intelligence service in Germany's Ankara in the visor, caused significantly worse reactions from the Turkish government.
Warning strike: Lokführer threatens with consequences for commuters
The national alert strike of the local leaders on Monday evening could also affect passenger traffic in NRW.
The distance announced for 18 to 21 p.m. concerns all transport companies, including long-distance, regional and S-Bahn transport, throughout the country,
The main direction of the alert strike is freight transport.

said the district president of the trade union German Locomotive Leader (GDL), Sven Schmitte, in Düsseldorf.
We expect significant failures.
Regional priorities do not exist.
The main direction of the alert strike was freight transport.
The Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced to do everything to minimise the impact.
However, the GDL did not say where they wanted to strike, so it was difficult to foresee the consequences in detail.
Police chief of Magaluf of Corruption accused
On Friday, the prosecutors presented evidence of extortion by police officers and employees of the city of Calvià to the state prosecutor's office of Mallorca.
The chief of the police of Calvià on the island of Mallorca was arrested in the notorious Binge Drinking Hotspot Magaluf after corrupting accusations by businessmen and bar owners.
Chief Commissioner José Antonio Navarro has been arrested after charges of corruption against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most of Magaluf's bars and nightclubs are located.
According to the Mallorca Diario online newspaper, the prosecutors presented evidence of extortion by police officers and employees of the city of Calvià to the Office of the Anti-corruption Office of Mallorca on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in connection with the corruption allegations and are questioned jointly with Navarro by a judge.
The national Spanish daily ABC reported that the angry nightclub owners said that the veterinary economy of the authorities had serious effects on their business.
“It’s no longer about serving money, it’s about surviving,” said one of the businessmen to the court.
Let's get our life base out of the game.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer due to a viral YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British tourist who took part in 24 men during a sauftour Fellatio.
Since then, the island authorities have tried to stop the irregular behaviour of alcoholic holidaymakers in Magaluf by minimizing the number of participants in the notorious alcohol-controlled pub tours.
The Playhouse Club, where the Fellatio incident took place, was forced to close for one year, while Playhouse and the Kneippentour organiser Carnage had to pay a penalty of €55,000 ($73.000).
The tourist town of Magaluf, which is especially popular with young British holidaymakers, is also known for a number of alcohol-influence accidents, including the trend of \"balconing\" when people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony to the hotel pool.
The first spring day with wet and stormy weather conditions affects flights from Adelaide Airport
The FRÜHLING has given South Australia a winter surprise, with fierce showers and strong wind, which interfered with flights from Adelaide Airport.
In the evening until 2 p.m., another 5mm rain fell on the city, after 6.6mm, which had already fallen to Sunday at night.
The last precipitation was the result of a series of short, stormy showers, including a guise that started just before 20 o'clock and caused almost 4mm of precipitation in about 10 minutes.
After the winter had provided for an early spring dose last week, the temperatures in the city fell again on Monday to a maximum of only 15.8°C.
The bad weather conditions probably led to the delayed landing of a flight from Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane should have landed shortly after 7.30 p.m., but was hit by a sharp wind - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to start through.
Windstorms reached around 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at that time.
The flight data showed that the aircraft had to start even on a second landing and finally set up at about 20.40.
The delay in flight resulted in the delay of some other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney.
For Adelaide, a maximum temperature of 16°C is predicted on Tuesday, with possible showers.
Matthies means: Highest time to network
In view of the galloping technical progress that threatens to turn our comfortable home into high-tech shell centers, our columnist Bernd Matthies comforts himself with an extremely familiar electronic accessory.
As I write this, my eyes fall on the spiral cable that connects the listener to the phone, and I think: Boah, how retro is that?
But there is a thought behind it: if the cable were not, all listeners would fly around the house in no time, and that would be even more retro.
After all, is it true that ekeltronic (ekeltronic?
No, typing error: electronic) sector the rule that today's world news is the electric debris of tomorrow, bought - obsolete.
For example, whoever still has a tube TV in the living room today, for example, simply says that he rejects television in principle.
Why these considerations?
Because the pressure of the Ifa at the radio tower this week again leads us to face our absolute incompetence in questions of electronics.
The layman, who had blindly mastered the former washing machine and CD players, does not even understand the purpose of the devices, which are spread out with incomprehensible eitlem expert talk in front of him: “Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies, the press office promises us.
Yeah, you okay?
What should we talk about with people who seem to volunteer to spread such quarks?
Basically, it has been about 20 years since, above all, that we should be networking our house in the most convenient way.
To get the yoghurt back on its own so that the fire detector will tell us on vacation on the Maldives that it is burning gradually in the work room.
And wouldn't it be wonderful if we from the office were to air conditioning on our arrival ...?
Yes, however, this requires air conditioning.
But a dream will come true soon: We lift our watch, tell you loudly, \"sucking\" - and at home, the dust-sucking rug goes away.
I'm wrong.
Everything runs out of nothing less than a revolution: “The boundaries between white and brown goods are floating around an industry identifier, one can connect the washing machine with a headphone, the steamer sends the weather report and the data glasses show how long the pizza still needs in the oven, but that doesn’t benefit us because we’re standing in the bar.
We also know from our daily practice: if a new-mode device is used really urgently, the battery is guaranteed to be empty.
What is another reason why the spiral cable on the phone will survive the next radio exhibitions.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from the areas near the Gaza Strip returned to the schools on Monday after spending the summer in air-protection rooms, while rocket and mortar shooting on their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas and the schools in Gaza remained closed while the area recovered from the fighting.
The start of the school brought a sense of joy and expectation to the communities in southern Israel, drawn by rocket shotholes, but the signs of the battles are still fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, staff of the \"Pashosh\" Kindergarten, which was hit by a rocket, were located before the arrival of students of grenade splitters from the walls and sliding walls.
“We’re a bit scared, but we’re excited,” said Ronit Bart, a resident in Kibbutz Saad and an English teacher there.
Many children from our area urgently need to return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said it felt \"a bit funny\" to suddenly go back to school.
“These were difficult times, and we didn’t leave the house at all,” she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbutz near the border to Gaza to offer his support.
Until a ceasefire broke the war last week thousands of residents of the border communities like Saad stayed in their homes or left their homes to move further away from Gaza in safer areas and escape the rocket and mortar fire.
Many inhabitants of Nahal Oz, a municipality near the border with Gaza, where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar grenade, still hesitate to return.
The Ministry of Education reported that about a dozen families had not returned.
Her children were temporarily accommodated in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanjahu attended a school in Sderot, a border town in Gaza, which was badly drawn by the Palestinian shell.
He appealed to the children to learn a lot and said, \"We will make sure that you acquire knowledge and provide you with security.\"
Israel and Hamas agreed on an unterminated ceasefire last Tuesday.
The ceasefire brought about an immediate end to the fighting; however, important problems remain unresolved, such as Hamas' demand for the withdrawal of the Israeli-Egyptic blockade of Gaza and the reopening of air and sea ports in Gaza.
Israel calls for the disarmament of Hamas and the surrender of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the battles.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to start in Egypt this month.
In the war more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, three quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children according to estimates from the Palestinians and the UN.
Israel contests these information and estimates that at least half of the killings are fighters, but did not provide any concrete evidence of this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4,591 missiles and mortar grenades during the fighting on Israeli cities, most of them in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of houses in the Gaza area and about 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools, which were converted into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in the protective areas and continue the fighting, the educational authorities postponed the beginning of the school year last week.
“I hope the school will soon be open to us so that we can continue to learn, as did the children in the world and the Jewish children,” said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who currently lives in a school in Gaza City.
After election in Saxony: CDU-Vize Strobl asks NPD prohibition procedures
In view of the loss of votes of the NPD in Saxony, CDU-Bundesvize Thomas Strobl has declared himself before the Federal Constitutional Court for an end to the ongoing NPD prohibition procedure.
Berlin - According to CDU-Bundesvize Thomas Strobl, the ongoing bans against the NPD should be brought to an end before the Federal Constitutional Court.
“The NPD cuts worse than the last time,” said Strobl, who is also CDU Landshef in Baden-Württemberg, the “Leipzig People’s Newspaper”
This is an enjoyable development in the right direction and a development that makes me more likely to result in a political struggle against the NPD rather than before the Constitutional Court.
The NPD had failed very little in the five-percent hearing on Sunday.
A first call for a ban on the right-wing party failed in 2003 because constitutional protection at that time also had informants in the NPD peak.
In December 2013, after long preparation, the Federal Council submitted a new request to Karlsruhe.
Federal Government and Bundestag did not join.
Harburg: Tents for new refugees
Refugees are now placed in tents in New Zealand.
The first central reception for refugees in Harburg is from all seams.
Now the internal authority has placed three tents of the Red Cross next to it.
District politicians were only recently informed - they are little excited.
\"These Haruck actions continue to prevent citizens and give district politicians no opportunity to contribute constructively to the human housing of refugees, says for example Britta Herrmann, Group Chairman of Greens at the Harburg District Assembly.
Their party demands that the district administration of Harburg provide unused houses for accommodation at present.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
The reasons for the overcrowding in the first instance are the response of those seeking help - and the fact that the authorities cannot provide sufficient places in subsequent facilities.
Many refugees therefore stay longer than the regular three months.
The house prices have experienced the strongest winter rise in seven years, showing a widely observed index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for private homes in the Australian capital rose by 1.1 percent in August, according to the RP data from Monday.
As a result of this increase, the total increase in June, July and August is 4.2 percent, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 percent, more than twice as high as the increase in the 12 months until August 2013, but the increase was not evenly distributed across the country.
The research leader of RP Data, Tim Lawless, announced that Sydney and Melbourne were driving a two-part market.
RP Data figures show that the house prices in Sydney increased by 16.1 percent last year, while in Melbourne by 11.7 percent.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices averaged an average of five and six percent.
At the other end of the scale is Canberra, which has been hit hard by the cuts in government spending and where prices over the year have only increased by 1.4 percent.
Mr. Lawless continued to say that for the next few months, with the start of spring, there would now be an increase in the real estates that would be sold, which would be subject to the market \"a real test\".
“If one considers the ongoing high rate of auction prices, a generally rapid sales rate and the persistently low interest rate environment, it is likely that home prices will continue to rise in the next three months,” he said.
In an opinion to the New Press, he contradicts statements by the managing director Peer Medau and attests to this, like a field master, to pose.
The style of higher education is not this, says the Communication.
The Medau family had already been informed orally about the university's arrival in mid-June.
The statement that the plans only became known in July is definitely wrong - according to Pötzl.
At the same time, he pointed out that the plans were not \"pre-fixes or even decisions\" but were \"priorities\".
The necessary expansion of the narrow road up to the castle for access was also less dramatic than feared by the Medaus.
From a nine-metre- wide street was and is not the talk.
It's going to be about 5.50 metres, which is one meter wider than before, explains Pötzl.
The Medau operators' argument that their free and school-based parking spaces will only be used by university students in the future does not apply to Pötzl.
Train parking is not going to be at all because this can now be solved intelligently as with other public parking spaces.
Think of the locals
According to the President of the University, the mountain village, which is located on the grounds and which would lead the entrance to the park deck in front of its door, is not to be affected,
Rather, he gives thought to \"that this is not only about the children's crib, but also about the residents at the junction to Friedrich-Strij-Straße and the 800 students of the neighbouring real school.
So this is much more than the partial interests of Mr. Medau, so Pötzl.
Whether or not the criticism of the Children's Crippe's Parental Council, with the expansion of the road, would be lost to a “the few natural spots of Coburg,” is justified, “can the reader decide for himself”
At the beginning of October, Pötzl, together with the State Building Office, Bamberg, intends to inform city councils about the structural development of the university by 2020, and to address the importance of the new development.
Peer Medau had informed the parents of the child crib last week about the plans of the university.
Therefore, the access for the new park deck is not intended to take you through the campus and Friedrich-Strieb-Straße, but through the Medau-Berg.
This would require two-track expansion of the narrow road at about a kilometer in length.
According to high bills by the Medaus, traffic in the park of Hohenfels Castle would be tenfold.
About 2000 vehicles per day are talking.
On the side of the city, the project had not yet been announced.
Glandorf resigns from handball national team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old of the Bundesligist SG Flensburg-Handewitt addressed health problems for this decision in particular.
The decision is not easy for me, it has matured for several months.
It is time for me to listen to the signals of my body and finish my career in the national team - the world champion of 2007 shared on his Facebook page.
With a balance sheet of 167 national games and 576 goals for Germany he goes to international retirement.
Because he wants to go on goal hunting for several years for the Champions League winner from Flensburg, he is no longer available to the new German coach Dagur Sigurdsson.
With the Icelander, who announced his framework for the national games against Switzerland on Tuesday, Glandorf started a long and good conversation.
His ideas and approaches have fascinated me just as they will inspire my long-standing fellow players and my successors.
But for my club, I would also like to be well available in the next few years, which requires longer regeneration breaks that do not allow the current double load.
The left hand had to fear his career after a heel infection in 2012.
Due to achillescent problems, he had been treated by team doctors of the German Handball Federation (DHB) with a cortisone syringe, which later caused a severe inflammation.
An emergency operation and two further interventions followed.
Then Glandorf had announced an action against the team doctor, the dispute ended with a comparison.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team career do not pass by any body without trace.
I have some health building sites that I can no longer ignore.
After the three foot operations, which took place in short intervals in 2012, I never got my blood pressure right in the grip.
To this end, there are some other wearable complaints.
Even at the beginning of the year, I noticed that although I can control my head, I can't fool my body - Glandorf explained in the interview to the magazine Handball Time
For a comeback, he would only be ready in the absolute emergency.
“When all the knittings are tearing, I’m always ready to talk,” the two-time family father explained to the specialist magazine.
However, I can count the years in which I can still play handball on one hand.
I also have to say that after my long stay at the hospital in 2012 I have also become quite humble with regard to my health.
After my career, I'd like to be able to do something right now.
He won the EHF Cup in 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo).
In 2012, he also secured with Flensburg the Europe Pole of the Pokal Winners.
German economy shrinked by 0.2 percent in spring
The crises surrounding the globe have slowed the German economy in the second quarter.
Gross domestic product decreased by 0.2 percent from April to the end of June 2014 compared to the previous quarter.
This was communicated by the Federal Statistical Office and confirmed preliminary calculations.
Consumerism alone revived the economy in the spring, while investment declined.
External trade also slowed down the economy.
Thanks to the strong annual start-up, a total GDP-plus of 0.8 percent for the first half of the year will be compared to the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and the goal of the \"Münsterland-Mooiste\" which on Sunday for the first time led through the Burgmannsstadt.
On Sunday, the Burgmann city of Horstmar experienced an invasion of Dutch footballers
The largest cycling association in the Netherlands, NTFU, organized the so-called \"Münsterlande-Mooiste\"
It is the largest bike tour across Münsterland, the cycling paradise near the Netherlands.
More than 1000 participants thanked Jos ter Huerne for organizing this tour through Münsterland.
This tour was offered in various journals.
We come from Den Helder and have been driving overnight to take part in this tour.
We would like to get to know Münsterland in this way once more - the cyclists were delighted by the route through the circles Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After registration in the club home of the Schützenbroderschaft Sta.
Katharina went on a small \"peace trip\" through the city over the wall, where the start took place.
Further, the route, which was written out for three different categories, headed Herrenholz across the Schöppinger Berg towards Coesfeld and across Havixbeck and Bildenbeck back to Horstmar.
On routes of 95 kilometres with 1175 height meters, 120 kilometers with 1475 height meters and 145 kilometers with 1775 height meters, cyclists proved their good condition.
They were used on their way to Havixbeck and Bildenbeck.
Chief Organizer Jos ter Huerne and Mayor Heinz Lölfing were very pleased about the success of this cycling event.
We are satisfied and it was a beautiful experience for all involved.
The organization was without any problems and there were no negative incidents - Heinz Lölfing draws a positive conclusion from this event.
Unfortunately, not as many participants as the organiser had expected, which was probably due to bad weather forecasts and morning rain.
“We will see ourselves again in 2015 in hopefully beautiful weather on August 30 or during another weekend, but the cyclists still promise to return to Münsterland and the organizers plan a new edition.
Konstantin alarm clocks carelessly honest memoirs
It is actually more philosophical testimony than biography, which has brought Constantine Wecker, Songmaker, Pacificist, politically safe activist, ex-haftling, to paper on 287 pages in \"Mönch und Krieger\".
Not chronologically, but more thought-fittings for thought-fittings, the Municher, born on June 1, 1947, wrote down his memoirs, each chapter initiated by a suitable songtext.
And he is frankly honest: from the Onanie as a gymnasium to the shop theft and drug use, he leaves no human weakness.
Also to show how he has learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow humans.
Wide space also takes abstract, but all the more important terms: love, soul, ego, being now, spirituality - all of which he tries to go to the ground, in a very philosophical but also very personal way.
And he also explains his pacifism, his social criticism, his political commitment - and also how he not only influenced the music (the opera lover became a soul and rock musician), but also his prison stay.
The latter has also brought the Lebemann Konstantin Wecker to the ascetic monk, who, as he says, \"is born, by subtraction, by leaving everything unnecessary\"
There are also short anecdotes to the earth between all the high-level views: for example, about beatings in one of GI's frequented locals or an amazing car ride, where he offered a tree in frontal.
Even there he is undefiledly honest.
Lenny Henry: My father never took me into his arms.
Never said, \"I love you\"
Henry was one of seven children of a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and their relationship was limited.
Henry tried for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which was partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and came from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He visited many therapies after the death of his mother, and Henry is thoughtful about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
One never saw his face, only heard his voice: “Hear up with the crack.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to see Cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who had already grown up when I was a child, went to the pub with him and talked about things like the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket stroke.
I never had such a conversation with him.
Much of my life he was this serious guy in the corner that read the newspaper.
Recently, Henry opened a foundry in Dudley, and although conditions are better than at the time of his father, he gained an insight into how life might have been for him.
It's a little brighter now, but they're dark, shaded, deep rising labyrinth with flames and smoke and a lot of rust.
My father used to just put himself in the tub and then one could hear him slowly as he began to sing because he could wash the casting of himself.
When I was there, it became clear to me that he had done this for years to bring the food to the table, and my respect for it grew.
Nevertheless, Henry grew up as a child without his parents ’ expressions of love.
My father never hugged me, he never said \"I love you\"
Only when my mother went bad towards the end of her life did we begin to say, \"I love you, I love you, I love you.
Through his own daughter, Billie, with Dawn French, he was able to share the love he had missed as a child.
Could you stop with that, I love you?
Stop hugging me!
Daddy, I'm 22!
with Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
It's still friends with French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn's a good person.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother was diabetic.
That contributed to her death.
So when I became very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, \"You have to be radical.
So I went through this fitness thing and also had to make a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's strenuous.
Nobody likes to eat carrots.
Henry's career change may appear in his elegant, short cut beard.
Since he was praised by the critics for his Othello, he has been accepted by the theatre.
It followed The Comedy of Mistakes, and then Fences of August Wilson.
This is a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that have filled his busy working life.
He started at only 16 years of age when he worked in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on stage when he imitated people and wrote to New Faces about him.
His television career began in the mid-seventies. “I was the only black imitator/comedian on TV for a fairly long time“
He learned in the profession.
Not only did I have to grow up in front of the public, but I also learned from 1975 to 1985 how to become an efficient joke telling machine while I was a star through television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
Since his manager had the right to the stage at the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program in which the people \"painted themselves black\" Henry performed his comedy there for over five years.
My family was very uncomfortable.
I wish it had never happened, but I don't regret having done it.
It was a strange, unpleasant position for me, but I worked on giant projects and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But this “year-long award-winning light pillar of British television” was also a “big parody of black people”
By introducing figures that ridiculed and celebrated British black culture, Henry worked in the eighties on an alternative comedy circle.
The first series of Lenny Henry Show was broadcast in 1984, and in the nineties he was known among other things as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!
Advertising, documentary films, TV series and film roles shaped his next decade, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv 2008 he thought, \"What are you doing next, Len, because everything feels like you're just spending time around or a little on the spot,
Then came a documentary series for Radio 4 entitled What's So Great About ...?
The first episode revolved around Shakespeare.
To Shakespeare, I was totally allergic.
I had never really learned anything about him in school and mainly thought of him as a middle-class domain, white in tight pants and a coalhead in front of him.
So I was scared of it.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said, \"You should try it.
Don't worry if you don't know what you're talking about.
Take some of the words into your mouth, and then you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare that way.
Henry recorded 20 lines from Othello's last speech for the documentary and he was thrilled.
I felt I could do that.
It was almost as if someone had put my head right at last.
“That’s why it’s a serious thing, take them seriously, learn your text, research a bit.
The samples were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we made it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car accident, and that just didn't happen.
And soon he appeared in the comedy of error.
Suddenly I was in the national theater and I could hardly believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, \"Oh, you've changed, \"
There was a technical mistake and Henry instinctively felt he had to entertain the audience.
“A little voice said to me, “You have to bridge for 10 minutes now while they repair the computer,”
Instead, the stage manager announced that the performance continued as soon as the problem was solved.
I walked off the stage and said something inside me, \"Oh, thank God\"
I'm not responsible for that.
I can leave it to someone else.
\"You play in a play, so stay in your role,
Henry in Fences at Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for Fences was challenging.
Panic is very good, which strengthens the tendons.
This too was good, so it's like a large shield from the gods that tell me, \"This is your determination\"
He says this, of course, with a DONDERNING voice.
So I'll stay with you.
I really love that.
I love being in a rehearsal room.
Henry, however, still has the head of a comedian - our conversation is perplexed by humorous outbursts, while he repeatedly imitates persons.
I decided not to make a stand-up comedy because I find that this kind of instant satisfaction from a hall full of strangers is somehow dangerous.
If you look for it all the time, you drive it in front of a wall.
I sometimes perform live in Apollo when I have a desire to do so, but overall, I don't have as much as I used to do.
I'm asking him if he'll ever make a stand-up comedy tour again.
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps shape a beginning, a middle part and the end of a trip - I don't think I ever want to give up that.
So is this his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like being an actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and that's great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Huthi rebels block streets in Yemen capital
In the conflict between Shiite Huthi rebels and the Yemeni government, the Huthis called for civil disobedience in the capital of Saa.
Huthi supporters would have occupied central streets in Saa on Monday, said a spokesman of the Huthi Party “Ansar Allah”
The access to Parliament has also been blocked.
Yemeni media reports of a traffic chaos in the capital city.
According to the online issue of the newspaper \"Yemen Post\" Huthi leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi had called on the measures on Sunday evening.
Huthi, according to the sheet, threatened with a further escalation of the conflict, should not be met.
The Shiite Huthis fight for more independence from Sunni ruled Yemen and demanded the resignation of the government.
The Huthi tribe has been besieging the Yemeni capital for almost two weeks.
Some 30,000 rebels have set up protest camps on the major access roads of Saa.
In the surrounding country there is always bloody fighting with the Yemeni army.
Kenya Registers Officials to Detain 'Spirators'
Kenya has begun to biometrically register all state officials to remove \"spirited people\" from government salary lists.
Employees who do not register in the next two weeks would no longer be paid, was a government announcement.
The government suspects that thousands of people still receive salary payments even after their departure from the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to fight corruption in the public service in 2013 when he took office.
In an investigation at the beginning of this year, it was found that at least $1 million (700.000) per month were lost in payments for ‘spirits employed’ and other abusive financial practices.
The government suspects that salaries will continue to be paid on accounts after a person dies or leaves public service, reports Wanyama Chebusiri for BBC from the capital of Nairobi.
All officials must now appear at identification centres in the next two weeks to ensure that their data on biometric registrations are recorded, has been notified in a government message.
All those who would not do so without a credible apology were further informed by the salary list.
\"This approach contributes significantly to the rationalisation of the public service by identifying the actual number of officials and also adjusting the salary list at both levels of government, thus eliminating the \"spirits employed,\" said Anne Waiguru, the cabinet secretary at the Ministry of Decentralisation and Planning.
The scandal around the art consultant Helge Achenbach will be negotiated before court for the first time on November 11.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, son of Aldi founder Theo Albrecht, demand 19.4 million euros of damages from Achenbach and two of his companies in insolvency proceedings in a civil trial at the Düsseldorf Landgericht.
That's what a court judge told us on Monday.
In the application it says that Achenbach cheated on the purchase of works of art and old-timers and that Berthold Albrecht calculated higher than actually paid purchase prices.
As a result, the agreed commission was also higher.
Achenbach bought valuables for Albrecht for 121 million euros.
Children need roots and wings
He spent 44 years in school, 23 of them as head of school.
From this time Manfred Richter knows many well-known Petershausener and Kollbacher from their time as a student.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always driven by his desire to see the people in the pupil.
The snowhead is the most famous mountain in the Giant Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motif from his homeland.
Judge was born in 1930 in Trautenau/North Bohemia, today Trutnov.
He was interested in the teaching profession after four years of high school.
A year later the Sudeten Germans were disbanded.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave their house.
After a few months in a camp, it went to Bavaria - in the freight wagon in 1946.
That's how the judge went to the Upper Franconian Senkendorf.
Teacher education took place in Bamberg.
In addition, Manfred Richter had to run ten kilometres to the nearest station six times a week, drive by train to Bamberg, go to school three kilometres across the entire city, and return in the evening.
After two months Manfred Richter got a bedtime in a Red Cross home in Bamberg: together with up to 15 fellow students in a dormitory.
In 1951, he took the second state examination after three years of teaching in 1954.
Since Oberfranken had no free teaching position for him, he applied for Oberbayern and came to the school in Kollbach on November 1, 1954.
The “Freulein-Room” was its first “service apartment” in the schoolhouse.
In 1958 he moved to a three-room apartment in the newly built teacher's house next to the school.
This house bought Manfred Richter in 1980 after the school was dissolved in Kollbach in 1968.
Until then there were three classes in Kollbach in the school association Petershausen-Kollbach and five in Petershausen.
From the school year 1968/69 these were collected in Petershausen in today's town hall.
When the School Association Indersdorf was founded, only the primary school remained in place.
In order to escape a resurgence in the now smaller school, the former rector Georg Sigl moved to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
But Petershausen grew up, and as of September 1982, the children and their teachers were able to refer to the present building, which was extended in 1997 after Judge's retirement.
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor Ludwig Götz, who, at municipal cost, had built a working room and in the extension of 1997 basement rooms, although this was not eligible according to the guidelines for school buildings.
“Citizen Master Götz was very school-friendly,” said Richter gratefully.
Throughout his career Manfred Richter has never forgotten the speech of a government representative who had responded to a lecture by a school council on law and justice: “You must never forget love - Manfred Richter did what he had heard as a young teacher.
“You have to tell the children two things: roots and wings - the one today says 84-year-old.
And he had to learn: “It doesn’t always work — whether he’s just talking about his students or about his own six children, it’s not quite clear.
In any case, Judge Tun was sometimes unconventional.
When pupils were beaten, they did not receive punishment from him, nor were they condemned for being resuscitated.
At the expense of the municipality, Judge had two pairs of boxing gloves created and had the two contenders oppose each other, even if there was to be a quail.
For the benefit of the school, Judge as Rector maintained a good relationship with the then Mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).
This moved the partyless judge after his retirement to apply at least the latter on the CSU list for the municipal council in 1996.
But Judge was elected to six and joined the CSU.
180 kilometers in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 cyclists set stopovers in the spa park of Bad Salzhausen and Schotten
When cyclists rush on their tour in Bad Salzhausen or Schotten, this is nothing special in itself.
On Friday, however, only the number of racers made an impression: the 700 participants of the hr4 cycle tour and the companion tross enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of Bad Salzhausen and later a party under free skies in the Schottener Alteburgpark.
Under the motto “Radling and celebrating on newly discovered paths between Nidda and Kinzig, the participants met in Bad Vilbel on Thursday and enjoyed a concert by Van Baker & Band.
On Friday it became serious: the cyclists took the first stage, which took 60 kilometres across Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and further into Schotten.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes were welcomed by Mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who was in Bad Vilbel by bicycle, and the head of the private company Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing-Döring.
To refresh body and mind, all kinds of good things had been prepared: the rural women from Ranstadt and Lower Mockstadt had baked 85 sheets of apple, tweezers, straw and cheese cakes, which had been wonderfully mouthed by the powerful cyclists.
“This cake can only be baked by a countrywoman,” a participant from Aulendiebach praised, while he ordered another piece.
At the drink level of the Turnverein Geiß-Nidda cold refreshments could be achieved.
The “Duo Bravo” entertained visitors with famous melodies from operats and musicals and received enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful atmosphere of the park seemed relaxing.
A gentleman also enjoyed a head massage from his partner: “He earned it, and finally he has already re-assembled broken bicycle chains today,
The mayor and manager still had to work: they were interviewed at the well in front of the drinkhouse by reporter Rainer Janke and took advantage of the opportunity to cast on the radio for Bad Salzhausen.
The doctoral director Tobias Hagen, who has been a tour manager since the first hr4 cycling tour in 2004, has only recently been able to do so, but he has had a lot to do with the technology on site.
His pickup truck, in which he communicated via three telephones and a radio device with his employees and the 15-person motorcycle staff of the police Hessen, wrote Facebook entries and made reports, also needed a check.
“The majority of the participants came from the Rhine-Main area,” he said, “but also from Gießen or Fulda, from Lauterbach or Taunus and even from numerous cities in Westphalia, cyclists have traveled.
The number of participants shall be determined a bit according to the overnight capacity available.
In category I, participants are accommodated in hotels, in category II in collection accommodation.
From the spa, the cyclists had a good impression when they returned after one and a half hours: \"Bye-bye\"
“It was nice in Bad Salzhausen - they waved to good luck.
After arriving in Schotten, the group was allowed to take a short break.
But in the evening the cyclists were demanded in the idyllic Alteburg park.
Under the direction of the Scottish Society for Tourism and Urban Marketing (GTS), the park had received a beautiful ceremony and of course had prepared delicious eggs, such as flame cakes with well-cooled spring whites.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS Managing Director Markus Hoßfeld and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs in his role as board member of the ADAC Hesse-Thüringen welcomed visitors.
The three were clearly pleased with the “many operations in Schotten”
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance stage.
The opportunity to swing under free sky has been used diligently despite the sporty activity on the bike.
Among the guests, more and more citizens were missing, as were the big crowd of cyclists, who were affected by the good mood.
On the second day, the stations Birstein, Wachtersbach and Bad Orb - including a concert with the Trenkwalder - were on the program for cyclists.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometres of cycling, the athletes entered Bad Vilbel again.
Dozens of Turkish policemen arrested against the government for \"conspiracy\"
A total of 33 police officers were arrested in Turkey on the basis of the suspicion of \"suppression against the government\", reported local media agencies.
The police did not comment directly.
Among the arrested are 14 high-ranking police officers, reports Hürriyet Daily News.
Some of them were involved in the corruption investigations against government employees, including four ministers of government last December.
In July, a number of Turkish police officers were arrested because they allegedly established an organized criminal association and had picked up phone numbers.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was then Prime Minister) described her action as part of the activities led by the Islamist clergy Fethulla Gullen against him and other people in positions of power.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (1 September) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenij Jazenjuk brought his daughter to school.
There he told waiting journalists that not all schools had opened again, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in every school.
Heaven is not peaceful throughout Ukraine.
We have to fight for a peaceful sky.
The whole of Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian people's front must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukhow, head of school in Slavjansk, visiting Jazenjuk's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally prevail here and that the children will receive an education that will be useful to them in future life.
The first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons in their hands and giving flowers to their teachers.
With Rona Fairhead, BBC may have found the great director she needs.
It meets with a proud glory drag from the banking world, media management and the inner circle of the Tory Party.
And she has her own front experience.
Her career began with the global management consulting company Bain and Co., which she moved to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and Pearsons' media world.
She was CEO of the Financial Times for seven years and resigned when the top post of the parent company Pearsons went to a younger male colleague.
Her invention allegedly amounted to almost £1 million.
Her political ranking is also solid.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, former chairman of BP as he sought more private economic knowledge in Whitehall: she became a cabinet consultant.
Her husband is a former Tory council member.
As early as May, I described the chairman's task with a poisoned cup.
Not only does BBC stand as a huge and complex unit in the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Trust works in two directions: inwardly on the first guard of the own management hierarchy in BBC, but also outwardly as a voice of public concern and unrest when things run wrong.
This ensures an almost unsustainable duopol, which requires a complete comprehensive reform.
But which newly arriving chairman would risk entering, striking on everything and taking apart an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while perhaps bringing itself around his job.
It's a difficult task.
And as if that wasn't enough, many are also interested in seeing the BBC reduced - power, money and status obsolete.
While competition is getting closer and new technologies are threatening old, comfortable security, the upcoming negotiations on licensing fees for BBC are associated with special dangers.
For the modest sum of £ 145.50 a year, the UK public is buying itself into the certainly largest media company in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it says it reaches 96 percent of all households and each of them costs only 40 pence a day.
And apparently the BBC is rising up again on the popularity scale: 53 percent are supporting it today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
The viewing and usage habits for BBC have changed: Today I get news headlines on my phone and see missed programs later on my iPlayer.
But she remains a very beloved and remarkable institution.
She needs a considerable chairman - I hope she found him.
Perry from Texas says that defeating Tweet was not authorized
A tweet from the official account of the Republican Governor of Texas, Rick Perry, on Sunday contained a negative comment about the democratic district attorney, who is at the heart of a criminal charge against him for abuse of the official force.
The Tweet was later deleted and replaced by another Perry's user account, which disproved the previous one.
A tweet has just been sent from my account that wasn't authorized by me.
“I don’t approve the tweet and have deleted it,” it said in the later message.
Perry employees did not respond immediately to requests for comments.
Although the tweets of Perry's official user account were out, it was not clear who is actually serving the feed.
In the previous tweet, an unprofitable picture of Travis County district lawyer Rosemary Lehmberg, who was sentenced to tax in April 2013 was drawn.
Perry filed a veto against the financial support of her office when she refused to resign, leading to an indictment against Perry - who might be a presidential candidate in 2016 - before a Grand Jury this month in Austin.
The second text says: “I don’t always go drunk with the three-fold permissible alcohol level ... but when I do, I complain to Governor Perry when he peeps it out“
I'm the most drunk Democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not entrusted with the management of the investigation of the Grand Jury against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was selected by a Republican judge.
Perry pleaded for not guilty and called the charge a political trick.
His high-class team of legal assistants applied to the judge entrusted with the case to reject the charge and argued that the law passed against the most senior governor in Texas's history is unconstitutional.
Perry stopped $7.5 million of government funds at the State's Public Integrity Unit - which is located in Travis County and in cases of state corruption in Texas - when Lehmberg refused to resign.
This veto caused a public complaint on the part of a left-wing watchdog group.
Perry's official user account is frequently updated - and sometimes famous.
After he had completed his fifth in the elections in Iowa during his presidential candidate 2012, Perry went on speculation that he would stop by posting a tweet of a photo of himself at a lake near him, with the words “South Carolina, we are coming”
Berkeley again declares the housing market to be \"normal\"
One of London's most prominent contractors pointed out that the housing market in south-east England was back to normal level.
Homes in the capital were highly sought and subject to enormous price increases, which prompted the Bank of England to set ceilings for mortgage loans in June due to the widespread fear of a credit bubble.
Tony Pidgley, founder and CEO of the high-class building company Berkeley said on Monday: “Since the start of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the highest level in 2013, and added that this has been a ‘stable environment of action’.
The real estate market in London was well established during the downturn as foreign buyers pushed into the capital.
According to the Cataster Office's information, prices in the city area rose by 18.5 percent in the past year alone, far more than the average increase in England and Wales as a whole.
The average selling prices at Berkeley's private, priced and student offerings rose by about one-fifth in the past year and by the end of April was £423,000.
However, a stronger pound has made real estate ownership in London less attractive for foreign buyers in recent months - some of them have also been deterred by the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric for a possible \"village tax\" before the general elections in May.
The London real estate broker Foxtons warned last week that the mortgage market report for April, in which sharper lending arrangements were presented, would also lead to lower market growth in both real estate sales and prices in the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England on Monday show a decrease in mortgage approval in July, which also indicates that the real estate market is cooling down.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, corrected its forecast for the increase in real estate prices in London for 2015 down to 3 percent, based on a now weakening home price awareness.
The transaction volume in the most expensive areas of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, has now decreased by one quarter every year, according to the broker WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, the desire for a home in the capital city for Berkeley is a blessing, as the due amounts for sales amount to more than £2.2 billion.
Mr. Pidgley added: \"The demand for the right well-planned product at the best locations remained stable and as a result the sales of the dates remained stable,
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in that year until the end of April - almost a third more than the highest level in 2007 before the crisis.
The annual pre-tax result rose by 40 percent annually to £280 million, turnover by 18 percent to £1.6 billion.
In a communication on Monday before the annual meeting of the company, Mr Pidgley said that the revenue for Berkeley is expected to meet current market expectations in the current year.
The analysts estimate the annual pre-tax result to be £ 450 million.
Berkeley shares stood firm at £23.96 in London in the afternoon.
Naked photos by Jennifer Lawrence published by hackers on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence appearance at the 85th Oscar Award.
Naked photos by Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence were published online by a hacker who claimed to have a “master list” of images of more than 100 Starlets.
A representative of the star from \"The Tribute of Panem\" confirmed that Lawrence's photos were real and complained to the hacker for \"explaining violation of privacy\".
The authorities have been notified and will track all those who continue to post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos that were originally posted on the 4chan photo-sharing page were allegedly acquired through a gap in Apple's iCloud online storage system. The alleged “masterlist” of the hacking sacrifice includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, who reported BuzzFeed.
It is not certain how many of the pictures are real, although Winstead, star from Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world, also condemned the hack on Twitter.
“To those of you who look at photos that my husband and I took in the private environment of our home years ago - I hope you are so well satisfied with you - Winstead wrote on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justice from the Nickolodeon series, iCarly and Victorious, argued that the photos were about pictures of her and tweeted, these so-called naked pictures of me are GREAT, people.
Let's take a look at the beginnings. *Wordplay intends*.
Buzzfeed reported on the late Sunday that a spokesperson of the pop star Ariana Grande rejected the authenticity of the alleged photos from her.
Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson's new novel about love and the letters \"J\"
They floated, so one could best describe it, they slowly dissolved like a cardboard that was left in the rain.
Sometimes a woman told him that he was too serious, strenuous, intense, distant, and perhaps somewhat scratchy.
Then shake his hand.
He knew a scratch brush.
He was crazy, like Igel, yes.
The last victim of this barbarism was an ongoing affair, which was more promising for a relief of the lonely boredom of his life than any other, and perhaps even brought him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a dazzlingly tender beauty with untamed hair and a flattering heart from a village on the northern island, which was even more remote and harsh than Port Reuben.
She had come to the south with an older companion, which Kevern had held for her aunt, who had inherited a plot in a damp but paradise valley called Paradise Valley.
No one lived in the house for more than several years.
The pipes were leaky, in the baths there were still spiders, naked snails had left their tracks on all windows, and believed they belonged to everything, and the garden was overgrown with weeds that looked like huge coal heads.
It was like the house from a baby girl, both threatening and tempting, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel \"J\" is on the longlist for the Man Booker Prize 2014.
The shortlist will be announced in the next week.
Kevern had sat with Ailinn handcuffingly on the broken deck chairs in the high grass and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon. Both had calmed down mentally into the service console, which provided the country with calming music and soothing news when the sight of their crossed brown legs reminded him of an old song by a long forgotten black entertainer, whose father liked to listen to closed roller shops in the home.
Your feet are too big.
Due to their honest aggressiveness, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Not prohibited - Nothing was so properly forbidden - simply not played.
It has been successfully obsolete, just like the word obsolescing.
The general taste created what permission and regulations had never been made, and how people in books choose the Vom-Tellerwasser-zum-Millionär-Memoires, cookbooks and love novels, so they chose the ballads in music.
In the euphoria of the day Kevern began to play an imaginary piano and to sing great feet in a rough-comic serenade Ailinn.
Ailinn didn't understand that.
“This was a famous song by a jazz pianist named Fats Waller,” he explained and automatically put two fingers on his lips.
His father had always done this to stop the letter J before he got out of his mouth.
It had started as a game between him and his father when he was little.
His father had played it with his own father, so he had told him.
If you start a word with a J without two fingers to your lips, it'll cost you a penny.
It hasn't been a very funny game since then, and it wasn't very funny even now.
He knew that this was expected of him, that was all.
It had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard of any.
Jazz, although not directly forbidden, was not played.
Improvising was no longer modern.
It was only room for a single \"if\" in life.
People wanted to be absolutely certain where they would end at the beginning of a melody.
The same is true of the mind.
His improbability made people nervous.
And jazz was musically expressed mind.
Although he was 10 years old without having heard from Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about jazz from his father's semi-secret collection of old CDs.
But at least he didn't have to explain to Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
At her age, she probably could not remember a time when pop singers were not black.
Again, no laws or constraints.
A compliant society meant that each element of this society gratefully agreed to the principle of group talent - grateful as those spared from fate.
People with African Caribbean origin were suitable for entertainment and sport through temperament and body building, so they sang and ran.
People originally from the Indian subcontinent were blessed with electronic talent as by nature and were entrusted with the task of ensuring that no family remained without a functioning service phone.
What was left of the Polish Community concerned the sewerage; what was left of the Greeks smashed plates.
Those from the Gulf States and the Levante, whose grandparents had not left the country quickly as WAS GESCHHEHEN WAR, WE WERE HAD - out of fear of being accused of burning, even for fear that the flames would consume them the next - had opened Labneh and Shisha Pfeifen restaurants, thought of themselves and became depressed with the inactivity.
Everyone according to his abilities.
Since she had only heard ballads, Ailin found it difficult to understand how the insulting words the beetles had just told her could ever be shown.
Music was expression of love.
“They’re not really insulting,” said Kevern.
Except maybe for people whose feet are too big.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved this song.
He talked too much, but the neglected garden gave him the deceptive feeling of security.
Nothing could overcome the sound insulation of the huge coal-like leaves.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why would your father have loved such a thing?
He wanted to say that it was a jux, but he hesitated to put two fingers on his lips again in her presence.
She thought he was a little strange anyway.
“It seemed funny to him,” he said instead.
She shook her head and blocked Kevern's sight.
There was nothing more to see around the world than her uncommitted black hair.
There was nothing else he would have wanted to see.
“If you say so, I mean it without conviction.
But that doesn't explain why you're planning on me.
She seemed really worried.
Are my feet too big?
He saw it again.
Your feet aren't so straight.
Maybe your ankles, a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
You hate me?
Of course I don't hate you.
That's just the stupid song.
He could have said \"I love you\" but it was too early for that.
“Your thick ankles are exactly why you like me, ” he tried instead.
I'm a bit perverse.
That didn't sound right.
It should have been funny.
When he tried to be funny, he often found himself in trouble because, like his father, he did not have the calming charm that was needed to embarrass the horror inherent in jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel too.
Maybe he wanted to be that, Kevern.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomons was red and lifted up from her chair, threw the console around, and spilled the wine that they had drunk.
Holunderflower wine, so drunkenness wasn't an excuse for him.
In her excitement, she seemed to tremble, like palm wed in the storm.
“And your thick head is exactly why I feel drawn to you perversely,” she said.
Except I'm not.
She hurt him, both because of the unnecessary unkindness of his words and the fear that she showed in her eyes when she leaned against him.
Did she think he'd hit her?
She had not told him of the life on the cold northern archipelago where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially the way it was here.
The same huge and icy ocean broke here as it did on the shore.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and more sad after THEM WAS DESIGNED WAR when their ancestors had been smuggling and beach robbers, pulled from knee to knee, always ready to raise their hand against a woman who refused or laughed at them.
Dickkopf?
They would have shown her a thick fist if she hadn't been careful!
She first nodded - Knuts was the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, a counter-gift to the non-saying love ballads from the console - they first protrude and then beat.
In Kevern's view, this was an unnecessary refinement, since the biting itself was an act of violence.
Ailin Solomons gave him a sign through her body.
He rose from the chair like an old man.
She also felt as though she had remained, but she was surprised by the growth of his grief.
That wasn't the end of the world.
They hardly knew each other.
She looked at him, as he was away - as a room on the top floor had her companion with him - a man who was complaining by what he himself had sworn up.
Adam left the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, although some had raised their hands against her.
A man turned away from her, bowed his back, shamed, defeated, without a spirit of struggle - why was it a sight that she seemed to know well, if she could not remember a single time she had seen such a thing before today?
When she was alone again, Ailin looked at Solomon's feet.
Several years before the events just mentioned, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher, was working on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative public mood monitoring body, on a short lecture on continued violence at low and medium-sized levels in exactly the parts of the country where their reduction, if not abolition, would have been most expected, in view of the funds and energy invested in eradicating this violence.
“A lot has already been done, and much has yet to be done,” she wrote, “to stress the innate aggressiveness of a people that has waged a thousand wars and won most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country where the sweet breath of human kindness has been historically seen despite the high-responsive churnings between the hedges.
But some properties appear to be inexhaustible.
The higher the church tower, the lower the passion he continues to awaken.
The population weeps at hearing sentimental ballads, is puzzled at stories of overwhelming difficulties and claims to believe firmly in the virtues of marriage and family life, but yet not only does the former roughness hold the rural communities as well as our urban fabric, but there is also evidence of the emergence of a new and lagging conflict at home, at work, on the streets and even on the playing fields.
“They have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate,” her mentor said, as he had read the whole report.
I suggest you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum lowered her head.
I also have to ask: are you an atheist?
“I don’t think I have to say that,” replied Esme Nussbaum.
Are you lesbian?
Again, Esme called on her right to privacy and refusal of the statement.
Feminist?
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
“I don’t ask that,” Luther Rabinowitz finally said, “because I am against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
This is a prejudice-free job.
We serve a prejudice-free society.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which in itself are absolutely acceptable and commendable, can occasionally distort results as you presented them.
They themselves obviously have prejudices against the Church, and these things, which you describe as \"unresponsive\" and \"hard\", could be interpreted by others as well as expression of a natural force and vitality.
If you continue on the road, WHAT IT IS like yesterday, if it would have happened yesterday, it means taking the country's essential life force.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, an LED letter in Flamingorosa repeated the advice that Ofnow had given the country in the last quarter of a century or longer.
Smile to their neighbors, appreciate their partner, listen to ballads, visit musicals, use their phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, the singing word is better than the written one, but nothing is better than love.
“I absolutely understand what you want out of it,” replied Esme Nussbaum with a calm voice when she was sure that her superior had spoken at the end, “and I say nothing but that we have not been healed as effectively as we have been forming ourselves.
My concern is that without warning, we might find ourselves repeating the mistakes that were at all first leading to DEM WENN IS.
This time, however, it is not the others that we let go of our anger and our distrust.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands.
To show that an angel's tolerance.
“They go too far,” he said, “if you describe actions as ‘errors ’ that our grandparents may or may not have committed.
They also go too far if you say that they had left their “wow - and their “mistrust - to “other -”.
In fact, it should not be necessary to remind someone in your position that when we understand the past as in protecting the present, we do not speak of \"our\" and \"other\".
There was no \"we\" and there was no \"other\"
It was a time of disorder, that's all we know.
“Of those who, if we are honest with ourselves, dare to throw away Esme, “no part of society can claim to have behaved well.
I'm not complaining to anyone.
Whether it was done badly or well, what happened has happened.
That was then.
Nothing has to be said about this - we agree.
And just as no fault has to be assigned, no fault has to be solved, if such a settlement is appropriate and if there is a way to remove it.
But to what does the past serve if we do not learn from it -
The past serves to make us forget them.
If I can say anything about this -
Luther Rabinowitz collapsed his pyramid.
“I’m going to consider her report,” he said and dismissed her.
The next day, when she went to work as usual, she was taken over by a motorcyclists who, as described by passersby, had been on foot in a kind of brutal rage.
Accidents exist.
Lesotho military member says no coup was planned; Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Official representatives of the military in Lesotho fought to have a coup planned for the overthrow of the government and said that they opposed police officers who were accused of armamenting political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country and announced that the army of the country had surrounded its official residence and had occupied government buildings in the capital Maseru.
The Premier brought his family to neighboring South Africa after he had reported attack threats.
Military spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said that there was in fact no coup, but that the military was responding to the threat from “political fanatics” whose weapons were coming by the police.
“What happened this morning was that the Lesotho Defense Staff, after receiving several intelligence reports, that within the police there were some elements that actually wanted to arm some of the political, party political young fanatics who were about to cause devastating damage,” he said to Voice of America.
South African spokesperson Clayson Monyela said the military action made the impression of a overthrow.
“Even if no one has claimed to have torn the government in itself by force, all reports agree that the activities of the defense forces of Lesotho so far show signs of a coup,” he said.
Speakers of the military of Lesotho announced on Sunday that the soldiers were retreating into their barracks and the situation in the capital was quiet.
In the meantime, Vice Premier Mothetjoya Metsing took over the leadership during Thabanes' absence.
Thabane announced that he believed that he had become the target of corruption in the country because of his attempt to fight corruption.
In Lesotho there has been great tensions since June after Thabane suspended parliamentary meetings due to the disputes in his unitary government.
He said that his actions would not have left the government unterminated, otherwise-sounding accusations of spite.
Production in the Eurozone at a 13-month low
The increase in production in the euro area slowed down to the lowest point in the last 13 months in August, so a carefully observed study.
The final market manager index of the manufacturing industry (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, after a level of 51.8 in July.
An increase of 50 indicates an expansion.
New orders went back and factories experienced breaks in a time of increasing tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures shall be received before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
Markets expect the Bank to have a clear plan for dealing with a slow recovery of the euro area and with the threat of deflation at an inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There is speculation that during this week, the Head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could provide further information on whether he is considering quantitatively facilitating the euro area, in line with those made by the United Kingdom and the United States during the financial crisis.
“Although small growth is better than no growth at all, the slowing effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties have become more evident for manufacturers,” said Rob Dobson, leading economic scientist at Markit.
The factory PMI for Germany, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to the lowest level in 11 months with 51,4.
In the meantime, in the second largest economic nation of the block, France, the PMI fell to 46,9.
France remains a concerned child, as does Italy's decline from solid expansion to stagnation.
Note that growth incentives in the key industrial mechanism of Germany as well as in Spain and the Netherlands are no longer calming down, said Mr Dobson.
The decline in industry is likely to fuel analysts who expect further monetary or fiscal incentives.
A positive message came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI increased to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief business expert at IHS Global Insight, said: “The best thing you can say about the sales manager index of the manufacturing industry in the Eurozone of August is that the sector continues to grow thereafter,
He added: “Producers in the eurozone are obviously finding life quite difficult at present, as current increased geopolitical tensions - especially with regard to Russia and Ukraine - increase uncertainties in the still difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular, and consumer confidence, and are likely to cause some orders to be delayed or even cancelled, especially large orders.
He said that, more and more likely, the ECB would eventually have to initiate a type of QE, although we suspect that this will be limited,
The centennial of the survivors of Beslan: Ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school, as the children who were strangled in it still suffer.
Ten years ago over 1,000 people were taken hostages by Chechen militias at a school in Beslan in Southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day martyrdom that shocked the world.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death at the horror in the classroom.
Just a decade after the terrible siege of the school of Beslan, where 334 people died, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned of a new apocalypse in Ukraine last night.
As fanatic Islamist terrorists captured and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, the beginning of a new school year, this seemed like the worst of evil.
The tragedy united West and East in disgust, and then, surprisingly, turned into action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery.
Ten years later we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death at the horror in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, although the memory of this terrorist hell will pursue them forever.
Your greatest hope?
That the war that Ukraine is now seeking - and in the children as they die - is now ending.
The girl who was photographed in an attempt to climb back into the shot school gym
She was photographed and famous by Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakow when she only tried to climb back into the shot-out school gym after a mine exploded.
Fully confused, Aida searched for her mother, Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were considered dead, but they survived.
“A woman told me to run around my life, but I couldn’t, ” said Aida at the time.
My legs were blood-flowing.
I got up and climbed back in to look for my mother.
A soldier took her safely.
After a series of operations, she considered herself completely healed, but yesterday said: “The pain returned three months ago.
I'm afraid I have to be operated again.
Some of the pliables are still in my knees.
Their goal now is to become a dentist to help people as helped by doctors.
“This tragedy changed my life, but it didn’t break me down,” she says.
“That happened to me, and you can’t change that.
Once a year I always go to the sports hall to remind myself of those who stayed there.
My friends and I don't try to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were small and dreamed of going to school together.
“I don’t want to marry until I finish my studies and start my career.
I think of a family later.
She says that the siege will always remain part of her, although the memory will be somewhat weaker each year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our horrors and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in Britain and everywhere.
When I see the photo of me online as I climb back to school, I think that many people see it for the first time, understand our disaster, and contribute to the fact that such a thing does not happen again.
The boy who fled through the ball-haul, in the opinion that his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (Russians go to school at seven years of age) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother Tamara.
As a seven - year - old he said: “Mama told me to lie down when there was an explosion and hold her hand,
After an explosion, he thought she'd die.
She said to him: \"Run\"
Fearing she could be dead, he fled and saw on the way a crying infant, caught it by the hand, and fled through a ball hail.
His father Vladimir, who locked his son in the arms outside, said: “Damir told me his mother had died.
He said, “I couldn’t save her, ”
In reality Tamara was stunned outside and with leg injuries in the hospital, on the one hand assuming that her son had died.
After reunifying, she said: “I cry for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later flown to London (by the now dissolved News of the World newspaper) to receive the title of a Barnardo's Children's Champion by Premier Tony Blair and his wife, Cherie.
“This horror chases you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering,” he said yesterday.
But I can say it's going to blow up in my memory.
I remember throwing away all my toy guns right after that.
But now I can play computer games with shooting scenes and that's not a problem for me.
“I’m not afraid to go back to the gym, but I don’t think about myself.
I remember these kids with whom I played in the courtyard and who didn't make it outside.
We never say they were killed or killed.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember very well my trip to London, especially the toy store, where I could choose everything I wanted, and the trip in an open car above.
But now he is afraid of place like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of calamity he and his friends suffered.
This horror chases you every day, but I wish I could stop reminding myself.
“I’m so sorry for all those who suffer from the horrors,” said Damir, who worked as a volunteer in a monastery last week.
I'd like to help.
I want to go to the police one day and hope they'll take me to the training academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said: “37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine that?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were just no children who could call and walk around, and this silence lasted for many months.
She vividly remembers her trip to London with Damir.
People in London cried when I told our story.
I understood at the time how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her Foundation for the prize and the opportunity to travel to London in autumn 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her myself that 10 years have passed, but I still remember the meeting with her and her husband in London, and how Damir and I have helped.
I remember Damir wanting to eat Borschtsch and calling them all local Russian restaurants.
I remember playing with waiters in a restaurant. Damir shot at her with his water pistol and they ran away and played with him.
And that was only one month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said: “I always think this world has not improved in these 10 years.
In Ukraine the war continues now, and every day people die, and I believe that many children have been killed and are still killed.
These are just like our children.
I think that for many of the war is part of the news they hear when they are bored or busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, the whole horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and that is so sad.
Damir grew up and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he is not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he's not looking for revenge, he's not overwhelmed by the past atrocities.
I know he doesn't like to remember, but he has six close friends from the class and they occasionally go to the gym and light candles there.
When he was smaller, he suffered from it - I remember how he sometimes sat on the sofa, turned the face away from us, for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he threw all his weapons and other military toys away. Damir is now 17, bigger than I, well-looking, intelligent and healthy.
I can hardly believe that I was so sure for several hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and came to my feet, I looked around, and saw hell around me, with body parts all around.
I was absolutely certain that my little boy could have survived in this hell impossible.
“I remember walking away from him, “Damir, I was so sure he hadn’t heard me.
But he heard it, and he ran away.
And so life, unlike many others, goes on for us.
Georgij Ilyin, 17
The boy whose terrible image after the siege became the symbol of the Greuel of Beslan
Comfort: Beslan survivor Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege of 2004, right a picture of Georgij today
His blood-flowing face was filled with fear when he ran around his life while Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols for the Barbarei of Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, had put him down for his first day of school before she rushed to get her older son Vladimir to university.
“I left the farm about two minutes before the terrorists stormed him, and so my little boy stayed there alone for three terrible days,” she recalls.
Not entirely alone, there was a whole family of relatives of us, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgij managed to survive.
The closer this date is, the harder it is to think about it and talk about it.
There is no single day on which we do not remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's been a long time, I mean, it would have happened yesterday, some scenes from these days are always tracking me.
Nobody's ever gonna forget, I promise you.
Intrusive: The image of Georgij (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right).
I remember Georgij wanting to go to school that day, and he said he wanted to embrace his teacher.
I only knew he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there is even this statue of the weeping Georgij in San Marino.
Georgij doesn't like to see the picture, and it's hidden with us at home in the bookstore.
I understand this, but I also mean that people around the world feel our pain thanks to this image.
Georgij says today: “It is important that such a thing never happens again.
“I doubt we will ever learn the truth.
People examine such tragedies repeatedly and never learn the truth.
And now they're investigating the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever find out what caused him?
This world becomes something terrible.
“I can’t understand how this is possible, because if you ask people, no one wants a war, so how does it happen?
Ten years are nothing in such pain.
We need dozens of years to forget it a little.
It attacked my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years I had some nightmares because of the siege, but then it got better.
I went back to school later in 2004 and was scared every day.
I was thinking of my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That's why I always go to the gym when September 1st is getting closer.
I want to get my old childhood friend Tribute.
It's hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to do it.
I don't feel as a victim, this story is now part of my past.
I won't forget, but I'm not sorry.
My life goes on.
I completed school this year and attended a medical college in Vladikawkaz.
I'm gonna be a heart surgeon.
My first choice was training in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health didn't allow it.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that won't happen.
Georgij Fanijew, 20
The boy who survived, though he was caught at the feet of a murderous terrorist
A miracle: Georgij Fanijew was caught at the feet of a murderous terrorist during the siege, but he managed to survive.
During the siege he was caught in the gym and sat next to the bomb that was attached to the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It's really a miracle that he wasn't killed.
“We feel as if it had been yesterday,” says Georgij, who wanted to go to the FSB as a secret service officer, but could not do so because of his health damage due to the siege.
It's still with me, it's nothing I left behind.
I am older now and people say that children can easily deal with bad experiences - I have to say that is not true.
“I worked with psychologists in 2006 and felt a little better after that, but I can’t forget it.
And I'd like to forget.
2005 - the following year - was the first and only time I went back to the gym.
I lost consciousness.
I'm never going to return there again and please don't ask me to show you where I've been sitting in this famous picture.
Survivor: Georgij Fanijev today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is terrible and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know that I don't like to think about it or talk about it, and they never asked me about school.
Physically, I'm fine.
I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can run well now.
But because of my health, I could not study at the FSB's Secret Service Academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I have sent my documents, also the medical ones, and they have answered that it is not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I've been there for two years.
He learns how to treat all animals from cats to cows.
He said: “I knew that I would never tell my children about my experiences.
Children should know nothing about it, and they should not, of course, suffer either.
His mother Marina, 42, said: “This pain never leaves me.
He's in my soul, worse when the anniversary is getting closer.
I'll go to the celebrations to commemorate.
I know Georgij won't go.
It must be much more violent for him because he was there and I wasn't.
I waited at home for him and couldn't help.
I am so grateful to God that he was returned to me, and here in Beslan all of them are drawn.
It's in us.
Georgij is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.
It's hard to accept that if something so unfair happens.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't participate because of his knee.
He has been operated several times, he can run, but he can't drive a sport.
I would say he has overcome the horror to 50%, but you can never completely overcome and forget.
This terrible experience will always follow us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the siege and this only reinforces my pain.
I lost a lot of people I knew well and who were dear to me.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could make me, but my heart weeps for the slain.
I know of families in which new children were born, but also of widows who never remarried.
It's hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want it.
I'll never forget how my heart jumped into me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what is happening in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is now very close to our country and I almost can't believe it.
We used to be a friendly country, how could it be that we are fighting now?
People and children suffer, I am sure that many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many more have been killed.
If only we could grab and throw all these rebels out - as far away as possible.
Aljona Tskayeva, 10
The baby, so caught by a special operation command, was carried in safety
Reserved: Aljona Tskajewa is secured by a Russian special deployment command (left).
She is now ten (right) and does not remember the cruelty at all
The world kept breathing in 2004 when the baby Aljona was carried in the arms of a Russian policeman from the Beslan siege.
The terrorists let them go, but in their cruelty their 30-year-old mother, the 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar were held back in the school gym.
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljona's mother and sister died in the murderous coma.
Her father, Ruslan, has since remarried and has a little girl with his new wife, Svetlana, whom he named after his lost daughter Kristina.
Aljona, now ten years old, does not remember the siege and has grown into an intelligent and happy girl, neighbors say.
“They are now a big happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children,” says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to save them all the memories that come up with the tenth anniversary.
You'll understand why.

4 tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you would like to take photos or videos underwater, there is a selection of devices.
The most affordable option is a waterproof point-and-shoot, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action cam like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which are to have about $300.
I have taken these photos at a family party with several cameras, all of which are available at a price of under $350.
Regardless of the equipment, there are a few rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery compartment and other compartments are closed tightly.
Include your camera in the photos or videos you want to record.
Some cameras and camcorders have scene and recording modes that optimize exposure time for the damp underwater conditions.
And before you jump in, check to see what depth your equipment is working at.
Some cameras are only approved for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
In our shopping guide and reviews, look for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models.
Take multiple shots - because many won't work.
Point-and-shoot cameras have an LCD that allows you to compose images, action cams normally do not.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to see this under water, and the right image setting is a lucky thing.
So you make a lot of recordings.
If your camera has a series mode, with a series of shots with slightly changed exposure settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light gets dramatically worse, the further you get away from the surface.
So if possible, stay close to the surface if you are taking pictures in a pool, lake or sea.
This also allows you to bring more color into your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Get close to the objects.
This is also a good advice on land, but it is all the more important under water because of the bad light conditions.
It is very important if you are working with an action cam: these devices often have a fixed wide angle lens, which means that you need to get closer to your objects if they are to fill the entire frame.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the kind whose character changes things, even in such a gigantic organization as the NHS.
As an advisory anesthesiologist, he devoted his career to saving the sick both the agonie of the disease and the pain of treatment.
Among his patients, his wife remembers, was a MI6 employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that the diagnosis and disease were important to the doctors, while the treated people were mainly concerned with something quite different: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose path of suffering began.
“I didn’t feel like it, ” he wrote in May of this year.
I had trouble picking up.
While fighting with the flu-like symptoms, he noticed that he made impatient accusations to his wife Juliet.
“I want everything right away than later, he noted.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt very uncomfortable and unfounded.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to carry out an X-ray examination of his chest.
It was only two weeks ago that he was skiing in the French Alps.
The result of the X-ray investigation was present.
He suffered from mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that attacks the chest skin, that is, the skin that overlies the lungs.
As with most cancers, the exact trigger is most difficult to determine.
For example, while some smokers suffer from lung cancer, not all lung cancer patients have been smokers before.
But Mesotheliom is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos - contact with the fibre building material, which was once considered a ‘wound substance’ but has now been recognized as fatal.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can be ignored as easily.
Asbestos is ultimately a product of the past.
The most dangerous asbestos type was no longer used in the UK since the 1960s, when the industry volunteered to stop using it.
Even where he was still employed, only people in certain industries worked directly with the fabric - clampers, construction workers, carpenters and yard workers, for example.
As an industrial hazard from a different time, it seems to be hardly worrying today.
But this self-satisfaction is inappropriate.
The UK, it seems, is experiencing today the climax of a mesolthelioma epidemic.
There are more deaths from Mesotheliom here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die from this disease as in traffic accidents.
Annual figures of Mesotheliom deaths since 1980 and expected future deaths in the United Kingdom
The reason why we now experience the fatal effects, although asbestos has been illegal for years (1999 all asbestos types have been banned), is that a mesothelioma develops only after decades.
And the hostages of the Mesotheliom are not limited to former workers in the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and is often still, present in the houses in which we live, the offices in which we work, the schools in which we learn and the shops in which we shop.
And therefore Mesotheliom does not know any class barriers, financial limits, professions or age.
The privileged bastiones, from the elegant stores in London to private schools, are not a shelter.
Parliament's buildings are infested with asbestos.
Even in hospitals where we are supposed to be healthy, this deadly carcinogen has already been formed as a starting point.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He wasn't a plumber either.
In fact, he found it difficult to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found it out.
“It looks as if there were a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy’s Hospital, where I completed my training for six years,” he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and pastors - use the tunnel.
You wonder how many of my agers will suffer from the same disease?
Unfortunately, he was able to answer at least partially this question.
“From the four doctors trained at Guy’s Hospital and who had been ill with Mesotheliom over the last five years, he wrote in a letter in 2010, “I am the last one to live.”
How many of us are still getting sick?
Mesothelioma was diagnosed with Andrew Lawson at the age of 48.
When he died on 17 February this year, he was 55.
This was an unusually long survival period.
Fifty percent of all mesotheliomer patients die within 8 months of diagnosis.
The disease always ends deadly.
So we can only repeat Lawson's question: \"How many of us are still going to get sick\"
The UK's leading expert on Mesotheliom, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Great Britain is expected to come to an end, a total of 90,000 of the disease will have been killed.
Most of them have no idea they're going to die like this at the moment.

A brief look at the acts of the courts to which the persons concerned often turn for damages shows how far the hostages of the Mesotheliom have already spread.
In June of this year, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that Janice Allen had illegally suspended asbestos.
She worked for nine years for the chain, from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of which was the flagship store on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years old when she started her work at M&S.
Now she has two children in the twenties.
“In front of this thing,” she says, “I had never heard of Mesotheliom before, I didn’t even really know something about asbestos.
I never thought that would affect me.
There are only a few people who know a lot about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos does not refer to a substance, but to a group of six minerals.
The name derives from the word “asbestiform”, a description of the fiber structure that makes the fabric resistant and flexible.
Three out of six were used in the construction industry.
Chrysotil, also known as white asbestos, is today the most commonly found asbestos in buildings.
It was used for roof plates, floor plates, tube insulations, coil insulations, even for brake pads in cars.
It is less lethal than other asbestos forms, but is nevertheless considered by the EU and WHO as a \"great health risk\" with possible death consequences.
However, more dangerous is the brown asbestos (Amosite) and the blue asbestos (Krokydolith).
Great Britain was once the world’s largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that “it’s clear but indirect evidence that this was a main reason for the uniquely high mesotheliom rates”

Janice Allen may not have seen himself as a typical mesotheliom victim, but Julian Peto's work suggests that her story is not unusual at all.
He has presented a study of the persons concerned, showing that “a substantial proportion of mesothelioma without known suspension by work or at home was probably caused by asbestos contact in the environment,
Much of these contacts are based on his statement on the \"normal use and ageing\" of our buildings.
It looks like no one can assume to be sure.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which examined the Palace of Westminster, shows how people, even in the heart of the government, might have been unconsciously exposed to the substance.
In 2009 Goddard reported that the service shafts and pipelines behind Parliament's committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be blown up by something as harmless as \"strong air movements\".
Members of Parliament are often accused of caring for their own interests, but here it looks as if the opposite is true.
While the Directorate of Parliamentary Labour Service insisted that the Westminster Palace had received a 'clean health certificate', it is now undisputed that £1 billion of work would have to be spent over several years in order to renew Parliament, modernise the electrical installations and remove asbestos, and that after the general elections of 2015, Members would probably meet in the nearby QE2 conference centre rather than on the green banks in Westminster.
The Goddard report also pointed out that \"the existence of asbestos has not been handled in accordance with the respective provisions,
No one can know if this mismanagement will cost life.
Everything you can do now is wait.
A person who could never exactly determine contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general physician.
As Andrew Lawson suspects the 50-year-old Abbott was exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals.
“I’ve worked in a hospital where asbestos complaints have been decided positively,” he says, “but I can’t prove it in my case.
It is so difficult to remember all the places you worked on, and the data.
What he remembers is the date of the beginning of December 2009, on which he got such a kind of fever.
He was 45, and he performed an operation just late in the evening.
Suddenly I had gunpowder.
It came all of a sudden.
I felt terrible.
I thought I couldn't make the trip home anymore.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain was from the chest skin that touched the skin around his lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma.
He didn't go to work for a month.
Amazing doctors took X-ray shots of his chest and put pleurakathethers on to extract fluid from the lungs and test in the laboratory.
However, his complaints remained undiagnosed.
His health improved slowly, and he returned to his workplace.
However, from time to time, symptoms returned, often after athletic activity and intense breathing.
In 2011, a patient with similar symptoms came into practice and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even now, Abbott does not link this with his own case.
Finally, his patient was several decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in that case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated and his doctor brought his CT scans and X-ray recordings to an expert group.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott felt ill for the first time, a probe equipped with a camera was introduced into the cave between the ribbed and the chest skin.
I'm an optimist.
Most of the time, I just keep going, he says.
Frankly, I hadn't been worried so much at all.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was in the week between Christmas and New Year: \"I was told that it was Mesotheliom,
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis of Mesotheliom
Suddenly, Abbott had appointments with Macmillan hospital nurses, one of whom recommended that he take a lawyer.
Only now did he grasp the extent of the epidemic.
“It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often isolated with asbestos,” he says.
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings were now ill.
And so Mesotheliom now meets younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous tubes with asbestos insulation in hospitals were underground, so patients were probably not exposed to the substance.
But many employees, who in pedestrian tunnels changed from one building to another (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in underground canteens (as Graham Abbott often did), came in contact with the toxic substances.
It turns out that over several decades after the war, hospitals may have been life-saving for patients, but life-threatening for the treating doctors.
He's still being removed today.
The students placed their bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbestos was frequently used in offices, shops, libraries and city halls due to its fabulous insulating and flame-retardant properties.
Also schools.
In fact, many people probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.
Everywhere in the country, in thousands of chemical hours, pupils have turned their bunsen burners down to asbestos mats.
The issue of asbestos in schools is now frequently addressed on websites.
And therefore, such innocent objects in our homes as floorboards or drawer roofs have by default contained asbestos.
“It is an industrial gift that is contained in large parts of our real estate,” says Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy’s Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that involved a woman affected was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
So take care of how you tear off your garden shed.
The effects of diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, are immense.
“It takes a while to process this,” Graham Abbott says.
I went back to work and tried to continue, but I noticed that I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I was in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I won't see another Christmas.
With the greatest difficulty was the change of perspective from the position of a doctor to that of a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers how overwhelmed he was by all the information he had to deal with.
“It was very difficult to record all of this,” he says.
“I asked my doctor how long I’ve been having
And I was given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, \"Well, I'm not going to experience another Christmas.
That's what it was then, \"
Mesotheliom is particularly secretive because it is our life-saving mechanism - the breathing itself - that causes the deadly cancer.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos is made of smallest fibers.
When the asbestos is rolled up and the fibers inhaled, they can get stuck in the chest skin, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the chest skin and can trigger cell mutations.
“The problem arises with the inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibers,” says Professor Tom Treasure, a heart thorax doctor who switched to Guy’s Hospital in 2001.
The hospital that Andrew Lawson suspects has exposed him to asbestos is, ironically, a leading center in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others who were probably also exposed to asbestos during their training in the hospital.
As soon as the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, Treasure says, “they are pushed from the respiratory process to the margin where the skin is.
From nature it is invasive from the beginning.
The usual options for other cancers do not work so well with mesothelioma.
For example, the effectiveness of an operation is hotly controversial.
Some people think she's worth an attempt.
Treasures deny this.
“You can’t cut out the chest skin,” he says.
They don't come around with the knife.
As a result, cancer does not speak very well on chemotherapy, but does not heal the effect.
“Sometimes there are long-term survivors,” says Treasure.
But in the end they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live long, much longer than expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after diagnosis.
Graham Abbott is still fighting two and a half years after his own diagnosis.
After contacting Mesotheliom, Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson, who had become a one-man support and counseling office for those affected four years after his diagnosis.
“Hello, cancer center,” he happily introduced himself to phone calls.
“He was very positive,” Abbott says.
He had received his diagnosis 4 years earlier and was still very active.
Originally, Abbott had been offered six chemotherapy cycles that would last four months and would only extend his life by one month.
“I was desperate, ” he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson managed, however, to \"make things appear in a slightly more positive light\"
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, a heart thorax specialist at Guy's.
“We had an advantage by not having to be reassigned, I just called and got an appointment,” Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to receive a transfer and wait for the approval of the treatment.
Money is crucial for mesothelioma patients in order to be able to perceive the best available therapies.
But when these treatments fail, many people who are concerned about another financial concern - about the future of the families they leave behind.
And so they turn to the courts in hopes of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
“It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous to health,” says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s was that it was recognized that a very low load posed a health risk.
And here the negligence of the companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital finally explained their case, but it was not what Morgan called a “complete compensation” because Lawson could not prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma was due to an asbestos contact with Guy's.
After the investigation into his death, however, a spokesman for Guy's confirmed that “the asbestos fibers were removed in the basement area concerned in the 1990s, ”
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How asbestos can be removed
In fact, it is for Mesotheliom patients who strive to compensate for a huge problem, assigning the deadly asbestos contact of a company or a workplace - usually decades after the incidents.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents may be lost.
And those who oppose claims know that time is for them, but certainly not with the plaintiffs.
In response to this, there were clear new legislation this year that made it easier for Mesotheliom victims to file a compensation even if their former employers were no longer to be found.
The law has established a fund of £350 million funded by the insurance industry for all those diagnosed after July 2012 to prove contact, but no one can sue.
In these cases, the plaintiffs receive 80 percent of what a court could have promised them in a normal compensation process - about £120,000.
Some 300 successful applications to the programme are expected per year.
Andrew Morgan thinks like so many Mesotheliom victims that £350 million was a very good job in the insurance industry.
“This is a deal of insurers for insurers,” he says, and indicates that this sum is a quarter of what insurers would have to pay if the time had not gone over it and mesotheliom patients found the companies and could normally sue them.
Mike Penning, then Minister of Labour and Pension, also admitted that the law was \"not perfect.\"
But both Penning and Morgan admitted that in the face of seven deaths, a quick action is necessary every day.
“People are suffering so much and need help today,” said Penning during the second hearing of the Mesotheliom Act in December last year.
At that time Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After their first discussions, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation, of which he expects a positive effect in contrast to Tom Treasure.
This has been accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy with which Lang-Lazdunski can present a survival rate of up to 40 percent over five years.
Abbott felt strengthened.
“This is of course the most important thing,” Abbott says.
This is always seen in patients.
There's something that's gonna keep you going.
When you give up, you get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent the operation in March 2012.
At the end of August, he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles.
Aftercarescans did not show any signs of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer spots around my chest.
I just got 50.
That's not life threatening.
It's life-ending.
Abbott again underwent six chemotherapy cycles.
No trace of tumours is now visible.
But the process is physically and mentally very strenuous.
You have to think about practical things - about the money, if I am no longer, for example, or about my wife showing how the Boiling Age works.
If you get bad news, you'll be negative.
You have to look forward.
As a father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, this is not always easy.
“It’s hard for parents,” he says.
It's hard to know what to say and how much to say.
When I received my first diagnosis, I told my girl that I had a disease that I wouldn't be old with.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very cozy and unscrupulous.
She told her friends and we soon got a lot of calls.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients must go through.
But for Mesotheliomer patients, such conversations are not of hope, not of a trace of hope of survival.
The disease (as in the end for Stephen Jay Gould) brings a grim security.
As Andrew Morgan says, \"Mesotheliom is not life threatening.

China rejects Hong Kong right to government election, demonstrators swear retaliation
On Sunday, despite the increased call for democratic reforms, the Chinese Parliament decided against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 elections by the Hong Kong electorate.
This action probably warrants the long-announced protests in Hong Kong's business district, while activists led planning and mobilization into the way within a few hours after the announcement.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress basically allows communist leaders to reject all non-peking loyal candidates.
“This is not unexpected, but it makes us angry,” said law expert Emily Lau, chairman of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
The residents of Hong Kong have been lied to.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In his defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, Vice-Secretary of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that the approval of public nominations in the elections for the Hong Kong government would be “chaotic”.
Since 1997, when the United Kingdom gave up control of Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing has promised to let the residents choose the government's presidency as of 2017.
The Chinese leadership presented the decision of Sunday as a democratic breakthrough because there is a direct electoral right for Hong Kong citizens, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leadership keeps the course firmly in hand by a closely controlled committee of nominations in Beijing.
In addition, a new clause will only allow candidates, with love for the country and love for Hong Kong, to be admitted.
The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most public-effective protests have been taking place in Hong Kong for several years.
Behind the pro-democratic campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to dispossess the financial district if Beijing does not allow real general electoral rights.
On Sunday evening, within hours of the announcement, hundreds of Occupy-Central supporters had gathered in the rain in front of the Hong Kong government headquarters.
During the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement had reached a new level of civil disobedience and that they were planning protest waves in the coming weeks.
They did not, however, provide further information, apparently to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online communication, the organizers announced that the movement “has considered the occupation of the central district only as a last resort, an action to take only when all dialogue opportunities are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are sorry to have to say that all the opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted today and that the occupation of the central district will definitely take place.
The Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for the Beijing announcement for days, and security measures, including police forces and barricades, were in place on Sunday in front of the government building.
The unrest is exacerbated by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city.
The addition of people from the mainland enhances competition for products and services.
Moreover, the fear that the values of Hong Kong such as democracy and freedom of speech are beginning to grow under the growing pressure of Beijing.
Some criticized the demonstrations of the Occupy Central Movement because they threatened the business - the Hong Kong Life Council.
“The protests they are talking about could cause great economic damage, depending on how many are involved and how long they are going to continue,” said legal expert Regine Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We don't want to raise any fears that Hong Kong is out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
The state controlled media of China also recently reported on the democracy activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by Western powers.
This summer activists organised an unofficial referendum on the electoral rights in which 780,000 people participated - more than a fifth of the voters in Hong Kong.
In July, tens of thousands participated in one of the largest demonstrations of democracy in the history of the region.
The tradition of school graduation balls in the USA is now being transferred to universities where Freshmen's performances are offered with the private airplane.
We are pleased to be able to respond to this demand and to offer the UK's first luxury travel service for students today.
In order to achieve a particularly impressive appearance at the university, the company also offers transport options such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also stated that the service has a security department.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to kiss their belongings in a dangerously overloaded car through the country.
Together with our new VIF options, we look forward to ensuring that students reach the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury this year.
A company spokesperson said that there are no new bookings yet, since the service had just been introduced, but added that “Students would book the service in the next few weeks.
The company also announced that despite the study fees of £9,000 per year, it would expect a market for this offer.
Students today are very different in their expectations and demands from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can do exactly that.
However, the National Student Union criticized the service as being dismissed.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the NUS for Higher Education, said: “This offer seems completely separate from the lives of the majority of students.
Many students who start studying this month see themselves facing a crisis of living costs, as available financial support in the form of loans and scholarships does not keep pace with the growing bills for the simplest basis of life before they can even think of spending thousands of pounds on something simple like arriving at the student home.
Feminists criticize racial issues and police behavior for Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
The participants lifted their hands in the air and sang, \"Hands high, don't shoot,\" while waiting before the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, because of the shooting of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
After their experience, white feminist commentators put gender before the race when it comes to addressing reproductive law and income inequalities.
However, while tensions in the Midwest increased and received attention throughout the country, Perez saw that white women's responses turned 100% around the race.
Compared with the answers of black women shortly after the 9th August shots, the personal essays with titles such as - thinking about Ferguson by a white woman - and - feminism not only revolves around the oppression of women - were relatively late.
But for Perez this meant an important change.
“I don’t think that in feminism you find many people talking about being white and privileges in such a high-class way,” she said.
People felt pressured to express something to the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis in which we are in and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnicized that they have to express it.
For English professor Coritha Mitchell of Ohio State University, Ferguson brought problems to the light that black American women are exposed to every day, but which are not regarded as \"women's themes\" in cultural space.
“I can publish something funny on Facebook about myself and my partner and get 150 likes from anywhere,” Mitchell said.
When I post something about how colored people in their own country are under siege, the silence is ear-dozing.
“How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship, but not about security in the public area?” she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have studied race, gender and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between racial and gender problems.
For them, black women have not had the luxury of separating the themes clean; they live every day in combined reality.
While white women now combine the themes of race and gender in the feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattery, professor of women and gender research at George Mason University, says that their predecessors did the opposite.
“ Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the reason was almost always the rape of a white woman,” said Hattery.
White women had to be involved in the story to justify the Lynch murder.
For Hattery, the division between white and black women came to the point where white fighters for women's electoral law such as Susan B. Anthony analyzed the country in the late years of the 19th century and found that the struggle for electoral law could only be successful for one group: women or blacks.
“They made the decision to apply for women’s electoral law, and the right to vote for blacks was to come later,” Hattery said.
When one remembers such things, one is powerfully aware of why colored women do not trust white women.
We didn't do our job well.
We never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women were given the right to vote in 1920, it took another decade for white women to organize themselves against the Lynching in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was formed almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women, says Mitchell.
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist reactions to the issues raised by Ferguson - police behavior, racial discrimination - is a mirror of the time when white feminists played “catches” with the problems that black women have faced for generations.
“It would not be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms took the right to educate a child as seriously as they do with the right to reception control,” Mitchell asked.
The second generation feminists who are building their careers in the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives are now trying to understand what that means.
The well-known white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went to Facebook two weeks after Michael Brown's shooting and published a posted article by Rebecca Carroll, the Guardian columnist, in which she demands more protests from white Americans on the subject of racism.
“I hope that women who have a different but parallel reason for understanding a danger inherent to the body - and opinions about the race that are clearly different in public surveys - will make changes,” Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem stands for a more intersectional feminism in which racial and gender issues are addressed, some of her comments on the racial theme in America are still a mystery.
Christina Sommers, researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of \"Who Stole Feminism\" told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young coloured men, are \"more vulnerable than their sisters\", but Steinem's comments about Ferguson are contrary to her earlier criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently imposed a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there were angry reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem that pushes into the foreground of mainstream feminism.
After nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors were taken up by the U.S. border police at the country's southwest border this year, the topic of immigration reform is again on the surface - this time as a women's theme.
Andrea Mercado, co-chairman of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that for a re-consideration of the subject as an essential women's theme, they only need to publish the stories of immigrant women.
\"These speak for themselves,\" Mercado said.
When the vast majority of work visas go to male immigrants, the women they accompany are in a position where they are susceptible to domestic violence and exploitation.
“These stories are found in the women’s organizations,” she said.
‘Swine House’ in Ipswich is for sale
The image of a house for sale was removed from real estate agents as it became clear that it showed a large pig that it had made comfortable in the living room.
The detached house has a bedroom, is located on a private street in Ipswich and is offered for £120,000.
Among the details was a picture of the living room of the house - to which also a pig belonged that his head had been bitten on a sofa.
Real estate agent Connells said that the pig in the photo was the pet of the owner.
“The photo, however, has been wrongly published and has now been removed,” said a company spokesperson.
In the Exposé of the House, Connells described the former Assembly Hall as a “unique single-family house with one bedroom”
Although the broker has removed the image from the website, it still appears on advertising material.
In the social media, domestic sales were of interest when some asked whether the pig was included in the purchase price.
The SW city Harvey is home to a new millionaire after Lotto win
A lottery player from Harvey is on this month
The search for a new millionaire in the southwest of Perth lasts, with a happy winner receiving almost $1.1 million from the lottery train on Saturday.
For the second time in five years, a newspaper kiosks in Harvey moved the jackpot in the draw of the first division, after $1 million in November 2009.
The happy winner, however, still has to report.
The store owner Steve Forward said that the profit provides conversational material in the small town in the southwest of Perth.
The city speaks of nothing else, and everyone is quite excited.
We thought that such a profit could come.
Eight WA winners have celebrated winnings in the first division last month, a due conclusion for a few happy weeks for the players in the state.
Last week a player from Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires in August, after a couple from Belmont only a few weeks earlier had won the $7.5 million mega win.
The winning couple had played for twenty years and said that the win allows them the possibility of a world trip and the purchase of a new house.
The millionaire from Harvey is the 59th winner of the first division in WA this year, with a total of almost $85 million.
Leonidas bat in the Gladiators arena
Not only the gladiators stood knocheltief in the Matsch during the first Rheinbach Roman Day in the leisure park.
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract well over 1000 visitors yesterday, who were insolent in the rain showers and the autumn cold and left the historical spectacle unresponsive.
There was a colorful array of performances, performances, games, exhibitions and information about the times of the Romans and their importance to the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial forces of the Gladiators' School of Amor Mortis, which used every rain break to demonstrate their robust martial arts in the arena prepared with soft sand.
Gladiator owners, Leonidas, proved to be a humorous and expert presenter and sent his men together in the ring to the heroic two-fight in various gladiatorial genres.
First were the \"provocators\" on the row with rectangle shield and short sword as well as leg rails on the left leg and arm rails on the right arm.
The \"Essedarii\" followed with a breast shield, short sword, and a worm, as well as an iron gladiatorial helmet, leg and arm protection.
Especially impressive was the appearance of the Retiarius, who, with a net, a drizzle and a dolch against the \"Secutor\" and after a short battle, hit the boys to the ground.
Since the swords were metallic to each other, the shields were creating and the worms were flying surreptitiously through the arena that a fear and envy could become the health of the gladiators.
But the imposing Summa Rudis, the muscular arbiter, had an always attentive eye.
“We wanted to revive the Roman everyday life and make the culture of the Roman era more perceptible, explained Lorenz Euskirchen, chairman of the organizer’s “Friendskreis Roman Canal” the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, an \"Oppidum Romanum\" became a Roman city from the park for one day, as Vice-President Claus Wehage stated in his greeting.
Finally, the Romans not only brought war and conquest in our region, but also Roman culture and numerous buildings that we still admire today.
Remains of this were also to be admired during the Roman day, for example, \"Aqueduct marble\" from the eleven meters high and 1400 meters long Roman Channel bridge, which once stood at Lüftelberg.
The Frontinus Society once faced the supply of water and energy, and the managing director Petra Fricke knew: “We are still benefiting from the knowledge of the day,
This is also confirmed by diploma measurement engineer Ralph Heiligen from the “EngineerteamZwei” from Rheinbach, who presented the measuring instruments of the Romans such as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented sketches and models of excavations anno 1894 as well as bricks from the original hypocauste, hot air heating, which once warmed the Roman villa.
Impressive, too, were the footprints left by Wolf and Fuchs two millenniums ago in the footsteps of Ton before they were burned.
In 2011, the Office for Soil Monument Care at the Rhineland Association had excavated the remains of a Roman villa in the North Industrial Park in Rheinbach.
The walls of an economic building with a dart for drying grain and milling have been found.
The building probably belonged to a Villa Rustica, an agricultural estate, explained the archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser.
A number of finds from these excavations presented them in a glass-vitrine, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels and parts of a decorative necklace.
The villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century after Christ, until the invasion of the Germans in the then Roman Rhineland, Morscheiser suspects.
In addition, the children engaged in the Roman windmill game, similar to today's mill game, or they wrote their names with metal handles on wax plates as they once did.
At the state of the Roman thermals Zülpich the children were allowed to lay mosaics themselves, at the stand of the glass museum Rheinbach Glasmosaiken basteln and at the stand of the natural center Eifel Nettersheim serve a heavy wheat mill made of stone to grind the flour for a flatbread or a mussel.
With the Roman carriages built by two cold flowers, the visitors passed through the amusement park and also passed the impressive state of the Städtische Gymnasium, which presented the results of their “Roman-Project Weeks”.
With a Roman week from 13 to 21 September, the village of Wachberg will also be brought into the Rhineland-wide Roman Year 2014 to commemorate the death of Emperor Augustus 2000 years ago.
Together with the Home and History Associations and the Wachberger Wander Association, the Partnership Association and the Oberbachem Laienspielkreis, thematic hikes, a lecture, cooking evenings and guided tours for school classes are offered and are reminiscent of the Roman past Wachbergs.
For example, a Roman Legionary will tell of his work on the nearby Wachtberg, present plants as living monuments from the Roman period, and present a funny lesson in international understanding between a group of Wachtberger-Germans and drawn Romans.
The primary school of Adendorf is dedicated to the Roman theme as part of a project week.
With the Roman Week, the numerous, often but no longer visible traces of the Romans in Wachberg are to be rediscovered.
In the Wachtberger Rathaus a small presentation will be remembered of the discovery of the Bercumer Matron sanctuary in 1879.
Ebola: The epidemic burdens West Africa's economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a major blow to the economy.
Markets are confused - and international companies go a long way.
The devastating Ebola epidemic is a major blow to West Africa's economy.
The harvest rots in the fields, the mines are abandoned and the markets are orphaned - the virus has severely increased the region.
Also some international companies are already going a long way.
“The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis but also an economic one, the head of the African Development Bank, Donald Kaberuka, judges.
Liberia is the hardest affected
“It’s a total disaster, we lose a lot of money,” says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells clothes on the second largest market in Liberia’s capital, Monrovia.
Only those who want to buy food or something for disinfection against Ebola are on the market.
Liberia is the hardest hit by the virus, but here alone more than 600 people fell victim to the fever.
The health authorities recently explained that the disease was present at every corner of the country.
The virus has also spread in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
A total of more than 1500 people died, and thousands more were killed.
Foreign firms withdraw employees
Companies operate everywhere in the resource-rich countries.
Foreign companies such as the Arcelor Mittal steel group are withdrawing their employees, and several international airlines are no longer attacking the affected regions.
The local traders and farmers also react: few merchants still leave their homes to get supplies.
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are under quarantine, the important cocoa and coffee beans in the fields were destroyed.
The farmers do not dare to leave their homes for the harvest.
Foods are becoming scarce
“People are going to travel less and less,” says Phillipe De Vreyer, Paris expert on West Africa’s economy.
The man, for example, who usually goes to the market and sells his vegetables, prefers to stay at home.
The population is therefore experiencing the consequences of the epidemic directly and vigorously: food will be scarce.
In the markets, the supply of basic foods such as rice disappears.
At the same time, the region heavily dependent on international firms threatens an image damage - with far-reaching consequences.
The greatest danger is that international companies will basically avoid the area over a long period of time, says Philippe Hugo of the French Think Tank Iris.
It is decided how far and how long the virus will spread.
For investors, the impression could arise, \"that it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, and therefore to invest, warns Hugo.
The disease also burdens the state budgets of the states
The disease also affects the state budgets of the countries concerned.
Moody's rating agency fears that their budgets will be heavily tightened by the high expenditures on the health system and in addition by the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank has already promised to help the health systems of the countries concerned with 60 million dollars (45 million euros).
The effects are traceable even in Nigeria, where only a few Ebola cases have been diagnosed so far.
Although the oily region in the southern Niger Delta has not been affected so far.
But elsewhere, many people are already at home for fear of an infection.
Reservations in hotels also fall significantly.
Shooters celebrate her 50th anniversary
The Schützenverein - Tannenwald - Berngau celebrates its 50-year founding festival from 12 to 14 September.
On high tours, the Schützenverein Tannenwald prepares for the 50-year founding festival from 12 to 14 September.
Planned on Friday, September 12, a big entertainment evening with the group \"Dorfröcker\"
On Saturday, at 6 p.m., there's the big böller shooting.
Afterwards, in the big party is the mood evening with the “Stoápälzer Spitsbuam”
Blaskapelle provides the music
Highlights on Sunday are the festival service and 9.30 a.m. in the parish church and the large fortress at 14 a.m.
In the afternoon is also the price distribution of federal and rapid shooting.
A particularly beautiful sight will be the 25 Festdams with their Dirndln.
Festkapelle is the Blaskapelle Berngau.
The patronage took over Mayor Wolfgang Wild and Secretary of State Albert Füracker.
The original term “Schützengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau” dates back to 1907, when on 21 March the association was founded for “social entertainment by means of practice in room and small caliber shooting.
The NS regime had caused the dissolution of the association in 1937.
It was not until 1964 that 19 young men were found again, who on April 30 in the guesthouse of Lukas raised the \"new\" Schützenverein-Tannenwald- Berngau from the baptism.
Karl March and Adolf Ried led the club as a shooter through a difficult start, in which it was mainly about finding a club's location and installing the shooting operation.
As early as the fall of 1965, the Schützenverein started in the Gasthaus-Leininger with two teams in the round contests.
In the following years, the sports shooters, who were now organized into seven teams, established themselves in all classes up to the 1st Gauliga.
The club records were purified annually and the magical border of 380 rings was reached for the first time by Rudi Meier in 1980.
As the performance of the active shooters has increased, the membership numbers have also developed positively.
After the club’s “Leininger” was no longer satisfied with the requirements of a modern shooting club, the board of directors, led by Johann Rinn, decided to create a future Domizil in the basement rooms of the new Landgasthof Härteis.
After 2700 hours of work, on 8 May 1988, Mr Strasser gave the ecclesial blessing for the new shelters.
One of the major highlights in the club history was the 44th quick shooting, combined with the solemn consecration of the new shooter flag in July 1991.
On 23 and 24 April 1994 the Schützenverein celebrated its 30-year founding anniversary.
In 1995, an ageing group was established.
Josef Schmalzl became an elder referee.
A major challenge for the \"Böllererer\" and for the association as a whole was the focus of the Bavarian Böller meeting in 2005.
In many hours of volunteer work, the club members modernized the rooms and the shooting system in the Berngauer Hof last year, bringing them to the latest state of the art.
Eleven teams in round competitions
See also the sporting performances of the shooter club.
In total, eleven teams are currently taking part in the round races: six Air Force teams, an air pistol team, a sports pistol KK1, a youth and two AH teams.
The first team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann rose to the district league 1 in the 2013/14 round from the Gauoberliga (highest league in the Schützengau ANB).
The 2nd team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml has risen from the Gauliga North to the Gauoberliga.
In addition to shooting, events such as bockstechen, phishing and kingball, club departure and Christmas celebration have tradition.
With this, the shooters are also at the festivals in parish and municipality.
Tony Stewart suffers accident when returning to the race track
Tony Stewart's return to the race course ended about half way through his race on the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart drove against the wall for the second time, after his right front tires were placed in round 172 and his evening ended.
Stewart drove his damaged car into the garage and left it without talking to journalists.
His team leader Chad Johnston said his 14-member team was disappointed, but now focus on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
“I wish we had a better commitment and a better result for him,” said Johnston.
We're going to Richmond and hoping we can make it better there.
Stewart used to race on Sunday evening after a collision with Kyle Busch in a wall and had to have the right side of his car repaired.
“I went in today with quite good hopes for a good result,” said Johnston, adding: “It just didn’t work out.”
It wasn't long after the second accident that Stewart's car was loaded into the slepper and the team had packed and was ready for departure.
Stewart dropped three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver in an Aschenbahn race in northern New York State.
He decided to return this week and win either in Atlanta or the next race in Richmond to win a place in the persecution.
He returned to his workplace during an investigation into the tragic incident that led to the death of the 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., which was on the road during a race to confront Stewart.
The authorities announced on Friday that the investigations on the cause of the accident would continue for at least two weeks.
No decision has yet been made as to whether Stewart has to face a charge.
The three-time champion was received with great applause when he was presented before the race.
After a start at 12th position, Stewart was soon in the first 10 and was temporarily in place four.
After a restart in lap 122, Buschs got
Car with No. 18 out of control after exit from Curve 2 and collided with Stewart, both of which drove against the wall.
Stewart continued, but fell back to 21st place.
Violent young people looking for dance
Simple to try out: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and Head Lisa Neitzel (from the left) are looking forward to joining the team.
Like many other clubs, jazz groups in TV Jahn also create all day lessons at the secondary schools.
After the summer holidays, some groups have been greatly decimated.
Now more young people are looking for a sport that is healthy and makes great fun.
In the two jazz and modern dance groups of Lisa Neitzel, formerly dancer in the jazz and modern dance formation \"Spirits\" are only nine children.
“Three in the group of eight to twelve years old, six in the group of the twelve to 15 years old,” the 20-year-old tells us.
With more activities, the whole thing would be much more fun, “you could dance quite a different choreography,” she says.
If you like dancing, donnersdays between 17 and 18 o'clock or Fridays between 17 and 6.30 o'clock in the dance room at the former Hotel Meyer, Freistraße 9, can take you into the training hours without obligation.
“The training starts on a regular basis with a warm-up program,” the trainer tells.
After that, various choreographies are practiced.
JazzDance has the feature that there is no definite form and is therefore open to many styles.
Elements from folklore through classics to sports and acrobatics are processed in Jazz Dance.
Of course, sociability does not come too short.
“We also go to eat, watch dance films, and we’ve been staying in the dance room for a while,” Lisa Neitzel reports.
In the group you can close friendships, share a beautiful hobby and do a lot for your own motor development.
Who doesn't like jazz dance, who can also snuff in one of the other offers of TV Jahn.
Children and adolescents can always snuff into the lessons in children's dance/jazz dance, bambini ballet, video clip dancing and hip hop.
The dance coach is Francisco Afonso.
Adult couples are welcome to the dance evenings on Monday and Wednesday.
Those who like Discofox, Long-Sleeved Walzer, Viennese Walzer, Rumba, Cha-Cha-Cha and Tango are allowed to watch and join.
Bulgarian prison supervisors protest nationwide
Hundreds of prison workers from all over Bulgaria have organized a national protest in front of the Ministry of Justice in the capital Sofia.
In the peaceful demonstration, they repeated their demands for the restoration of their old working conditions that had recently been changed.
Higher salaries are also on a list of demands to be discussed with the interim justice minister Hristo Ivanov.
Officials have been protesting symbolically against the new working hours for a month and are calling for a return to the former 24-hour shifts.
Despite the meetings between the union of prison staff and representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, the national Bulgarian Ratio (BNR) reported.
The negotiations continued, the Director-General for the implementation of criminal measures, Rosen Zhelyazkov told the BNR.
The protest of the prison staff is expected to be supported by members of the union association of employees of the Ministry of the Interior.
Ukrainian army has abandoned Luhansk Airport
In the Ostukraine, the pro-Russian fighters are still on the verge.
After heavy fighting, in which Russian tanker battalions were allegedly involved, the Ukrainian army today, Monday, gave up the airport of the Rebellenhochburg Luhansk.
The army also announced that seven soldiers had been killed in the last 24 hours.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had previously drawn personal consequences from the heavy defeats of his army in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the supreme military leadership, without giving details.
Prorussian separatists fired plane
In the fight against Ukrainian government forces, according to their own portrayal, pro-Russian separatists have again shot down a fighter aircraft and two military helicopters.
In addition, about 100 soldiers were injured or killed in the fights in the Donezk region, according to the insurgents on Monday, Russian agencies were told.
Coast Guard Ships sank
The insurgents also claimed to have for the first time sunk two boats of the Ukrainian Coast Guard in the Asov Sea.
The Ukrainian border guard confirmed that two of his ships were under attack on Sunday near the port city of Mariupol.
Seven border guards had been injured, a spokesperson in Kiev told the transmitter 112.ua.
Two crew members were considered missing.
Local media made Russia responsible for the incident.
The separatists also reported that several localities in the Donezk area were under their control.
Diplomatic offensive in Minsk
In the Belarusian capital Minsk, the Ukraine contact group meets today.
In addition to representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, a separatist ambassador from the Ostukraine should participate.
In advance, all actors used their appearances to publicize their demands.
NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia due to the planned stationings in Eastern Europe as a result of the Ukraine crisis.
NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels that NATO adhered to the 1997 NATO-Russia Council founding agreement.
However, the NATO chief accused Russia of \"a cracking break\" of the agreement.
“Today, we have to see reality that Russia does not regard NATO as a partner,” Rasmussen said.
From documents and comments from the Russian side, \"that they consider us to be opponents\"
Stronger NATO Presence
Rasmussen has also announced a desire to strengthen NATO's presence in Eastern Europe.
A \"Readiness Action Plan\" to be decided at the NATO Summit in Wales will ensure that \"we will have more visible NATO presence in the East as long as this is necessary\" said Rasmussen on Monday in Brussels.
Kiev and Moscow agree on new gas talks
Russia and Ukraine have agreed officially on new talks to settle their gas dispute.
The negotiations were scheduled for next Saturday, the Russian energy minister Alexander Nowak said on Monday.
A decision by the European Union is yet to be taken whether it will also send a representative to the talks.
Because of the dispute over the price of gas, Ukraine has not received fuel from Russia for weeks.
Finally, EU Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger had communicated between both sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also interrupt gas supply for Europe.
Europe refers to about a third of its natural gas from Russian sources, much of which flows through Ukraine.
Merkel speaks word of power: Toll will come \"very clear\"
Now the chancellor clearly confesses.
But it is not a free letter for all complicated details.
CSU’s persistent concerns from the CDU against the passenger car toll have grappled.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel has spoken after persistent resistance from her CDU a word of power for the introduction of a car toll.
“In order to make it clear: it is in the coalition treaty, and it will come,” said the party leader on Monday after meetings of the CDU Spitzengremien in Berlin.
Merkel did not define himself on a detailed model.
In the black and red government programme, \"determined parameters\" were mentioned.
Federal Minister for Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) has made a proposal, and this is now being worked on,
However, the NRW-CDU insists on its no to a toll just right on all roads.
Merkel stressed that Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) was also involved in the discussions for a draft law.
In addition, he spoke with Dobrindt on further opportunities to activate more private capital for infrastructure investments, such as broadband expansion.
“There’s nothing special about it — Schäuble had left a ‘speech’ report uncommented on Sunday, his house will examine its own concept to pay highway investors with toll revenue - after the 2017 election.
CSU Chief Horst Seehofer then warned against developing toll concepts against the leading minister in the cabinet.
CDU-Bundesvize Armin Laschet confirmed his objections.
“The coalition treaty never intended to take any interest in all county and federal roads,” said the North Rhine-Westphalian CDU country chairman.
In this respect, it is an important signal that Seehofer has now announced to speak again on the subject.
Resistance to the plans also comes from the CDU Land Associations Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate.
Background concerns are that a toll affects small border traffic to neighbouring countries.
Seehofer had asked for loyalty to the CDU coalition because of the toll criticism of the CDU.
The Left considers the plans to fail in the face of the dispute in the Union.
\"The Murks toll is dead, said party leader Bernd Riexinger of the \"New Osnabrücker Zeitung\" (Monday).
\"With the toll the Minister fails - Dobrindt intends to introduce a vignette obligation on all German roads to start in 2016.
However, according to the coalition agreement, domestic car owners may not be charged in addition.
Therefore, they should receive a full compensation for the toll over the car tax.
However, the model must not adversely affect foreign drivers in accordance with EU law because of their nationality.
Genetic disorder often misdiagnosed
A British woman says she thought that she would die as a result of a misdiagnosis over many years.
Karin Rodgers lived almost her entire youth in the belief that she had only a few years to live after being diagnosed with another disease.
It actually suffered from the Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK reported that misdiagnosis is a common problem in people with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
About 23,000 people in the UK are likely to suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness, unsafe walking and curved toes.
Illnesses also suffer from numbness or pain. The disease is incurable and progressive, which means that symptoms are getting worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed she was suffering from Friedreich-Ataxia (FA) - a disease with very bad chances of survival.
Rodgers thought she would sit in the wheelchair before she would 18 and die before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children 51 years old today said: “As a child, I knew that I couldn’t do the same thing as the others.
I fell down all the time, and everything took longer for me.
I could never ride the other kids rollers or skateboard and was often hounded in school because of my way to go and run.
Rodgers said that, at the age of 13 years, after several operations to relieve her achillescents and stretch her feet, she saw her medical records when her doctor had left the room and read that she had left to FA.
“I felt guilty because I was curious, so I told no one, but I went home, looked for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA company,” she said.
When I received an answer, I was shocked and panicked.
I thought I would be in wheelchair with 18 and die with 25, and then slowly lose all my skills.
I did all of this alone with me and planned my own funeral.
She said that when she turned 17, she realized that her abilities had not diminished as strongly as she had imagined and asked her doctor.
He just stood up and hugged me and said, \"My love, I don't think you have that, otherwise you would be in the wheelchair right now\"
I think you have something far less life-threatening.
After some genetic tests, their CMT was detected.
“When he told me what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner,” she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT Awareness Month to raise awareness of this disease.
Stabsfeldwebel a. D. Berni Dieter has been working as a fire worker since the closure of the former military practice site.
For almost ten years now, the former military practice site in Munsingen has not been shot.
Nevertheless, the ammunition still appears in the heart of the biosphere region of Schwäbische Alb every month.
The pomegranates are sometimes still so dangerous that they have to be sprinkled on site.
An ear-causing bang is hailing over the heart of the biosphere region during the bursts.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot fell on the Münsingen military training station, which was closed after 110 years of military operation at the end of 2005.
Since that time, the 6500-hectare area has been the core of the Swiss Alb Biosphere area, which is open on 13 designated roads for hikers and cyclists.
Tax burden on businessmen in Washington area increases with economic recovery
A recovery of the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax decisions for companies in the country increased slightly last year, while economic recovery accelerated, so a newly published study last week, and companies in the Washington area made no exception.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia area jointly paid $27.6 billion in government and local agencies in 2013, an increase of 3.8 percent compared to the 2012 revenue of $26.6 billion.
Last year's government and local tax burden increased by 4.3 percent to $671 billion, compared to 3.9 percent a year earlier, and it was the third year of growth following the several years of declining 2009 and 2010.
State taxes increased more than local taxes, by 4.3 percent, according to the study carried out by the Service Agency Ernst & Young with the Centre for State Taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of the district's tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from corporate taxes, while 36% of Maryland's revenue comes from companies.
Virginia receives 28 percent the lowest tax revenue from companies.
Much of the increase in tax revenue is justified in a recovery of the real estate values of the companies, researchers say, leading to an increase in real estate taxes by 3.7 percent this year after the three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 percent.
While much of these gains came from large states such as California, New York, and Texas, the outcome seems to be for the Washington area.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia paid over $10 billion in government and local property taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 - an increase of 4.2 percent over the course of a year.
But the apparent recovery in real estate values is not so effective in increasing state and local tax revenues, as real estate taxes amount to just over one-fifth of company tax returns.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.
“In Maryland, a large part of real estate, especially in the tax area around D.C., is owned either by the government or by non-profit organizations that do not pay property taxes,” said Douglas Lindholm, Managing Director of the Center on State Taxation.
For example, Maryland is forced to rely much more on income taxes in order to provide the same services that other States offer.
The recent recovery in tax revenues by companies cannot be attributed solely to the recovery of the real estate market
Business revenue also seems to recover, according to the data.
Companies in the region reported income taxes on government organizations of $2.3 billion compared to 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland took $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount of the region.
While the trend is in the same direction, local tax burden for companies does not increase evenly in all three places.
The increase rate in the district was 4.3% to the national average, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9 percent.
Only Virginia reported a lower average tax income of 4.1 percent.
Virginia has 6 per cent in all three areas of office the significantly lowest corporate income taxes (in all three there are fixed corporate tax rates).
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 percent and in the district at a relatively high level of 9.975 percent.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce at the beginning of this year showed that in Virginia, lower government and local corporate taxes are demanded and a better tax climate exists overall than in Maryland.
The study did not examine the district.
Despite the advantages, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbours.
North Carolina has passed laws to reduce its corporate tax rates from 6.9 percent to 6 percent this year, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 percent next year.
If the State continues to achieve its income targets in the coming year, this law could reduce the government income tax rate by 2017 to up to 3 percent.
In the meantime, it seems to be better for small businesses in the Washington area to pay more government and local taxes, according to the recent study.
Business taxes, which are paid as personal income taxes by small businessmen - a transitional structure, after which most small businesses are organized - in the district, Maryland and Virginia, increased by 20 percent last year to $2.4 billion, a significantly faster growth rate than the total company taxes.
The researchers say that the trend and increase in corporate taxes across the country is likely to continue this year, with an increase in general surplus tax revenue for the state and local governments by 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period of the previous year.
Nevertheless, the Washington area could have a negative impact on the region's labour market if the federal government's spending cuts were to have a negative impact on the region.
Partner city: German beer for Guangzhou
Hops and malt - also a popular combination in China.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt's partner city in China now wishes a brewery and also hopes for a direct flight between the two cities.
Deutsches Bier, brewed in Frankfurt's partner city Guangzhou - is the urgent desire of the officials in China.
“We would be very pleased if a German brewery were to settle in our city,” said the vice-party secretary of the South China metropolis, Li Yiwei, this week when visiting a SPD delegation in his city.
In the course of the conversation, the official of the ruling Chinese Communist Party came back to this issue of the Twelve-Million-Metropole.
Guangzhou, which is also called Canton in Germany, is one of the richest cities in China, was Li.
Therefore, people also possessed the purchasing power to afford German beer.
The Hessian SPD chairman Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel, who led the German political delegation, told the host that he would listen to a possible partner for the project in Germany.
“It doesn’t need much for beer: good water, grain and pleasure in life, he added at lunch with the party superintendent in Guangzhou.
Mr. Li already radiated this joy of life, and he flattered the host.
This led to the functional from Guangzhou with sheep's gulf - but with red wine served for the meal.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao is based on German brewing.
Tsingtao beer is brewed after the German purity offer.
Increased trade
A second request from the Chinese host would be a direct direct flight between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Vice-Participant Li.
The Lufthansa had previously offered the flight, but dropped in 2012 for economic reasons.
“It would be worthwhile again,” said the local politician.
\"Business transport between our two cities continues to grow,
At present, travelers had to take the route across Changsha in Hunan Province, Li complained.
Also the administration of Guangdong Province, whose capital is Guangzhou, hopes for flight connection.
The vice-governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, put this desire in the foreground in his conversation with the social democrats.
\"This is a very good idea - answered Schäfer-Gümbel - the Chinese Vice Minister Li Jinjun, an intimate German expert, nodded in agreement.
Achieved Partnership
The lazy vice-party leader of Guangzhou hopes that he will be able to visit Frankfurt next year at a partnership meeting.
Li Yiwei was already in Main, but not yet in this function.
He came to office this year only after his predecessor had been promoted out of office due to corruption accusations.
The local party leader Wan Qinglian also had to go.
The action against the Guangzhou officials is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in party and administration, which is enforced by Head of State Xi Jinping with hardness.
The new top politician Li Yiwei had worked in front of his party career for an American company, which is most unusual in the Chinese Communist Party.
Before joining Guangzhou, he worked as a top official in Fujian, where the VW Autobauer built a large plant.
Frankfurt has officially entered into more than a dozen urban partnerships.
The connection to Guangzhou 9000 kilometers away is one of those maintained by both sides, for example with a student exchange.
Last year the 25th anniversary of the German-Chinese connection was celebrated.
The South China metropolis on the Perl River is almost as strong with its economic power as all of Hessen.
The next year they want to achieve a gross domestic product of 250 billion euros, Li reported.
Joan Rivers family \"presses the thumbs\"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious three days ago since her introduction to a hospital in New York City; however, her daughter has now been hopeful that the 81-year-old comedian is recovering from her illness.
“Thank you for your enduring love and support,” Melissa Rivers said today in a message.
We're all pushing the thumbs.
According to her mother, sources were transferred to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency in a hospital at the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy.
The doctors deliberately keep them sedated and under careful observation until they are more satisfied with their condition, which is still described as \"earnest\".
The reactions came from many sites, also in the form of overwhelming online support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmentally friendly vacuum cleaners and rising wages
In future, stricter environmental standards will apply to cars and vacuum cleaners that come into the market today.
Similar to refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners receive a label from 1 September where the buyer can detect central data such as the energy efficiency of the device at a glance.
New cars are subject to sharper nitrogen oxide values in the pollutant class “Euro 6”.
In addition, there is more money for the equipment builders: they receive a nationally uniform minimum wage of 10.25 euros.
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what information had reported on Monday morning: the online retailer and video producer, and a variety of other things - buys the Twitch video streaming service for $1.04 billion ($970 million).
The announcement comes surprising, not because no one expected a takeover of Twitch, but because it was widely suspected that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago it seemed as if Twitch's sale to Google's video service was for a big deal decided on, and cooperation also appeared naturally.
Twitch, which was founded only three years ago when Justin.tv was started as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to release their Bravour pieces in games, an “YouTube for live games” such an insider.
The Twitch interface.
And \"let's play\" is a video genre in which better knowledge of the (mostly older) games give an impact of secret science theatres are already very popular on YouTube.
It's just that YouTube is often mentioned when you want to describe Twitch, so the message that YouTube wanted to buy Twitch was taken a little boring, a textbook example of an established technology company that buys a potential competitor.
It is a mystery why the deal with YouTube did not come about, as according to the company reports were willing to pay just as much as Amazon.
All we know at the moment is this statement by Emmet Shear, President of Twitch: “We decided for Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions and they want to help us get there faster,
Another secret is, in fact, the incredible success of Twitch.
For Snobs like me, who explain that they prefer sports to watch, it is difficult to understand the attraction that goes from watching others while playing instead of even taking the control console into their hands.
It's one thing to look over the shoulder to a friend at 3 o'clock in the morning, while she sneaks through Resident Evil, and something quite different to watch a spider shot in his head 20 times in Call of Duty.
You could watch all these games right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games, so watching without your own control of the perspective can be a really good recipe for headaches.
I admit that the fast runs in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronics age complete whole games in record time are entertaining.
But as long as not a game or humor virtuosis is involved, his Twitch channel is probably not so interesting.
But what do skeptics know like I already know about it?
Twitch is called by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic peaks.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money from it?
It is hard to imagine Twitch being integrated as elegantly into Amazon Instant Video as YouTube Twitch could easily have swallowed.
But Twitch has something that every company would like to have: thousands of young men who become advertisers.
As the chairman of Twitch, Shear, said, Amazon and Twitch both believe in the future of gaming, and the medium shows no signs of shrinkage, not even - swallow - as a spectator sport.
At the Hüpfburg at the Burggartenfest there was a lot going on Sunday evening.
The concept of the organizers was true.
Despite the strong rain gusse on Saturday evening, an estimated 1200 music fans came to the open air festival in the Burggarten.
The admission had to be stopped at a time.
“That was annoying, ” said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salzwedel l light and fun.
From two Spanish words, Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem formed the name Amula.
Because the Open Air in the Salzwedeler Burggarten is supposed to radiate brightness in the day and evening through various shows.
Well, and the fun comes from alone anyway.
This was already evident in the early evenings when the first visitors to Open Air opened up.
A celebration for all generations had been promised by the organizers.
And that's what they did.
Around the supply levels on the Burggartenwiese it had made itself salt welder, but also guests from the closer and further surroundings comfortable.
They followed the first live performances, waving with the foot in the tap, enjoyed cool drinks - short: pure relaxation and enjoyment were indicated.
And that's across the generations.
While the white sand on the beach bar was lumbling on ceilings on the extra-carried ceilings, others were allowed to drink wine in the Vinothek in one quarter, the young people were toiling at the Hüpfburg, which was a great attraction for the smaller guests.
But the voluntary helpers in the truest sense of the word also had to do all their hands to become Lord to the urge and to enchant imaginative creations into the small faces.
The bigger ones used the kickers tables or participated in a skateboard workshop, which the goodfoot crew from Salzwedel set up.
Until the big rain came.
Shortly before 5.30 p.m., he danced down on the visitors, especially families were looking for the pasture and dryness.
But the attraction of the festival did not cancel this.
“There were more people than expected, ” said Ron Sem, who spoke of a ‘success on the whole line.’
That's why there's nothing to repeat the big party next year.
Although content and size of the event still have to be worked, Sem made it clear in a first balance sheet on Sunday compared to the popular vote.
As an angry one, he said that in the meantime the admission had to be stopped.
Obviously, the security company had been booked with too little force.
The result: Some who had already paid did not come to the site anymore.
The response was very good.
In a first careful estimate, the Salzwedeler co-organizer spoke of about 1200 visitors, who were tumultuous in the Burggarten.
There were problems with sound technology.
The Salzwedeler Hip-Hop-Band Blocks`n`Rox broke off its performance.
The technicians were not able to create a semi-reasonable sound.
The planned Shisha lounges could not be built, because the tents could not be brought to salt weld due to a tire pan.
“But in the next year they will be there, so the organiser will be.
The premiere of the Amula Open Air was more than successful by the number of visitors.
And that in bad weather.
However, the organizers have made some mistakes that are still being forgiven for the first time, but must be eliminated in the second edition.
In the social network Facebook too, the organizers have to take criticism.
“Sorry, but for twelve euros you’ve just been expecting more - Melanie Meier is on the event page.
“Unfortunately, you took over a bit,” Ele Zimmermann says in the same place.
Others do not see the initial problems very closely.
I think it's very good that some not only stutter stupidly, but also really try to put something on their feet.
Hut off, writes Stephanie Jenß to the amula.
Now the organisers will have a year of time to make these critical points.
New Radom in Berkum: Wachtberg's landmark shrinks
It's not as expected.
Rather, the ready-made component is waiting to be used in the distinctive building.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: almost 50 years after the space observation radar TIRA is established, the case, called Radom, is completely renewed.
The new Radom will be slightly smaller with a diameter of 47.5 meters than the old one.
But the size still remains world record.
The last step in completing the new case is the cap exchange
The upper quarter of the old case is separated and removed with a crane.
After that, the last quarter of the new case is erected.
As soon as the weather starts, the action should go over the stage at the beginning of this week.
The participant in the Ice Bucket Challenge refuels Kiefer
Isabelle Roberts from Great Britain cried so much when her icy water was poured over her head that she violated the bone structure of her face.
This Ice Bucket challenge went painfully beyond that.
A woman was taken to the hospital after she screamed so much at the Ice Bucket challenge that she pulled off her jaw.
Isabelle Roberts from Great Britain was so much concerned when her icy water was poured over her head that she violated her facial structure.
“The water was so cold that I screamed, and while I was doing it, my jaw just stopped standing,” she said to The Mirror.
Ice water is poured over the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but that didn't go, the jaw was stuck, and then I understood that something was wrong.
My mother and my sister also saw this and almost went into the pants before laughing, but I had to get into the emergency room.
The 20-year-old from Great Britain has been hospitalized to reinstate the jaw after participating in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip has been linked to an Internet sensation and a thousand times to Facebook and Twitter.
Will the Burgvereins move back to a line soon?
Finally, there was always strife between the two Wolfratshauser Burgvereinen.
Now the board is thinking about possible cooperation.
As an example of the reconstruction of the Wolfratshauser Burg, the deceased Richard Dimbath, former chairman of the Wolfratshauser Burgfreunde, launched the project in the French Guédelon.
A year ago there was no good climate between the Burgverein and the Burgfreunden Wolfratshausen.
The views of how to deal with the history of Wolfratshaus Castle and a possible reconstruction have seemed very different so far.
Now the two camps are moving on to each other: discussions will soon be held on a common approach.
This is confirmed by Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfreunde) on demand of our newspaper.
“I called Mr. Piffl and suggested that we could put ourselves together once,” reports Sjöberg.
In his view, all members of both associations could move back to one line in the future.
Thus, visible successes are more quickly evident.
While the Burgfreunde around the suddenly dead Richard Dimbath had a reconstruction of the castle on the mountain forest, for the Burgverein um Sjöberg, the site is at the forefront of the site.
Herbert Piffl, second chairman of the Burgfreunde, was very pleased with his own information about the call.
Since Dimbath's death, he has been in charge of the castle friends.
A new chairman is to be found at a meeting of members in mid-September.
At present, according to the 74-year-old, the club counts about 40 members.
“After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we had the association activities rested out of respect at first - this “denk phase” was necessary to think about how it could continue,”
According to Piffl, the new chairman is to go into the conversation with the Burgverein.
Until then, the castle friends could also make a current mood picture within their grouping.
A candidate for the Presidency is not yet available, says Piffl.
\"But I am confident that someone will find himself -- He himself doesn't want to practice because he has his residence in Bad Tölz.
The new chairman should be a Wolfratshauser.
The Tölzer would like to continue working on the project “but very much like to cooperate”
The different positions in terms of reconstruction will probably remain in the eyes of Piffl's in the near future.
He honours Dimbath as a “missionary” who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar, well advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an airlock.
Because of the high participation of the population and by voluntary volunteers from all over the world, they are a tourist magnet.
Piffl: “I was also skeptical at first.
But in the course of time, I have become more and more convinced that it is useful to drive forward the project - a single feature could be created for the river town.
There's nothing here.
In addition, Piffl believes that the project could be funded by EU grants, visitor tickets and potential sponsors.
“I don’t want to just throw the idea of reconstruction overboard in person,” he hopes, “that the Burgverein may be moving something at this point.
Their goal of documenting history at first is important and good.
After that, you could continue looking.
Clever ways to save at university textbooks
Since the cost of university textbooks is more than $1,000 per year for many students, the fast-second semester student Matt Schroeder considered himself a clever sparide.
He invented a loan system for books of higher semester students and offered a nominal compensation to delay the resale.
“My math book usually costs $1180, but I got it for $10 for one semester and a Chick-fil-a-cook,” said Schroeder, 19, who attended Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester would have cost him $430, he said.
He spent $120.
The college board reported that on average, students spend more than $1,200 annually on textbooks and study materials, but there were different cost-reduction options for students.
Online songs and creative approaches like the Schroeders are increasingly the solution of choice for students.
Renting textbooks is becoming more popular, and so students can use a book for a semester, often at a significantly cheaper price than when buying it.
Neebo Inc, who runs more than 250 university bookstores, announced that the renting of text books has doubled since 2011.
Surveys in the industry show that about a quarter of the books were rented in the college bookstores last spring semester, said Neebos Vice President Tevor Meyer.
Less than half of all textbooks are purchased in campus bookstores according to the Trade Association National Association of College Stores.
Here's the one time for the best deals.
Buy online
Some new books cost only one-third of the price online for which they are to have in the campus bookstore.
The ninth edition of \"Calculus\" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $290, but can be obtained at the specialized textbook retailer Chegg.com for $239.99.
Buy used
If the notes of other or normal signs of use do not matter, used books are a good option.
\"Calculus\" is used on Chegg.com to have $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, graduate student at Brigham Young University, says he spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used edition of \"Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business\"
The book was sold for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, Head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls, recommended students to ask their professors if previous expenses were permitted.
Sometimes the updates for the seminar work are not relevant.
In such cases, older spending can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest expenditure.
Besides Chegg and Amazon, Half.com is also a popular alternative to used books by eBay Inc.
Rent
Renting textbooks is worth considering if you treat them fairly well, remember to give them back and you don't want to keep the books after finishing the course.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased book.
For example, a student could rent \"Calculus\" for the duration of a semester for about $20.
Inform yourself about the provisions of the business where you rent, including the penalty fees that may apply to writing notes, underlines or signs of use.
Tenders: If you don't return the book, the penalty fees can even exceed the price of a new book.
E-Books
E-books instead of conventional textbooks are also an option.
Sometimes these books are de facto rented by providing an electronic license for a certain period of wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
At Chegg you can rent \"Calculus\" for 6 months for about $61.
Bracey says that students in literacy courses often find the best offers, as many classics can be downloaded for free today, while scientific and engineering textbooks can be very expensive.
Take a look around.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon attend Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for price determination in books, as you can be so sure to find the right textbook.
And before an online order, you should check, according to Gault, if the book is actually in stock.
He learned this lesson on the hard tour.
He bought a book that had four weeks of delivery time and finally paid the full price in the college bookstore.
Why “Guardians of the Galaxy” did not become a cashier
“The Expendables 3 - by Sylvester Stallone played less than 30 million dollars of his 90 million dollar budget in the US, while “Sin City: A Dame to Kill For - only recorded 12 million dollars of his budget of 70 million dollars.
The film \"Sex Tape\" that was cut to Cameron Diaz only played $14.6 million at the opening weekend, while children's films such as \"Drachenzähmen\" made 2 - also disappoint with the revenue.
An article by telegraph film critic Robbie Collin indicates that in the children's films the lack of quality in the films could be the reason themselves.
Collin referred to 2014 as \"the worst year - so far for children's movies and described \"drachenzämen leichtgemamen 2 - as purely \"functional\" fantasy continuation.
In the case of films for a slightly older target group, however, it seems as if the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritical rating for each summer film launch, which was shown on at least 2000 canvases between the American Memorial Day and 20 July 2013 and the current year.
The results are based on the opinion of cinema visitors and film critics and indicate that this year's movie hits are equivalent to those of last year.
Some commentators believe that development is due to changing viewing habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's soon-to-be jungle book film, said to Hollywood reporter: “I think the times are changing,
We must accept this and not try to follow the past.
In contrast to the currently weak cash results of Hollywood productions, Netflix has recently achieved sales with the streaming content of $1.2 billion, almost twice as much as last year in which sales amounted to $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios for focusing too much on filming of comics and prophesing a \"core melt\" of Hollywood.
In the light of the current deterioration, some commentators argue that his dark prophecy could contain a true core.
However, due to the potential cashiers to be expected in summer 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic:
The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, recently described the decrease in cash revenue as simply \"cyclical\" and said to Hollywood reporter: \"The next summer will be the biggest summer at the cinema box at all, and nobody will worry about the business anymore,
When the 2nd table tennis district class was deleted a few years ago to streamline the league classification, this has been a step in the right direction.
Now the Deutsche Tischtennisbund has taken an additional 3rd Bundesliga into the program.
The consequence: Whoever has not risen has gone down.
Göttingen's highest class team, Torpedo, has avoided the decline in the Oberliga-Relegation, but only plays fifth in the next season.
The fourth class of Torpedos remains ladies, despite their grand march into the regional league.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Lower Saxonyenliga, as well as the boys of the SC Wende.
The SG Lenglers and the Torpedo Reserves arrive in the new association league, in which the Landesliga no longer represent Göttinger Clubs.
With the ladies the TTV Geismar plays in the Verbandsliga, the Torpedo-Zweite in the Landesliga.
What the composition looks like is a better district class, is now the new district overliga South.
Here TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Bovender SV, Langenholtensen, FC Weser and TTC join.
In the district league, as regional representatives Dransfeld and the SC Wende play, in the district class of the TTC II, Red-White, the Bovender SV II and the teams of the TTV Geismar II and III. The district league of the ladies starts at least in height.
Güntersen, TTC and TTV Geismar II are here with the party.
Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen run in the district league.
With nine teams each
The SC Wende sends his girls to the small district league.
Also the district league staff of the SCW boys - there still starts Torpedo II - is not complete.
In a district class Geismar, Tuspo Wende and the Ovender SV enter the season.
In the first season of the newly founded Regional Association, the two Göttingen Kreisligen started with nine teams each.
In the West-Staffel are the Red-White II, Upper SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lenglern II.
In the Ost-Staffel, there are, among others, Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen.
The ladies' circle league consists of Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Wende and the SG Rhume.
This is still better than the Osterode district, where there are no women's teams at all at all on the circuit level.
Noting that none of the six 2nd circuit classes achieves scale, here the innovative and impulsive circuit board will have to think once.
Nato Summit: First Protests in Newport and Cardiff
On the weekend there were protests by opponents of the Nato summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the centre of Newport for an anti-Nato march.
On Sunday about 150 people gathered in Cardiff in front of the town hall there to hold a so-called anti-terrorist summit.
Stephen Fairclough has been following the developments on weekends and talking to demonstrators who have traveled from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers fled the Blue Mountains
ZWEI young bushmen were kept safe with the rope wind after being caught overnight in the Blue Mountains in NSW.
THE 16-year-old girl and 19-year-old man broke up for their tour in Govett's Leap in Blackheath shortly after Sunday afternoon.
Concerned relatives called the police at about 20 o'clock when the two of them weren't returning home.
A search force from local police and rescue services broke up and the couple was found at about 23 o'clock near the Bridal Veil waterfalls.
The girl had hurt herself at the knee and the man had crashed and had hit his head.
Rescue forces stayed with the couple overnight, and they were flew out on Monday morning.
They were delivered to the Blue Mountains Hospital in stable condition with an ambulance.
Government hostile protests escalating in Pakistan
The about 1000 demonstrators were pushed from the PTV building by soldiers, said Minister of Information Pervaiz Rashid.
After about half an hour, the transmitter re-recorded the radiation.
PTV Director Athar Farooq said the demonstrators equipped with sticks would have damaged devices in the editorial.
Dead or injured were not reported.
The demonstrators call for the resignation of the Head of Government, to whom they object to electoral fraud.
The police told us that about a kilometer from the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, on Monday, about 3000 demonstrators had met with security forces.
According to hospital records, a police officer was injured.
During the weekend at least three people were killed and more than 500 injured when demonstrators tried to advance to Sharif's residence.
They call for the resignation of the Prime Minister.
On Sunday evening after a meeting in the Army headquarters, the powerful military had called for a political solution to the conflict, “don’t waste time and do it without violence,”
The report further stated: \"The army remains committed to ensuring the security of the state,
The escalating violence has caused concern for an intervention by the military, which has already been more frequent in the past.
The protests led by the opposition politician Imran Khan and the preacher Tahirul Qadri have continued since the day of independence on August 14.
Sharif refuses a resignation.
Khan and Qadri had called on their followers on Sunday to endure.
“We won’t go back without forcing Sharif to resign,” Khan said.
Qadri expressed himself similarly.
Khan accuses Sharif of having won the parliamentary election last May through fraud.
Qadri calls for the withdrawal of central and provincial governments.
Then a transitional government should reform the electoral system and issue new elections.
More than 40,000 security forces are in operation to protect the government district.
At first, the protesters had peacefully endured before Parliament, until Khan and Qadri called them to Sharif's residence on weekends.
Hütteldorfer after second season victory in place three of the table.
With the 2:0 above grace, Rapid took a peaceful end on Sunday for a bitter week.
“The victory is very liberating,” said coach Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached an intermediate level with the Aus in the Europa League on Thursday.
“The success experience was incredibly important, ” confirmed Captain and Torschützte Steffen Hofmann, who, with Green-White, was in place of three.
Schrammel-Traumtor brings Rapid to Siegerstraße Rapid with the second season victory has shown the right reaction to the disappointment against Helsinki and goes with a success experience into the country game break.
“We wanted to show a positive reaction,” said external defender Thomas Schrammel, who, with his wonderful leadership-volley of the Sixteen-Reck in the 14th minute, set the course for victory.
“I thought I was going to get all the frustration of Thursday and snag him under the latte,” the 26-year-old smiled.
When Schrammel met for the last time in a Bundesliga party on 13 Novmember 2010, that was still for Ried.
The first championship goal in the Rapid-Dress will therefore remain with him in special memory.
“This is something very special to me, I am of the Rapid Younger generation,” Schrammel said.
Due to Mario Pavelic's short-term blizzard, Schrammel moved from the left to the right defensive side and also made his case very good there.
He has enough experience that he can also exercise this position in a mirror.
The gate he deserved, he's already done some assistants here - praised Barisic.
The team shows the character Schrammel also delivered the flank at 2:0 by Hofmann after an hour, which finally made the decision.
For the guests could have written before that.
“Thanks to God, we have had some luck today,” Schrammel also noted, which has been referring to the division of performance and result over the past few weeks: “The results have not voted, but the player has always been good compared to the last year,”
Barisic even found that in many games one had been better than today - against - the strongest team played this season in this stadium -
The first three-pointer since July 26 thus proved that the team structure was intact to the backlash: \"Today my team has shown that it has character,
For him, it is no less gratifying: \"That we have finally played too null again,
Much work during country play Also the fact that several failures are to be complained with Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger gave their starting debuts make the victory even more valuable.
“You must not forget this,” said Barisic, who lost in the past three days with Behrendt and Pavelic players, “who have been very stable in recent times.
Therefore, the national break needed to be used in order to \"leak wounds and make a bit of physical progress\" explained Barisic, who has five U21 electors in his ranks.
One that seems to be particularly close to the break is Captain Hofmann.
He breaks up for the team, goes over pain.
Especially in this difficult phase, he has shown that he is a very important player for us - confirmed Barisic.
Hofmann gave the game Rapids before his departure in the 68th minute not only the structure, but also the second goal.
For the 33-year-old who finished his 350th Bundesliga game, it was the first hit out of the game since November 2, 2013 (4.2 over the Admira).
Hofmann: \"If you don't believe that everything is good now, we're sure we've had a bit of luck, but at some point happiness needs to come back to us.
Now it was high time - said Hofmann.
He freely urged concentrated further work: “You can’t always see this black and white.
We haven't played as badly in the last few weeks as this has been shown.
But we must not believe that everything is good now.
He could not dispute the importance of his role for the team.
It's a very young team that I can really help right now.
They hold on to me at certain stages, said Hofmann.
\"Grödig-Coach Michael Baur had little to offer himself and his team.
He regretted the fast counter hit, from the Wizarding category, as well as the regular goal of utility in the 40th minute, which had been recognised wrongly by Arbitrator Collegger.
The only excuse I can make for the team is that we were towards Tor in some stages not concrete enough.
We've had too few closures.
The internal defender Maximilian Karner similarly saw it: “It started very badly, but then we found in and even made a gate.
The whole thing would have been more in it.
Under this whip there is Ruh
We showed a powerful trunk in our puzzle task of the summer series \"My piece of Rhöner Glück\" last Friday.
Several of these tree giants still exist in the county, the specimen pictured is the \"smooth oak\" above sub-white brown.
A hollow footpath leads up to the around 600-year-old oak.
It passes through groups, basalt stone heaps and basalt stone lakes.
A piece below the stone's break from Bauersberg, one kilometer north of the road to Weisbach, stands there.
Vital looks like the natural monument, it extends beyond the other trees of the surrounding area and reminds of an American mammoth tree with an extent of over eight meters.
A small Buddha on a tree trunk indicates that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
However, despite intensive research, there was only evidence of the origin of the name.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has also consulted the Bishopsheim Archive and asked older people from Unterweitenbrunn to find out what meaning it has with the jigsaw.
The result of his research remained the rather sober explanation for the name.
Thus, until about 80 years ago, goat hairs should have driven their animals from sub-white-brown to the hard-rooted and stone-free meadows.
At the foot of the tree shall the animal keepers exhausted from the ascent shall have rested.
In the meantime, the area has regained its importance, because in the meadows, goat herds actually feed again.
The area has also been declared the core zone of the Biosphere Reserve, Schneider has further found out.
When entering the stone collections, however, caution should be exercised, as the basalt warmed up by the sun is also a popular place for cruisers.
A hiking trail leads from sub-white brown to the tree, but is somewhat hidden.
Further routes are signposted, up the direction of Hochrhön and invite to an extended hike.
Where's the Wasserburg?
However, a water castle, which is sought at our next task, is rather rare in height.
The mirroring in the tomb already gives a good impression of the building, but we have some historical buildings in the county to which the building counterfei could fit.
Where is our “piece of Rhöner Glück” located?

After a week of retiring, Italy's prime minister and EU official Matteo Renzi, opposed strong conservative resistance at the EU Sonnengerpfel last week to the nomination of his foreign minister Federica Mogherini as head of EU foreign policy, she became successor to Britain's Catherine Ashton.
Renzi considers, as the government’s close daily newspaper La Repubblica reflects, the vocation of his Mogherini, also known as a favourite within the government team, as strengthening the position of social democrats and his own in the EU.
He also expects a drive for his \"reform package\" in Italy.
Not least, Renzi hopes that the left-wing party base will be calm again and again, because Mogherini is assigned to it, though in a moderate way.
In contrast to conservative representatives with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Poland nominated as President of the Council, Donald Tusk, the prevailing opinion in Rome was to achieve political compensation.
Because the EU Chief Diplomat will be Deputy President Juncker at the same time.
The outstanding agreement of the EU Parliament is considered to be safe.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly have called the 41-year-old politician of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) a \"important recognition\" of Italy's role in the EU.
La Repubblica spreads optimism that, for almost two decades, Mogherini, known for her ambitions, has grown up to face the \"enormous challenges\".
The Roman is married and has two daughters.
Her party career began in 1996 in the youth organization of the then Democratic di Sinistra (Left Democrats), which joined the Catholic Centre Party of Margherita in 2008 to present-day Social Democratic PD.
In 1999, Mogherini became Vice President of the European Community Organization of Socialist Youth (European Youth Socialists).
With the 2001 election to the left-wing Democratic Party Council, she entered high party politics, working in the Foreign Policy Division, whose head soon became her.
Its traditional focus was on Italian foreign policy, such as the Middle East, which was known by studies on NATO use in Afghanistan, in which Italy is involved with a contingent of troops, and made contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and with the Democrats in the United States.
Since 2008 she has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies, in which she is expert in defence and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became prime minister in February 2014, he called Mogherini to become his foreign minister.
If the PD again has a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country, which contributed to more than 40 percent of the party's votes in the EU elections in May, then, as noted in PD circles, Federica Mogherini has a share of it.
Preservations in Brussels, the new EU external representative has too little diplomatic experience, so lack of substance, will be countered in the PD.
In Brussels, especially by Poland and the Baltic members, Mogherini's unrealistically realistic accents on the crisis in Ukraine are being divulged as a 'Russia-friendly course'.
It supports the pipeline South Stream operated by the Russian company Gasprom, via which Russian natural gas is to be transported directly to southern Europe, which also serves the energy security of Italy.
After Renzi took office in July as EU President, Mogherini traveled to Moscow for her first visit to the state.
Photos showing them with Putin at Shake-hands were taken in Brussels with outrage, and they also invited the Kremlin Chief for October to a Milan Economic Summit.
A total of nine young people started their training at emz-Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
Among these is an Azubi, which has previously completed another training in the company.
In four training professions, the new staff will work in the future: electronics (three trainees), mechatronics (two), tool mechanics (two) and process mechanics (two).
All Azubis come from the district of Schwandorf: Tobias Braun and Thomas Bücherl from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidgaden, Johannes Beer from Neunburg form Wald, Felix Doomaier from Oberviechtach, Daniel worry-free and Sebastian Zahner from Pfremmd and Ferdinand Strebl from Teunz.
The new trainees previously attended primary and secondary schools and real schools.
From Wednesday to Friday, the trainees of all year rounds and the instructors will go to a team training event in Oberammergau, where, among other things, an all-day hike and rafting are on the inside.
The company counts 435 and 950 employees worldwide throughout Germany.
The number of trainees distributed over all ages is 27.
The socialists in France should \"keep their mouths and put France in order,\" said Francois Hollande's most important ally.
Mr. Valls called on the deeply divided left to show “their love” for the controversial socialist president, whose cabinet education was opposed to the large majority of the French.
The President deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
“It’s our duty to stay on his side,” he said with great applause.
As a compelling gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government would not question the controversial 35-hour week in France, despite the strong demands for a resolution of the regulations of Emmanuel Macrons, the new Minister of Economic Affairs.
On Saturday, Mr Hollande had called upon his fellow socialists to show themselves “united” with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the Minister of Justice, drove Sand into the gear, where she appeared at a meeting of abducted socialist delegates and criticized the Socialist Party for taking the French “faith in their future. ”
Marine Le Pen, the leader on the far right of the National Front, mocked the constant digging of the socialists and said that they could not imagine the new Valls government going through for more than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls also has none, they are forced to form a new government if the old did not survive even a summer.
“And the new one will also not survive the fall or winter,” said Miss Le Pen to supporters.
She reiterated her party's call for a resolution from Parliament and said that she was confident of emerging as a winner in pre-election elections and was ready for the government.
France's ruling party suffered defeat in the municipal elections in March and the right-wing National Front was in front of the EU elections in May.
A survey in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche revealed that 76 percent of French people believe that the Socialist Party is exposed to the danger of collapsing into several rival groups before the end of the 2017 Dutch term.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government did not achieve any improvement in the economy and record unemployment figures.
“There’s a small window for opportunities, but public opinion must quickly feel that things are changing,” he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could worsen further.
Norwegian Cruise just before a deal with prestige Cruises of $3 billion
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest cruiser in the world, has been leading advanced negotiations to acquire the competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc for about $3 billion, according to industry experts.
A deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to the luxury cruise ships of Prestige Cruises as well as to its wealthier clientship, while there is competition with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
An agreement could already be announced this week, the sources said on Sunday and warned that the talks could end without results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the Apollo Global Management LLC private equity company (APO.N) also owns a 20 percent share of Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to remain anonymous because the negotiations were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while a spokesman for Apollo rejected a comment.
The Norwegian Cruise company, based in Miami, operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean Sea, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
His revenue was $2.57 billion in 2013, an increase of 13 percent compared to 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also located in Miami, operates under the brand names Oceania and Regent, which jointly operate eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean Sea, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenue for 2013 of $1.2 billion, an increase of 6 percent compared to the previous year.
The cruise industry totals approximately $29 billion and in the coming years is expected for it due to the strengthening of the middle class in emerging countries such as China and India.
The companies are trying to position themselves for these new customers as the best choice for cruise providers.
Prestige Cruises applied to the U.S. regulatory authorities in January 2014.
Apollo is the majority shareholder of the company since an $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was created in its current form in 2000 by a merger with a cruise provider owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a leisure and casino association under the control of the Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in the Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise went to the stock market in January 2013.
Ghenting held 28 percent of the shares at the end of June, Apollo 20 percent of the shares and the TPG Capital LP private equity company held an 8 percent share of the company.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise jointly own more than 82 percent of the passenger capacity of American cruise ships, according to the original application documents for the Prestige Cruises Stock Exchange.
Pro-Hongkong activists condemn China on the day after the election.
The Chinese flag was held in the vicinity of a pecking faithful group.
On Sunday, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress passed a framework law that allows only two or three candidates to vote in Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first receive the majority support of a nomination committee, which is likely to be occupied by ex-members.
This decision will make it almost impossible for oppositional Democrats to be admitted to the election and will cause pro-democracy activists to perceive their threat and paralyze Hong Kong with ‘Occupy Central’ protests.
Political reforms have long been a controversial issue in Hong Kong, and China's leadership fears that the calls for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following the publication of a Beijing White Paper, which set out China’s predominance over Hong Kong in June, democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on the electoral procedure in the Special Administrative Region, where hundreds of thousands marched into the city’s business district and organized a sit-in there.
Lis survey is organised by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
The Deputy Chairman of the Legal Commission of the Standing Committee, Zhang Rongshun and the Vice Director of the Hong Kong Office of Affairs and Macaus of the Council of State, Feng Wei, should be consulted during the day.
Student activists announced that they would gather in the afternoon in front of the office of leaders in Hong Kong.
By the end of the 150-year colonial government in Hong Kong, Great Britain had no democratic elements.
Putin demands that Ostukraine should be included in the dialogues with the State.
According to Russian President Vladimir Putin, Russian media reports on Sunday required the Ukrainian government to put an end to the fights against separatists in the east of the country and to start negotiations on the \"statehood\" of the depriving region.
His spokesman Dimitri Peskow later made it clear that Putin did not mean that the territory of the Ostukraine under the control of the Separatists would be part of Russia, but that its status towards Ukraine would have to be redefined in order to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.
Putin's call to the Kiev government for negotiations at eye level with the pro-Russian insurgents, however, fits with the strategy apparently pursued five months ago by him since the beginning of the outpourings: aid for the separatists in taking territory and pressure on the Ukrainian government to enable the newly proclaimed region of Novorossiya factual independence for an alliance with Russia rather than with the West.
In an interview with the state television channel One Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to recapture the areas held by separatists in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were taken in March and April after Moscow had annexed the Ukrainian peninsula Crimea on 18 March.
The Kremlin and the Separatists have recently referred to the occupied area as ‘Novorossija’ or ‘Neurossia’, a term reminiscent of the pre-revolutionary shine period of the Russian Empire.
Putin pointed out that in the course of the campaign of Ukrainian politicians for elections on 26 Oct. and while government groups have civil communities in areas held by separatists, itar-tass reported that they are hoping for quick peace talks “in their illusions”.
“We need to have a detailed discussion, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organisation of the society and the state status of the South East Ukraine in order to preserve the interests of the people living there,” he said.
Peskow said that Putin's reference to statehood in the context of greater autonomy, which has been discussed by the Kiewer leadership for months, must be seen to dispel fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are at risk.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the necessary autonomy to the eastern regions, said Peskow.
It's not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskow said, \"because it's not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but about an internal conflict in Ukraine,
The Kremlin spokesperson's explanation for the correction of Putin's “fell interpretation” remarks highlighted Russia's claim to leadership in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the East, as opposed to the direct annexation of Crimea, on which the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have far greater difficulties in annexing the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in the Ostukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and polls from the time before the conflict resulted in a broad majority for the stay in Ukraine.
The autonomy addressed by Russian diplomats on international forums would give the regional governments in Ukraine the power to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations, thus giving Kremlin de facto control over an area that connects the Russian state area to Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, annexed five months ago, is the home port for most of the Russian Navy, as well as an important trading port and historic coastal region.
The regions between the Rostov region in Russia and the Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian military.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed in his speech on 7 June that Ukrainian legislation should consider additions to the Constitution, with which the respective territories should be given greater control over their finances and the status of languages.
But his notion of autonomy seems to stand in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels whose weapons and insurrection Moscow is accused.
Putin's last call to Kiev to negotiate with the Separatist leaders at eye level followed a further advance by the rebels last week, after Russian troops and tanks have entered the Ostukraine via the previously peaceful region along the Asov Sea.
The Separatists, supported by Russia, took over in the hands of the Ukrainian security officers, who, according to the fears of Ukrainian security officials, is the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region up to Crimea, the control of Novoasovsk.
For this reason, massive civil and military preparations have been launched to establish Mariupol, a steel industrial port with 500,000 inhabitants situated between Novoasovsk and narrow access to Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke on Saturday at a meeting of the EU leadership in Brussels and urgently asked for action to prevent another Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic which has been independent for 23 years.
“We’re just in front of a point where there’s no back,” warned Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now located in the territory of Ukraine.
The EU Summit did not decide any concrete actions, the leadership demanded the draft further sanctions against Russia to enter into force in an unspecified escalation of the Ukraine crisis.
Ukraine soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk, after two Russian colonizers and 1,000 soldiers entered the Donezk region last week to support the besieged separatists, Colonel Andrij Lysenko, spokesperson of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council reports on Saturday in Kiev.
The first 63 Ukrainian soldiers included in the Russian invasion of Ilowajsk were exchanged on Sunday against 10 Russian parachute hunters who had been captured in Ukrainian territory a week ago, and Lysenko told them on Sunday.
Naked photo scandal around Australian Promise and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten did not make a helm about his troubles over hackers who probably stole naked images of his fiancée Gabi Grecko and a Who is Who the A-promis from Hollywood.
The film town is in excitement, after a series of clear photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence have appeared in a hacking scandal for promiscuity on the Internet.
The hacker, who is responsible for this, probably has 60 naked photos of Lawrence, Star, and Superstars, including the models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, the singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle and the actress Kirsten Dunst.
By Australian actress Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne, private photos were allegedly also made due to an iCloud-hole public.
There are 101 promises on the list.
Edelsten, who had been engaged to Grecko last month, said to Confidential: “It’s disgusting.
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and passed on to others.
Grecko, in New York at the time, reported that according to a news website, the hack \"was shameful\" and that the affected \"was hurting\" felt.
The hacker probably has 30 pictures of Palmer with her ex-girlfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots in which she is on top without being in a pool.
The film works Palmers include \"Love is invincible\" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovski and the actress Browning from Sucker Punch were not available for comments on the hacked images yesterday.
A representative Lawrence' said to TMZ: \"It's a terrible violation of privacy\"
Actor Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his tweet: “Posting hacked pictures from a cell phone is nothing but selling hehlerware“
Just legally, the dissemination of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Radler, Jogger and Wanderer were present yesterday at the 8th Puzzle on the Großen Feldberg and thus supported the association “Help for Cancer-Sicked Children”.
The tour, which was one torturous, provided easy training for the others.
In one, however, everyone agreed: It was fun.
Thomas Studanski may have slept well last night.
For the first time in his life, the head of the Oberurseler Brauhaus went to Feldberg yesterday by bike.
For the good purpose.
He can easily hide the little muscle cat there, especially since participation on the 8th wheels on the Große Feldberg in favor of the association “Help for Cancer Children” (Frankfurt) has also brought a valuable knowledge personally.
It's a great thing.
“I now know that I can do that - fine “
Little pausing on the way in the applause curve?
No, if I had stopped, I'd have been out...
Like Thomas Studanski, who is sitting for the CDU in the Oberurseler Stadtparlament, many of the 718 participants complained yesterday in the morning about mountains and came close to exhaustion, but happily arrived on the plateau.
On the other hand, it was easier for others to cross the 11-kilometre long distance between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Dietsner, for example.
The green politician who appeared in red from the circuit day - red dress, red bike - did something else at the start of the understatement - each lot of professionals, there is the goal to arrive), but then proved to be half professional on the mountain and went through the finish after 45 minutes without need of breath.
He also went through the route in a slide, as did Nina Kuhn, a press spokesperson of the city of Oberursel, who had made his way along with Frank Grüneisen.
For the two triathletes, the \"Feldberg-Radling\" was not necessarily a sporting challenge: \"Here we are about Charity, we are happy to be with it - we would have made an exit anyway - so Kuhn.
They had met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg on the way.
The boy (12) went down to Oberursel in the morning to strike straight back to the height.
The Frankfurt Florian Zierz had swung into the saddle at 9 a.m. in the morning, “mighty” the Feldberg twice to roll home with fun.
Also had fun \"Fritten-Toni\"
For the head of the Oberurseler Kultkiosks, bike tours across the Feldberg are simply included.
He had reached 40 minutes with his 6.5-kilo racing wheel.
A crazy event.
For this purpose - I like to be there - Andreas Balzke said.
The trained Mainzer tells himself that he is an “ambigated racing cyclist”.
He has to be so, because he was on the road with the \"Fixie-Rad\", but that's also racing bikes, but without switching...
Not only did the 20 hikers, who climbed over the White Wall and the fox stand to the top, prove that it was also a jogger, who on a cord made a car tire with weights behind them.
Bergwacht-Arzt Professor Volker Lischke, who, with his team equipped with Allrad-Bully and Quad, took care of safety, said: \"I know - I'm from Frankfurt, who trains for a special sled train, only that he keeps the sleds himself - so the man is certainly his own sled dog.
The 718 participants - and thus as many as ever - were sent in groups in the morning.
The hikers first at 9.30 p.m.
The first cyclists and runners followed at 10 o'clock.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bikers set off.
Bent Hansen, chairman of the association \"Radeln auf den Großen Feldberg\" gave the start commands and wished the participants a nice trip.
For next year he hopes that it will be possible to block the route up to Feldberg to the safety of the participants.
