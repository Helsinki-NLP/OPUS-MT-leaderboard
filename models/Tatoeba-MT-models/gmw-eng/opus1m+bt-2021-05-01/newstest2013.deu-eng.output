A Republican strategy to counter Obama's re-election
The leaders of the Republicans justified their policy with the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter to be a myth by confirming that the electoral fraud in the United States is rarer than the number of people killed by the lightning strike.
By the way, the lawyers of Republicans have recorded only 300 cases of electoral fraud in 10 years in the United States.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the participation of voters.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for the implementation of the elections in the individual states.
In this sense, since 2009, the majority of American governments have announced new laws that make registration or urination difficult.
This phenomenon gained importance after the November 2010 elections, in which 675 new Republican representatives could be registered in 26 states.
As a result, 180 draft laws were introduced in 2011 alone, restricting the exercise of electoral law in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to present a photo identification and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws also shorten the time limits for early voting, declaring the right to register as an electorate on the day of the election, and depriving citizens of the right to vote for whom a court act is available.
Before the 2006 elections, no U.S. state required voters to present a photo ID.
Indiana was the first state to raise such a claim.
In 2008, the Supreme Court of the United States confirmed the constitutionality of Indiana's law.
The Republican authorities decided to extend this practice to other countries.
Over the last two years, they have been promoting legislation in 34 states with which voters are forced to present a photo identification.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, US citizens do not have a universal card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of US citizens, i.e. 21 million elective persons do not have a photo ID issued by a government authority of their state.
In addition, five million new voters do not have such a ID in 2012.
However, often more than one hundred dollars are to be paid in order to obtain the necessary ID.
The new restrictions affect young people, minorities and low-income people disproportionately.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people with incomes of less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over 65 years of age and 20% of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 do not have the necessary photo ID.
That's enough.
Students who are regarded as voters who give their voice to democratic candidates are not allowed to use their photo identification issued by their institution in several states.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting associations who choose more strongly for the Republican side to use the cards issued by these associations for elections.
Before 2004, no state for the election required proof of citizenship.
Arizona was the first state to introduce such a claim.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to demonstrate their U.S. citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting Hispanic votes.
Because it is obvious that two out of three Hispanic voters prefer the democratic party.
In addition, Republican legislators supported laws in eight states in 2011 that abolished the registration of voters on the day of the election.
In addition, you have limited the right of individuals and groups to assist voters who wish to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the 2004 voter registration campaigns have helped to register about 10 million citizens.
As a result of the measures adopted since 2009, the share of newcomers’ registration in 2010 has decreased by 17% compared to 2006.
In addition, the Republican legislators have passed laws in five other states aimed at shortening the period for early voting.
For example, in the 2008 general elections in Florida, 33% of the voters who elected in advance were African-Americans, although they accounted for only 13% of the state's voters.
The same applies to the Hispanic population.
The latter accounted for only 11% of voters, but 24% of the citizens who chose in advance.
In contrast, the whites who represented 76% of the voters accounted for only 46% of the voters who chose in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters have vigorously opposed the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
Several draft laws were blocked by the vetoes of democratic governors.
The U.S. Attorney General has intervened to enforce the most controversial laws.
They could partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID.
However, the newly introduced rules in 2012 will undoubtedly make it difficult to exercise the right to vote.
The democratic critics challenge the party political nature of the passed laws and see in them as a clear goal the influence of results in the countries decisive for 2012.
A 2011 report by the Brennan Center shows that those states that have passed these laws make up 171 of the 270 votes required in the electoral body to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these amendments to the legislation on the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential elections in 2012.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the participation of voters.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Prostate cancer early detection: should the test be done or not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes shows incorrect results, with false negative or even false positive results leading to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to greater delay for the men already undisclosed to carry out early detection tests.
Should the test be done or not?
We got the opinion of two specialists.
In the studies carried out in the US, there were numerous interference factors between the control groups, making it difficult to interpret these data and to give clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, concluded that there is a difference in mortality between patients with and without early detection.
This study has also shown that the likelihood of metastases being formed is 30 to 40% higher if no early detection has been performed after 12 years.
Therefore, I recommend the test from a age of 50 and 40 years, if you have a direct relative who has already been diagnosed with prostate cancer.
There is also a higher risk for men of African-American origin.
The most important thing is to make the right decision once a cancer has been detected.
There are cancers that are aggressive and others that are indolent.
The extent of the risk of cancer must be made truly clear to the patient by showing him the possible options in which prostate cancer can remain untreated if it does not affect the quality of life in the long term and, in these cases, one chooses to actively monitor the disease.
Today, many men who have recognized cancer have no treatment because their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to their lives.
They are proposed to be actively monitored and are offered treatment when the disease progresses.
The criteria for deciding who should be treated and who should not be determined with increasing accuracy.
That's why I still recommend carrying out the test.
Most importantly, however, it is to talk to his doctor to determine whether or not he should be performed.
In cooperation with the international Urology Society, Movember has developed an instrument to assess the advantages and disadvantages of the PSA test.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no miraculous means to prevent cancer.
Despite progress in research, adopting a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering from illness.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if all were to eat well and move sufficiently.
“If there were no smokers, this value would rise at least to 50%,” says André Beaulieu, spokesperson of the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, about 10% of cancers are assumed to be caused by inheritance.
Several remain completely unexplained.
The fight against tobacco dependence remains a priority for the Canadian cancer society, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for several other cancers.
It greatly harms human health.
\"Today there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec - the speaker André Beaulieu regrets.
Encouragement data: 10 years after the cigarette is released, the risk of cancer is reduced by half.
The weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, overweight and adipose also promote the outbreak of the disease.
They seem to increase the risk of breast, grim intestine, mast intestine, esophagus, abdominal salivary and uterus cancer.
“The research shows that regular physical activity protects against gum intestinal cancer throughout life,” he adds.
Nutrition
The organisation also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too large a quantity, it increases the risk of having a gum or breast cancer.
Worts should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
“The latter can damage the body cells and lead to the development of cancer,” he explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their investigations are not currently conclusive.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one study found out the reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another showed an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has not been clearly demonstrated.
Mr Beaulieu also stressed the importance of talking to his doctor about his concerns and his family's prejudice.
‘The conduct of an early detection test does not lead to cancer,
The Higgs-Boson analyzes
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs-Boson has caused some excitement last summer, and for good reason.
In fact, it is believed that this boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And finally, it is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the standard model - our best or least false - explanation of nature and the behaviour of matter - but has not yet been observed empirically.
But for the physicists it is not yet completely certain that it really is the Higgs.
We know without the shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particle, and that it strongly resembles the Higgs-Boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, this appears to be confirmed by new data presented this week at a major physics congress in Kyoto, but there is still a lack of data to be completely safe about it.
Nevertheless, let us assume that it is actually Higgs, as there seems to be only a small risk of being deceived, and look at what it is about.
In this world there is a necessarily imperceptible law, which causes two objects to not be present at the same place at the same time.
It is not possible to violate this rule - and try not to be too strong as you will be hurt.
For even if particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that such a law applies to it as well: the Paulian exclusion principle, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same state of quantumity, with this state of state consisting of some of their properties in the whole.
The physicists then divide the particles into two categories.
In one corner are the good citizens, who are called Fermione and are kind to the Pauli principle.
And in the other, the bosoons, an evil band of anarchists who are not holy - in any case, not this principle, which means that they can actually be in the same place at the same time.
According to the website The Particle Adventure, these bosons are divided into two groups from the Berkeley laboratories (which, by the way, is absolutely amazing): the mesons that we will not treat here and the \"power particles\" by which the great forces of nature spread and the Higgs boson are somehow related.
But it must be stressed here that these bosons are not all such exotic creatures as one might think.
If you are able to read this chronicle, then only thanks to a boson of exceptional banality: the photon or the light particle, which is the \"bote\" of electromagnetic force.
When a particle accelerates with an electric charge or changes direction, the electromagnetic field is \"tormented\" in exactly that location, like a pebble that was thrown into a pond.
This “storage” creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon and thus one of the boson’s carriers of power.
Stable Field
The same applies to the Higgs-Boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, must be \"tormented\" so that this boson can be shown.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen has to achieve very high energies, a little comparable to a frozen pond whose surface could only be torn by a very large rock.
Therefore, a huge particle accelerator like CERN is required - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a size of 27 km! - to achieve such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again helpful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
It is in fact not all particles and not all materials interacting with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but others don't - for example, a sheet of paper would never keep itself in the refrigerator.
And likewise, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do have a mass, while the others (such as the photon) do not have a mass.
For what can all these research now \"be good\" asks Mrs. Plamondon?
For science, they are used to review the standard model (SM), and they also enable physicists to accurately examine all differences between the observations and the predictions of the SM.
There are numerous physicists, by the way, who eagerly hope that such deviations will be found, as the slightest difference could open a door to a \"new physics\" and stop some holes of the model.
One must say that the latter still has great shortcomings, since it does not provide an explanation for the gravity (ups!) and the dark matter that forms about 80% of the matter of the universe (renew ups!).
However, such deviations have not been found at CERN until now.
Impacts
The impact of these research on the general population is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there is no evidence.
By the way: in the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in the Bell labs did not suspect that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs where the laser was invented in the 1960s, and who himself developed the first continuous stroke laser (the first ones were pulsed) in 1962 - has already said that the laser was considered to be a “laboratory” at the beginning.
Imagine...
In addition, applications can also come from all the tools that surround research.
For example, Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor during his work in optics in 1969.
Although it was not the original purpose, this sensor now serves all digital cameras worldwide as a \"eye\" and has introduced him to the 2009 Nobel Prize for Physics.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily change our lives, but it means that you really can never know...
Palliative care - the best way to die...
Quebec has recently discussed the delicate question of the end of life with its \"Death in dignity\".
The debate needs to be resumed shortly, although a draft law is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this important subject area.
Le Devoir tried to take a closer look at this.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that had devoured him had left him a period of two years.
“They gave me five years to live, I made seven years,” he said half-heartedly, lying in his bed in the home for palliative care of Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he arrived in the morning.
“However, it’s always a shock, you can’t be prepared for it,” he says.
The illness makes her work: an immeasurable weakness prevents him from going to the toilet alone and even eating himself.
Sitting at the table in front of a delicious lunch, he resigns to help with the meal.
Courageously, he even manages to smile and talk to the strangers who are busy around him, bring him his medication, and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
“My greatest wish is to heal my diarrhoea, as this is humiliating, he tells me.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
“In the course of our lives, we learn that a man is biting in the stand,” says Pierre Brodier, psychologist at the home of Victor-Gabois.
Returning to childhood is an unacceptable humiliation for certain persons.
“This depends on the person’s ability to take a step back, ” he states.
In the view of several people working in palliative care, major events take place in the midst of these retreats.
Patients who are assigned to the home for palliative care Victor-Gabois all suffer from cancer.
You have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, they are no longer used by doctors and nurses who care for them with so-called “healing” care.
For Ms. A., 89 years old, the worst fear of dying is “consciously and by suffocating.”
But because of the illness, I really got to know my children.
“I have good children, ” she adds.
“I no longer have wishes in life,” she says before she accepts that she is set up a mask that helps her breathe.
In the next few days, she is still expecting a final visit from her son, who comes from Italy.
In the home Victor-Gadbois you can offer with a group of voluntary body care and assistance in food intake.
Palliative care is then used when there are no other options.
To make dying more pleasant.
In Quebec, 11,700 inhabitants have a bed for palliative care.
That's very little if you take into account that one day we'll all die.
Here life is continued under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The deceased is granted oral care with Brandy or Pepsi, depending on the request.
Diabetics no longer need to control their blood sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last evening we served Mr. X a beer that died during the night.
This morning his son will drink the beer at the feet of the deceased.
“We help family members and patients alike - reports nursing director Nathalie Savard.
At home Victor-Gadbois is not a day like the other.
In addition to an old man of 93 years, who enjoys the last family gathering in the court and is well supported by his pillows as one strikes at his honor, a 36-year-old young man, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two little children, dies tragically after trying everything to survive.
“For six months, three to five beds have always been associated with cancer patients under 45 years of age,” says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients assigned to the home Victor-Gabois come from their home, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, i.e. to care to alleviate the suffering of patients when the latter has reached the final stage of their lives, both at home, hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the home Victor-Gadbois and the company for domestic palliative care in the Montreal area, specialize more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
This great inadequacies in Quebec's health care ensure that several doctors specialising in palliative care face concerns about the adoption of a law on the regulation of death aid and assisted suicide.
Since the month of October, a manifesto has been signed by prominent figures of palliative care such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe to demonstrate their contradiction to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec's health system is not powerful enough to ensure that all right to high-quality palliative care before being accepted for death relief.
A short time ago, she says, I saw a patient who was suffering from great distress for 14 days without taking any measures to relieve her suffering.
I fear that patients only want to die because they do not receive adequate health care.
And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients in spite of the worst prognosis, banning them until the last day.
Hélène Richard's chances of survival were already minimal when she discontinued heavy chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was going to stop treatment, she answered me that she regrets that I gave up the fight, she told me.
However, she had told me that I was at the end!
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who have asked to die thank the nursing staff for not allowing this desire after their pain has been alleviated by a team of palliative care.
However, it must be clearly stated that palliative care is not omnipotent in pain treatment.
According to Elsie Monereau, Head of Palliative Care of the Society of Home Palliative Care of the Great Montreal Region, 8% of patients do not speak of pain treatment.
Thus, at the end of life, doctors often resort to the terminal sedation, which is designed to put the patient to sleep either sporadically or permanently until the time of his death.
We can't do more than if we don't perceive this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief will be more and more able to access this terminal sedation.
Patients whose pain is not alleviated all say the same sentence: \"I want to die\"
But that doesn't necessarily mean, \"I want you to put me to sleep - but - I want my pain to be eased\"
The implementation of this report was possible due to a journalism scholarship of Canadian health research institutes.
Large scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Road construction officials, construction industry companies, political parties money-creators and Italian Mafia specialists tell every day what they know about a great system in which construction, civil servants, politicians, trade unions and Mafioso are intertwined.
An industry very expensive for Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
\"It is strange how the system is broken down since drastic measures have been taken, with Jacques Duchesneau, MP in Quebec and former Head of Montreal Police.
The scandal was discovered by him on the basis of an in-depth investigation of the violations related to the contracts on road construction in Quebec, which the then Prime Minister had reluctantly agreed.
The Duchesneau Report established a direct link between industry, secret financing of parties and bribery of officials.
“Since the start of the investigation in 2010, he stressed that “the Ministry of Transport alone had saved one billion dollars in the contracts,” because some of them had been pulling their instincts in order to get their share!
The Charbonneau Commission, which has already caused two mayors to fall, adds, hoping that she will succeed in showing “the tactics behind the individuals”
A 2011 created permanent anti-corruption unit
The permanent anti-corruption unit launched in 2011 also makes great efforts with its troops to auditors, investigators and analysts of the government.
Furthermore, the police of the \"Marteau-Truppe\" which has since 2009 caused Montreal's \"channelization cartel\" to proceed in the artificial winding-up of contracts...
Over the last few weeks, she has regularly conducted house searches and has raised accusations of fraud and corruption against municipal mandates such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, who is the mayor of a suburb.
The next one on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his office as mayor of Laval, Quebec's third largest city.
He is suspected of repeatedly receiving lubrication in exchange for public contracts.
By the way, engineers from the Montreal Road Construction Office, as well as Italian entrepreneurs, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambia, were charged.
The latter has raised concerns by declaring to the Commission the operation of the system for obtaining public contracts.
For several years he himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal to an intermediary associated with the Mafia who transferred the money to the Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
In the 2000s, Mr. Zambito had his hand in the game everywhere, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to the liberals who were in power at the time.
He also managed to organize an illegal grant for the former Liberal Vice-President Nathalie Normandeau.
Circulation contracts whose costs have been artificially charged by him
In Montreal, the \"system\" of corruption worked smoothly.
The former civil engineer Gilles Surprenant described this in detail before the Commission: in ten years he received gifts from the construction company, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as bribes of $736,000 as a counterperformance for sewerage contracts, the cost of which he artificially blew up.
Other road construction officials admitted that they were lubricated by artificially blowing up the invoices with false additional services by 30-40%.
In addition, an organizer of the Mayor's Party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately looking beyond a shadow budget that filled his cash with black money.
As a result of these revelations, Mr Tremblay resigned at the beginning of November, which led to a serious crisis in Montreal.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal's first MPs to strike the alarm.
As mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district, in the east of the island, she refused to sell a municipal property for $5 million and continued selling for 1.6 million to builders in the booming real estate market from 2010.
70% black money in the election campaigns
The investigation, which is finally carried out, says that it is “drawing in a thread that allows it to understand the functioning of the system of ants submerged to stop the harm and to denounce the guilty,
She says that the procedure is \"painful but positive.\"
However, we are in the process of cleaning the wound, needing an investigation only for Montreal, as well as supervision to prevent a return to questionable practices.
How to clean up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, notes that when officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars, they are thinking primarily about the role of mandaters who are about the tactics in the picture, if they were not involved in the fraud!
Based on a share of 70% black money in financing the election campaigns in Quebec, he says: “We have been told that this is only a weak drop in reality,
The government of Quebec proposes to limit the donations to parties to $100, which, according to him, would change nothing about the situation: “As long as the electoral campaign spending is not strictly limited, black money will be in circulation in politics,
He recommends a complete revision of the public procurement system and the financing of the parties: “We can’t fall deeper; by going to the ground with courage, we can rebuild the house on a more solid basis with more controls and laws,
If this story damages Quebec's international reputation and that of Montreal, Mr. Dukesneau urges those who laugh at it to take a look at their own backyard...
‘PSG is not FC Barcelona’
In this season you have adopted a new scale with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
You can explain it through a personal insight, but also through the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have come.
Every day I make progress on their side.
The technical staff also gave me a lot.
These elements spur me daily to improve my level of play.
And in a game this is even easier.
In football, everything goes very fast.
But I don't get excited.
Since my beginnings in the centre of the preparatory training of the INF Clairefontaine until my play time at Saint-Etienne, I have always made gradual progress.
They thus take advantage of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The new additions of this summer are used to play games very high levels.
They also know that each training unit is crucial.
This leads to a player like me who has to offer the forehead and wants to give his best.
By the way, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot about my position.
He is supported by co-trainers like Claude Makelle, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the task?
Of course.
Ancelotti brings respect to all technicians.
In Ligue 1, there is no comparable person at present, and he is one of the best trainers in Europe.
He looks back on a rich experience and has won many titles with respected clubs.
He had contact with big players.
I think he'll win more titles in Paris.
In January I had a encouraging conversation with him.
At that time, I had just recovered from a series of injuries.
The confidence he has placed in me is also an explanation for my achievements.
What do you think about the first part of the PSG season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon has taken the place of the top rider.
But we're laughing at the back.
One of our most important goals is the Champions League: in this way we qualified for the eighth final.
What is the aim of the association in this competition?
We will try to get as far as possible.
Everything is possible from now on.
However, we will have to speak our words against very good European teams.
First of all, we want to become the first of our group to be in front of Porto, so that we can play back the eight-final as a home game.
Can the PSG become a major European association in the short term?
He already has the budget for it...
In order to become a large European association, Paris must win title and make a name for itself in the long term.
This is not the case today.
The PSG will finance itself so that this project can take concrete forms.
Would it be a great failure not to win the title in Ligue 1, as was the case in the last season?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year we are really at heart to say goodbye to this title.
In the last season we were close.
In May we were disappointed because we were strong enough to take the victory.
We finished the season with a very strong performance.
We have completed 79 points.
Normally you should be master with 79 points...
But another team, that of Montpellier, achieved an even better season.
I think this year is the right thing to do.
Even though the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are ringing around the title, I think we have the stuff to gain him.
Do you think the media expects too much from the PSG?
In view of what has been invested and the players we have, it is normal that much is expected of us.
We accept it perfectly.
However, if we win against Troyes 4-0 in a home game, and you still find something you can imagine, that is certainly a bit frustrating.
You wonder what people are still expecting.
We could never win every weekend with 4-0.
We're not the FC Barcelona!
We're trying to create a game concept.
A team is building up over time.
In the Champions League we have proved strength.
Consider Manchester City, an association that has not managed to qualify for the eighth final for two seasons, and which has also made huge expenditures!
In terms of the invested sums, you were believed to be at the game break with 15 points ahead!
It was said that our opponents and the French championship would be ignored.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not good last season, were boosted by this new PSG
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope we will be the smiling winners in May and tell us that despite all the difficulties, we have finally won them.
The PSG seems to be fully dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic's services.
So much better that you're talking about a \"Zlatan Dependency\".
This means that Ibrahimovic is powerful and shoots many gates.
That's why he came and he proves to be the star of Ligue 1.
Everywhere he played, he had to face the fact that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the team we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects those around him.
What he has done is really extraordinary.
This encourages others to improve their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders worldwide, also allows everyone else to make progress.
How did you experience the 2012 EM with the French national team?
Like a disappointment.
It was my heart to take part in this EM.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from dropping out some play time.
I've seen things out there that I've come out of.
Today I manage to make good games in the national team.
This has been my hope since my baptism with the “Bleus”.
From what has happened in Ukraine, we have drawn our lesson, and today we have to put on an exemplary behaviour.
What do you think about the first months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the “Bleus”?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualification group for the World Cup.
The national coach is strict, is close to the players and is ready to win.
As it was Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for EM.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the “Bleus” to Brazil.
On 16 October in Spain, the disembarkation (1:1) is an opening game?
This game gave us confidence.
Everyone's committed to everyone else.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never experienced a similar game in my career.
With Bitcoin payment and sales without a bank is possible
The opposite of current monetary exchange on the basis of central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between stakeholders.
Moreover, as so often in these technologies, a political vision is tangible: the conviction that the current monetary system, designed by bank monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, the bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is both a virtual currency (but converted into dollar, euro, etc.) and a protocol for secure exchange such as BitTorrent that allows direct exchange of files.
About 200,000 transactions have already been recorded with 15,000 computers on the network.
A few thousand websites accept Bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment.
After reaching a maximum of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, Bitcoin's rate dropped five months later to $2 before recovering today to about ten dollars (the rates are listed on the bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing particularly impressive compared to the world trade of real currencies or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown interest in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes Bitcoin as \"the virtual currency with the greatest success - in competition with the dollar or euro - and - similar to the conventional currencies -
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as the “Credits” used to advance in a video game that can be won or bought through games (and sometimes even exchanged).
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, trade is each time controlled and processed by a central authority.
By means of Bitcoin, all network nodes are simultaneously keepers of the account book, auditors, cash issuers as well as buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail.
With the difference that the user can choose a different address for each payment, which ensures anonymity.
A number of the data related to this transaction is signed electronically by a double encryption system.
In this way, the network can check the authenticity of the transaction.
With the help of the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the treated bitcoins are present in the entire network account book of the public accounts.
The key step is to enter this new transaction into this book.
This is done through a mathematical task that is started on the computers, with the winner, who is a kind of temporary central banker, having the privilege of adding these additional lines.
This is a breakdown of the file, i.e. converting a large file into a shorter and distinct electronic fingerprint.
The computer “take - the new transaction and add a number to it before the whole thing is hacked”.
The goal is to find the number that gives a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
If this number has been found, the other nodes can easily check if it is the right one.
The transaction is thus permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user wants to pay with the same money for cheating twice very quickly (less than 10 minutes), only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other would remain without linking, since both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the task gets 50 bitcoins.
To prevent inflation, this reward is regularly halved, probably before the end of 2012.
The bitcoins in circulation are thus limited to 21 million, but can be shared up to one hundred millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a...
In addition, the difficulty of the task is increased with each improvement in computing performance.
The life of the network has already had heights and depths.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin were attacked and the Bitcoin entries stolen.
\"The vulnerability used does not concern the actual protocol - assures Pierre Noizat, who has just introduced Paymium, which is a real money payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports on the possibilities of money laundering using this anonymous service.
However, cash also shows these shortcomings.
Major actors such as Wikipedia reject donations of this kind.
They are accepted by others like the blog platform WordPress.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel have analyzed the accounting book and showed that almost 80% of the bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November a \"Mega closing sale\" was launched.
“Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged,” says Jon Holmquist, who works for the company Coinabul, who converts Bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a book on this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transactional network.
His system is similar to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but Bitcoin uses to validate transactions that are cheaper.
In addition, the holder manages his identity and can thus remain anonymous.
The system can easily be implemented with dealers, and the latter do not need to install new terminals or computer programs.
You just need to specify an address that can be \"photographed and detected\" by a phone, Pierre Noizat says, which assures that he has thousands of users.
It is a general trend in which hierarchical systems are considered in favour of more horizontal systems.
“It will take some time for bitcoin to get through, but 2013 could be a turning point,” he predicts.
The ECB, by the way, intends in its report to reassess the various risks considered highly today in the event of a success of this currency.
We've moved out of Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the US are expected to follow at the end of 2014.
It is time that the Afghan army regains ownership of its territory, and that the Afghan people decide their future without expecting anything from us.
In particular, we have punished Afghan farmers by viewing them as terrorists.
And we ourselves with our 88 killed soldiers, as well as the wounded and slain.
The Taliban is made up of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often also of farmers who refuse an armed foreign presence, as in the Soviet era.
They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even though jihadists, Pakistani, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks have joined them.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by local insurgents, the latter will no longer be there if Western countries become more discreet.
The withdrawal of the French troops from the base in Nyrab, which I observed from a hill planted with almond trees, financed with French loans, was carried out properly.
The trucks and tanks convoys flown by helicopters have reached Kabul without being attacked.
As of the end of 2014, there will be no more influx of Taliban into Kabul.
Since its irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996, the conditions have changed.
At that time Kabul was empty and the country was overwhelmed by war due to the fighting of the various opposing groups.
Their takeover of power was then regarded as a sort of liberation and return to security.
The Afghan women paid the price for the obscurantism of the peasants overwhelmed by the organization Al-Qaida, but their situation has not improved to this day.
Former Mudshahaddin, Afghan government and current Taliban have the common desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The most important figures of the anti-Soviet war came back to power in 2001.
They have turned into business makers by confiscating property from the government to sell it as a land of construction to refugees from Iran and Pakistan and thus benefited from the massive American procurement of sub-contracts.
They called themselves, and most of them were not involved in the battles themselves.
As I have heard in the campaigns, people want a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, just like those who could make use of American grants: the capital escape is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have had contact with the modern world, and have enjoyed their benefits.
Around 65% of the population is under 25 years of age; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is one fifth of the total population.
In the cities the state schools are full of girls like boys.
These young people, who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders, will have to provide jobs.
All, including the armed parties, are possessed by mobile phones; television with its Turkish series representing a modern world is watched everywhere.
An army is now in place.
Are the authorities under whose command they will be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already trying to restore the militias in the province, which will escape the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the country of the mountains with strong local identities would have benefited from a certain decentralisation with the example of the Western nations, but by abolishing the office of the Prime Minister, who had existed since the Constitution of 1964, the United States wanted to make it a centralized state with a strong presidential force.
President Karzaï does not want foreign controls, especially on the occasion of the elections planned for April 2014.
However, his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and long before.
Industries have not been rebuilt, functional dams are not present and important irrigation systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported, apart from fruit and vegetables, nothing is produced.
The private initiative will be given priority.
In a country based on 30 years of war, state control of infrastructure would have been necessary.
The rumor was spread that Afghanistan possessed immense soil treasures.
This further reinforces the impression that the Western countries were only on the ground to empower themselves.
Without energy to process the iron or copper ore on site, or without means of transport for an export over the mountains, no mining is possible.
The Chinese have already almost abandoned Mes Aynak's copper mine, let international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) make their excavations at the huge Buddhist site and remain the most important employers in the province.
One day it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, largely dependent on imports and exports, to restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of the French combat forces was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional assistance: girls and boys, French Institute at the universities, French Institute, military, legal, medical and agricultural cooperation, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009 a Civil-Military Action Service has been set up by the Ministry of Defense (Cimic) in 2012, in dozens of mountain villages, carried out numerous non-profit work and measures to remediate agriculture and to be carried out by a small French non-governmental organisation to try to win the \"hearts and spirits\" and achieve the impossible task of reconciling aid and offensive actions.
These work, for which a large number of local workers were required, could help to suppress the rebellion: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increase of agricultural land.
What kind of souvenir do we leave after military spending of two billion euros?
A much more modest budget will contribute to improving local living conditions, which are often very hard at a height of more than 2,000 metres.
In the message, dozens of written inquiries of small agricultural projects have been made by municipalities of the province of Kapisa.
In order to free farmers from the rebellion led by foreign groups, which according to their own statements is their desire, the continuation of small, well-controlled and direct civil aid would be necessary in their favour.
A Constitution with the Brechstange in Egypt
This is a new poker game by President Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever with regard to the Constitutional Declaration, which temporarily grants it the unlimited power, it has decided to put everything on a map.
To the surprise of all, he announced on Wednesday that the constitutional assembly would adopt its final version on the next day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State had granted this plenary two additional months for the completion of his work.
For almost two years now, Egypt has been based on a text that has been modified several times, which weakens institutional stability and leads to a legal breakdown.
This new initiative has only created an even stronger division of the country.
For his opponents, the President remains in his \"autocratic delirium\" by continuing to \"break his word\" and \"steps the right with his feet\"
On the side of its supporters, it is assured that it is a way to put an end to the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period of time, which forces the brothers to renounce their intention to explain to the Egyptians the text section for section.
For the President, it is also a way to rediscover his public and democratic legitimacy while protesting all over the country.
After affirmations in an interview with the American weekly watch Time, Mohammed Mursi seems convinced that the Egyptians will be willing to vote.
In particular, the Egyptian people are ultimatumd with this withdrawal to an overburdened vote: \" Either you agree to my draft or I retain the unlimited power - the latter is supposed to end after the Constitution has been adopted.
85 Most of the Islamist members of this constitutional assembly adopted the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of liberals did not comply with the call.
Just before the Constitutional Declaration in mid-November, they have turned their backs on the view that they have not been able to put their views into practice.
Representatives of human rights organisations, religious minorities or civil society have acted similarly.
In order to achieve the decision-making capacity, 11 persons, alternate members, were added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim brothers.
It is not surprising that the articles were usually adopted unanimously.
By the way, the commentators found it entertaining that the only difference of opinion of the day... was expressed in the time for prayer, since some members of the body believed that the pendelior of the constituent assembly did not go exactly.
The text, which has yet to be adopted last evening, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2 which drew all attention to itself remains identical to that of the 1971 Constitution and states that “the principles of Sharia are the main source of law,
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is an important requirement, had the hope of replacing \"the principles\" with \"the rules\", which would have made stricter application possible.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is evidence of their good will and of their respect for the other members of Egyptian society.
“Shrewdness - the liberals who see this as propaganda only.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done on other articles.
In particular, they have considered Article 220 which recognises a consultative function at the University of Al-Azhar, in particular with regard to the verification of conformity with the laws of Sharia.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, this is disturbing because “the persons who are asked for an opinion have not been elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
You can see in this the first signs of a theocracy,
The fears of the liberals are also fuelled by the fact that the next rector of this university should be far less moderate than the current one.
“There is currently no concrete religious commitment to be recognized.
With this constitution we remain within the framework of the bourgeois state.
Most lawyers who have worked on this text are not Ulema, but academics, who have been trained in the French system in part, emphasised Alexis Blouet, who writes a doctoral thesis on Egyptian constitutional transition.
He admits, however, that \"with regard to Article 220, there may be a plurality, since the terms used are derived from the religious vocabulary.
In particular, one refers to the \"Fiqh\" [Islamic case law, No. d. Red.].
And in the future, the question could be raised as to the extent to which civil judges are competent to decide on it,
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is strongly criticised by the far-reaching powers it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim brothers argue that these are significantly reduced compared to the former regime.
Another point of dispute: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the examination of the defence budget shall not be submitted to Parliament, but to a national defence council.
Similarly, there will be no ban on civil proceedings in military courts, as the associations have demanded to defend human rights.
The latter also share their fears about the text they see as threatening freedom.
The existence of the blasphemies is maintained, and insults are now banned, which could have serious consequences for the right to free speech, especially for the press.
In addition, no more articles relate to the protection of women, emphasizes Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
In your opinion, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to speak on television last night, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
The supporters of the Head of State will march on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists await holy sites, the navel of the world and a sea of Sole
In itself, the Promised Land combines the glory of Bible truths, modern comfort and an unspoilt nature.
AIF calls you the five most important reasons for visiting Israel.
Repent to the Holy Places
Visit the river Jordan where Jesus was baptized.
It means that all who bathe in this river receive God’s blessing.
Galilee is the place where Jesus performed his miracles: the conversion of water into wine at a wedding feast, going on the water, the silence of the sea tower and fishing.
Jesus appeared here to his disciples after the resurrection.
Most saints, however, are found in Jerusalem.
Believers follow the path of suffering or the crossroads of Jesus Christ (on Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The path begins at the Roman fortress of Antonia, Pretorium, where the court was, and leads through the streets of the old town to the cemetery on the Mount Golgotha, where the crucifixion, the anointing stone and the grave of Jesus are located.
Here is the Christian view of the navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
The monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem is located in the place where a Christian legend says the tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem there is also the most sacred place of the Jews - the battle wall, the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
Traditionally, people of different beliefs leave behind a set of desires that then go into fulfillment.
Take a trip to heights
The ruins of the fortress of Massada form the remains of the secret hiding place from enemies that Herod the Great had built for his family in the year 25 AD.
They are located on a rock wall in the mountains at 450 meters altitude above sea level.
Only mountaineers can reach the ruins from their own strength.
All the others bring an air cable car to this historic summit.
In the north of the country in 1600 to 2040 meters altitude is the famous ski resort Hermon, in which it attracts countless tourists during the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain you can reach there with a shuttle bus.
The ski slopes have a total length of 45 kilometers.
According to an old legend, pagan gods were said to have lived on the mountain summit.
Unique Museums Visit
There are almost 300 museums in this country.
On just one trip, not all of them can be visited.
But at least the five most interesting of them should be paid a visit.
Among them is the Israel Museum not far from the Knesset (Parliament).
There, ancient Qumran manuscripts or scrolls are preserved by the Dead Sea, found in Felshoelten in the Judean desert, as well as about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
There the collection of works of Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso is exhibited.
In Akko you can visit the museum in Bad Al Basha, which houses several halls of ancient Turkish baths with sculptures of the visitors and bathing servants of the time.
In Caesarea you should visit the unique private Ralli Museum, where you can admire sculptures of Dali and Rodin.
There are neither museum leaders nor souvenir shops.
Admission is free, and donations are rejected in principle.
The fifth museum, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells of one of the most shocking chapters of history.
The most touching department is the monument for the children built to commemorate the 1.5 million children destroyed in the concentration camps and gas chambers.
When the room enters, total darkness prevails.
Stars sparkle.
And the names of the Jewish children and the lands in which they died were broken.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Do something for health
The three main recreational areas of Israel lie on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of the three places there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphins and ocean arias.
Amazingly, the red sea is also bathed in the winter months, as the water temperature there does not fall below 21 °C and the air warms up to 23 °C.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and is bathed all year round.
By the way, this unusual sea with a location of 417 meters below sea level is the world's deepest sea.
Its turquoise blue water has a high salt content and thus even wears non-swimmers easily on the surface.
The surrounding landscape is indescribably beautiful.
Visitors come here for treatment using salt water (natural salt sole) and healing mud as well as for treating inflammation of the skin, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, sugar disease and the calming of strapastic nerves.
Touching the Secrets of Age
These secrets include the old town of Tel Aviv, the city of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through this city, the famous sea route, Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia were intertwined.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to tradition, Noah just built his ark here, and Perseus saved here the beautiful Andromeda, with which he lived a long and happy life.
Tourists like to sling through the narrow streets named after star signs.
Fortuna is supposed to be the legend of all who touch the walls in the gasse with their star-sign.
In Jaffa you can find newlywed couples from all over Israel and even other countries on photo-terms.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can strip through the Roman theatre and conquer the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times Caesarea was the most important city of Judea and residence of the Roman governors, including Pontius Pilate.
In the carefully restored theatre, evening concerts and operas are performed today.
Favourites for tourists
If you're going to Israel, don't worry about your bad English skills: About 30% of Israelis speak Russian.
The money in the trip is not taken in Euros, but in dollars that can easily be changed into shekel (current exchange rate: 1 dollar to 3.8 shekel).
In the city you usually get ahead with the bus, but in Jerusalem there is also a motorway and in Haifa the only subway line in the country with six stations connecting the suburb with the upper city.
That's exactly what it's like to be an underground cable car.
A journey within the city costs 6 Shekels regardless of the means of transport, which is enough including conversions for a trip of up to 1.5 hours.
According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated in Israel on Saturdays.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday markets and shops are closed, and public transport is resting.
And on Sunday morning the work week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and restaurants, only kosher food is served, excluding pork, seafood, fish without shells and food containing both dairy and meat products.
Instead, you can choose between different dishes with ham and beef, soups and desserts (made with coconut milk), traditional Jewish humus paste, various sauces, fried balls made of pured beans and peas (falafels) as well as fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
There are many well-fed cats for this, which are pleasant and unlightened to scatter through the streets.
In the evening it is even seen sleeping on the roofs of parking cars.
The cats like lively places and don't say no to delicacies.
A car rental costs between $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) and $18 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) depending on the brand.
The insurance costs an additional $15 per day.
And bicycle rental costs 15 shekels a day.
Tickets for museums cost on average 30 shelves.
In figures
In 2012 more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most adventurers and recreational seekers came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the USA and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists came to the Promised Land, which corresponds to an increase of 51% in 2010 compared to the same period, before the cancellation of the visa requirement on 9 February 2011.
\"The Great and Powerful\" leads to Moscow: Migrants save money for language
While MPs and citizens' lawyers discuss the benefits of the law on binding language tests for migrants, criminals are already dealing with counterfeit certificates
Every year 13 million guest workers come to Moscow, Saint Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are the citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money for the maintenance of the families who have remained in the home.
On 1 December a law came into force, which requires each migrant worker to pass a test that certifies the knowledge of Russian language.
To date, this rule applies only to migrants who want to work in the services sector, in the municipal housing industry and in retail trade.
However, in future, the tests, according to the Federal Migration Authority, will become mandatory for all host workers.
In doing so, one must not only take language tests, but also test tests into Russian history and the basics of legislation.
Language skills must be demonstrated both for obtaining and renewing work permits.
Exceptions only apply to citizens of countries where Russian is official.
This law also excludes persons who received their training certificates and diplomas prior to the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Sense, problem and protection of rights
The whole of the examination offices will be under the egide of the Pushkin Institute for Russian Language, the Russian University of Peoples Friendship, Moscow State University, Saint Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
The migrants can take the tests in all cities; already more than 160 corresponding centres have already been opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce the tests was supported by the representatives of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Authority.
On the other hand, several times before the entry into force of the law in the press, citizens' lawyers asked the following question: What does the whole thing actually bring?
What changes does the requirement to have language skills show for both the Russians and the host workers?
Above all, the language spoken by the Migration Authority is about reducing the number of forced workers.
“Many are now discussing the protection of the rights of migrant workers,” says Viktor Sebelev, Head of the Federal Migration Authority in Tajikistan.
However, their rights must already be protected from their departure.
Only organized recruitment will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
There are problems facing migrants without employment, education, language skills and medical assessment.
Sebelew is convinced that a future migrant without language skills will inevitably encounter people with evil intentions, who put him under the pretext of helping him into a dark, narrow barracks, where he will endure with dozens of his equal months without food and documents and will be created 12 to 14 hours a day.
We have many complaints from our migrants.
“In the home country you will be promised one, and upon arrival you will be deceived, will get their passports taken off and will not receive the promised pay - confirmed by the head of the Chief Labour Migration Administration of the Tajik Migration Authority, Tolib Schwaripow.
Don't chimp, boss!
Nevertheless, many citizens of the Central Asian Republics who want to earn their money in Russia admit that they are unable to master not only the language of the target country, but also can hardly express themselves in writing in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much their fault, but rather the evil: only a few Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiken can afford a reasonable basic education.
For in their families there is not even money to feed the children, rather to buy them decent clothes, shoes and school things.
As a teenager, these children immediately take the first opportunity to earn money.
“It’s difficult without language skills,” they admit.
“You feel humiliated and inferior,
As regards the law, citizens' rights stress the following important aspect.
Only migrants with legal status must pass the test.
If you do not have this status, there is no testing and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile, most of the host workers continue to remain illegal in Russia.
‘Recognizable welcome or access for unauthorised persons’
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, linguistic difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration can be made quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
The staff of the Russian police know that our documents are mostly fake and we are not registered, and cases of extortion arise.
“You want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea,” says Tajike Umed Huschkadamov to journalists.
‘Don’t miss any cost of false papers,
Already the day the law entered into force, it turned out that not only can the registration documents be faked by the migrants.
Some counterfeit certificates certifying the completion of the language test have already been seized by the Federal Migration Authority staff.
The fake papers were printed with an ordinary color printer.
Of course, the new owners did not get them for nothing: every migrant who hoped to be able to save themselves the tests paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
This is more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: it costs a migrant worker three thousand rubles.
Moreover, the most important immediate task is to protect the system from corruption so that certificates cannot be purchased easily, both officials and civil rights officers agree.
For the moment, the authorities can only promise host workers who first fall through the test that they will receive time for a language background course.
Newcomers without language skills are also offered places in areas where there is no need for active communication with people.
Interior Ministry ignores illegal arms market
Share of legal weapons in criminal offences very small
The Russian Ministry of Interior plans a tightening of the arms law for private gun owners.
The authorities are responding to recent events: injured people in shootings at weddings and seven dead people in the amoklaus of Moscow lawyer Dmitri Winogradow.
The police want to ban the wearing of non-death weapons in the public and impose the age for possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal supported the chairman of the Duma Committee on Security and Corruption, Irina Jarovaja, and promised that the amendments to the Law on Arms will be submitted in the near future.
Not all are satisfied that the Russian authorities want to fight the problems by \"screwing the screws\".
An open letter was published on the Internet, whose author - representatives from various arms associations - called on the authorities to distance themselves from “senseless tightenings”.
The percentage of crimes with registered weapons is very small, said the criminal lawyer, Wasilij Lesnikov, the Russian service of BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crimes involving the use of registered weapons were committed during the course of six months in 2012, while a total of 1,168 thousand offences were recorded for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that a tightening of the law will not prevent criminals from using themselves on the black market.
According to the authors in Moscow, every possible weapon can be found for little money.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior stresses that the spread of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The weapons reach the black market through several channels.
There are five such main channels, a former Colonel Viktor Baranez, who worked for ten years in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of a website that accepts gun orders
The first canal is the army or the military, i.e. weapons that were stolen during the battles in the Caucasus.
“The weapons were stolen by both the Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves,” says Baranez.
On the second channel comes illegal weapons that are stolen from criminals.
Baranez explains that these include weapons stolen from police weapons chambers as well as directly from law enforcement staff.
Other illegally sold weapons come from military weapons camps.
In many military camps, explosions were common.
“There is evidence that some cases were fireproofing to hide the lack of weapons,” says the former military member.
According to Baranez, a contribution to the black market is also made by the weapons manufacturers.
“Today, there are countless private armour factories that do not stand up to international competition and that is why, under the hands of the black market, for example in Moscow, the expert reports.
Another channel of the black market is the smuggling.
Especially many guns and guns come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
“There is their own, sometimes handicraft production, as well as a mafia that organizes the smuggling,” explains the former military member.
Where did the weapons come from?
Experts calculated the proportion of each of the five channels involved in supplying the black market with illegal weapons.
In 2011, a report was prepared by the Centre for Problem Analysis and State Administration.
The experts analysed reports from the Ministry of Interior and the Federal Service for State Statistics, criminological literature and publicly accessible data on arms portals.
According to the investigators, the majority of illegal weapons come from the army and the legal protection authorities.
Half of all weapons on the black market were there through the “responsibility of those responsible for their work with weapons,” says the report.
According to the researchers, 17% of weapons come from conflict areas, 14% fall from thefts in weapons production, and 5% are from illegal excavations.
A sales advisor to a gunload, who does not want to be named, assures us that for a long time no one has been buying weapons found in illegal excavations since they are obsolete.
According to him, it is more common for traders to get the post in a gun camp.
A weapon, for example a gun of type TT, is purchased via a fencing rig.
The gun is exposed and passed through the fence.
“The dealer brings the gun to the city and sells it there for 900 euros per piece with two magazines,” he tells.
\"The police, of course, know all about it and therefore, if they cannot comply with the crime detection plan, periodically carry out checks on dealers offering illegal weapons, the sales advisor adds.
\"As in the luxury shop,
Buyers and sellers find the most common information about acquaintances with each other.
I had looked at websites and blogs when someone became aware of me and suggested that I come to the station, Begovaja, where a person would wait for me, which would bring me to a certain place where we could then negotiate the price.
I only learned the price of the gun there.
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
“To get a gun, I need a friend who has contacts, the sales advisor tells me. “I have such a acquaintance, but I don’t trust him.”
There are dealers in the markets, but there is a need to go there and agree with a code such as \"by Ivan Ivanovich, who lets you set up that daughter has lost a tooth\"
I'm even getting to some hit rings about a friend I trust.
He's just giving me the bats, too, because he knows I'm not pissing him.
Newcomers are looking for weapons in various ways.
In the mid-1990s, former military member Viktor Baranez tried to buy illegal weapons when he wrote an article on this subject.
According to him, the schemes have not changed.
He got a photo album in which \"every possible thing\" was depicted.
“I felt like I was in the luxury store,” the military member recalls.
According to Baranez, the buyer does not get the cat in the bag, but can try everything out.
As a potential customer, I not only buy, but drive with the seller into the forest, and there we set up a target disc.
“I can shoot there then, and when I am convinced that the gun has a good shot, we negotiate with each other,” the expert describes the procedure.
Shopping from the sofa
Internet search engines show search results for websites and groups in Vkontakte - where weapons are offered for various purposes.
There will be no need for any papers or there will be personal meetings.
“You only need the right amount of money,” says the advertising advertisement on the website, “buying a farm gun or gun.”
There users give up your orders and create requests.
Is it also sold to minors?
“Of course, without a licence,” user asks, “Iwan” (word-of-sale).
“Buy a TT. Moscow - is the laconic request of “Fedorenkow”
The Federal Security Service switched on the short, countless web pages, and buyers who want to buy weapons go to the service to the net.
People come like hungry fish during feeding and then land in Siberia and may raise coal
Military commentator and former military official Viktor Baranez
I have heard of the following scheme: The website is usually registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
The persons responsible shall accept the orders.
The buyer transfers the money via a bank machine.
“As an answer, he gets a photo and a description of the hiding of the weapon - reports the press spokesperson of the non-profit organization -Pravo na oryzhie - Dmitrij Kislow.
Viktor Baranez stresses that at the end you can also go out empty and come behind grids when you place an application on a website.
The Federal Security Service switched on the short, countless web pages, and buyers who want to buy weapons go to the service to the net.
“People come like hungry fish when feeding and then land in the Siberian labour camp and are allowed to shake coal,” he says.
A Makarow for $100
According to experts, the purchase of illegal firearms is expected to result in prices ranging from $100 to $900.
According to Dmitrij Kislow from the organization \"Pravo na oryzhie\" you can buy a Macarov gun for 100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait up to one and a half months.
The weapon is issued in military arms camps by mid-range supervisors.
According to the official statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, the number of offences involving illegal weapons throughout Russia decreased by 7% from January to October 2011, while the number of detected cases of theft and extortion related to weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosives decreased by 7.8%.
In the United States, fast food and supermarket employees strike
Every fourth U.S. youth is behind Mc Donald's checkout sometime
In recent days there has been massive protests across the United States against low wages in branches of Walmart and restaurants of popular fast food chains such as Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one can predict whether the protests will continue to swell or whether they will soon return to the air.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several left-wing non-profit organizations.
In addition to increasing the modest wages of simple Walmart and Fast Food employees, protest organizers aim to establish trade unions.
So far, this industry of the economy has hardly been organized in a trade union.
46 cents a year?
The protests started last week after Thanksgiving, on the so-called Black Friday, at which sales took place in the United States that attracted millions of customers, which sometimes led to handcuffs.
On that day, some Walmart employees, of whom there are 2.2 million worldwide, put down their work and, together with trade unions and left-wing activists, branches of the chain whose target groups are low and medium incomes.
Walmart sells all products, from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The goods in the Walmart branches are between 8 and 27% cheaper on average than in large supermarkets.
For this reason, many of the slightly paid Walmart employees only purchase at their own workplace.
The prices and the product range made Walmart one of the largest companies in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart is often only able to sell the goods so cheaply because the employees are paid poorly.
The latter also complain about severe working conditions, such as missing forklifts or hand scanners.
The participants in the protests on the \"Black Friday\" demanded wage increases and expressed their anger that the contribution to own health insurance had increased from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
A typical Walmart employee who earns $9.5 per hour could not afford this increase, they said.
Researchers from the California University in Berkeley prove that if the company raised the average wage to 12 dollars per hour, it would cost Walmart 3.2 billion dollars.
That's about 1.1% more than they're spending for wages now.
If Walmart completely changed the wage increases to customers, each purchase cost only 46 cents more in the future.
Each year this would be for them compared to today's multi-expenditure of just 12.39 dollars.
Advocates of Walmart are pleased to note that only nine states have been involved in protests and that they have not paid any losses to the company.
The Black Friday lasted from 8 o'clock in his shop on Thursday to midnight the next day, and during this period Walmart sold about 5000 items per second.
In total, the Walmart cashiers carried out almost 100 million transactions on the Black Friday.
In an interview on the left-winged Huffington Post website, Dan Fogelman's spokesperson, said that a total of \"less than five Walmart employees were working and that the protest action was merely \"a further PR trick\" of the union that organized the protests.
‘Free Cash —
The protests continued this week in New York, where their goal was not Walmart branches (which are not desirable in this advanced city and are therefore inexistent so far), but McDonald's and other affordable restaurants.
McDonald's says the company sells billions of portions, and yet you don't get sick, and you won't be paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member of the New York City Council
At present, the minimum wage in accordance with federal and New York legislation is 7.25 dollars per hour.
In fast-food restaurants, the minimum wage is gradually raised, but not too strong, and on average their simple employees in New York receive $8.90 per hour.
Less than she deserves no one in this expensive city.
As it is possible to get out of New York with so little money, I'm incomprehensible.
There was a time when almost a quarter of all U.S. adolescents were behind the tea after school at McDonald's, but the young people were still living with their parents.
Almost one saw the main source of income or planned to stay there longer.
Now during interviews with McDonald's employees, I am constantly meeting people who complain that they have to come out with this reward and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment in the Wall Street Journal's forum, whose author notes that it is useless to have children if one does not know how to feed them.
The participants in the protests, which began on Thursday at 6.30 a.m. in front of McDonald's in 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashiers and cooks of fast food restaurants receive a minimum wage of $15 per hour, which is more than a doubling of the current minimum wage.
They continued to call for the formation of trade unions in the fast-food industry.
The U.S. law prohibits the management of the company from reaching this goal and denouncing or dismissing union members.
On the other hand, corporate governance does not make it easy for them.
However, the establishment of trade unions in the fast-food industry is also difficult for objective reasons.
The most important reason is the high staff fluctuation.
Unsatisfied
Protests were strong this day and there were many other fast-food restaurants in Manhattan.
The highlight of the protests was a meeting in the afternoon in front of McDonald's at Times Square, where some local Democrats spoke, including city council member Jumaane Williams, who said: \"McDonald's says it sells billions of portions, and yet you don't get sick, and you won't be paid for your honest work,
The demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, Mayor Bill De Blasio, who said that “we should support fast-food employees together in order to earn a fair wage and achieve the economic prosperity that everyone New Yorkers deserve.
According to New York Times, this was the biggest action of its kind in the history of the U.S. fast food industry.
However, only a few hundred people were on site, not all of whom are employed in the fast-food industry, in which tens of thousands work in New York.
It is not yet clear whether the spark of these protests will mobilize whole masses.
\"The brain can only be moderately overlisted so far,
The popular theme of advanced reality, popular with followers of modern technologies, has been commonly observed by the lens of a special eyeglass.
In summer, Google first presented a working model at its annual conference, and in November it was announced that Microsoft had also applied for a corresponding patent.
However, in conversation with the head of the group for interactive 3D technologies at the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, it becomes clear that the glasses for the scientists of the company were only a transit station.
It stimulates the possibility of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands and creating virtual open spaces.
- Please briefly describe what research your group is doing.
- We are dealing with the interaction of man and machine, but we want to expand the limits of this interaction.
To date, mankind has largely remained stuck in the phase in which pixels are worked on flat screens, which are sometimes also touched.
However, we want to look ahead for 5-10 years and predict the radical changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors are progressing, and today, no more Xbox is sold without Kinect, as everyone is interested in motion control.
- What else are we expecting in the future?
- Although Kinect has brought the interaction to a physical level, much still plays on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the output has not yet been crucial.
We try to change this, working on real three-dimensional imaging systems based on different technologies, including projections.
We need to release the computer world into our physical world and make it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary that not only the user, but also its environment be recognized.
Then we could add the real world much easier by virtual objects.
And first of all, we should get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
She's popular, but isn't she overvalued?
- It is certainly not the all-purpose solution, as it raises questions about privacy because one does not always want to inform all the parties about its actions and intentions.
Actually, every type of interaction with computers is good, but each one in its particular niche.
For example, in the field of controlling objects in public places, we worked on a project where we experimented with short and scarce rather than exhausting gestures.
The gestures were not recorded by the object camera, but by a bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, but it could theoretically be reduced to the size of a watch.
But overall, the future includes mixed control types, such as gestures and language.
- How's that?
- For example, would we ask you to give me this spray can?
They say it and at the same time indicate it.
- I'm usually just saying it.
- Oh, that would be very hard to recognize.
- Does that mean you want the user to adapt to what a machine can do at the time, and what is not?
- Not necessarily, but this is a mutual approach.
I think that in the next time we will have to work primarily on developing new sensor types that will allow us to more accurately capture reactions from individuals.
This can be laser sensors, for example, as they offer a good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- What claims do you make from your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors to modern cameras?
Is there a lack of resolution, depth or something else?
- The present generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional detection.
Of course, 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 fps would not be bad.
But the main thing is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
Thus, all current technologies are not good enough for us, as the developers of algorithms have more work.
It must be taken into account not only the resolution along the X and Y but also along the Z axis.
The speed and number of images per second are also important.
The movements of man are extremely dynamic and openly said, the present 30 fps are in particular too little for gestures.
In our lab in Redmond, Stephen Betishes developed a contact sensor with a adjustable processing delay of between 1 and 100 milliseconds, with today's commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not all understand how this affects the interaction of man and machine.
For my work I needed exactly such a device, only without touch control and with more images per second.
- Shouldn't the number of cameras be increased?
- Kinect is currently working with three cameras, one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the second is a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB camera.
It is not used to calculate the depth of the object.
More cameras might solve the problem...
Or reinforce the problem, as more calculations would be necessary.
It would be nice to have a flexible, Kinect-like system where we could play with different camera inclinations to determine how this helps us in the three-dimensional determination of a position.
- If I remember correctly, Microsoft did not present his glasses to the public in contrast to Google.
Do you not think that in terms of the application of the technology of expanded reality in everyday life, glasses have the best prospects?
- Of course, it is not pleasant to always keep a smartphone in the raised hand on the way, but I think the following: The most amazing variant would be a \"changing\" extended reality, where we could switch over a cloud from the glasses to the smartphone,
The glasses is a personal gadget and in it is its strength (private can only see you), but also its weakness, because an extended reality through glasses prevents you from working with others on virtual objects.
- For a moment, let's imagine that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is not only available to Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also to normal mortals.
There is a problem which often refers to the critic of this idea: there is no tangible reaction!
The hands don't feel anything at all!
What answers does your group want to give to this objection?
- In my lectures, I often say that the extended reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth breakthrough could well become the integration of tactile perception.
An interesting method is currently the use of the second hand as a somewhat unusual projection document.
She perceives pressure excellently!
However, there are also technologies that are actually aimed at giving the “pictures in the air” something hand-resistant, for example, the interference of some directed ultrasound rays at a certain point where the fingers are located creates a feeling, which is still as weak at the moment, as someone pushed over the handballs.
There are also bands for the wrist that affect the nerve endings in the fingers, also this is a potential direction.
- Did you try to cross the brain?
Let's think it feels what it should feel when it sees something?
- That's a good idea, so we haven't tried yet.
Here is another task that we will have to deal with for a long time, namely to let a person who is physically in a closed room believe that he is instead in an open, virtually infinite space; here we work on concepts with treadmills (other than in fitness studios), moving platforms and large balls.
So far, the brain can only be moderately overlisted, and many years before us are still busy.
This is precisely what makes the work in the field of virtual reality attractive to a researcher: we are only at the beginning of many topics.
Own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project \"Petersburger Avantgarde\", dedicated to city dwellers who form the avant-garde of art and culture.
On the read list, high-ranking representatives of the Petersburg art scene, whose success goes beyond the borders of the city and who often find recognition in Europe without being known in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole town knows Kirill Miller, the red-dressed beards, which are sometimes found at the Russian Museum, at the summer garden, at scene meetings or on vernissage.
Wherever Kirill Miller's pictures are displayed, they attract large masses of people.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg social-philosophy artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a shining personality of the Petersburg Avantgarde at the end of the 80s and the beginning of the 90s.
He is also a man of the city and by his presence on the street enchants his fellow citizens a smile in the face and provides them with good mood.
He recently took a turn and became a Petersburg-based shooter, as he finally felt ready for this difficult role with regard to his artist's presence, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you always in red and not, for example, in yellow or turquoise in town?
I chose the color red as a fashion designer that deals with the optics and the image.
In this world Red is the compromise between artists, image consultants and society.
In society, everything that deviates from the ground orms calls for aggression and bad behavior.
But I want to get into conversation with people through my provocations.
Each of my previous provocations was an invitation to talk.
- When did you know you had to be a painter?
- At an exhibition at the Cultural Palace of Newskiy, where my works were exhibited.
I understood I had to go this way.
Then the time of the old free but not officially recognized painters ended then, and new and free painters like me were incomprehensible.
I became friends with the painters of the new generation, i.e. with the representatives of the \"Gazonewschina\" from it, \"Pushkinskaya 10\" and then I was finished.
It attracts me to the theatre, to fashion, to music, actually to everything except literature.
And all of this was united in your art clinic... it was important for me to be at the heart of Petersburg culture, where the best-creating artists were to gather.
In 1995 I occupied a space in the Pushkinskaya 10, and there was a musical-artist club for the Bohemia, the house of the Petersburg Bohemia until the renovation work.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazz, and I remember how Schnur came there with his project \"Ucho Van Goga\".
Schnur and his friends sang simple songs to play-back, wore tight jerseys and belonged to them as well as to the modern-day composer Igor Wdowin.
When the group started playing live, it was made of their “Leningrad”
Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the time of \"Halli-Galli\"
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it started his great career, but he learned the basics from us.
The gallery \"D 137\", or the club \"Griboedov\", also originates in the art clinic.
There, our employees and regular guests went.
I am a hero of the past century, when culture meant something else.
In 2000, there was a survey in the press about the award “Personalities of Our City”.
I won in the category \"Artist of the Year\" and thus I was reached at the climax.
It is not easy to work in new times according to old rules; I am a person of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In modern times it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: one can be famous without making a cultural contribution.
- Your work has an unrecognizable style.
- Many of my pictures are real pearls and clearly express the topicality and sharpness of the thoughts.
I will have an exhibition with the theme \"The Russian Museum as Clowns\".
Clowns are timeless.
I used to be social, but now it hurts and prepares to be so.
In a clown, it blurs everything and loses its tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and I have grotesque ideas.
For example, let's save the world by prescribing that everyone has to dress up completely.
Now everyone is looking at the clothes and is oriented to the outside and not the inside of the human being.
But maybe you can't give a man your hand, but you should spit him in the face.
The deception disappears by dressing.
- We recently saw you in the role of the urban filming organ player.
Who, if not me?
- Can commercial art be nice too?
- Today, commercial art must be careful, considerate and flattery.
We see the decay of cultures.
In the past, people formed large groups: the Bohemians loved one and the simple people loved the other.
Now there are microcommunities, and it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a one-hundred-dollar note everyone likes.
Now you have to think about who you're gonna like.
Now each cult star has about 100 followers.
- To the appearances of Stas Michilow, but several thousand!
- To him, abandoned women, there the sexual-social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons 300 people come and not 10 thousand, hence there is less management, money, and everything goes down.
I have followers, and the most important thing is not to cheat them and not destroy the achieved.
In my youth, I painted such images that even at a collector hanged in a row with the works of Falk and Larionov.
I started with pictures that usually only come at the end of my career.
Nowadays there are often misunderstandings.
It means spiritual culture and consumer culture.
Consumerism has no culture at all, that's something quite different.
I am a person of past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money to paint.
This is the culture I support.
- Kirill, what's going on in Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
It is said: servants of culture.
But not every one of them can deal with culture.
With the real czars it was different, because the czars may not understand much about culture, but they understood that proper experts are necessary.
There are good consultants in Moscow at present.
In Petersburg we have those who might be experts, but they are being blocked, as there is a need for more high-ranking experts who properly evaluate the former and open the way to them.
Now only its own taste counts.
The same applies to the Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say they don't accept all contemporary art and some painters therefore have to look for other museums.
- What's Petersburg for you?
- Petersburg is not the capital of culture; in Moscow there is much more culture and a corresponding breeding ground.
Art can only grow hard on our stones.
We need a cultural breeding ground because, for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that is not right.
There are many curious people in Europe who attend exhibitions or concerts.
That's a lot less with us.
Art must be modern again, as at the beginning of the previous century.
The project will be financed from grants from the city of St Petersburg
Birth in the world
Earth in danger.
Warming or collision with killer steroid.
Caravans of spaceships with earthworms on board are looking for a replacement planet.
In order to save mankind, is the important question of how we can continue to thrive in hardship or on the replacement planet?
I do not believe that there are many options to choose from.
In fact, there are only two real planets that we could at least hypothesizedly inhabit.
“This is Mars and Venus,” says the scientist at the Astronomical Sternberg Institute Vladimir Surdin.
However, while conditions on Mars are comparatively life-friendly, a temperature of 500 degrees prevails on the surface of Venus.
Life would only be possible at great heights or in the orbit of Venus, i.e. in all.
The researchers first addressed the issue of reproduction in all with regard to flora.
Experiments with plants have already been carried out half a century before.
The fourth generation of herds grown in orbit does not differ in the least from the earthly species.
It followed the breeding of insects, more precisely of tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in orbit.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent to the world to explore the effects of gravity on the development of embryos.
It develops a very normal chick.
But then the problem begins.
“The problem is that the chick has to be able to stop; it has to be able to stand on its legs and start moving,” explains the laboratory director of the Institute for Medical-Biological Problems RAN, Vladimir Sychew.
Without a solid background, the chicks fell wild.
Ten hours later, the instincts of the newborn stopped completely.
The chicks did not react to light and sounds.
Four days later they simply died.
\"Two times we let chicks slip and put the whole thing in, because it is simply impossible to work there with them - Vladimir Sychew holds out for the failed experiment with the chicks at all.
The last breeding cage with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in spring 2013.
However, only same sex species will be found on the biosatellite “Bion”.
There was an experiment with rats that had already been fertilized into the world.
In principle, nothing special was found.
“This was just with the biosatellites, but again it was just a single experiment, and the research needs to be continued,” says Vladimir Sychew.
After landing, the space rats got young.
The problem of reproduction directly in space has not been solved so far.
The task is difficult.
Animals that are torn from their natural habitat simply cannot follow their reproductive drive.
Unlike animals, humans could do so in principle.
Homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can create a similar emotional background.
Such experiments are not carried out from ethical considerations.
But women have been flying into the world for 50 years.
The biggest risk was in Tereschkova.
The most valuable thing that humanity possesses is the female organism.
Our möwe flew from it, and no one on earth could have answered the following question: Does it cross space flight?
Will she be able to bring a child to the world after that flight?
“At last, no one answered this question — says space veteran Watang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, just one year after their space flight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereschkova, bore a daughter.
The father of the child, Andrijan Nikolayev, was also cosmonaut.
In 1988 the second woman in All, Svetlana Sawizkaja, who was twice in orbit and even performed work outside the spacecraft, bore a son.
Nevertheless, there is a risk.
We only have very few cosmonauts, where after long flights, everything went well and they got healthy offspring.
“The more dangerous it is even in orbit flights, the closer Kosmonaut Waleri Poljakow, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation.
And yet mankind must look for new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection and the production of artificial gravity.
The hydrolabor in the preparation centre of the Cosmonauts is a mandatory station during flight preparation.
Here in a silent state, the cosmonauts win routines for working in open space.
The water represents the difficulty.
Although adults feel water as pleasant, it is a foreign environment; yet infants feel water as a natural element.
It is as if the little Ichtyander bears witness that life on the land escaped the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is in the mother’s womb for about 9 months in the fruit water, and that it can become more easily used in water.
In principle this is logical, since from birth until the first swimming just two weeks pass.
“That’s too little time to forget something,” says baby swimming teacher Marina Aksenowa.
Thus, while for a newborn child the severity is a much more natural state, the woman does not come out without gravity.
In the state of gravity, the abdominal and pelvis muscles return enormously quickly and thus the ability to squeeze out the child also decreases.
Well, we're dealing with this by means of birthing aids.
For example, birth could also take place in a special chamber to push the child out.
“But what happens then” is Waleri Poljakow’s not insignificant question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the cultivation, the organism cannot train the skeleton and the muscles.
A newborn child cannot be placed in orbit like an adult for training in a stress suit.
He will simply lack what is of fundamental importance to his life.
“This experiment, which we are doing together, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead us to bring about a disabled person, a completely inappropriate person,” says the director of the Bioethics Commission of the Institute for Medical-Biological Problems RAN, Igor Pestow.
To date, the birth of children in the world is mere theory.
At some point, however, it will become reality when the earth’s inhabitants in their spaceships break up into a distant planet that will become the home for their all-born descendants.
NKOU-Chief: Black system control failed by debt of policy
The Czech Republic has good control bodies and adequate laws in connection with public contracts, but falls short of their application.
In the conversation for Aktuálně.cz, this is said by the Vice-President of the Highest Control Office (Neuwvyšší kontrollní úřad, NKă), Miloslav Kala.
\"A law is never perfect, but it must be applied properly - and I think this is not the case with us - Kala comments on the current situation.
A similar result appears to be shared control by Czech and German auditors.
As a negative example of practice, he leads the attitude of Prime Minister Petr Nečas to the so-called \"Black System\".
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not bother the entrepreneurs with controls - is the system now prohibited or permitted?
“A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then it cannot simply come to the President of the government, and the Control Office, whose duty is now to prevent the control of compliance with the law, determines Kala’s activity.
At the meeting of the Control Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a joint Czech-German project, in which both countries' laws on public procurement were compared.
What was the point?
This is a parallel test, with which we started about two years ago.
It is simple to say that the European legislature sets out how public procurement should be handled. National legislation is building on this, and finally there is the actual practical application.
We compared all of this with each other, and although the test has not yet been completed, we have been able to identify very interesting differences. Generally speaking, the laws with us may be even more \"stricken and perfect\" but the actual application in Germany is better in some parameters.
This confirms that it is not enough to set up new and more precise rules again and again. You also have to deal with the actual application of the law.
How can the project help you? What results for you from this project?
Such common control could help us to stop constantly trying to perfect our laws and reduce and outstrip thresholds if this does not seem to have a particularly positive effect.
Economy means acquiring a business at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and excluding unlawful enrichment or even criminal actions.
But reducing thresholds for orders does not guarantee that we reach this goal as well.
It may even be that in this way we are only burdening the system with excessive papiercram, and those who are looking for gaps in the system are much easier to exploit the system than if the thresholds remained higher.
They are talking about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech Procurement Act.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a similar authority here as our NKOU, or does the system work differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the German counterparty is to the NKă of the Federal Court of Auditors, which is similar to ours and also has a collegium which is formed only slightly differently. In principle, however, both authorities work similarly.
The competences are also comparable to some extent, although Germany is a state, i.e. that there are these accounts in the individual Länder as well - the German system differs from ours.
The BRH may only control federal funds according to our state resources.
Public funds managed by the districts and municipalities are subject to the control of the national accounts offices.
As far as German legislation is concerned, is it simpler than ours?
In general, I would be reluctant to compare this without specific details. However, Germany is often described as an example in some respects, but it is certainly not possible to say that Germany is in any way better.
Is that perhaps because the examiners are better there?
This does not mean that, but as I said, I do not particularly like such comparisons.
It should also be noted that those countries that are an example for us are also faced with problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn't have any cooperation with our authority, would they?
As far as Czech legislation is concerned, what was the significance for your authority to renew the award law, do you already feel any impact?
In view of the fact that this novelty is only in force for a short time, it has not yet been affected in our tests.
Since our controls take place subsequently, we have to expect a certain delay here.
To date, we have experienced more impact in the preparation phase of future controls - so we have introduced the new control instrument, the detection of risks of ineconomy, and examined and analysed with this almost 14,000 public contracts - here, of course, the changes will have an effect, as thresholds have changed, the conditions for certain types of tenders have been modified, among other things.
Do you see the adoption of this law rather positive, or is the system burdened with further bureaucracy?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction and hope that this assumption will confirm itself.
However, the problem may arise that the rules become more \"stricken\" and can no longer be respected.
Already under the previous rules, the persons under examination against the institution (e.g., in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, the Regional Council) are accountable for the fact that any non-compliance with the procurement law is equivalent to a violation of budgetary discipline.
But is it then sensible to make the law even more stringent?
I do not think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system and not punish those who have committed a form error which does not affect the actual decision making.
Such a system only puts the bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where's the way out?
First of all, let's say which path is not goal-driven.
The Prime Minister recently said that ODS would not lighten the entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called \"black system\" - what exactly does that mean?
Is the Black system now prohibited or allowed?
A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then it cannot simply come to the President of the government, and the Control Office, whose duty is now to prevent the control of compliance with the law in its activity.
He can say, “We change the law and allow the matter to happen, but he cannot say that we do as if nothing were.
The Procurement Act contains relatively strict rules on the formal execution of certain transactions - and this is also right for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, it is also tragic if the bidder is excluded with the best offer solely due to form errors.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied properly - and that is what I believe is missing from us.
On the streets there are some ice sheets, but they are mostly dry.
On the streets of the Czech Republic there are partly snow and ice sheets.
However, the roads are generally well-drained, sometimes with increased caution.
KaribaKarlsbad
In the district of Karlsbad, the streets were well-drained this morning, and there were snow and ice sheets.
Temperatures dropped to -5 to -10 °C, it should get a little warmer during the day.
In the region it is no longer snowing, and in the deeper altitudes only a thin snow cover remains.
However, there are about 30 cm of snow on the ridges of the Erzgebirge.
According to the district highway guard, there was limited vision due to fog.
The R6 motorway and the traffic routes of the first road class in the region are currently fully accessible.
However, attention should be paid, for example, to bridges on which the railways are sometimes required and smooth.
At the same time, all roads of the second and third classes of roads, including mountain roads, are accessible.
However, snow remains partially required or exhausted on these roads.
In particular, increased attention should therefore be paid in the higher layers.
Districts of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
On some East Bohemian streets there is danger because of ice sheets, in higher locations and in the mountains there is still a snow layer on the streets sometimes, the street and highway direction is shared on its websites.
The street champions warn drivers about ice sheets, which can occur in higher locations in Pardubice district.
It can be found on the roads of the second and third classes of roads in the districts of Lanškroun, Üstí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy and Vysoké Mýto.
Roads I/43 and I/34 in Svitavy are chemically treated.
Snow is particularly located on the streets in the Giant Mountains and in the mountain Orlické area.
An excavated layer of snow lies on the streets of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In East Bohemia it is mostly sunny or cheerful today, and it remains largely precipitation-free.
Temperatures range from -3 to +1 °C, and a weak wind blows.
Pilsen District
Today, roads in Pilsen District are well-drained, but there is a need for increased attention locally, and the route is suitable for the weather.
This is frosty in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below freezing point.
Since it has snowed before and the temperatures then fell, it can come on the streets to ice sheets.
There is also a need to expect fog, but the view will improve in the course of the day.
These data come from the district road championships.
The D5 motorway is practically fully accessible, but increased attention is recommended for road championships between 80 and 131 kilometers.
The railways of the first class are mainly dry but frozen.
However, in the south of Pilsen and Tachov circles there can be ice sheets.
The railways of the second and third road classes are damp and therefore the reference to possible required sections applies here.
Drivers should be particularly careful mainly on less frequent roads in the Böhmerwald area.
Olomouc District
With snow-match today, drivers must expect to travel in the direction of altitudes in the district of Olomouc.
After the use of scattering vehicles, snowmatch remains on the pass Červenohorské sedlo as well as on the road towards Videlský kříž.
Nightly snow driving forced the street majors to use, in the Šumperperk district, according to the road administration, about 3 cm of new snow fell.
In the other areas of the district, the railways are usually fully accessible.
“In the Šumperk district, snow remains in the altitudes.
On the pass Červenohorské sedlo the drivers must expect snow-match towards Jeseník - said an employee of the road management Šumperk today compared to the agency ČTK.
Her colleagues in the district of Jeseník had to go out at night, according to her information, the streets are free and wet to the altitudes after chemical treatment.
In the district of Olomouc, the roads are fully accessible, but in the district Šternberk the riders have to drive cautiously in forest sections, as the roadways are still damp here.
District of Labem, Liberec District
In northern Bohemia, the street champions report several badly accessible sections of the road.
In addition to several places with snow or ice sheets, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice is closed in the district of Ustí n.K. according to traffic police information.
Temperatures remain below zero even in deeper locations, so that snow and ice are kept on the streets. However, no problems have been reported from the lowlands, especially south-east of the Bohemian Central Mountain, and the roads are usually dry there.
No traffic disturbances have been reported so far.
Ice glates are reported in particular from the vicinity of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, there were ideal conditions at night - rain and melting snow during the day, cloudless sky and frost at night.
Bad traffic conditions are reported by the main routes and road I/13 at the border of the districts of Ustí n.L. and Liberec.
The blockage of the road between Telnice and Knínice was required due to branches pushed from the snow load to the highway.
Šimon Ornest: At our concerts we want to collect positive energy
What do you think is going to happen in less than a month of world decline?
This is one of the disaster reports that we people like to jump to.
With our band The Tap Tap, we make fun of it and say that we are the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy to stop or prevent world decline.
In December, you will also realize a unique project with three concerts against the world’s decline.
Can you introduce our readers to the project?
This is a national benefit event that we have been planning for two years.
For this we want to use the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, whose end is forecast for December 21 at 11:10 in the morning.
On the day before, i.e. on December 20, there will be three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava simultaneously starting at 21:00.
The end of the concerts should be about the time, at which the Mayan Calendar ends on the Pacific Island of Kiribati, which is in a time zone around 12 hours ahead of us.
Whose idea is this?
Originally probably from me, then we designed the idea together with our graphic artist Honza Augusta.
Not only do we want to gather enough positive energy to prevent world decline, but we also want to think with the public about the state in which we once hand this world over to our children.
At the end of the Mayan calendar, we also developed a unique collection of shoes, t-shirts, bags and key trailers against the world’s decline, with their purchase via www.e-tap.cz to help people too.
The band The Tap Tap has also recorded, together with other interpreters, the so-called hymn against the world’s decline with the title “World Fall Out”.
Already today, the hymn on YouTube is very popular. Will it also sound like the beneficial concerts?
Of course, at the very end, provided that everything works and the world’s decline does not take place...
The hymn is to be sung simultaneously by all performers on all three concerts.
In addition, the hymns are transmitted live in a direct connection from the Czech television.
The text of the hymn comes from Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main character of Jesus in the video clip, also Xindl X sings with...
How did you come to work with both?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, which is related to the fact that we realize a lot of beneficence events and concerts...
We strive to involve these people intensively in our projects.
It has been shown that most people are interested in cooperation with us and have fun with us.
What purpose does the proceeds of the concerts benefit from the world’s decline?
For the establishment of the barrier-free educational center Studeo, where we have been working for six years with the Association Tap at the Jedlička Institute.
The students of the Jedlička Institute are regularly cared for by lecturers who help them with different leisure activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the means to look for the lecturers, we want to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedlička Institute, a building of our own is to be built into which we will move into this project.
At each concert several groups and interpreters occur.
What criteria have you chosen?
We wanted to put together a program that addresses all generations including children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý occur.
You can find out all else on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar major events planned for the future as well?
In May we will perform for the first time at Prague Spring, and we will also prepare an interesting programme with interesting guests.
Next year we would like to be present at the Czech House in New York, and I personally - if we are in the USA - would like to link this with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not very small, so far you have been in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap, however, is a group composed of people with disabilities.
How do you cope with these trips logistically and organizationally?
It's not as bad as it appears at first glance.
Five of our members are wheelchair drivers, i.e. the wheelchairs have to be transported in the luggage room. We also have to drag a lot of instrument cases and other luggage with...
Nevertheless, it has always worked without problems, ČSA and British Airways have always been very well prepared for us, that I have sometimes been surprised.
Even in Moscow, where we were last, there were no problems.
As you travel abroad, you have a comparison of what it looks like in the individual countries with accessibility, how to deal with disabled people, etc.
How did you experience these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than with us, we were just witnessing in Russia that everything in the East is still in its beginnings.
In contrast to Prague, Moscow is absolutely not disabled. It is still unusual for someone in the wheelchair to travel alone in the city centre.
It is not even obvious there that a wheelchair driver can be introduced, for example, in the elevator.
Fortunately, there are also associations that try to point to the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what ways do we need to catch up with the more developed countries?
There are many other things that we're after...
It should be noted, however, that improving the situation is always dependent on the efforts of those concerned.
In London and Madrid it is absolutely common for people with severe disabilities to move independently in the public space, go to the museum, use toilets, etc.
But it is not just common for a larger group of disabled people to participate actively in social events, in which we are a little ahead of the West with the band The Tap Tap!
Respect in the public and accessibility is one thing, but only when important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come from our ranks will things really start to change.
So far, these are only individual cases of particularly willful personalities.
The Tap Tap is very popular at the moment. However, if we go back a few years: what motivated you to set up a band in 1998?
At that time, I started as a caretaker at the Jedlička Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in getting involved in something intensive.
And since I am a musician myself and I play saxophone, I have created a music AG together with a colleague.
Well, and in time, as our moderator, Láƿa Angelovič, used to say something out of control (laughs).
But didn't the band get familiar until the last few years, or am I mistaken?
It is true that cooperation with well-known singers has helped us, and we have also begun to actively advertise for us.
We have become aware that if you do something and don't see it outside, your own performance does not exist in some sense.
Thanks to the EU funding funds, we can also afford good lecturers, high-quality equipment and so on.
Was it your goal to get it so far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I have felt the potential for things to change.
In the show business today often copies one to another.
This is logical in its way, as everything is considered new with caution and is accepted only after a longer period of time.
There are only a few really unique things, and I dare claim that Tap Tap belongs to them.
Of course, the first impression the viewer has is pity; this is only natural...
But this pity is absolutely superfluous because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned beings we must regret.
They are people who can live and develop a full life, provided they have the means necessary to do so.
I always say that when people with disabilities succeed something, this is not only a progress for them themselves, but for the whole society.
Was it also helpful for this success that you are a strict boss as you hear from many people?
If you want to do something well, you must not compromise in many things, and you must also ask for some discipline.
I believe that this is perfectly normal.
Some come to us with romantic ideas, and when they find that they have tastes twice a week, have to take preparation phases and spend a lot of time on concert trips, the enthusiasm quickly fades.
But this is how it works everywhere, in every band that wants to work seriously and achieve something.
Currently, The Tap Tap has twenty members.
How many of them were there from the beginning, i.e. since 1998?
Only one: Lá in Angelovič.
We're an open group, people are coming and going, and you can't stop that.
Anyone who has the will and the desire to participate is always welcome with us.
It takes place on the day before the predicted world downturn, Thursday, December 20th, 2012 at 21:00 p.m.
Locations are: Incheba-Arena/Prag, Fléda/Brno and Plynojem/Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
All three venues will be connected to each other at the end of the live stage and a common interpretation of the hymn, the world’s decline, comes out of the band The Tap Tap.
The aim of the concert is to establish the resources for the provision of a multifunctional disabled education centre, which is to be created under the name STUDEO at the Jedlička Institute in Prague. Cost: 25 million CZK
Admission costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years free of charge, tickets are available in advance at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and Space.
Last week Poland was admitted as a twentieth member of this space authority at a Council of Ministers meeting of the Member States of the European Space Organization ESA. Poland is thus the second member country from the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a member of ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland began a close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated in several ESA projects in the following years.
The road of Poland into space began much earlier.
Before the Second World War, Polish cosmos enthusiasts were engaged in space travel, so they did not always rely on understanding.
For example, I remember the lecture by A. Šternfeld of 6 December 1933 at the Warsaw Observatory, where the author presented thoughts from his pioneering work, \"Inway to Cosmonautics\".
However, the ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the listeners cold, and after years Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
Šternfeld won the Prix REP-Hirsch, which was founded by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch in 1934.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became an important advocate of astronomy and space.
In Polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski's globally recognized contribution to the development of space has been appreciated, among other things, by the name of one of the craters on the earthward side of the moon.
Already in 1925, a rail-draisine was built in Poland for which a rocket drive was planned.
Unfortunately, the author of the draft and the details of this project remained unknown.
It is not even clear whether the rocket should be used for starting or braking the draisine.
The information for this is exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933 the Polish infantry began to deal with rocket-operated bullets.
The research was conducted by the Institut Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
From the documents delivered it is apparent that the research was carried out until the stage of practical testing.
The research was then interrupted by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937, a photoelectric hunting rocket appeared in the press of the design produced by Ing. Rohoziński, and in the following year, the work “Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza” by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky appeared.
Both projects dealt with the military use of the rocket drive.
Shortly before the war, all projects for military use of rocket technology were coordinated by the temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Committee Doradczo-Naukowy).
The Committee was set up in 1937, but after two years of work his work was completed by the beginning of the war.
Further articles on space appeared after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Space Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.
The first mention of this society was made in 1954 in the November issue of the magazine Problemy, in which four extensive articles of space are dedicated.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal to establish a space society.
At the time there were already the first projects on satellite technology, and it was anticipated that the exploration of space would have future.
Already in its early days in 1956, the Polish Space Society PTA tried to join the International Space Federation, founded in 1951, and in fact the PTA became an ordinary member in the autumn of 1956.
The following year, the first PTA chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became Deputy Chairman of the International Federation for Space.
He served until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has been involved in the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish rocket for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first one was launched on October 10, 1958.
The rocket with a maximum flight height of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and did not weigh very 5 kg.
Later, an improved version, the RM-1A, was built, and in 1959, flight tests began with the RM-2 two-stage rocket in the Błędów desert.
The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another stage of development should already be able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should reach a flight height of up to 14.5 km and be used to observe high winds.
In 1962, however, further development was halted.
The first RM rocket was the Meteor-1 rocket developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket, its total length was 510 cm and the starting weight was 32,5 kg.
Three types (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed from this rocket, which differed in the size of the transport space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A rocket has a transport space of 0.4 liters capacity, Meteor-1B of 0.34 litres and Meteor-1C of 0.62 litres.
The maximum flight height was 37 km for all three types.
In 1965 to 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Aviation Institute, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a starting weight of 380 kg and was capable of transporting a load of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
The Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were then built.
It is also worth mentioning that Poland's accession to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 followed by the establishment of a national COSPAR committee two years later.
Poland also participated in space research with Soviet satellites in the context of the Intercosmos programme, and in 1978 Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became second intercosmonaut after the Czech Vladimír Remek.
The abolition of the law on non-profit works is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the law on non-profit works.
This decision led to a lively discussion in public.
It is certainly interesting to consider the problem from a broader perspective.
Liberally oriented economic systems in the EU and in the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the end, this means that the individual economies are in a permanent conflict with each other.
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with endless financial speculations.
Due to the large differences in the value of work (early wages), price tensions occur.
Under this term, a condition must be understood where the manufacturer tries to survive the economic competition by importing cheap goods, by ‘subsidising’ the competition, thereby increasing the market share and increasing its profits.
To a large extent, this means for most companies to move their manufacturing abroad or buy up cheaply, or to give up their business.The result is high unemployment in countries with comparable high labour costs.
As private capital has no social responsibility and thus no responsibility for the unemployment caused by it, it is necessary to increase public expenditure.
This situation is reinforced by the fact that Mr. Entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and thereby replace the total social and social damage caused by them.
This situation is generally known, so that concrete statistics are unnecessary at this point.
The carefree practice of private capital creates in the individual economies a situation where governments are forced to compete in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own population and thereby attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, governments deliver private capital without regard to the social consequences of their own population.
This is expressed in particular in amendments to existing laws.
The aim of these measures is to force its own people to accept the dictates of private capital in particular in the field of wages.
This is done, on the one hand, by economic constraints on long-term unemployment, on the other, by cutting workers' rights.
The result is growing poverty, as well as increasing differences between the poor and the rich.
In Germany there have been public food outlets for the poor for several years, which are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work.
The number of people affected is already in the millions.
As a result of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, there are regular cases where workers receive such a low wage that the State must raise their income to the minimum of existence.
Such a scandal was also discovered in the case of auxiliary forces employed in the German Bundestag.
The austerity measures of virtually all the EU southern states will undoubtedly go to the same state where people are forced to emigrate under the pressure of a disastrous fall in their social level (as it was in the 19th century), or to pay a famine on the edge of society, hoping that at some point private investment capital will flow into the country.
The question of where does this capital come from, of course?
If it comes from another EU country, poverty only moves from one country to another; or capital remains entirely out of place, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt, or in Africa, employees work for a fraction of European wages.
This concerns Latin America.
Liberal theories and media insist that the state should not participate in capital in its own economy, and that planning leads to economic disaster.
Private capital insists closely on its position that the State should not intervene in the economy.
But then one has to wonder whether private capital does not influence or even direct the whole state in its own selfish way.
Here is the clear answer: Yes.
The evidence for this is the existence of a virtually almighty lobby that is omnipresent in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, mutual prejudice, legislation in which virtually everything is strewn but not punishable.
In Germany, the situation is such that a Ministry of State is in charge of the drafting of legislative drafts in a lack of finance private, closely linked with industry.
These draft laws are subsequently passed during the Bundestag.
All the violence goes away from the people as the Western constitutions proclaim it, but from strong financial groups that prefer their own interests.
Obviously, the liberal democracies are now quickly getting into a situation as described by Appian in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic at the time Caesar and Pompeius: \"The state has long been in decline, and the offices have been occupied with violence.
Against lubrication, by unlawful exacerbation of advantages or with stone and sword.
The corruption grew unhesitatingly, and the people went to the election with already purchased votes, ... \"People with character did not apply themselves to offices, so that the state had no consul for eight months, ... \"One really began to talk about the fact that the only medicine in this difficult situation was a sole rule, and that a strong man had to be elected... Appian thought about Pompeius, but the strong man was finally Caesar, who permanently replaced democracy with the sole rule.
As shown, today’s society, as in ancient times, is based on the ruthless preference of one’s own advantage, without regard for all social interests.
Private capital is already by its nature not able to recognize and enforce the advantage for the whole society.
The result, today as it was then, is an unprecedented decade of elites who are not at all trying to make profound reforms.
The cause of the rise of fascism and communism must therefore be sought in the ruthless liberalisation of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
From today's state, the decline of these regimes in favour of liberal democracies can be seen as a certain pause, at which the next round is already taking place.
Especially disastrous is the fact that today’s elites face the possible losses of hundreds of thousands of human lives, the humanitarian and social disasters that we are already witnessing, as well as the crimes against humanity, as we know them from the older and newer history.
The abolition of the law on non-profit works is not a solution here, at least not a lasting one.
Under the pressure of global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will continue to seek ways to push the social level of the population downward.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The only solution is targeted political-social reforms that increase the capital participation of the state in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government, and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: Labor of Chaos.
“... that nothing can be caused by violence, or ever,” sings Sting in the song Fragile, whose most important verse in the refrigerator reads: “...by not forgetting how fragile we are.
“If my sons didn’t want war, there would be none,” says the dying Gutel Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849.
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there were, as always, a multitude of reactions.
They stand behind Israel and argue with its right to self-defense, while they call the Palestinians terrorists; the others, in turn, support the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the Israeli state, with the genocide committed by the Palestinian Arabs and describe the State of Israel as terrorist.
At this point, I do not want to write about those who have been born into the current political situation in these recurring waves of killing and who are victims; in the end, the inhabitants of Israel today, including the self-governing areas, have not experienced the beginning of violence themselves.
It is my concern to open the readers' eyes behind the scenes, to look at who the 95 years of tension (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small spot of land in the Middle East are especially useful.
My thoughts are partly based on accessible historical facts, others are derived from them and come from my own understanding of who or what group of people significantly influence the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is primarily a story of the struggle for power.
In every era we can make a Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is less apparent is the question of whether it was really always these personalities themselves who determined their steps autonomously, or whether behind their throne was someone who directed their actions towards a predetermined goal.
We must admit that we are living in a time when the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hands of fewer individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power has not arisen within the life span of a generation.
Among these astronomically rich families is a special one that could be described as the head of the crack (I don't know if there's anyone about them yet, but I don't exclude this) - the Rothschild.
Much is not written about them.
Understandably.
The first press agency (Reuters) was purchased by the Rothschilds already in the 90s of the 19th century in order to prevent the connection of their name with high-criminal acts, in their background always standing the stronghold of their power, the increase of their wealth or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all the world's central banks, and against the countries in which they are not involved in the central banks, they wage wars or equip themselves on these (before the attack on Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq there were 5 countries, after the fall of Ghaddafis only four, with Russia in the meantime subjecting its central bank to the Russian government).
Whoever tried to oppose this family had to pay with life for it.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothschild's Bank of America as a central bank, began to issue his own bank notes during the Civil War and was murdered in a theater in 1865.
J.F. Kennedy began to issue his own banknotes and wanted to abolish the FED - he was murdered in 1963; Mr. Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936, after he wanted to sue the FED for dissolving the global economic crisis in 1929.
The global vows of power of the Rothschild led in the years 1859 - 1871 to formulate a plan for the decommissioning of three world wars by Albert Pik, a freemason of the 33rd and thus the highest degree of knowledge.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great monarchist states of Europe, the second war would in particular break the colonial rule of Great Britain, and the third war would reduce the world population to about 0.5 - 1 billion people (a number would provide for their amenities and their luxury and would not consume so many resources), create a universal religion (Ecumenism is nothing more than the vanguard) and eventually lead to the acquisition of absolute power.
The method by which the group of the richest families works with the Rothschilds at the top is the triggering of a crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution (order from chao - order from chaos).
However, these solutions are incorrect and always lead to the deterioration of the situation (see FED's foundation, so that crises such as those triggered by them in 1907 do not repeat).
After the murder of the Habsburg Throne Successor Ferdinand in Sarajevo succeeded them in triggering World War I, they destroyed the Russian Tsar Empire through the Revolution of the Bolsheviks.
The First World War ended with the sudden, military and economically unfounded capitulation of Germany (for the destruction of the Russian Tsar Empire the war was no longer necessary), followed by the dissolution of the Central European Grand Power of Austria-Hungary.
In order to make World War II simpler, the banks created a latent conflict situation through politics, by putting Germany in the grip of gigantic war repairs, creating the condition of impoverished masses, so that they only had to subjugate the Germans with a sufficiently strong leader, who offered the debtors named and simple solutions; another factor was the creation of the People's State of Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, who should take on the function of a fifth column and also take on the role of a war fire.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschild initiated the founding of the Zionist movement, in which a branch sought to establish a Jewish state, as far as possible in the historical area of Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration mentioned earlier created the prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; it came to first clashes with the established Arab population.
Terrorist attacks were on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler got rid of the chain, at which the international bankers had initially held him, or whether everything went according to plan, it is difficult to estimate, and in any case the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the prerequisite for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and just as the war repairs against Germany prepared the ground for World War II, the proclamation of the State of Israel represents the creation of the focal point for the Third World War.
If international bankers succeed in dismantling this war, the Jewish people will be victimized in the front line of the Second World War, along with the Arab or Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of strife and chaos, not only in the land itself, but also internationally (but only remember how sharply people divide themselves into followers and opponents of Israel).
Who is the guilty and who is the victim of the conflict between Palestinians and Israelites, where injustice only triggers injustice in an endless spiral of violence, with the greed of individuals at first and their striving for global power?
Here one must distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leadership, but the international bankers in Israel, as well as us, the people, are exclusively choosing their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, Falke Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascism-stricken politician loyal to the international bankers, who is doing everything to develop a war with Iran, which, in view of Iran's membership in the Shanghain cooperation organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), could quickly expand into a global conflict, and in view of Iran's control of the only 2 miles wide road of Hormus, over which 20% of the world's oil supplies run, could result in the destruction of the world economy.
In what light are David Rockefeller’s 1994 words: “The only thing we need is an all-to-do crisis, and people will welcome the new world order,
In its idea, the new world order is a world of lords and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the human population serves a small group of financial aristocrates.
A world in which every newborn at birth is implanted a chip to submit to this being of total control.
“And it makes the little ones and the great ones, the rich and the poor, the free and the servants all give themselves a sign on their right hand or on their foreheads, that no one can buy or sell, because he has the sign, namely the name of the beast or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom! He that hath understanding, he considereth the number of the beast.
For it is a man's number, and his number is six hundred and sixty-six,
The movie Argo: If it's the worst thing, call Hollywood
In November 1979 a mob of Islamic students occupied the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats as hostages.
For their release, they demanded the delivery of the fallen Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled to the United States after the revolution, who had preserved the patronage over decades over his regime.
For the American government, there was no positive way out of this situation - it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, as this would have severely damaged the confidence of its allies in other countries.
At the same time, she was unable to enforce the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was a severe blow to the call of the united states, and the subsequent fiasco in the violent attempt of the hostage liberation made everything worse.
The captured diplomats were finally released after 444 days after negotiations by the Algerian government.
The fate of the hostages called home a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian moods.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to Jimmy Carter's defeat against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film Argo of the director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story that gave the United States a small partial victory.
Before occupying the message, six ambassadors managed to escape.
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to bring the refugees out of Iran, helping them an extravagant story to cover their true identity - they traveled with Canadian passports tarnished as members of a film staff that supposedly visited a science fiction film in the country.
Combination of genres
The plan developed by the expert on “Exfiltration - Tony Mendez” also required the collaboration of Hollywood.
To make the tart credible, articles on this film project appeared in specialist journals, press conferences were held, and the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of this operation have long been kept secret. The film is based on Tony Mendez's memories.
Affleck's film is a special combination of several film genres.
On the one hand he is a realistic politician, but at the same time also a so-called “Caper Movie” i.e. the story of a successful Husar piece such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
In this way the mood levels change - on the one hand the documentary scenes from Tehran (in the title sequence iconic contemporary photographs are shown, and even in the film version of the same situations there are no major differences).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, which come ironically and slightly overhead.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at the meeting table, on the office halls, on the phone...
With this film Ben Affleck has succeeded in a remarkable restart of his career.
From a smiled actor has become a respectable director, and even as an actor he is now no longer the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third film after the crime No children's game (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the thriller city without grace (2010).
At the same time, it is Affleck's first film that does not play in the local Boston of the director.
The feeling for the atmosphere of the place was one of the characteristics that the previous films of this director were derived from the standard Hollywood.
However, this feeling also proves in Argo, where Tehran is \"played\" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film play in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that really took place - the entry sequence of the embodiment of the message is very impressive in its illustrativeness, yet conveys the feeling of confusion and unforeseeability that occurs once the story moves.
A similar effect has been achieved by Affleck with his team also in fictional scenes (the wrong film set on a bazaar in Tehran).
Too much action at too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that history does not offer many exciting scenes in the cinematic sense.
But with the little one he works quite successfully, sometimes helping the reality - which then does not always seem so elegant (the scenes in which the threatening crisis at the airport in Tehran is turned away from a telephone call in America, or also the persecution hunt on the runway, seem somewhat cool).
The weakness of Argo is its all too broad distribution, which is due to the need to show too much of action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, but their figures would have earned more space, and so they are far from alone in the film.
Affleck's film loses a bit of traction. It is a film that can be followed with a certain interest and the design and a thriller from the 70th year's-old retro style.
However, enthusiasm only makes it difficult.
However, as a reminder of a piece of history that has been lived up to this day and as evidence of how obsolete the notions are of the omnipotent and all-knowing intelligence services, he is sufficient.
Guidelines for the inflating of balloons, bananas and circuses
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which calls for an annual survey of the most absurd bank charges, has decided this year to organise the competition ‘Absurdest Regulation or idea from the EU workshop.
\"On this idea, the EU's recently proposed plan to introduce a 40% women's ratio in the management of large European firms, said Patrik Nager, who is concerned about the organisation of this survey, to Právo newspaper.
For example, the European Court of Justice ruling on the harmonization of insurance tariffs for men and women is among the nominated absurdities.
Until then, women have enjoyed an advantage in life insurance because they are objectively at lower risk for insurance companies.
\"More incredible incidents from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will take place until the end of February 2013 - followed by a vote.
The controversial EU regulations include, among other things, the binding addition of bioethanol to fuels which, as a result, are damaging to the environment, the further banning the reliable mercury thermometer, only because they contain a relatively small amount of this hazardous substance, or the directive on the size of chicken cages, which this year made eggs much more expensive.
In the past, criticism also reaped the factual prohibition of the use of the term \"buttering up\" or also the ban on the sale of conventional bulbs.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU apparatus often decides under the pressure of this or that lobby from trade and industry, whose claims in Brussels are usually represented by one or more member countries (for example, the Czech Republic is currently trying to enforce the requirements of Czech banks with veto threat).
Lobby interests also supported the fact that bananas of the highest trading class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and must not have ‘crumbling anomaly’.
The European Commission defended the argument that it would only harmonise the incompatible national standards that would hinder trade.
EU standards on fruit and vegetables have already been raised against the resistance of some countries, pointing out that the previous directives would lead to food waste.
A candidate for victory in this survey may be the EU Regulation last year, which, according to air balloons, must be made aware that children under the age of eight may not blow up the balloon without the supervision of an adult.
The EU called for an American study, which, according to air balloons, is the leading cause of children's suffocation deaths.
A similar restriction already applies to children up to 14 years of age when using annual market flows.
Curious incidents also exist at home
It is also relatively absurd that a directive that concerns European officials themselves - everyone who takes an official role in the EU must not use the name Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the subject to Greece and must instead say FYROM (Former Yugoslavia Republic of Macedonia).
In cooperation with the Association of Liberal Economist Laissez Faire, Server Bankovnípoplatky.com also nominated the EU Regulation on the size of food stocks in the field of a member country in addition to the above-mentioned absurdities.
The EU thus established the maximum volume of food supplies allowed on the day of our accession to the Czech Republic.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the fixed volume for mushroom preserves, for which a high fine threatened us.
The organisers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for not having a sea, or by the idea of providing funding for requests for funding funds.
These ideas did not come from Brussels, but from Prague.
“We are disadvantaged by the fact that we have no sea.
We will apply for restitution in the EU, according to the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he argued that the cereal harvest had been very high and the state warehouses were overcrowded as a result of the so-called intervention purchases.
Since the Czech Republic has a further route to seaports, according to Palas, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
The European Commission finally opposed the Czech Republic so far that it organised an invitation to tender for the purchase of cereals from countries without access to the sea.
Funding funds for applications for grants offered by the municipalities to the Ministry of Regional Development under the direction of Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), specifically should be the means of setting up grant applications to Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
However, while regulations in the Member States are becoming easy targets for criticism, the EU's efforts to regulate and thus also for the effectiveness and development of the entire European Union are more worthy of recognition by some experts.
According to these experts, a more serious problem is more the EU funding for projects that have nothing in common with the deepening of European integration, but have been forced into the budgetary negotiations of individual Member States.
Emotions also highlight the fact that the Czech Republic, like other member countries in Brussels, has to fight for the right to use specific designations of traditional products and this fight does not always win.
After a six-year struggle with Germany and Austria, the Czech Republic was able to defend the name \"Olomoucké tvarůžky\", the Inlanderrum (Tuzemský rum), whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, but our manufacturers had to rename it to \"Tuzemák\".
The term rum may only be used for products of sugar cane distillate, not for products of sugar beet.
In the official list of products registered in the EU, the company of world-famous cheese varieties Feta and Gorgonzola, the Lübeck marzipans or the Parmaschinken now also includes the Karlsbader Zwieback, Carps from Pohořelice and Třeboň, or the Saazer Hopfen.
With an EU brand, the Pardubic Lebkuchen or the Hořic rolls can be bred.
“People want me to save the Republic, but I’m just an amateur,” Okamura claims.
Mr Senator, how do you get the idea of running for the office of President?
It's not about being a senator or a president.
If everything would work in our country without problems, I wouldn't be able to do anything.
But I can no longer see how the Republic has been looted for 20 years, as thieves run around freely, while people increase taxes and pension age.
I had no ambitions to become a politician.
But if I see something I don't like, then I'm trying to propose a solution to change this.
And since I am already over 40 and independent and partyless, I have no other way to influence things than to apply for the office of Senator or President.
In the Senate you made it and then straight on the way to the castle.
Aren't you going to turn your voters back?
I told myself all the time that I would take up the battle for the castle after the result of the Senate elections.
Later I specified this and said that I would apply for the office of President if I were elected Senator.
My goal, however, is not the function. The function is an instrument with which I can realize my visions.
I need as much influence and a mandate as possible.
The difficulty, however, is not just that we as a people are scrambling in the pubs and in front of the TV, but that everyone who wants to change something.
In addition, the media that want to rob you of honor and confuse the freedom of the word with freedom.
For example, I was claimed to be a journalist or to be a consultant to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your visions.
You have taken up the battle for the castle with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians as well as with retroactive assets over 20 million crowns.
To do this, you need to change laws.
As President, you have no competence in this respect, and only the Senate as a whole can bring forward proposals for legislation.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I worked to ensure that the guide remained a free trade, and this could be enforced.
The problem is the petty policy - if someone comes from the right or from the left with a good proposal, it is deliberately rejected, and that only stops the population.
As an independent party, I have a far greater potential to gain support from all the parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that without drawer thinking and party dogmas, I can take what is best for our country.
Do you see yourself as a human being in politics rather on the right or on the left?
From a Czech point of view, it seems to me that people see me on the left.
For me, however, this right-left thinking is completely unimportant.
For me, it's important that we keep coming.
I am not concerned whether someone belongs to the left or to the right camp; I want to connect people.
I support publicly any good solution, even if it comes from KSČM or ODS, and I will also oppose bad ideas.
You're wrong if someone calls you populists.
But don't you confirm that by what you just said?
If you are setting up a business plan in a company, then you also have an ideal goal and vision.
And you want to get closer to this.
This can be called populism, but all the proposals I have spoken of are already working in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without the support of Parliament, you will only remain the keywords.
And that doesn't make you far in politics in the long term.
Or do you think that if you talk to people long enough, you will succeed, for example, in enforcing material and criminal liability?
I have no other option.
To convince politicians, journalists and the public and to try to bring them to our side in order to enforce these goals.
As President, it would not be a problem for me to call on the chairmen of the parliamentary parties live on television to legally anchor the material and criminal liability of politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And if so, they may have to say why they reject it.
A strong personality that points to maladies can put pressure on the political scene.
Take only once the direct election of the president, which was a merit of public pressure.
I make it clear that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my views and visions.
I have just started politics and tried to find the support of the majority for my programme.
I always try to judge things myself; and if it doesn't work, I will return to the private sector in six years.
That sounds like Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a rescuer.
I know that I can't do anything on my own; therefore I talked to several well-known personalities about whether they don't want to do anything for the Senate.
For example, I spoke to Radim Jančura, who refused to do so because of work overload.
I also supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who discovered the fraud in dealing with light heating oil.
My candidacy began with the requirement that people are deeply unhappy, but now I am no longer sure.
Sixty percent of the voters did not attend the elections at all, and those who went mostly elected representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate we are only two independent.
People have chosen such a Senate composition that changes will only be very difficult to enforce.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, e.g. for the direct election of mayors and district chiefs.
Do you think about setting up your own party?
I haven't thought about it yet because I don't have time to review the past of any potential party member, nor do I have the money for it.
I don't even have money for the presidential campaign; on my transparent account only 20,000 are CZK.
You don't have any money?
You talk about assets, how do you look?
I estimate my private assets to be around 60 million CZK.
In Prague I have a property worth 25 million, one apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection worth about 10 million, as well as an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Škodu Superb, which is worth about one million, and then I have a few more millions on the account.
By the way, Aston Martin was a children's dream - James Bond always liked me as he drove in the car, was gallant to women and fought evil at the same time.
You're driving an Aston Martin, have a 60 million assets and don't have any money for your campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but your own money you don't want to invest in it.
That's not just convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Should I make debts?
I've already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors shows that my program probably doesn't arouse too much interest.
And I am not obliged to oppose the campaign of my own resources.
The cost of the campaign is basically covered by my salary as a senator.
But I couldn't live by the senator's salary; for example, I couldn't finance my son's English school that costs 30,000 a month.
If only I wanted to make money, I wouldn't be able to do anything for anything.
So do you continue to work as an entrepreneur to have your income?
Didn't you say you're going to go back to these activities?
But this does not relate to the level of salary.
As promised, I ran back my activities in part.
For example, my alternate in the spring becomes managing director of the travel agency.
People want to see me as a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to live with something.
What monthly income were you used to as an entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and that is still the case.
However, as President, I would completely end my business.
The full discussion can be found in the Saturday edition of Právo.
The MVRDV architects prove that the true adventures are not just in the head - for example Spijkenisse and the recently built bookberg - 2 photos
“I find the building funny, it looks futuristic, and at last there’s something interesting to see again,” says Lisette Verhaig, a streetside passant.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a nearby big business, says: “But, it’s beautiful, it’s already the house,”
But I wonder what else we need for today.
Everyone has internet, iPad and e-books.
No human is still voluntarily entering one of these Old-Style libraries today, right?
Spijkenisse, a little-needed sleeping town in front of the gates of Rotterdam, is an extraordinary record holder.
The 80,000 resident community has the lowest education rate in the Netherlands.
A few years ago, in order to counter this stupid situation, we decided to contribute to general education and to rebuild the seven fictional bridges shown on the euro notes as nicely brushed steel concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And so the city fathers recognized that there was only one way to become a master of statistics: a library had to come from!
Winy Maas from the Rotterdam architecture office MVRDV, master of the great-counsel bar charts and producer of funny, often cynical buildings, took the matter with usual ease and appeared to the competition hearing anno 2003 with five books under his arm and a grind in his face.
And while the jury was still dizzying to look at himself and squeezing with the axles, the frayed Maas stacked his fine fellows of the size to a pyramid and ended his actionistly substantiated speech with the words: \"Dear Township\"
So that's him, my proposal for the Book Mountain of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Bookenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million euro is worth of mountain.
It is part of a revitalisation project, including underground garage, supermarket, post office and a few adjacent residential and rowing houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Bieksberg was awarded the second prize, Best Library of NL 2012.
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Thus is the faceless small town resorts, which until now had no more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and a completely ugly town hall, behind whose white facades one would be inclined to suspect a dairy factory to be richer in a piece of contemporary architecture.
Above all, however, Spijkenis now has the first public culture in the history of its existence.
The Long Way to the Book
The first impression: Bookeldorado under cheese bell.
Although there is a lift that leads through the middle of the mountain massif, the true pleasures of space and reading are unlocked during the gradual climb of the topography.
The all-round glazed interior is bright and clear, the burned clinker floor and the elegant street lanterns clearly speak the language of a public town square.
The urban setting is perfect.
You're already watching park bench, dog and football playing boys and girls.
And books, books, books everywhere.
“The books are usually standing along the facade, and in the middle there is a large, dark room, which is mostly uncomfortable and impersonal,” says Winy Maas.
We have put the classic room configuration on the head and stamped the reading area from the inside to the outside.
The interior of the Bücherberg is well used: In the middle are offices, internet library, chess club, environmental center and home technology center.
A special joy are the black bookshelfs, which are sometimes wall coverings, times breasts, times boots.
Optics, haptics and smells are foreign.
Even embroiled architects and civil engineers shake their heads as to the unknown building material.
“We wanted to work here with recycling materials,” explains Joop Trouborst, project leader at the municipality of Spijkeissen, on request of the standard.
And so, one day, in a French agricultural holding, we came across a suitable waste product from agriculture.
For many years, a millimeter thin plastic nonwoven has been used in greenhouses in the Netherlands and in fields as root base.
That's cheap and time efficient.
The thin textile holds in, two seasons, after that it is ripe for the bulk.
For the library, the nonwovens - for the first time in these quantities - were pressed to four centimeters thick plates.
Under heat impact and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) becomes a dark, homogeneous, load-bearing material that smells a bit like new cars and a bit like sports shoes.
After 105 steps, one has reached the summit.
At the end of the almost 500-metre walk you will be rewarded not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch crockery and stuffed ficus trees.
They provide atmosphere, but above all for the right humidity in the literary mountains.
Donations for the New Soul
“You wouldn’t believe it, but despite the many glass areas, this house is a presentation project in the field of ecology,” says Trouborst.
Heats and cools with Earth's heat.
Although the Bücherberg is under a glass fall, the sun itself appears only briefly inside on sunny days.
The wide wooden glue bins, which are across to the glass facade, serve as a treasure and catch up a large part of the sun's rays.
The room climate is very pleasant.
Complete the rest of the automatic rollos.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptic from the IT industry, already dared get the way into the new bookstore.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And even the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who even calls the Bookenberg as \"the last superfluous soul\".
The reason: At the opening just a few weeks ago, every resident was invited to donate a book from his personal stock.
This will fill first the optical gaps in the not yet fully-contained library - currently 70,000 pieces.
The concept has risen.
The shelves are filled up to the top.
“Nothing is worse than a semi-empty library,” says architect Winy Maas.
“I think, thanks to our invitation, every resident now has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it's just the scar.
MVRDV has thus succeeded in the kingly discipline, which is called the identity foundation in the field jargon.
Spokenness has written literary history.
As young and uneducated as she may be.
This is finally a point of reference for identity.
Szabo: \"Germans have to play a larger role,
Germany has included itself in the vote on the inclusion of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, expert on US-European relations, Berlin is thus balancing to a narrow diplomatic degree.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week Germany had initially signaled that it would vote against the request for an observer status of the Palestinians at the United Nations.
But then there was Berlin.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.
Now, however, Germany must be careful because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I do not think it supports the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - but without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also contained the voice when it was about to set up a flight ban zone.
This was finally enforced by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on important international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because it is just changing its foreign policy away from a policy managed by the United States to a German foreign policy.
It is difficult to say that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
So the Germans find themselves between the fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still taking on their role, but they are on their way to a more \"normal\" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, as they have France or the United Kingdom.
What does a \"normal\" foreign policy mean, specifically from a German point of view?
It shows the willingness to include in national interests positions independent of those of the US or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of the other great powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the attitude in the Middle East conflict and voting in the UN?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf States.
That is why it must be careful not to put the public, but also the elites, in the Arab countries.
That certainly plays a role.
But I wouldn't want to attach too much weight to it either, that's not a completely unilateral relationship.
But it certainly plays an important role in German considerations.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the United States by engaging in important decisions of the vote, for example in voting on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe and even in the United States there is great understanding of the German position.
That's why I don't think this was such a dramatic break as in the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany will even show some respect for it.
Because it signals that it is taken seriously as an international player and that its interests must be considered.
There are different opinions on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The United States, on the other hand, has clearly declared itself a veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the United States and many European nations?
Because of American internal policy, these differences have always existed.
I believe that the government under Obama may have quite a lot of understanding of the European position.
But because of the political situation here, the government cannot, of course, represent this position publicly.
I do not believe that the actual differences of opinion are as large as they always appear.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, then Obama is not so excited about Netanyahu's politics.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand, and the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other?
I think that's exactly what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
It would, of course, be a bit easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, which is not currently the case.
So they can't be part of a wider line and instead have to push things out of their own position.
That's what they're doing with the euro right now.
I believe that in the future Germany will play a leading role in pushing Europe into a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, already because of the relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive topic.
But I think that the Germans are clear that they have to play an independent role.
Does Germany itself see itself as an important international player - does Germany want to play a major role at all?
Or does Germany still find the leadership role difficult?
Germany is still not used to it, that is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a larger role.
For example, when we look at the euro crisis, every time Germany takes on a larger role, a wide variety of anti-German feelings will be released.
That doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
This is actually the old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
As seen, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the USA.
It must be receptive to different neighbors and opinions and this is not easy.
Now the US's influence in European policy is decreasing continuously, but the EU is not filling this vacuum at the moment, who else is there?
The Germans will simply have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, it's unpleasant to them and makes them much more unpopular - c'est la vie!

“Trade protection” in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren as well.
But what is Armani Polo?
In this case, a name registered in China is hidden, but it has nothing to do with the companies of origin.
Nevertheless, it enjoys protection as long as the actual nominees do not complain.
And even then it's not clear if they're getting right.
“It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China,” says Thomas Pattloch, lawyer at Taylor Wessing, who specializes in protection violations in the Far East.
Every week a new case arrives at my desk.
The posters already have a few additional letters so they can register their brands.
So from Gucci simply Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada, you can register Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied in this way, such as the sport product manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with registrations of the trademark office in Beijing.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company placed the trademark Zegna DF Puma, an art name that also served at the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is well known that the Chinese world champions are in copying and in violation of intellectual property.
In the big cities there are multi-storey department stores that sell almost exclusively counterfeits.
Pattloch's cases, however, are different: On behalf of his clients, he argues that Chinese companies are officially granted the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call the \"Bang Mingpai\" a passenger brand.
The word is oriented to \"Bang Dakuan\"
That's what women mean, the rich men are fishing.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any debt
“That’s business-damaging, you have to fight it,” says Pattloch.
“The brand is watered down, the single attitude disappears, the image damage is huge “
The financial failures and the process costs of the industries concerned go into the millions, especially in the case of expensive show products.
According to the market research company CLSA, China is the third largest luxury product market with a volume of 15 billion euros a year and the fastest growing.
However, deletions of dubios entries in the trademark register are difficult to achieve and go into money.
For up to nine years, the procedure can go ahead, with uncertain results.
Pattloch reports on cases in which the court rejected actions because after the long period of time, the claimed name has become “market reality”.
If the plaintiff has bad luck, he'll even have to pay the plagiarism because he violated his brand in China, Pattloch says.
Sometimes the law of the jungle prevails here.
Famous cases also cover graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a lawsuit with the construction machine manufacturer Sany, the company that recently took over the German concrete pumper Putzmeister.
The Chinese are therefore allowed to use an emblem similar to the Mercedes star to this day.
The Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue and white logo, which reminded BMW; the dispute was made, Geely had to change it.
The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China against descendants from Hong Kong and Singapore who made the famous crocodile look in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
Although the CTMO brand office in Beijing admits that there have been bottlenecks there in 2010 due to too little personnel and space equipment.
In the past year, however, we have returned to normality from the emergency situation in the course of work,
Thus, the stock of unprocessed opposition proceedings had fallen by 22 percent.
Almost 57,000 such cases have been completed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Yet there are still 81,500 complaints in the office.
Getting on the other hand costs a lot
As so often in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year the CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost one third more than 2010.
This is a record and means that for the tenth time in a row, China will introduce the list of new applications around the world, the Authority will notify.
This also applied to the stock of all valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan had been charged.
This means that every registration on average costs 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
On the other hand, it costs many times, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the Group has been fighting against a Chinese plagiarism.
Although the Germans were able to achieve that its illegal manufacturing of imitated motor vehicles was eliminated.
However, the follower continued to secure Chinese rights at the Freudenberg brand.
This has been failed by the fact that in Germany family names could not be protected, says Hanno Wentzler, Chairman of the Management Board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The stamp office CTMO also rejected the opposition of the Munichers.
In the next two instances, Freudenberg got right, but the opponent of the trial continues to fight to this day.
You've got to be very careful.
Now the matter is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a good conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: \"The procedure is extremely demanding and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves.
The internal costs were hardly determined, the company archive even had to look through a hundred-year-old files to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the opposite side a “high six-digit euro” in vain for settlement.
“You see how much this is worth for us,” Wentzler says.
The dangers in Fernost are even threatening to jump back to Europe.
Then, if there are Imitators there, there are unprotected brands.
So a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
This business segment has long abandoned the Group, yet it has been able to cancel registration.
“You have to be very careful,” says Wentzler.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be very careful at business with China.
It was not enough to rely on international trade mark rights, but the foreigners should, as Wentzler says, register “everything that is somehow protective, even in China.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
In fact: If Freudenberg was subject to the last act of his brand drama, then the opposite would probably have to pay license fees for his own name, Wentzler explains.
Or we will be pushed out of the market in the relevant segment.
World AIDS Day: Stamping, singing, helping
In Heidelberg the choir probates Imbongi - and in Swaziland Aidswaisen is happy about it.
The history of a compound that overcomes far more than 8733 kilometers.
First, there is the stamping: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, ladies' pumps and men's slippers looking for the tap on the parquet floor, find him fast.
One-two-three-four.
Then the vocals slowly swell - old, bass, tenor and soprano - wither, and follow.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, took it almost out of his tusks, when he brought them together with his smooth wild gestures.
It is Monday evening, in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the choir Imbongi is trying a new song.
The fifty singers came from 23 to 69 years old, from the human geneticist to the housekeeper.
\"Om'Obani\" is not an easy piece, each choir voice has a different text and it is still spoken in a very foreign language: Zulu, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in parts of Swaziland.
Self-help assistance
Around the world, there are some 34 million HIV infected, which estimates Unaids, the United Nations Programme for the Control of AIDS.
23.5 million people live in southern Africa.
In Swaziland, 245,000 AIDS orphans live.
More than 40% of the population are now HIV positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni the association Voices for Africa Paten has found in Germany.
70 of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can take over a partnership.
She guarantees the child school fees, school uniforms and a warm meal daily at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means on Zulu storytellers or also praisers.
Speaking the Bantu language fluently in this room, nobody can, but sing.
For almost ten years, the choir has been practicing songs in this strange soft language and occasionally brings them back to where they originally came from: to the South of Africa.
Because 8 733 kilometers of air line from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the vocal force of the German choir.
40 percent are infected
About 2000 people live there, some still in simple clay and straw huts, most of which are children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents, because these are caused by the HI virus.
In Esitjeni it is apparent in the small, where Swaziland is sick: highest HIV infection rate, lowest life expectancy worldwide according to Unicef.
Cuts of the male foreskin, which have been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, are hardly accepted by the population.
More than forty percent of the people in Swaziland carry the immune weakness virus in themselves, with thirty to die in the middle is no rarity.
During a joint African trip in spring 2005, the choir discovered the village, but above all, the Imbongis saw many children on the streets, who lacked not only parental care but simply on everything: food, clothing, education.
Without graduation in a poor country, there's no chance.
In the beginning, it was still the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school for a few euros a year and to allow him a warm meal a day.
But just a year later, the choir founded the \"Voices for Africa\" club, which has been taking care of the Aids Waises in Esitjeni since then.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and tripper (gonorrhea).
Common viral STIs are HIV, human papillomaviruses, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
Filtlers and scratches belong to the parasitic STI.
Who are the main affected groups?
Syphilis and trippers are especially common among men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute assumes that at least four out of five syphilis cases reported in Germany are transmitted through sexual contacts between men.
For heterosexual adults, chlamydia infections, trichomonads, candidosis (pilz), tripper and human papillomavirus are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The spread of HIV is comparatively low among heterosexual adults in this country - nevertheless: About 20 percent of HIV-new infections are related to this group.
Among adolescents, chlamydia infections occur much more frequently than in other populations.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people between 15 and 25 years of age.
Human papillomaviruses are also common in young people.
How did the number of infections develop?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to reporting.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has more than doubled from 1697 diseases in 2001 to 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of HIV infections has decreased since 2007.
In 2011, there were some 2700 cases.
This is about a tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate a sexual illness?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, complaints in urination, discharge, abdominal pain as well as blisters or warts.
Often, however, they cause no pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not offer a hundred percent protection.
In part, pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be passed on through lubrication and close body contact.
Experts therefore recommend regular examinations especially in frequently changing sex partners.
The majority of STI can be cured early on and avoided late follow-up.
Through patents, donations and not least the gages that the choir sings all over Germany, there is a lot coming together.
“All in all, we have already sent around 200 000 euros to Esitjeni,” says Annette Lennartz, chairman of the association.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-conscious and perpetuating woman, manages the funds from Germany.
She also takes care that the orphans get well under one of the grandmothers, for example.
The Gogos, as they call the old women on Zulu, are the support of the village.
Some of them have taken in up to 14 orphans, give them a roof over their heads and ensure that the children in their uniforms appear on time for school lessons every day.
Anyone who no longer has comes to the shelter of Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid by the club as well as the two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, \"Voices for Africa\" has set up a sewing school, built two chickens' houses, and organized jointly with the American health organisation PSI, that many in the village have made an HIV test.
This is not a matter of course, because, as obviously as the disease is throughout the country, it is silently dead.
A King with 14 wives
“AIDS is an absolute taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it has to do with sexuality.
Actually strange in a country where the king officially holds 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy rather than democracy.
Among other things, it is also due to this stately sanctioned life form that the HI virus has spread so rapidly over the past decades.
But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus through the country.
Free condoms are available at every corner, says Annette Lennartz, \"but they are hardly used.
The culture is another - meat to meat -
To promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi Chor travels all two, three years together through the south of Africa and sings songs full of sorrow, struggle spirit, confidence and black self-awareness, many of which still know about the southern tip of the Black continent from times of apartheid.
A bus full of whites who sing songs in a black language - so much recognition not only brings mood and joy, but has already carried off some grim border soldiers a few tears.
The journey always leads to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their duck children.
Even if you can hardly find the small village on maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni River it is more than known.
“Going to Esitjeni, there is the light - say the people there.
And when you return the 8733 kilometers of air line to Heidelberg, to the stabbing singers in the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Straße, then you see it shining.
Messenger: NASA Discovers Ice on Mercury
The probe Messenger has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice cover may be up to 20 meters thick.
The U.S. Space Agency NASA has demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the sun, there is frozen water there, as three studies published in the journal Science on Thursday.
The probe Messenger has found evidence that there is an ice ceiling in the permanently shaded region of the planet.
This should be at least 30 centimeters and possibly even up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably came from comets or possibly asteroids that hit Mercury.
No one brings the discovery of ice, but related to the existence of life on the planet, said the chief scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help clarify how water and other building blocks of life have arrived in other areas of the solar system.
Unnoticed by the Earth's citizens, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix are exploring the depths of the world.
From time to time, they send pictures to the Earth: Small guckholes in infinite widths.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a planet according to the new definition of the International Astronomical Union of 2006
This picture section of an infrared recording of the Spitzer telescope shows a family portrait of uncounted star generations: The oldest stars can be seen as blue points, harder to identify are the pinkish, newborn, in the star's circular room.
This star-forming region - called unromantic W5 by scientists - has discovered the telescope tipper in the constellation Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6500 light-years.
This dazzling glut of a dying star has taken up the tipper telescope of the Nasa.
The donut-shaped ring consists of material that the star slipped out in the death process.
In the giant trifid nebula, 5400 light years away from Earth, new stars are created from gas and dust.
The Nasa Spitzer telescope shot this photo of the galactic birth tube.
The Pleiades star cluster, also called \"The Seven Sisters\", can be seen at night with the naked eye.
With the telescope, however, the colors are better applied.
Like a red age, the helix nebula looks at the viewer on this infrared photo.
It is located 700 light-years away in the aquarium constellation.
His similarity to an earthly continent brought this fog to North America.
A combination of normal and infrared photo provides spectacular coloring.
This baby star could only be recorded in its full beauty by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: as these were created, is one of the great puzzles of astronomy.
Perhaps they are the remains of a Saturn monsoon that disappeared without trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and sharpest shots of the Hubble telescope: The Whirlpool Galaxy
Depending on coloration, images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The recording published by the European Southern Observatory shows the trifid nebula, several thousand light-years away, in the constellation Schütze.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (trifidus divided, three-stranded), since dark dust strips triple the glowing heart of the star birth site.
In the constellation of snake carriers, astronomers have photographed the promenades of a cosmic carambola: 400 million light years away from Earth, the cores of two merging galaxies are rushing together and will inevitably collide with each other.
This star birth recorded the Hubble telescope in the Spiral Galaxy M83.
Whose technical abbreviations do not lie, he may call them the Southern Fire Wheel by their nickname.
The photo of Hubble's space telescope shows an excerpt from the Irisnebel in the constellation Kepheus.
The 1400 light-year fog consists of dust grains that are ten to a hundred times smaller than ordinary house dust.
This image was composed of optical and X-ray recordings of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, recorded the space telescope Hubble for the Nasa.
The larger spiral galaxy is called scientists UGC 1810.
In this star nebula is the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The star's scales always produce new Youngsters.
Also this star cloud, connected with the rosette nebula, produces constantly new baby stars - 5000 light years away from Earth.
In this glowing galaxy with a small black hole there is no dust yet, but only gas.
Researchers suspect that it was only recently after the big bang, when hydrogen was mainly found in the universe.
Our insights into all: The most important telescopes
The telescope was to be invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608 - even before Galileo Galilei used it for star observation a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have grown ever bigger - and the insights they provide have become deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope in the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the world's largest long-distance tube.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, the Large Binocular Telescope stands.
It allows views into the world over two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior life of the Gran Telescope Canarias on the Canary Island of La Palma is huge - the mirror alone comes to 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
Nevertheless, it reaches a diameter of about eleven meters.
The disadvantage of the cheap construction: The telescope is fixed at its height angle - and thus limited in its mobility.
The hobby Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at the altitude angle.
Its peculiarity: the high power of light.
This, in fact, reaches the world's largest mirror telescope, despite comparatively small mirror diameter.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico), researchers are listening to extraterrestrial signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
At the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI), each computer owner can help by providing computing power.
View of the Observatory of the European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here stands the Very Large Telescope - which honors his name.
With a total of four mirrors, the remote tube can also illuminate the mid-infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned on the Chilean ESO Observatory.
Its main mirror is to be filled with 42 meters - and composed of almost 1000 mirror elements.
But with images at the earliest 2018 can be expected.
Until 2007, the two basin telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They offer two mirrors each with an average of ten meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna-Kea Observatory, which looks into the sky next to them with the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
Also on the Mauna Kea a new, huge telescope is to be created - with a mirror average of thirty meters.
Here's an illustration to marvel at.
However, the main impressions from the All provide the space telescope Hubble.
Since 24 April 1990 it has been delivering pictures of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the space telescope Kepler has been looking for extrasolar planets - mainly for those that are habitable.
On 2 February 2011, the Nasa announced that 1235 planetary candidates had been identified since the start of the mission.
In the picture, the last preparations at the Kepler Space Telescope are documented.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is shot into space at the earliest in 2018 on board an Ariane5 rocket.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: it is supposed to look for light from the first stars and galaxies for the big bang.
Scientists believe that ice also exists on the south pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data for this, as the Messengers are far closer to the North Pole around the planets.
Radar measurements have been pointing out for decades that there is ice on Mercury.
Through the Messenger probe - the first to orbit Mercury - launched in 2004, scientists now have certainty.
Drink butter every day - and become 168 years old
In southern Azerbaijan many people reach Bible age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A search for traces in the country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan many people reach Bible age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A search for traces in the country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
The journey through the Talysch mountains is to be called wild romantic.
The small bus rumbles over the winding road, past densely forested hills, tearing rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, you could think you were in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border to Iran is just a few kilometres away.
Here is where the Caucasian people of the Talys are living, of which not much is known, except that they speak perfect Persian as well as Aseric and are very durable.
The final station is Lerik.
The small town is protruding with overcast architecture from Soviet times, which doesn't even want to fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, too difficult is the approach of Azerbaijan's capital Baku.
For the 323 kilometers you need eight hours because the road is only one-tracked.
The fabulous wealth that the country owes to its oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived here in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the stuff for tourist attraction.
“Baku became famous in May with the Eurovision Song Festival - and next year we have a festival here for the oldest people in the world - says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the museum for longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here the Vita is documented by about eight dozen Talyschen from the area, older than 100. Fatulayeva shows a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136 a child was born
But a controversial star of the museum is the shepherd, Müslümov, who is 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And given the oldest documented person, 122 years of age, Müslümov's age seems very doubtful.
He was born here in the region in 1805, and died in 1973, explaining Fatulayeva.
The man had been married three times and had 23 children, and at the age of 136 he should have witnessed another daughter.
So, did Müslümov reach his age for a few decades?
But Rembrandt Scholz, senior researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of the high tides in Central Asia.
“There are also a lot of old people in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,” says Scholz, “even in Sardinia there are extremely many very old men,
However, due to lack of documentation, no scientific evidence on age should be given, especially in the absence of registered records.
Every day beechish melted butter
The fact is, however, that the people of the region around Lerik are strikingly often reaching a biblical age.
There are currently 20 people who are over 100 years old.
So why do so many high-time people live here in the south?
The Assyrian travel guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talys.
Museum director Fatulayeva, on the other hand, believes that it is in the diet.
But that the calorie-rich food of the Talysks should be so healthy that they love meat, bread and, above all, dairy products and many of them drink a glass of melted butter every day does not appear to be particularly plausible from a nutritional point of view.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? Rubaba Mirzayeva lives in Cengemiran, a tiny settlement not far from the city of Lerik.
With her 97 years she is still relatively young for these widths.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house, which is typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a butter barrel, which she untiringly rolls back and forth.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and one daughter, both are long-standing grandparents.
Two grandchildren also jump around.
In the kitchen you prepare tea for guests, which is served in the typical brook-shaped Armadu glasses.
Mirzayeva's white teeth are perfect in a row and limb, under her head towel it hides long dark-flowered creatures, which her son proudly reveals in front of us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so they never went out and kept their color.
“Shampoo I never used it,” Mirzayeva says.
Monthly pension is sufficient for life
She always ate only what came from her own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
I haven't bought food all my life a single time in the supermarket.
Then she tells about her husband who was in the army.
It was the worst in the post-World War II period.
But everything became better than the \"loved father\" Heydar Aliyew took over the rowing.
Propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult that is driven around the father figure of the nation, who ruled his country like a dictator, hardly knows borders in Azerbaijan.
Until 2003 he was in power, and later his son Ilham took over the rower.
After all, there's no need among Azerbaijan's old people.
230 Manat (about the same amount in euro), Mirzayeva receives monthly pensions, for local circumstances an amount of which one can live well.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's son has long been buried right: \"The old are enjoying high regard in our culture.
They live in the middle of the large family, are loved, cared for and are happy.
If this is not a reason to stay alive as long as possible
The word \"human rights\" is missing in the Constitution
The revolution returned to Cairo.
Rivalising rallying in Cairo revealed the deep division of the country.
The future constitution with Sharia as a basis is highly controversial.
The Egyptian President did not spare himself with pathos.
We have to make the transition.
“And that he succeeds lies in my responsibility, before the people and before God,” he said in the State TV.
His speech was addressed to all the people, but above all to the Christian Coptics, the liberals, enlightened Muslims and secularists.
Because all of them, hopelessly disputed in a confusing opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a God-state on the Nile of graces of powerful Muslim brotherhood.
He said, as Mohammed Mursi almost apologised, that he was temporarily cutting the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanding his competences in order to save the revolution.
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctoral degree from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save, about this is the Egyptians, the world is not completely clear.
Should the Judicatives be avoided?
In fact, the 234 articles that have been perplexed by the Islamist-dominated 100-head Constitutional Assembly in a nocturnal 15-hour parforce party are partly a source of concern.
As in previous constitutions, it is in the draft that the case law is based on the \"Principles of Islamic Law\"
But what does “principles” mean?
That was and is the interpretation matter and it is to be feared that the Islamists will use the sophisticated formulation and the corresponding legal scope for a stricter interpretation of the Sharia.
This suggests at least a new article to be added: in all the matters relating to Sharia, the Al-Ashar University had to be appointed, the country's most important Islamic institution with great radiant power throughout Sunni Islam.
This does not have to, but it can mean that the clergy oversee legislation, which would de facto result in the dismantling of the Judicative.
Much in the draft draft paper is interpretation matter
It is also problematic: civil military jurisdiction should continue to be maintained.
These courts served during Mubarak's rule to suppress oppositionals.
After the dictator's overthrow, up to 11,000 civilians were in military custody.
The State should also, it is in the draft, \"protect the true nature of the Egyptian family\" and promote their morality and values.
This is formulated legally so unsharp that with the help of this article, state institutions could even control the content of film art and literature.
In plain text, this means nothing but censorship.
No article, by the way, expressly states the equality between men and women.
For this, another forbids or condemns the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what is an insult, and how it is to be feared, remains unclear.
Similarly, dubios encourages the formulation that the \"oppression of people\" is forbidden.
Is there already a cartoon of the president or a joke at the expense of a lawyer?
Interpretation matter, as is so much in the draft, which Mursi is available for signature and, according to his words, is presented to the Egyptians for popular vote.
\"The revolution has returned,
The opposition has been formed for weeks against the domination of Islamists.
Tens of thousands gathered at the Tahrir Square in Cairo in an unusual reception on Friday evening and vowed to bring down the Charter even before it can enter into force.
“The revolution has returned and we will win,” said Hamdin Sabbahi, the third-placed of the presidential elections.
Peace Nobel Laureate and ex-Chief of the International Atomic Energy Authority Mohamed El-Baradei stated that the draft constitution was based on the Müllberg of History,
Through short news service Twitter, he accused the followers of wanting to lead a \"push against democracy\".
“When he calls out the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him,” said the oppositional Jasser Said.
“We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet softened, the Egyptian media cited the opposition politician Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that they would not want to monitor the referendum, which would invalidate it.
“The Qur’an is our constitution,
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood blew into the area demonstration, but was careful not on the Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other Nilufer in front of Cairo University.
Many veiled women and followers of the Salafists participated and cried: “The people are calling for the application of God’s law.
They demanded from Mursi: “Surves the country and said: “The Qur’an is our constitution”
A struggle for the highness over the symbolic Tahrir square, on which everything took its start, would probably have raised civil war-like conditions.
That obviously didn't want to risk it.
The Muslim brothers explained that both the opponents of the draft Constitution and the supporters of the Constitution would have expressed themselves loudly and clearly.
Now is the time to let the people in the Electoral Court decide in which direction the country should go.
A majority for the draft of Islamists is considered safe.
'The word human rights is not even present,
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry with this forced constitutional process, which would actually have gone until February and should have involved all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organisation (EOHR) defended the Muslim brothers when they were under Mubarak in prison or in court.
Not because he would share their view of the world, but because human rights are indivisible to him.

Rakfisk from Norway: Is this the worst fish in the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living - not only in Europe but all over the world.
Could the country’s success secret have something to do with the local appetite for quite bad-looking fish?
Take a selection of overripe cheese varieties.
They are placed in the midst of a bunch of dirty, damp sports clothes.
And get out of there for a week.
About this, one must imagine the wet - smelling smell of Rakfisk, one of Norway's major delicacys.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours away from Oslo.
There is snow here, spectacular landscapes - and this persistent smell in the air that just doesn't want to disappear.
Rakfisk is contaminated with salt, which - depending on how stinking one would like his fish - is fermented into water for up to a year.
When in Norway the darkness comes over the country and the weather gets colder, Norwegians stream to a feast here in Fernnes, which, now, really very impressive specialty is dedicated.
“You eat it raw and then rinse it down with a glass of Aquavit,” says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works in the local fire station, but is also organizing the festival as a so-called ‘rakfish general’.
Around us, people eat small fish cubes and take large amounts of alcohol to themselves.
“Some people like the Aquavit more than the Rakfisk,” said Havard.
The spirits can penetrate the smell.
I'm going to cost some chickens.
If you avoid approaching the Rakfisk in the nose, it is not bad - like Sushi, who has a pretty long bus ride behind them.
Rakfisk is the product of a completely different, much poorer Norwegian era, when there were no cooling options yet and fish was drowned in airtight salt water barrels in autumn.
In the deepest winter he was then taken out after long fermentation and, undoubtedly, consumed with alcohol-damaged senses.
Even a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and mainly migrated to the United States.
Today the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a thriving labour market, high wages and a comprehensive healthcare system.
Even from Sweden, the old rival, who was far richer than Norway not too long ago, immigrants flowed.
Rakfisk is regarded as something important - as an essential, though strictly smelling part of Norwegian history.
He's one of the more expensive dishes you can buy here.
But actually everything here is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs proud 10 euros.
Norway doesn't often get into the world press, and most people don't seem to bother it.
Here we still hate to name Anders Breivik - those racist right-wing extremists who shot 77 men, women and children last year.
Instead, we refer only to the ‘Occident of July 22nd’ incident.
Norwegians do hard to accept that someone in their peace-loving country is capable of such brutal murders.
Since the early 1970s, growth has been one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world.
“But oil is not the only reason why we’re so good at it,” says Anna, our waitress, who distributes round tablets with mature rake fish and embodies the Nordic ideal with her long blond hair and stiff blue eyes.
We are an - as they say - prudent people.
Her English is exactly like that of most people here.
We're not very inquisitive, we don't like prailing.
Norway has been very careful with its oil wealth - much of the industry's income will be invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
In the years leading up to the global economic crisis, when everyone was throwing money around them that they didn't even own, Norway was holding its wallet closed.
“As long as we can go skiing in winter and hike in summer, we’re happy,” Anna says.
“And, of course, eating rake fish, she adds with unsavoury laughter.
I stand in the snow and stand up for another dish - from Rakfisk I have enough.
Such an Elk-Burger is definitely a different thing.
But in the evening the stink fish is again on the menu.
The hotel where I am staying is one of several venues that organize a Rakfisk dinner where guests can vote for the best - or perhaps the most challenging - smells of fish.
There is a live TV setting to a showmaster dressed with fly, which is surrounded by plates with rake fish.
The spectacle resembles the Eurovision Song Contest.
\"What score do you have there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen,
\"Here are our points, Havard\"
You clap and laugh.
A man falls from his chair, possibly overwhelmed by the Aquavit.
But maybe it's the severe darkness of the whole fish.
Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto faces difficult start
While Mexico's future President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares for his accession to office, Will Grant of BBC analyses the challenges ahead of him and the mixed feelings of his people.
Traffic in Mexico City is currently very bad.
Even on better days this is an ever-stopped city, but on Monday a ring of steel was built, which locks several important routes to the capital and provides chaos on the streets.
However, the aim was not to disturb Pendler on the way to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new President Enrique Pena Nieto will be taking over the leadership of the nation.
He's facing a complex task.
Under the secluded government Felipe Calderon, Mexico has been able to survive economically well, but the country has been under the control of a drug war that has cost 60,000 lives over the past six years.
“My government is committed to reducing violence,” said Pena Nieto at the Oval Office to U.S. President Barack Obama at the beginning of this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this objective.
Before joining the U.S. President, Pena Nieto served as Governor of his home state of Mexico.
In this densely populated, vast part of the country that surrounds the capital, opinions about the new head of state are shared.
A direct man
In the remote town Valle del Bravo, for example, he is remembered.
Residents of the resort attribute to him the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure.
To reach the city, you can drive on one of the highways that had Pena Nieto built and that represented a great improvement over the rough, rough roads that once existed here.
Plakets with its name also hang outside a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
“We expect him to make real and ongoing changes, such as his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who works as Congressman for the Pena Nietos Party, who works PRI.
In particular, as regards security and economy, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country needs so urgently.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was replaced by Vicente Fox in 2000.
The Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the Presidential Palace of Los Pinos, the party has great expectations of Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejects the accusations of opposition, the new president lacks substance.
He was a very direct man, very committed and had great plans for the country.
He's an excellent statesman, but he's also a man who can listen.
But on the other side of the state, not many people share this view of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The place is hidden under highway crossings and in many ways represents a suburb of Mexico city itself.
And the problems in the community are of crucial urban nature.
At the beginning of this year, the military was deployed to combat drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
In one spot of Brachland near a large garbage dump, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left behind in the last two years alone.
During Governor Pena Nieto's term of office, over 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico - a statistic that even surpasses the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is notorious for its violence and murders of innocent women.
The critic Pena Nietos believes that he did not address the problem of women's murder properly during his term of office.
But in the worst case, his government closed its eyes to the problem.
In a concrete building, typical of the descendent quarter, Irinea Buendia fights with the tears as she shows me photos of her deceased daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the event, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes that she was murdered by her partner in life.
“When I arrived at her home, it seemed as if her body had been washed - Senora Buendia remembers.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the body bar was already in use.
While her mother tells her story, the wall looks down on us a picture of Mariana. It is next to a cross that bears a single word: justice.
But exactly this one, as the family said, has so far been denied her.
The authorities treated me as being a blackmailer, unsatisfied, Nörglerin.
They want you to accept their judgment and keep their mouth shut.
“But that’s not possible if there were so many form errors and failures,” she says.
When President Pena Nieto receives the President's bond on Saturday, he also takes on a great deal of responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been affected over the last six years by violent crimes, and the new President has promised to take particular care of this problem during his term of office.
“I hope he is as president as he was a governor,” says the PRI Congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza are most afraid.
The prosecutor claims that Bradley Manning did not complain about abuse
The prosecutors objected to Bradley Manning's accusations that he had been abused in prison.
The hearing deals with Manning's time in the military prison in Quantico, Virginia
The defence seeks to reject the charge due to harsh terms of detention
The freeman of the U.S. Army is accused of having released thousands of confidential documents
The prosecutors tried on Friday to find that the army-free Bradley Manning - charged with the greatest disclosure of confidential information of American history - failed several occasions to complain about the abuse he allegedly suffered in military custody.
In a cross-examination of Mannings during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Maj. Ashden Fein explained that documents on weekly visits by prison officials during Manning's nine-month detention period in Quantico, Virginia did not raise any complaints about his treatment.
A day before the cross-examination, which had been held by a defence application for the rejection of the charge - Manning had already been sufficiently punished by the harsh term of imprisonment - Manning had said he had considered suicide in prison.
The intelligence analyst of the U.S. Army, who was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service period in Iraq.
The material was then published by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed Manning as a source of information.
In the hearing on Friday, Fein went through with Manning the forms that officials had filled out after her meeting with Manning during his detention in the Quantico military prison, where he had been in prison from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officials asked Manning questions and wrote up his answers.
When Fein asked him about the forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he had judged the treatment by his guards as \"excellent\" and the treatment by the institution as \"very professional\".
The forms, according to Fein, contained no complaints about abuse, although the officials questioned Manning directly for his treatment.
Manning replied that he had expressed his concerns orally, and the officials had discussed it with him and indicated that they had not been logged.
“They wrote up (after discussing the concerns) “No problems,” and that didn’t necessarily mean that I didn’t say anything at all, so Manning.
The judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment when he met with a committee in January 2011 to examine the suicidal thoughts he had mentioned several months earlier on a form.
Manning replied that his intention during this meeting was to step down his observation status to avoid injuries.
The military said that it assigned him this restrictive status - one level under the threat of suicide - to his and the protection of others.
“I wanted to convince employees that I was doing well, and to get rid of the monitoring status for the prevention of injuries (...) in order to achieve a higher quality of life from my point of view,” Manning said.
Manning said on Thursday he was arrested and transferred to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to Quantico Marine Base in Virginia in July 2010.
He said that in Kuwait he considered suicide and once became unconscious because of the heat.
Not to know what happened to him or the outside world was burdensome.
“My world was shrinking on Camp Arafjon, on this cage together,” Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I'd die in this cage.
When he was transferred to Quantico, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society.
You only allowed him a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothes and his glasses.
Manning said he tried to stay in motion, because on the day it was forbidden to sleep or just to lie down.
Stets had to sleep with light, which ended from the outside into his cell.
If he turned at night and could not see his face, they would wake him up to turn back.
In January 2011, Manning's lawyer formally opposed Manning's treatment.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to the military prison of Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday, the judge also questioned Manning for an accusation he had made on Thursday - so he slept one night in his cell in Quantico and had to face guards and other prisoners naked at a morning count.
Manning had said that he had never had the opportunity to wrap himself around with his blanket during this count.
When asked on Friday, Manning stated that he had concluded from an order from his guard that he should drop the blanket with which he could have covered. However, he admitted that no one had asked him to do so.
On Thursday Manning had said that he was forced to sleep naked on the previous night. He had previously tried to show an official that he was no danger to himself.
Manning said to the official that he could have used the covenant of his underwear or flip-flops to hurt himself, but he did not.
That night, Manning said, his underwear, flip-flops and glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account his detention experiences and drastically reduce his level of imprisonment, he should be sentenced in his trial before the military court, which is scheduled for the beginning of next year.
The defense has stated that Manning will confess minor offenses for guilty, while other charges that are considered to be too extreme should be challenged.
The continuation of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend. A justification of the terms of detention is expected by the prosecutor.
The Pentagon remains in its position that Manning was held in accordance with the provisions applicable to all prisoners under the highest safety precautions in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include the favor of the enemy, illegal publication of intelligence information on the Internet, the transfer of national defence information and the theft of public property or documents.
If he is found guilty at all charges, he threatens a life sentence.
My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many people are forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to accuse immigrants - they call them hard times into memory, he says
Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and arrived at the passport check when there was no advice in me.
Signs refer to two queues: one for \"Mexicanos\" \"Mexicans\", another for \"Extranjeros\" \"Ausländer\"
I stood there for a few seconds, unsure of which I should go to.
I grew up in Central California and was called \"Mexicans\" all my life.
An ethnic shortcoming - just as my friends call themselves Boston Irish - or my friends in New York - Italian.
Later, I decided to “Mexican-American”
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home, there was no need for curds or ties.
I was just American.
I speak Spanish, at least well enough to assert myself in this language at both ends of an interview.
But I don't have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and I don't get rid of my American accent either.
So I took my American passport and put myself in the queue for Extranjeros.
I thought about that moment this week when the future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
The agenda included all the issues that are expected when the heads of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in talking about the growth of the Mexican economy. It is a reason why Mexicans remain in Mexico with the same probability today rather than moving to the United States.
He wants to connect with the United States and Canada and create a North American trading block in the European Union.
And Pena Nieto vowed to continue the war of Mexico against the drug cartels, even if he didn't mention any details about this.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resistance.
Most Americans probably never waste a single thought that the United States invaded Mexico in 1848 and forced the country's leadership under reserved rifles to leave them more than half of their territory.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries and not in minutes, memories of this event are not to be overlooked.
So as soon as a U.S. government official exercises only mildest criticism of Mexico, - in the Mexican press and among the country's elites - complaints are heard about how Americans are threatening the sovereignty of their neighboring country.
And the children of Montezumas are on the path of war.
And yet the biggest challenge facing Mexico lies in the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Want to talk about Resentiments?
There's more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. People for whom the country offers opportunities, and others for whom it does not.
The only reason why so many Mexican people live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at one point in our family tree a person - perhaps a parent or great parent - did not have a chance to move north in Mexico.
And in most cases this person corresponded to a profile - dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our faithfulness applies to them.
Not Mexico.
And even though we may now be living the American dream, attending good schools and getting good jobs, we must never lose sight of the American dream we are living - not the Mexican one.
Our identity may be blurred, but what concerns our loyalty is not the case.
This is clearly true of the United States.
Moreover, we are aware that many members of the Mexican leadership layer do not like us.
This is based on mutuality.
They see us as a memorial of a humiliating defeat and look down on us because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our band in Mexico will never be strong enough.
In your opinion, our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families had not failed in Mexico, they would not have gone.
And then we wouldn't see ourselves trapped behind the silk curtain - with a pleasant life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, born in Guadalajara and legally immigrated to the United States as a child, reminds me that tension exists between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans have a clearer idea about who they are - and Mexican Americans take this bad care of them.
While she is an American citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans I know have the feeling of belonging neither to one another nor to the other.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springstein.
You enjoy the best of both worlds, but none of them are rooted.
In Mexico we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States, we are seen as Mexicans.
As I should learn during my trip, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: some Mexican leaders and parts of education want to resume their connections to the diaspora.
They want to use Mexican Americans as provisional ambassadors for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues how great a visit to this country is and put pressure on the political leadership to intensify their ties to Mexico.
Well.
It won't happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And given the unfair distribution of income, unbridled corruption and drug violence, many of us are not at all so sure if it really is a great country.
I'm afraid you'll have to go alone, amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet willing to give up the United States for dealing with Mexico for a few and a half centuries, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans have a role to play in how their family members were treated not so long ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we are \"Mexican\" when I thought.
Old Fights, New Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected pillar of peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to choke such a hope in the germ.
In the midst of the usual debt allocations, countless buildings were laid in shelters and ashes, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed - and for the first time rockets from Gaza near the Israeli metropolis Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem were beaten.
However, although Israelis and Palestinians seem caught in their historical conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they want it or not - Palestinians and Israelis have become part of these vortices.
Maybe this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to assume that the fatal path situation could finally end.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance, in view of the current situation, optimism seems anything but appropriate.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on November 21st, this week's battles have strengthened the victims on both sides.
Hamas' leader, the Islamist movement, who has been controlling the Gaza Strip since 2007, is claimed to have pushed the Israelis back, even though his grouping had to record large losses.
Although several Hamas leaders are killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip are captured in one of the most desolate and densely populated corners of the planet, Israel has not yet succeeded in destroying Hamas.
In fact, Hamas in the West Bank is gaining control of Fatah by the rival, moderate Palestinian group.
And the Hamas leaders could conclude that they have time on their side.
Just as Islamists in the Arab world have gained influence, Hamas has been able to draw powerful and rich friends on their side.
Turkey, a resurgence, regional power once considered Israel's closest Muslim ally, has taken hold of the Hamas Party, just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Jubilative Hamas supporters believe that Israel is an Islamist half moon - from Lebanon to the north, where the militant Hezbollah has power, over Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamist form may stand before the overthrow of Bashar Assads, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And in particular the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt - the most remote and important Arab country - on the southern flank of Israel has changed the balance of the region sustainably.
Hosni Mubarak, the Latinist despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time left for Hamas.
In contrast, the brotherhood with Hamas has been weakened and its leaders are more dependent on popular views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could prove to be an actor who could not be pushed out even by Israel and the United States.
The Israeli hardliners, on the other hand, have a opposite conclusion.
Militaryly, Hamas is no longer a danger.
The Israeli missile defence system, \"Iron Dome\" has survived and many of the Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
At least for a while, Israel will be able to sleep more quietly.
In diplomatic terms, the United States is unshakable in its position, and many European countries have held Hamas responsible for the latest violent escalation.
Israel has done well in recent years, especially under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of suicides - not least thanks to the lock-in systems that have been introduced into the West Bank and thus into the main part of a possible Palestinian state. These continue to protect Jewish settlements, which have been declared illegal in the area of international law.
Netanyahu is well there. In the run-up to the elections on 22 January, his Likud party joined Avigdor Lieberman with an even more combative group.
Why do these backward-listed Palestinians also hide and leave their own state?
If they actually had control over the West Bank, would they not, like their fellow fighters in the Gaza Strip, fire rockets?
No, it's better to keep them in check behind the wall and punish them if they dare to lift the heads.
Maybe the hardliners will be able to get through, but the Arab Spring could take them through the bill.
Even if the Islamists, who are now in power in Egypt and in other countries, have little left for Israel, they will first focus on the difficulties in their own country.
The defense seat of Israel is larger than that of its four Arab neighbours.
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to restore their economy.
That pragmatic President Mursi met with Barack Obama to reach a ceasefire could be a promising sign - and perhaps symbolise the beginning of a new era.
Israelis should also think more long-term.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking considerable steps towards democratization, Palestinians are still deprived of their right to self-determination - a powdered book that will undoubtedly explode in the Israeli occupied areas one day, just as this week a bus exploded in Tel Aviv.
The oppression has already undermined democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population this situation will only be exacerbated.
Bloody missions to reduce Hamas in the Gaza Strip will increasingly demand their diplomatic tribute over the years.
Both sides need a pull from the outside
The correct answer is the one represented by the more reasonable representatives of both sides, the majority of the rest of the world, and by this paper: two states in which Israel departs for security purposes.
The hope for the near future is that the ceasefire will give outsiders more influence to enforce this solution.
Egypt must now, together with Turkey and Qatar, stop arms deliveries in the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever before to convince Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, supplemented by territory exchange and a common Jerusalem.
Foreign Arab nations should also bring Hamas and Fatah to an agreement.
This would do more for the creation of a Palestinian state than with the upcoming application for UN observer status.
Obama must also contribute his part to moving Israel to negotiate.
During his first term of office, he failed to imagine his own peace plan.
Far away in the white house, it seems as if he is also refusing to participate.
But that is a regrettable, short-sighted perspective.
The United States has a major interest in a stable Middle East.
And there is a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian laws on uniform cigarette packaging enter into force
Health warnings and diseased body parts on neutral green packs equal for all tobacco brands
The world's first laws on uniform cigarette and tobacco packaging have entered into force in Australia, replacing brand logos and colours with neutral, olive green covers that are also printed with drastic images that show sick body parts and children who are affected by cigarette smoke.
Apart from the different health warnings and pictures, Saturday is the only difference between the packages in the brand names printed in identical, small font.
Australia thus introduces the world's strictest regulations for tobacco packaging.
The Australian Federal Government wants to remove young people from smoking by eliminating the glamorous image of tobacco consumption.
In doing so, the government goes out of studies that have shown that people who have not yet started to smoke at 26 will not start with 99% more likely after that.
“You can already see at children’s young age that they understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to apply with their brand image,” says Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek. She cites studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and the changes will only slightly affect the profits of multinational corporations, other countries are already considering similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the laws.
So it was said that the laws would favour black market trade, leading to cheaper and more easily accessible cigarettes.
“The laws will lead to serious, unintended consequences,” says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian falsifiers will offer far greater quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.
Others, on the other hand, say that the laws have stimulated their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, notes that the demand for cigarette tuis and silicon blankets has increased enormously to cover the unsustainable packaging since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco had failed two months ago at the highest Australian Court with their indictment of the laws.
Zico sold up to 6,000 units of wholesale trade and waited for new stocks.
For us, this is a good business.
According to experts, the hook in popularity of social media lies with exactly the population group to which the plan is addressed.
A number of Australian laws have banned tobacco companies from TV advertising, prohibiting them from acting as sports sponsors, and forced most traders to stop putting cigarettes in stores. Now tobacco advertising is switched to the Internet.
The Australian government has banned Internet advertising by local companies and sites, but has no influence on international sites.
“Those who market tobacco and have only a small area left to apply for its products do not get around the internet,” says Becky Freeman, a health researcher at the University of Sydney.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman has noted an increase in experience reports on brands written by “very ordinary people”.
You have to ask yourself the question: is this just a private person who finds so great a favor in Marlboro cigarettes that they even record a video for it - or has a marketing agency to do with it?
British American Tobacco Australia says that instead of focusing on marketing, industry focuses on dealing with the new laws.
It has even gone so far as to pay the Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new regulations - those countries complain to the World Trade Organisation about unjust trade restrictions, although none of the countries have more trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected for mid-2013.
According to Plibersek, the government has conducted talks with other countries considering similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to prescribe photographic warnings in 2001.
Meanwhile, they have been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Harder laws are being considered in Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers show up in spite.
The pictures don't affect me.
I just ignore them.
“You just take a chicken and put the box away,” says Victor El Hage when buying a cigarette box, on which a photo with a mouth tumor is printed.
Frankly, there's only one reason I'd stop, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, operator of the tobacco trade “King of the Pack” in downtown Sydney, says that the uniform packaging made filling of its shelves difficult.
“I used to take an hour earlier to order a delivery, I now need four - says Yu.
\"The government should simply have banned cigarettes completely - then we would have said okay, that's it, we're close - he's clearly going to add obscenity.
In a constantly electrified world it is nice to be bored
This thank-giving I spent five hours in the airport unexpectedly, when our plane fell out due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane.
So I had enough time to get a few thoughts on boredom.
I don't want to lie.
Waiting half a day at the airport for a flight is quite annoying - even if books, magazines and iPhones (and, of course, tax-free shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and child development experts are leading boredom as something positive.
When it comes to them, it's okay for us and our children to be bored occasionally.
Thus, the brain is forced to lose itself in interesting ways of thinking, which may promote creativity.
And because most of us are almost constantly staring at one screen or another today, the benefits of boredom are no longer beneficial.
So should we welcome the boredom with open arms?
Yeah.
And no.
That's what I'm going to come back to.
Like many people, I have always assumed that boredom is a relatively current phenomenon that has developed with increasing leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of \"Boredom: A Lively History\" (Yale University Press, 2011) does not see that.
“In fact, boredom has a very long history, ” he says.
The house walls of Pompeii adorn a Latin graffiti over boredom, which dates back to the first century.
And then there is the question of how to define boredom.
According to John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom has been defined and discussed in many ways.
After a long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea in front of a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues concluded that boredom can be defined as the experience of wanting to perform a satisfactory activity but not be able to do so.
As a result, boredom differs from apathy in that the person is not employed but wants to be.
In the case of apathy, however, there is no urge to do something.
The key experience of boredom, he says, is in a “storage of attention process, paired with a bad mood and the feeling that time is only slow”
This can cause boredom almost as much as depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes that although these two conditions may be related, bored individuals see the problem in their surroundings or in the world, while depressed persons see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we believe that we are boring, even if we only have difficulty concentrating.
In her study \"The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention\" - to German for example: \"The inconvenient mind: The definition of boredom under the aspect of attention - which appeared in September in the journal \"Perspectives on Psychological Science\", Professor Eastwood and his colleagues point to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a volume on which a person would present a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud television program from the neighbouring area that had nothing to do with the content. Others heard it on low volume, so it was hardly perceptible, while the third group did not hear these sounds at all.
The people who heard the hardly audible television indicated that they felt more boredom than the two other groups - they had problems focusing on themselves, could not find a reason for this and attributed their difficulties to boredom.
When trying to focus on a difficult or challenging task, the disruption of attention can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, if you do a one-to-one job - like looking for faulty products on a factory conveyor belt, music can distract and help you not to feel bored -
In fact, he says, we now know that hermits and critters, often interpreted as signs of boredom, can even combat them by keeping individuals more physically attentive.
\"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to chat around are more likely to learn and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still, according to Professor Fenske.
We all get bored at some point - my delayed flight, a drooling speaker, a particularly tiring film.
But some people are more bored than others.
In order to measure these differences, researchers developed in the 1980s a scale of boredom,
On the scale there are statements like \"Many things I have to do, repeat and are monotonous\" and \"I have so many interests that I don't have enough time for everything\"
Using such scales, researchers have found that boys are often bored as girls, according to Stephen Vodanovich, Professor of Psychology at the University of West Florida - in particular, as regards the need for more and a greater variety of external stimuli.
But in general, teenagers are a rather tense bunch.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a pager.
He found that 32% of adults in school and doing homework were bored, whereas 23% indicated being bored if they were not in school.
However, only 3% of parents reported feeling bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he doesn't know if the percentages of boredom have increased or decreased.
However, he is sure that “youth is perceived as particularly boring, mainly because children and teenagers do not have a major impact on their everyday life.
So back to my question of origin: Is boredom healthy?
Sometimes it does not, because in extreme cases it causes people to take extreme physical risks and to fall away from gambling or drugs to alleviate them - this has shown studies.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors examine the relationship between boredom and creativity. This opinion is Professor Vodanovich, who has been exploring the subject for more than two decades.
“With boredom, the brain wants to say that one should do something else,” said Gary Marcus, Professor of Psychology at New York University.
But the brain doesn't always know what to do right now.
If you are bored and you use this energy to play and cook guitar, you will be happy.
However, television can create feelings of happiness in the short term, but they are fleeing in the long term.
So anyone who reaches an iPad for his bored child can take it away from boredom, but it has not learned to entertain or control himself, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds: “Self-control transfers from one situation to another,
The child not only learns to entertain, but also gets more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should celebrate boredom.
Nor should we see them too critical.
Instead, our goal should be to make us feel comfortable away from the ongoing activity and technology change.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
“It sounds as if we had to be more often bored, but boredom is the painful, incessant desire to do something meaningful,” he says.
He believes that people in truth are only looking for a way to turn off and relax.
“In an environment where we are constantly being overstimulated, it’s difficult to get busy once the noise is muted,
In Colorado there is no clear guideline for the new marijuana law
19-year-old Community College student and football player Anthony Orozco stands for a trial in south-eastern Colorado that will soon be legal in this state: possession of some less marijuana chunks and a pipe with which he smoked them.
According to Orozco, he and some friends were on a September day by car in Lamar near the border with Kansas when they were stopped.
After the police officer had found marijuana in the car, Orozco was charged for possession of drugs and drug utensils - cavalry offences, each with a fine of $100 - and received a trial term.
“We are treated like criminals,” Orozco says.
But is he one too?
In the uncertain weeks following the decision of the State to legalize small quantities of marijuana for their own use, the answer for hundreds of minor drug offences depends less on the law than on the site.
Hundreds of irregularities that revolve around marijuana are already being dropped here and in the state of Washington, who approved similar measures.
The police are no longer pursuing adults over 21 years of age for ownership to a small extent. This is permitted by law as soon as the new laws enter into force in the next few weeks.
But state lawyers in the more conservative districts of Colorado have announced that existing marijuana offences continue to be pursued and still cite people in court.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the Western Mountains, agree to prevent new, state-licensed marijuana shops from opening in their communities.
“This situation continues to develop so quickly that I don’t even know what will happen next,” says Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, east of Denver.
And regulatory authorities in the state of Washington are also rattling themselves in the head.
They are waiting for guidance to set up a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of drugs - and have a deadline until 1 December 2013.
In Washington, it is believed that Colorado is in any case the most prevalent state in terms of the regulation of marijuana, where the drug was only legalized for medical purposes and then for personal consumption.
“Colorado has a more regulated market. The state is therefore well suited for orientation,” says Brian E. Smith, spokesperson of the Supervisory Authority for Spirits in Washington State.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than serve in the sense of a rough guide.
“We have no real precedent to follow, he adds.
The Washington Act, referred to as I-502, will enter into force on 6 December, thus forming the endpoint of a grey zone in which the state licensing system does not yet exist, but the possession is legalized.
And unpleasant practical questions need to be clarified at this time - for example, how the state's requirement for \"adjusted access\" to licensed marijuana is to be agreed with the ban on cannabis transactions around 300 meters around schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities.
“Nowhere will it be harder to find a site for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle Balling Area, Ben Livingston, spokesperson for the “Center for Legal Cannabis” of a recently formed research group.
On November 21st, Chief Oates sent an e-mail to his staff in Aurora stating that the prosecutor would no longer pursue minor marijuana offences in persons over the age of 21 years, and that the police would, from now on, seek no criminal penalties for this offence.
Chief Oates added that the police would continue to enforce urban regulations on the regulation of medical marijuana producers and would continue to follow drug dealers.
In Weld County in the north of Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck represents a stricter view.
After the vote, he stated that his authority would continue to follow cases of marijuana possession, mainly to move consumers to withdrawal.
At present, 119 persons must be responsible for the possession of about 50 grams or less of marijuana before the court, although many have also been accused of other offences.
“Our authority has the duty to prosecute offences at the time of the offences,” said Buck in a statement.
The reactions are even ambiguous in places such as rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer show adults for the possession of small quantities.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to drop all pending ownership procedures.
“I don’t think I was was wasting my time trying to enforce the right until it changed,” he says.
Although 55% of the voters in Colorado supported the measure, it was clear from the outset that it would not be easy to reconcile the personal consumption of marijuana with the complexities of government and legal system.
And the contradictory reactions throughout the state fostered a profound division among local officials in terms of the great green experiment on days.
In the case of state lawyers, it is a \"cultural barrier\" says Sean McAllister, a law firm from Denver, who represents an accused in court for marijuana offences and acts on the spot as a spokesman for the national organisation for reforming marijuana laws.
“They have spent such a large part of their lives criminalizing people for the fact that they still cannot accept legalization,” he believes.
The first states to treat the smaller quantities of marijuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington are treated as national samples for the legalization of drugs.
While proponents and government officials prepare for an age of legal sales, they are at the same time nervously waiting for instructions from the federal government, which want to continue to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana as a criminal offence at federal level.
Advocates of the Legalisation Movement hope that the Ministry of Justice will give up.
Despite several outstanding arrests by consumers and sellers of medical marijuana, the Federal Government has largely allowed the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Kevin A. Sabet, former drug policy adviser to the Obama government, believes that while criminal officers are likely not to enter doors to attack smaller amounts of drugs, they are likely to stray, who are to tolerate legal, state-regulated marijuana business under the new legislation.
Several cities in Colorado do not wait for the federal authorities to act at all.
Even before the election day, some local municipal authorities approved moratoriums for new marijuana businesses, although they could only open in about a year.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the west, decided on a six-month ban that is likely to be adopted next week.
“We don’t want to get into a position where we license someone and then stand in front of a big problem at federal level,” says Bob Nicholson, member of the City Council.
Our community voted against this legislative amendment.
We judge for what the congregation has decided and not for what the state has decided.
Many questions are still open.
Petronella Wyatt: I was mobbled from Oxford because I'm Tory
Not only university students today are being attacked for their views
It has always been my greatest dream to get a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had attended the university I once held for the world's greatest mark of knowledge, for a modern Greek symposium that promoted the great pillars of civilization - free thinking and tolerance.
But within two weeks of my entry into Worscester College at the end of the 1980s - there I had intended to study history - I had packed my suitcase again and thus led the first scandal of my life.
My father broke into tears.
My friends were confused.
In the Evening Standard it was said that I had gone because I had a problem with the fact that comilitons had sex in the neighboring room.
The author A N Wilson said shelmically that I had left the university because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
The truth, however, was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yeah, ran because I suffered from systematic mobbing and threats.
Not because of my rather unusual name, or because I came from a private school.
I was only harassed for one reason - a reason which seemed so narrow and cruel in this supposed cradle of enlightenment: My late father Woodrow Wyatt was an important consultant Margaret Thatchers and I support the Conservative Party.
Why do I mention this right now?
Now, according to current reports, a new generation of students of moderate rights suffer from similar persecution.
The organized and increasing hatred of Tory students in Oxford has now developed such dimensions that a group of them last week demanded equal rights protection that benefits gays, disabled and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College state that they are “often actively isolated, personally attacked and declared undesirable due to their political views”
They call for a place on their college's equal rights committee to ensure that their opinions can be expressed freely.
Her situation was worsened by a recently broadcast documentary on political students at BBC Two, \"Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right\" which represented Tories as eccentrics and neonazis.
This was shown in, among other things, graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford Conservative Student Association of the University of Oxford, who drove in a Rolls-Royce and protruded with silver-coloured suit and silver-occupied walking stock.
At other universities conservative students say they are regarded as “sin blocks for the introduction of higher education fees”.
The 20-year-old Luke Black, Vice President of the Conservative Student Association of the University of Nottingham, reported in a Sunday newspaper: “There is a growing link trend in universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club, without even getting to know us.
Samuel Roberts, 21 and history student in Corpus Christi, who initiated the quest for greater protection, believes that such a climate is “unresponsive ” The 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, designated president of the Oxford Conservative Student Association, says that she observed a growing rejection of students of moderate rights among JCR members.
“This poses a danger to intellectual discourse and to the well-being of members,” she says.
In my first weeks in Oxford, I belonged to such a minority.
As an incredibly shy 18-year-old, I arrived in September 1986.
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its climax.
In the previous year, the University voted not to give Margaret Thatcher, a former student, an honorary title due to cuts in higher education.
The atmosphere would even have left Stalinists appalled.
In the first days of the first semester week, when new students get to know each other and the tutors, I received a taste of the future events.
I made the experience that the tutors not only tolerated the ridicule of Tory students but even took part in it with joy.
Political issues such as the mining strike, the privatisation and the rejection of the government of sanctions against the apartheid regime of South Africa found their way into the wooded rooms of the Tutorium.
At my first these events, I should have translated French texts from the 18th century into English. I had not been drawn on what was to come.
“Miss Wyatt,” said tutor Harry Pitt (now dead), “please translate the first paragraph,
I stuttered.
Pitt was a little man with a face like cake dough, and quite ugly.
“Do not hesitate to learn French, or are they just stupid,” he asked me.
The other students were kicking.
Tears opened up in my eyes.
“I suggest that they take a few French hours in your spare time - so, if you’re not too busy with your social activities - Pitt kissed me.
I returned to my room with a hanging head.
That evening, I was sitting in college alone at dinner, when someone easily tapped me on my shoulder.
It was an English student of the second year named James who presented himself as a member of the Conservative Student Association.
“I know who you are,” he kindly said.
Unfortunately, it's how it is.
Anyone who is suspected of being Tory will be forced.
It's bad enough for me, but they know that your father Margaret Thatcher is close, so it's gonna be worse for you.
Most Tory First semesters pretend to be supporters of the Labour Party.
In a local pub, I tried to adjust later.
I insisted that I was not in all points with Mrs. Thatcher.
This trick should prove unsuccessful.
A student in philosophy, politics, and economics, who had ironically attended Eton College as a conservative, said to me: “You are the daughter of a fascist pig,
You're dirty.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverse and dirty.
“How did Tories have sex, ” one asked.
They beat each other, don't they?
I felt the way homosexuals must have felt before the more liberal legislation of the United States.
Would I ever manage to live a normal life at Oxford University?
Would I only be able to meet like-minded people after the dawn of darkness?
Should I turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural inclinations?
The three years before me extended before my spiritual eye to a purgatory of awe and isolation.
The only tutor who openly recognized himself as Tory was Norman Stone, professor of contemporary history who had his seat in my college.
He was hated not only for being a conservative, but also for consulting thatcher in matters of foreign policy and writing speeches for them.
He was only rarely there.
He hated the place, found it provincial and small-carried and rejected it for his Marxist-deterministic history perspective.
In 1997, he accepted a professorship at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
“You won’t be happy here,” he told me.
I started to commute between Oxford and my parents' house and found refuge with more open friends and family members in the city.
My father told me I hated Oxford, and why I did it.
He seemed incredulous.
During his time in the 40s, all political views were accepted.
“But it’s the best place in the world,” he said.
They would never do anything like that, not in my city of dream tower peaks.
Even my communist friends always laid bare manners.
His moist eyes were drooping.
Give the whole thing a chance.
I'm sure you're just fucking.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance became weaker.
One of my male friends, as well as Tory supporters, had given up the pressure and denied his convictions.
During a tutorial in the following week, where another historian had seriously claimed that I was “an enemy of the people,” I decided to do the same.
Although I secretly broke up with shame, I admitted that my parents had given me a ‘brain wash’ and called it ‘old trottel’
The relief only took a short time.
It was my father who hit the last nail in my Oxford career.
At that time he wrote two columns a week in the Murdoch press.
My door was locked.
I hid myself in my room, and after five minutes my haters gave up.
When they went, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
I'm glad you can call me a wonderful slump.
But no 18-year-old should ever suffer in an educational institution under such intimidation and wickedness.
And even more tragic is that it was Oxford - a university that not only produced 14 Tory Prime Minister, but still hides itself behind an undeserved call of equality and freedom of thought.
\"Valentino prefers elegance of fame,
On the occasion of the exhibition \"Valentino - Master of Couture\" which was opened this week in London, ABC talks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian fashion maker.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of the accommodation of an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
This has been recognised by the designer at the opening of the “Valentino Master of Couture”, a magnificent retrospective for which more than 130 dresses of the Haute Couture have been put together, created by his “Maison” over the last 50 years.
“I love this palace,” he says with his distinctive Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose only protagonist is Garavani, but who could not have been written without his distinguished clientele.
Valentino has always experienced fascination with the sticky and distant world of the nobles.
In the first hall of this exhibition, which will be visible until March 3, there is a multitude of private letters and photos with the signature of the most retrievable aristocracy, starting from Princess Salimah Aga Khan, the Princess Marie Chantal from Greece and Margarita from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophys of his social rise from the modest fashion maker in the city of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international jet set.
Being in love with the nobility does not have to be of a disadvantage.
“At least they don’t step out their chickens on your magnificent carpet, as some beautiful celebrities from pop music do,” says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s the two lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
“We all rejoiced when we were invited to his house in Gstaad,” explains the ex-wife of “Heini” Thyssen, closely friends with forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnalli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of fame.
And yet he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress of Valentino
Even the Argentine model Valeria Mazza does not forget the charisma of the fashion maker.
Many years ago, after a fashion show at Piazza di Spagna in Rome, we went to his home for dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
Every detail of his apartment, decoration, food and music he recognized and felt his influence.
“All invited persons felt important and loved, remembering the “top model” that started their career at the week of Haute Couture in Paris in 1995.
“It never comes out of fashion because its designs are works of art,” she concludes..
A modern view of origin
The life of Garavani is not a story of freshness, rather of mutual affections.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House has been transformed into a glorious 60-metre walkway that offers a role-playing exchange: the user takes the model's place and walks along the trail to admire a dreamy audience wearing the masterpieces of Valentino, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristóteles Onassis, the costumes that Monica Vitti wore in \"La Notte\", or a coat of wool and leather that belonged to Emperor Farah Diba.
In this audience of fashion dolls, names such as those of Sibilla de Luxembourgo, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofía of Habsburg are shining.
Naty Abascal and the fashionmaker, 2006
Many of these customers say that the first Valentino is like the first love, \"unforgettable\"
I can still remember perfectly.
It was a pants, a shirt, a western type \"Gillette\" and a jacket from the autumn/winter collection 1971-1972.
“It was a gift from him,” says Naty Abascal, one of the designer’s museums.
“I draw him to all others because of his great love for women and because he highlights our beauty, adds the ex-Herzogin of Feria.
I like the colors he uses very much; they have lots of light and underline the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Even the princess and opinion leader at the fashion Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can't forget the first time she wore a Valentino.
When I was a teenager in Italy, I dreamed of finally having the age and the opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses...
It finally came to an end in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a party in the castle of my veteran, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with flying skirt and a draped upper part with a decolleté making its name honor.
“It was a real dream,” says Rodrigo d’Arenberg’s widow.
\"Valentino doesn't depend on fashion, his consciousness is timeless, explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between París, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess D'Arenberg keeps her evening dresses of the fashionmaker, with absolute care, \"because a dress is not only a dress, but also the memories associated with it\"
The \"King\" of Fashion
The large finale of the exhibition in Somerset House is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress for her wedding with Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 -ragazze - (as the fashionmaker called his close friends) were needed to make this ivory silk dress with beads, twelve different embroidery and a four-and-a-half-metre-long sweat.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the top authority of the professional press, this dress was a milestone in the Haute Couture at the end of the 20th century, \"the return to the customers of the top society\"
For years with the \"savoir-être\" trotting the elite, Valentino is now its best specimen.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest award in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded the honorary legion, cumulates as many honors as each of the husbands of his clients.
“I’ve always noticed his refinement, his calmness, his well-kept and perfect appearance,” D’Arenberg admits.
I saw him the last time a month ago at a gala dinner at the Museum de Orsay.
He sat at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
\"He was spotless; time doesn't leave any traces of him,
And this is what a princess says...
The most difficult profession in the world: the human working animals of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano are putting their lives and health into play when they carry 70 kilos of sulphur over the steep, rocky paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others work literally in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their lives by getting sulphur from Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, he has to climb down to the bottom of his crater every day, where the sulphur-bearing gas from the earth solidifies in contact with the air.
After breaking out large sulphur stones, which can weigh up to 70 kilos, he transports them into two bamboo baskets on his shoulders over the shooty paths of stone.
It is only 250 metres to the top of the volcano, which rises to an altitude of 2386 metres, but the exhausted carriers need more than 40 minutes for the rise at the turtle pace, maintaining balance and taking care of their steps so that they do not slip and crash.
They know that each step can cost their lives, as did a French tourist who crashed years ago on the steep slopes of the Kawah Ijen.
Kawah Ijen mining workers earn 5 Euro cents for each kilo of sulphur they reduce.
Arriving above, they walk the path between the tourists who photograph them like circus monkeys and run with the tiring heavy baskets three kilometers to the scale, which a mining company has set a little further down at an altitude of 1850 meters
The society is PT Candi Ngrimbi, which since 1960 exploits the phenomena in the volcano and (not better said) exploits its workers, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 Eurocents) for each kilo of sulphur.
This is then sold to the petrochemical industry for 10,000 rupees (83 Eurocents) each, because this mineral is widely used in everyday life for the production of string wood, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even bleaching sugar.
“Since we normally carry 70 kg, we get about 46,000 rupees (3.8 Euros) for every path,” explains Anto, who normally makes three routes a day.
For each route, it takes three hours, after which it is completely made, but at the end of the day it has 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros).
What looks like a miserable wage for such a rather inhuman effort, however, is the triple of what he would earn with the fieldwork.
“The daily wage of mine workers here, where the coffee harvest pays 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day, and the average monthly income is two million rupees (167 euros), is very high, explains the carrier who previously worked as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work was not as hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village nearby, for a reason as important as the sulphur in Indonesia: “I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought them to Java to convert them to Islam,
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are irritated because of the toxic gases.
The 27-year-old Anto has been playing his life at Kawah Ijen for three years, whose sulphur has already left the first traces with him, although he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases from the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay for reaching his dream.
“I will work here for two more years because I want to open a store or learn Spanish or French,” he promises in a more than acceptable English.
This sympathetic and intelligent young man, but punished by life, could work as a tourist guide, waiter or at the reception of a hotel, but instead he does the work of a tragedy.
He shares a dirty wooden hut with other wearers and stands up every morning at two o'clock, because the sulphur also flows out at night, where his characteristic yellow color shines blue in the darkness.
The shadow challenging, he climbs into the crater in the light of a small forehead lamp to his helmet, which he has bought from his own money.
About 400 carriers load the baskets with sulphur onto their shoulders on the crater floor.
Despite their large profits, the mining company has not mechanised the sulphur mining to save costs, and does not supply any equipment to the carriers who work on their own account and are paid by weight.
They also do not receive a share of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) supplement per camera device, which the guards of this nature park, along with the admission fee of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) from tourists who come to photograph the volcano and human tragedy.
“This work is for animals and not for humans,” protests Madrusin, a staunch 42-year-old carrier who has been working at Kawah Ijen for three decades since leaving school.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and assures that he continues, \"as long as it goes\", because he needs the money for the education of his three children between the ages of 10 and 18.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life.
Even if the sulphur burns the throat and itches the eyes, when the wind suddenly turns and the miner climbs into the thick columns rising from the crater, the men are so hard that no one complains about severe diseases ... of course, besides the usual respiratory problems, arthrosis, pain in the knees and bladders on the shoulders that have deformed from the weight of the baskets.
With the basket on its back, Unainik is only able to carry 50 kg with his 53 years.
Every day, he and his companions break 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which is transported from three trucks via a goat path between the bridge to the Tamansari camp in 18 kilometers away.
“I’m not going to retire, I’m going to die here because the volcano was my whole life,” Unainik explains, opening his mouth wide, missing some teeth.
Of his five children, the eldest works with his 30 years as a sulphur carrier.
The time goes by, but poverty keeps generation in one of the toughest professions in the world: those who work as human burdens at Kawah Ijen.
Singapore needs babies to save the economy
The Singaporeans blame for not having children, for the career, stress and cost of real estate and for the child's education.
\"The population of Singapore must grow,
I am a patriotic husband, You are my patriotic wife: We fulfill our civic obligation and we create life!
It seems unbelievable that the verses are part of an advertisement for mint vouchers, but nevertheless - or just for that reason - they became a viral video on YouTube at the beginning of this year in Singapore.
The sentences are part of a rapper song, the local proverbs such as, “Schieving will be a “bao” (laib) in the oven to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising company BBH, who has shot the video, has the hope that the advertising spot will come in a fun way to draw attention to the problem.
Her creative leader Douglas Hamilton says he wanted to use the power of music to get people to fulfill their \"national duty\".
This is only for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world when growing up, so we noticed that it was a topic we had to take care of.
We knew that the government had tried a lot, such as the marketing of perfumes with pheromones or the organization of speed dating evenings (fast flirts).
Perhaps many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily lead to success.
Therefore, we thought: why not make something as creative as possible to address this problem, such as composing a rap?
1.2 Children
Those who do not take this issue lightly are the Singapore government.
Each year, it spends $1,300 on political measures to encourage citizens to have more children.
A package of government grants for couples and parents up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But everything has had little success so far.
Singapore is a rich, highly technological city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its rulers and its strict social controls.
According to its national population authority, the birth rate is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time this rate was over 2 - which is also known as the replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why don't the Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director for Marriage and Family Policy of the National Population Authority, says that this is due to “better training and greater career opportunities.
“This has allowed people to marry except and to form a family to have significantly more options in terms of life goals and priorities,” she explains.
These changes in social circumstances have contributed to the higher number of single people and to the delay of marriage and births, the result of which is the reduction of the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, immigration policy aimed at a drastic increase in immigrations in order to counter the reduction of the population led to resentation among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where the barely-casted xenophobic blooms against many new immigrants, especially against the Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and not integrating themselves.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons for the fact that the Government Party in Singapore achieved its worst election result since independence last year.
Since the elections, an attempt has been made to correct the problem of higher contributions and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the drop in birth rate has the known impact on the economic growth of a nation that has tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore’s example also shows unexpected consequences.
The government tries to achieve that not so many small apartments are built.
It has already had an impact on the housing market.
The Urban Development Authority has begun to control the number of small apartments known as \"shoe boxes\" and may be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show a large sales success.
However, there is a concern that they can promote the lifestyle of the individual, and that they deter construction companies from building large homes for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director-General of the real estate company EL Developers, says that his shoe boxes can be sold much faster than larger housing units.
They are so popular, and the units are sold out for days and even weeks faster than the larger housing units.
This makes them much better for our cash flow.
He admits, however, that the new standards give developers clearer orientations to which previously obstacles were put in place if they wanted to build too many small housing units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
Even if these new rules could pave the way for an increase in the national birth rate, discussions with the Singaporeans working in the financial district would reveal that they will not have a major impact.
“People are very stressed, housing and education are expensive too, so it is pushed out by many - says a young manager.
The kids can get others.
“It’s important for me to have my own money and time,” says another man, about twenty years old.
Men and women lead their careers, stress and cost of ownership and education as reasons for not having children.
That is why the Singaporeans have the final word when it comes to getting children - the government can still do so much.
offline Private offline is online private
Privacy
According to the dictionary, this is the property of private or private life, where one has the right to protection from any type of interference,
What is private for someone under 16 years of age?
How is this definition applied to its everyday life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he faces when he makes known on the Internet situations that he would not share in real life?
El Periódico interviewed five young people between the ages of 10 and 15 who are often on the network.
In four of the cases, they linked the term to \"something very personal\" on the personal level and \"the password and the user\" when they applied it to social networks.
“My deepest secrets would not be announced in a post - says 10-year-old Jorge when trying to explain the meaning of “private” in websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
“These are very confidential secrets, my mother may know them, but not the whole world - he confirms.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or pictures of games.
I also spend my time with acquaintances.
“I wouldn’t share a photo that isn’t mine or someone who makes the stupid head,” he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong to publish obscenity photos, by naked people, by crime, or to write insulting or violent comments.
Jorge assures him to know 35 friends he has in FB and nine followers in Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
This includes the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I joined Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
“I don’t know if anyone answers me, I just load them up, ” he adds.
“The social networks are entertaining, I can talk to relatives in the distance or with friends quickly,” he says.
He replied that he would never accept an invitation from an unknown.
Even if someone recommended him a stranger, he would ignore it.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask he admits to not knowing 20 of the people he added to his friends list.
“That doesn’t scare me because we have something in common, for example music,” he admits.
According to the boy, no one made any sign of him or asked him for his address or phone number.
“If someone bothers me or asks for it from me, I simply remove it from my user account,” he admits.
José joined Ask after reading a recommendation in Twitter.
The boy's experience is not unknown, which is known today as cyberbullying.
The acquaintance of a friend was blackmailed in a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
“He never learned who it was, ” he assures.
According to José, the victim did not close the user account.
\"He only made it private,
Then he explains a series of steps to safely configure a user account.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yeah, I'd do that if he was unsympathetic to me or if I wanted to wipe him out.
“But I know this is cyberbullying,” he explains.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, teacher for English with university degree in education and learning, believes that in order to guide the children and adolescents, it must be understood that it is the purpose of social networks to inform.
“The Internet was created as a medium for searching for information; however, with the appearance of these pages, the rules of the game have changed,” she says.
Porras explains that the academic Marc Prensky, the owner of a Master's degree in pedagogy at Yale University and author of the work, Digital Natives and Immigrants, formed these terms for explaining the phenomenon.
The Digital Natives are them, the children and young people who grew up with this technology.
“We’re the digital immigrants to teach them where we’re still learning ourselves,” he says.
He explains that this is a complex issue, \"because we demand them to have a defined criterion of what may be disseminated, published or said, and that at an age where maturity is not sufficient for this,
“They should also be selective if it is most important for them to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences,” he adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and young people what privacy is, is to ask them questions that bring them to their minds.
“To say they shouldn’t do it, doesn’t work,” he says.
Porras then mentions some possibilities: there are things you wouldn't tell a stranger. Then why do you do it on the Internet?
Or: Would you like to have a photo published by you, like that published by a friend?
You know what the others are publishing about you?
Did you ask the other people for permission before when you labeled photos of celebrations?
And one more question: Do everyone need to know what you are doing at any moment?
Another point is to give them an understanding that they need to act online as they do it offline.
It's the same rules.
“Someone outside the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must apply to social networks,” he explains.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, elementary school teacher and educational consultant, comments that it is essential that parents carefully read the guidelines of social networks.
When they understand all sections, they have solid foundations to talk to their children about the importance of opening a user account on the Internet.
“For example, age, or what you may share or publish, he explains.
According to Guardia, children need to be reminded of the lesson “You shouldn’t talk to strangers.”
Conclusion of the Unasur Summit without publication of the Lima Declaration
The 6th Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without publication of the Lima Declaration, which was announced before and should theoretically be signed by the seven governments present.
Efe repeatedly tried to gain access to the signed document at the VI. Orderly meeting of the Heads of State and Government of Unasur. Sources in the State and Presidential Office initially announced that they would hand it over after the clause, but then declared that it would be published at some time on the website of the Peruvian Government.
On questions relating to the text, they stated that the content was presented to the press by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala.
Journalists' access to information about the summit was limited at any time.
During the day, only the picture of the presidential meeting without sound was transmitted in the pressroom with the announcement of “private session, restricted audio”.
The few information circulated among journalists was received by the press speakers of some of the governments present at the Unasur meeting, but not by the Peruvian press spokesman.
The only document that was distributed during the day was the list of participating presidents, which caused discomfort among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who requested more information.
Afterwards, the President of Peru sent the media an e-mail with the \"Declaration of Conclusion\" of the Summit, but it was the Declaration of Humala and not the official document to conclude the summit.
Last October Peru was host of the IIIrd Summit of South America - Arab States (ASPA), and despite the press's strong call, the so-called Lima Declaration, which was previously announced, was not published.
On the official ASPA website you can be convinced that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities stressed that the information systems would be available to journalists, but they restricted access to information to a large extent.
The summit also ended with Chile and Peru's joint commitment to adopt a judgment of the Court of Justice of The Hague which establishes a border conflict between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would take the decision of the IGH, which begins on Monday in The Hague, in the process of initiating Lima against Santiago to listen to the pleas of both sides.
“We will follow and execute the judgment on the differences we present to this international Court at present,” said Humala, along with his Chilean counterpart.
“Chile was, is and remains a country that adheres to international laws, seeks peaceful solutions to disputes, concludes agreements and subjugates the international courthouses, adds Piñera and greets Humala with a handshake in front of the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of both presidents that they would submit to the IGH took place after Colombia had brought an action against the Bogotá Convention after a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which it considered to be a serious mistake, in which it agreed to submit to the judgments of this international court.
At the summit, the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner were present.
Paraguay, which has been excluded from the Unasur since 2011, did not participate in the meeting since the resignation of its President Fernando Lugo.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, opened the talks in the morning and ended the summit shortly after lunchtime in Lima.
The Head of State closed the closing document, stating that 16 decisions were made and that the lines of action for 31 projects between the South American countries were set by a total investment amount of 17 billion dollars.
To the decisions taken, he said that the countries of Unasur will take significant steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship, to which we extend the decisions on residence rights,
It announced that measures would be taken to \"improve cooperation in the fight against insecurity in cities and against organised, cross-border crime, as well as measures to improve access to drugs and the Internet at low prices in all areas of South America and to act jointly and efficiently in the event of natural disasters,
With the crisis in Europe, “economic consolidation (in Latin America) is not allowed to take on a trifling train, but is intended to extend our production performance and to show our people a better future.
“We have decided to give priority to a number of 31 emblematic projects aimed at improving the spatial connections in South America and especially in rural and border areas...and thus unite our countries and develop new economic forms,” said the Peruvian President in a read statement.
Among these projects would also be five Peruvians lying on the cross-axles of his area from the coast to Brazil, and two of which would ensure a better connection with Ecuador, although he did not give further details.
The final document also referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
“We hope that the election process in this country will serve to resumption it in the Union of South American Nations, of which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to continue to remain an integrated region for prosperity and peace and good neighbourly relations was another aspect highlighted at the summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, before his participation in the regional meeting, said that he was expecting a meeting on Saturday in Mexico with his counterpart of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, to deal respectfully with the maritime conflict after a judgment of the IGH in question by Bogotá.
“Maybe I’ll meet with President Daniel Ortega on the morning (Saturday),” Santos said.
\"We will review all these ways - they are not exclusive, and the Nicaragua agreement also makes talks with Nicaragua necessary - he stressed.
“I hope that President Ortega will be able to say that we will deal with this matter as civilised and respectful as possible,” added Santos.
Santos and Ortega would meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they intend to be present at the office of the new president of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
As part of the Summit, the Secretary of Defense of the Block for the adoption of the Action Plan for 2013 was also meeting in advance, which aims to strengthen dialogue and consensus on the defence of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of the UNASUR even though the latter country is currently excluded.
Peru has the Presidency at the time of the regional block.
“South America must learn to integrate its citizens,” says Rafael Correa.
Today, the President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal whereby \"South America can actually learn something from Europe\"
Correa, who attended the 6th Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which took place in Lima, explained to the state television in Peru that Europeans were “in the second world war and in other disputes, and are now practically a father country”
In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship that would advance the member states of the Unasur.
\"The free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries must be achieved, as is already the case in the Andean Community; however, there are reactionary sectors that seek to return to the past, he warned.
The President of Ecuador also supported the reform of the Organization of American States (OEA) under the directive to reduce the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and to take into account those who have signed the San José Convention on Human Rights.
Those who teach never commit themselves to anything, and in return, we always sign the South American everything.
“It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has its headquarters in Washington and is funded by the United States,” he explained as a reference to the political asylum that Ecuador has granted to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa assured him that he did not regret this decision because it did not betray his principles but fulfilled his \"deep democratic values and views on human rights\".
He added that at the time, there had been ‘founded assumptions that Assange would be delivered to a third country and that his proceedings would not be complied with,
He also criticized the Swedish judiciary, which he demanded to interrogate him in his area of state for an alleged sexual offence, while \"the Swedish case law allows this by means of a video conference that could have been carried out on Ecuador's Embassy in London,
Correa explained that the danger was that the health and mental condition of Assange would be affected.
\"Since he is in our message, I have not spoken to him, but the ambassador has informed me that he has a slight problem with the lungs, but not a serious one - said Ecuador's head of state.
However, there was a risk that he would take physical and mental harm because he was trapped in a tight space and could not perform physical exercises outdoors.
“This would affect the health of every human being,” he added.
Correa stated that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange since June in Ecuador's Embassy in London was the granting of a free letter, with which he could travel to Ecuador, and that this was in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe. He stressed that there had been talks with London to find a solution for the imprisoned founder of WikiLeaks.
We are not dealing with human rights, we do not use this word in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
\"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the European legal authorities , because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, has a number of proceedings on various European instances\", he said.
And, in my opinion, \"when the United Kingdom grants this free letter tomorrow, this is done\"
And if Sweden interrogated Mr. Assange on Ecuador's Embassy in London or Skype, how it allowed the Swedish case-law and was made in other cases, the problem would be solved.
Correa took advantage of the opportunity to confirm himself as a defender of freedom of the press and said that what he did not tolerate is the mediocreness, the evil intent and the lies that detracted from the free expression of opinion,
“The biggest enemies of freedom of the press are not the evil and perverse politicians, but bad journalists who strive for profit and extortion,” he said.
In this sense, he was pleased that Ecuador was no longer dominated by such journalists, nor by the bankers or hegemonic and spy-bourgeois countries, and was presuming that in a re-election, he would deepen the revolution in order to continue the path in this right direction,
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur at least up to its next elections, arguing that the organism must remain “hard and must not give up opportunism and no rule of law as a legally dressed state, because it “was destroyed by the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay”
The President of Ecuador also holds the wish of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the ruling of the International Court of The Hague, which gave the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua the advantage of negotiating with Nicaragua the sea-law borders between the two countries, to \"absolutely\"
At present, this judgment is not implemented.
It is a problem between a South and a Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the pursuit of a common path.
They must be treated extensively so that they can be overcome and looked forward.
He also relied on a good conclusion of the disputes over the sea borders between Peru and Chile before the same Court of Justice and said that \"it is right for Latin America to call on international authorities if both countries commit to adopting the judgment, even if it is very difficult to do so,
With regard to the possibility that he will be a candidate for the next presidential elections in Ecuador in order to succeed in his third term, he stated that he sees this opportunity, with much optimism and joy, although sometimes it is very difficult to do so,
Correa assured that if he left the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life.
Power has never been interested in me personally, but under such unjust circumstances as in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
“My political movement had the belief that it was me who guaranteed this probable victory, so I have to fulfill this responsibility,” he said.
If I should win, it would be my last period as president, after which I withdraw from public life.
This also applies if we lose.
“That’s what he said.
Correa also referred to the treatment of the health problems of the president of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I just spoke to Venezuela's vice president, Nicolás Maduro, who told me that he had traveled there for a planned routine treatment, and that he would expect to be able to travel back to Cuba after the election campaign.
\"In no case does it mean a relapse in the health status of President Chávez, he commented.
Today, the Ecuadorian Head of State participated in the 6th Summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with the call for greater regional integration to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
Cause of death due to AIDS is a late detection today
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed the results: HIV positive.
“It was as if a bomb hit in,” he says about the moment he received the diagnosis that the doctor was trying to “smooth off” without any discerning success.
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to inform himself about it; and this with such commitment that he just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the Civil de Guadalajara Hospital (HCG), in which he came after several battles in 1994.
Fabrizio has been living with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was difficult to imagine in the early 1990s when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigmata.
At that time, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoids saying goodbye, \"because it led to a dead end\"
At the time, AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today it is possible to survive this syndrome even with quality of life.
However, many people still come to the clinic, who do not know anything about their illness, where the virus has already caused damage and exhausted their immune system, and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, i.e. after the first reported cases, “the great success today means that the survival of a patient who is receiving treatment in time and the survival of the general population is exactly the same,” explained the head of the HIV unit of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, stating that this information was based on a well-known scientific publication in April of this year.
The expert on infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, the scientists have concluded that AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of impairment of the immune system of the individuals at the beginning of treatment, and that those greater chances that are not drug-dependent: up to 30 years at a rate of 200 CD4 and 50 years at a rate of 500 CD4.
Simply put, the above statements mean that those who receive the diagnosis HIV positive at the age of 25 can, in this sense, become “problemless 75 years old, as long as it is under control,” explained this expert.
In order to be able to correct this progress, it must be remembered that the life expectancy of the Mexicans today is an average of 76 years.
Even if mortality has significantly decreased in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people who die of AIDS has decreased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (annual report of ONUSIDA), it is nevertheless correct that 60 percent of patients in the national database have died since the appearance of AIDS.
Jalisco alone killed 255 people in 2011 and by May of this year there are already 187 deaths; however, it is assured that there has been universal access to antiretroviral medicines since 2005.
So why are people still dying?
In my opinion, the problem is not access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and so is in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years, we have not had any medical care problems. The problem is that people come in a very advanced state because they do not know their infection condition, i.e. in very late stages of the disease.
He makes a striking statement: “Nine out of ten patients come to us if they already have an accompanying infection. In order to be able to influence global mortality, more early diagnoses are needed, so that all persons in need of this are given massive detection tests,
This proposal is agreed by the experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (State Committee on AIDS prevention in Jalisco) and also by patients such as Fabrizio, who carried out his test at a private laboratory, and for the only reason that it had made a friend of him who, despite his young age, was already in the AIDS phase and even had the caposi sarcoma (a cancer-like tumor), which is one of the usual complications.
Everything's different if you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die, and they don't want to hear anything.
“If I have to die already, I’d rather place three times in my case.
The change was to improve, I feed myself well, drive sports and take the drugs.
Today his parents only know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like everyone else.
“I work, do a lot, have an active but responsible sex life, I pay attention to my health and that of the other person,” says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO in order to animate with his testimony those who are afraid today in the context of the world’s AIDS day.
They should take the test if they belong to the risk group. The sooner they know whether they are HIV positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live responsibly like all people.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condome behind the charging table
Between the health programs and the simple citizen there are big holes, explains Ricardo Salazar, journalist from Guadalajara, who has accepted the issue of HIV.
And the most important thing is prevention.
In these places, \"the distribution of condoms was actually increased; earlier they were released individually, now they give us packages with a hundred pieces, which is good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom - he said.
Young people are at risk for new infections.
“What you need is a widespread mock question of social workers, guidance staff in schools, employees in pharmacies and in the health care system who do not want to be exposed to adolescents, the correspondent insured.
He suggested reorientation of this inefficient distribution; the condoms should not only be behind the charging table, but also in public toilets of facilities frequently visited by young people.
It should not be promoted promiscuity.
They are not to be paid the beer and motel, as Governor Emilio González replied to the question of whether it would be reserved under his administration.
“Sexuality does not look like this; it is best to bring the condoms closer to those who are already engaged in sexual activity,” he said.
Key data from Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is located nationally at 4th place of new and cumulated AIDS cases, and 13th place in relation to HIV.
92% of cases of infection occur via sexual intercourse, 6% via blood and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV because there are 4 or 5 people for each registered case who do not know.
After the U.S. Court of Appeal has confirmed a judgment that does not recognise the restructuring of the Vitro Group's liabilities, which has been achieved through a trade bankruptcy in Mexico, an ominous precedent is created for each national company with offices in the neighbouring country that has a problem of payment.
It could be said, then, that the procedures for the survival of the companies which allow Mexican laws are not valid in the country of the stars and stripes contrary to international agreements.
In practice, the recognition of the judgment received on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale at the court in Bancarrotas for the northern district in Texas leads to the fact that the Mexican companies are helplessly exposed to the seizure of their property beyond the river Bravo.
However, the decision opens the door and gate to the largest glass producer in Mexico to appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States because of three inconsistencies.
While the judge of the case points out that the creditors must be subject to the bankruptcy law of the United States, the Fifth Circuit Appeal Court, based in New Orleans, first says that the main proceedings are the trade bankruptcy dealt with in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation is not known in procedures for the non-payment of companies with a cross-border profile.
In fact, for this purpose, the United Nations Model Law was created for the unification of international trade law, and the American Law Institute was used as a slicker.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the votes of the companies after recognition of the liabilities in the bankruptcy mass that the branches of Vitro had with their parent company, the necessary majority would not have been reached for the restructuring of the liabilities.
However, this possibility is recognized by the Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case in which this scheme has been approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities have been confirmed by companies of the Group of the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles (Federal Institute for Trade Competitions).
It is also correct that, after withdrawal of the votes of the branches, the creditors of Vitro, the creditors who complained against Vitro in the courts of the United States, i.e. the Geier funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, had not reached a majority.
The vote would have taken 45 per cent against 37 per cent.
This is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro is blamed for its difficult situation in 2008 as part of the major economic crisis in the United States, which struck the country.
For this reason, the González Sada family objected to the same court of appeal so that the vote would take place in plenary, i.e. by all judges, because only three of them voted.
If this is not accepted, the Cerciorare opposition, which calls for the review of the proceedings by a higher authority, shall in this case be filed by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The seriousness of this case is that the Court left aside a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the Figura amicus curiae (friend of the court), in which the proceedings carried out by Vitro are described under the Law on Commercial Concourses, and in which it is pointed out that it had strictly adhered to the agreements signed by both countries in order to comply with Chapter 15 of the Competition Act of the United States.
It is also pointed out that the country has submitted itself to the principles of the United Nations Commission on international trade, i.e. to the rules laid down for cases of cross-border non-payment guaranteeing the equality of debtors and creditors.
Two-banded carambole: one blow for Vitro and for the country.
General balance sheet
After the advertisements by the Mexican Air Transport Trade Unions against the former owner Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent administration, did not come forward for several months, the Asociación Sindical de Pilotos Avidores (the Trade Union of Pilots) finally made progress.
The request made by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has now filed a criminal proceedings against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is being accused of the disability of the judiciary.
After that, the Supervisory Authority has systematically refused to inform the main administration of the Republic of a transaction carried out by the entrepreneur in order to deduct from Bank IXE's F/589 trust account to the name Mexicana de Aviación 198 million pesos.
These funds were used to acquire shares of the Administradora Professional de Hoteles (the professional hotel administration).
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Dragon Mart is surrounded by
A group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of bourgeois society have decided to create a broad front in order to resist the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún at a meeting on the weekend at a forum of the University of the Caribbean.
As you know, we speak of a huge sales and sales center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the country beyond the wall, supplemented by a living area for the employees of 150 companies.
In advance, the Canacintra (the national chamber of processing industries) has reached to unite the governors in the southeast in order to resist the monumental establishment that partially destroyed protected areas and constitutes the mother of all the threats of the industry.
ACTA is dead
Because the government has signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, which is known under the English abbreviation ACTA, under the terms and circumstances of the Mexican Ambassador in Japan, the matter has already been archived in accordance with the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property.
As you know, these measures took place, although the Senate had taken the opportunity out of consideration because it viewed them as a violation of free expression of opinion in the social networks.
Homex long term
In an effort to pay long-term liabilities without affecting short-term liabilities, the construction company Homex brings stock exchange certificates to the market for over 500 million pesos.
The issue is the first of four equal emissions, which promise an interest payment every 28 days.
Establishment of Competival
Established by NYCE, e-Quáility and Kernet, leading companies in information technology, a group of companies was founded under the name of Competival, whose goal is the service market of software clusters in Central and South America.
The investment in question is over $1.5 billion.
Hetin-Reyes: \"Basketball was my life\"
The world boomer of basketball, Héctor Hetin Reyes, was connected to basket sports for more than 60 years and has traveled the whole world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a large spiritual collection of the history of the country's basketball like Héctor-Hetin-Reyes.
Before being tied to the wheelchair by a strike in 2008, Rexes was part of this sport for 6 years, whether as a player of lower classes, player of the first national league, Plenipotentiary and leader in the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or president of the basketball association.
“For my life, I had many hats in basketball, even several at the same time, when I was president of the BSN, head of the national team and president of the association in the 90s, Reyes remembered him at home in Bayamón when he visited Primera Hora, where he lived with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
\"Basketball was my life\"
Reyes does not exaggerate with this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated with photos and memories of his long career and witness them.
Bayamón in the heart
The most emotional memories are those that recall his time with the Vaqueros from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, where he celebrated his 15-year anniversary as co-manager or CEO of the club.
“These were my best years, which I enjoyed most, because I was allowed to be part of eight Vaqueros championships since 1967 as managing director, co-manager or coach.
There were many fulfilling years, including the five championships between 1971 and 1975.
And then I agreed with a championship in 1981, the year of the debut of Jerome Mincy at BSN.
From then on, \"Cuco\" took over Ortiz, who was a very good administrator, says Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who worked here as a coach and was employed at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), saying, \"I have a very powerful and 2 m big player.
If you want him,
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartov then recommended the free throw specialist Raymond Gausse, who had become a citizen and was one of our best throwers.
I remember, as he said, that if Mincy had enabled a championship for Bayamon, Gause would have taken care of another one.
The championship of the Vaqueros with Gausse was awarded to him, but already out of a distance because he was already at the top of the association in 1988.
At that time he preferred to enjoy his executions and those of Mincy in the national team.
I remember winning the U.S. for the first time in the Vorolympian tournament in Mexico.
After that came the 1990 World Championship, where we took fourth place, which would actually be bronze, if not this Canadian arbitrator, who would have let us repeat the last move for the second time, said Reyes.
Was this group of the 1990 World Championship the best national team you've ever seen?
She is one of the best, as is the one who won against the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
My favorite, however, is the team of the 1991 Pan-American games in Cuba, where we won gold and offered a fight to the US team, as they did when they won us at the Bronze World Cup.
Not only were Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and Piculín (Ortiz) again there, but also the young players (Javier) -Toñito - Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario -Quijote - Morales, who were unable to attend because of a knee injury in 1990.
A team that may not have been the best in terms of personalities, but with which we won a gold medal and which gave us great joy was that of the 1995 Vorolympian tournament in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players such as \"Canito\" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a replacement for the blocked players because of the events on the Pan-American games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal against every prognosis.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
This was no doubt Piculín Ortiz.
His figures at the international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level as much as Piculín.
And this, without taking into account his career in the various leagues in which he played.
Who was the best coach from Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult question.
We had a number of good trainers like Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
I like Leo Arill's work.
What do you think is the best thing you've achieved in the association?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, which included the BSN in the early 1990s up to 17 teams in a season.
What else can you do?
There are things I would have introduced, such as the regionalisation of the lower categories.
That the boys play in Ponce, for example, only in their territory and only meet in the national playoffs on teams from other corners of the island.
Today the children make unnecessary many trips and games.
At least I see the result of the required trainings and courses for trainers, table officials and arbitrators.
I'm proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I like to listen to music, see videos of music of my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally I go to a basketball game.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always on my side.
Larry Hagman is dead
Larry Hagman was born on 21 September 1931 in Forth Worth (Texas) and became famous worldwide with his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as \"J.R.\" in the television series \"Dallas\" where he played a selfless, insidious and manipulating businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series \"Dallas\" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, is dead.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of \"Dallas\", died on Friday afternoon due to cancer complications according to a family press release to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer of \"Dallas\"
“Larry was back in his beloved birthplace Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role he liked most,” the family said.
The Larry family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the celebrations of the harvest thanks festival.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original and subsequent series, was with Hagman when he died in the Dallas hospital, said her journalist Jeffrey Lane.
He made all the joy he knew.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much.
“He was an original person and lived life in full swings,” said Gray in a message.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992, and he admitted that he drank a lot over years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was detected in his liver, and he underwent transplantation.
In the years leading up to Dallas, Hagman became known on television as a nicer guy in 1965 to 1970 with the sitcom-bechanting Jeannie, the NBC TV station.
There he played the astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is put on his head when he met an attractive \"Dschinn\" (played by Barbara Eden) who will live at home with him.
He was also a performer of two comedies, which were broadcast only a short time, such as The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His cinema works included well-evaluated roles of criticism in The Group, Harry and Tonto, and Primary Colors.
But it was his masterful interpretation of the enchantingly repugnant J.R. that made Hagman a superstar.
The dramatic series of the CBS television chain on the Ewing clan and other figures in its vicinity was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertising claim “Who shot J.R.” that should create expectation for an episode full of emotions where Hagmann’s figure was almost killed led to an international speculation, and millions of dollars were put in bets.
This led to the series reaching a viewer record in that time.
When the answer was known in a chapter in November 1990, it was seen by an average of 41 million viewers who had turned “Dallas” into the second most seen entertainment program since the end of “MASH” in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was Kristin, the brother-in-law of J.R. (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who had shot.
J.R. had smitten her and threatened to present her as a prostitute if she did not leave the city, but others also had reasons for wanting to see him dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of Ewing as a corrupt, insatiable man with a charismatic smile: a late businessman and unfaithful husband who sought to introduce his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
“I know what to do on the tombstone of J.R.,” Hagman said in 1988.
It should be called \"Here the honorable citizen J.R. Ewing\"
This is the only business he has not won.
Victoria Principal, co-player of the original series, remembered Hagman on Friday as an “enormous personality on and outside the screen”
He is unforgettable and irreplaceable to millions of worshipers in the world and remains with us, who are happy to know and love him, preserved in our hearts.
Ten episodes of the new edition of \"Dallas\" were broadcast a few months ago with great success in the TNT TV channel.
The recording of five chapters for the second season was completed, and a sixth chapter was just shot, informed the transmitter.
By Warner or TNT, there was no immediate explanation as to how Hagmann's loss would be dealt with in the series.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who played classic works such as \"South Pacific\" and \"Peter Pan\".
Martin was still a teenager when she got Larry during her marriage with lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck at the theater stage in New York in the early 1950s, after which he served in the Air Forces in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met the young designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities live.
In 2001 he titled his memoirs \"Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life\"
“I didn’t write anything that I believed would harm someone or affect him in any way,” said the Associated Press of his time.
After liver transplantation, he applied for liver donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist fearful patients.
“I advise them, give them courage, I meet with them when their operations are imminent and then afterwards,” he explained in 1996.
I want to give them some comfort, such as \"no fear, it's a little uncomfortable the first time, but it's going to go well for you\"
He also opposed smoking and participated in several campaigns.
Start of the courses that study the “End of the World”
Each week, students investigate apocalyptic issues such as nuclear war, zombies, virus and germ and global warming.
Every semester, when the professor of religion decided to take a course about the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible fishing hook: the end of the long retelling of the Mayan calendar on December 21, many people believed that it meant the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what to expect him in the following two months: the destructive hurricane Sandy, which some have called “Deudarmaggedon”, as well as a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christian theorists believe that the Apocalypse begins.
“I didn’t notice that this will be the most apocalyptic semester ever,” said Charmé this week to students at the University of Rutgers-Camden (New Jersey).
If someone analyzes what is occurring in the world today as if we were thirty days away from it, this would be a really good period.
And he reminds us that the bad is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only professor who offers courses on the “end of the world” this semester, which should actually be the last in history.
In Temple, Professor Barry Vacker gives the course of media, culture and the end of the world.
Each week, students investigate apocalyptic issues such as nuclear war, zombies, virus and germ and global warming.
“We’re analyzing why these ideas spread over time,” he said, as well as the way hypothetical scenarios are offered that lead to a specific human behavior.
For example, if nuclear material came into the hands of terrorists, a war could break out.
This month students analyzed films with apocalyptic content and examined how they could compare to real life.
“I have tried to inform the students about what is possible, likely, credible and impossible,” said Vacker.
At the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, the professor of Latin American history Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, a associate professor of art history and anthropology, formed a team to offer a course with the simple term \"The End of the World\".
“We don’t record 2012 in order to keep up with the option of resuming the course, in case the world doesn’t go down - said Restall.
In spite of the above, students need to study, create projects and participate in final examinations.
In Penn State the final examination will be carried out on the eve of the Apocalypse, which is why students have no other chance to continue their work than, until the night when the world is supposed to end, Restall said.
The courses were very popular.
“In two hours, there were no more places, ” said Restall about his high-average student course, which was filled with 35 students.
Weeks before the start of the semester, we received e-mails from students who asked if there were still places free.
The students, on the other hand, assure that the course is among the interested.
“It’s fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves,” said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Rutgers-Camden for religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sect or religious mentality is actually only a question of comfort or its lack.
The 25-year-old student Will Wekesa for psychology and health care explains that she has seen all apocalyptic films.
“I never heard of a lesson where this is taught, ” he stated.
I enjoy it.
But none of the students interviewed - and less still a professor - declared to believe in the last date of December 21st.
“Our first project dealt with the Mayas’ prophecy, and we discredited them in certain ways,” said Julie Zehlen, a student in Temple last year, 21 years old and West Chester.
The Maya never predicted the end of the world; it is only a key point in the calendar, said Restall.
However, he notes that in Western society there is an apocalyptic fear that leads back several centuries when people responded to changes in their surroundings with the prediction of the end of the world.
The Internet has increased these speculations.
“Other places people don’t think so,” he says.
This is mainly the case in the English speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who teaches in the Philippines this year, quickly answers the question of whether he would know a course there about the “end of the world. ”
“The Philippines does not participate at the end of the world,” he wrote as an indication of an exception to a higher instance.
We have a favor from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that over the years many days were spoken of by the last court, and said that if nothing happens on December 21st, \"people immediately think of a new date\" or that December 21st was the beginning of a seven-year period after which the end of the world would come.
Students and professors take this date lightly.
Several said they wanted to go to celebrations about the end of the world.
“Maybe I’m calling some friends so we can laugh together,” said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student for communications.
