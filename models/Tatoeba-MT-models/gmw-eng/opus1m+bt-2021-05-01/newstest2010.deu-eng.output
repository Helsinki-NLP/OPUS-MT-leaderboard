Barack Obama receives the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth U.S. president
American President Barack Obama comes to Oslo, Norway for 26 hours to receive the Nobel Peace Prize here as the fourth U.S. president in history.
In addition, he receives the diploma as well as the medal and a check over 1.4 million dollars for his extraordinary efforts to intensify world diplomacy and cooperation among the peoples.
The head of the White House arrives tomorrow along with his wife Michelle in the north-east metropolis and will be busy all the time.
First, he makes a visit to the Nobel Institute, where he meets for the first time with the five committee members who elected him from 172 people and 33 organizations in October.
After that, the couple planned a meeting with the Norwegian king Harald V and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit reached its climax with the ceremony where Obama takes over the prestigious prize.
He receives this as the fourth U.S. president, but only as the third, who receives the prize directly in office.
The White House has already announced that Obama will speak about the Afghanistan War in the takeover of the prize.
The President does not want to deviate from this issue because he knows that he is taking over the prize as a President who is currently leading war in two countries.
A few days ago, he intensified the efforts of the war by sending further troops to Afghanistan, which no one forgets about his critics.
At the ceremony, Obama also received the Golmedaille, the diploma and check over ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
The money he intends to donate for benevolent purposes, but he has not yet decided on a concrete charitable work.
The event programme then includes a banquet with the President and his wife, where, apart from Norway's king and queen, the Prime Minister and other 250 invited guests will also be present.
Obama was very reluctant from the beginning.
For example, he mentioned that he felt that he didn't deserve the prize completely.
He also repeated several times that the price is not just for him, but for all those who want the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he insisted that this is for him \"requirement to action.\"
Naturalists are accused of extortion
The Leitmeritz Police accused the president of the civil association of \"Natural Protection Community of Leitmeritz\" for extortion.
In several cases, last year he filed appeals against some construction procedures, for the withdrawal of his vocations he requested money from investors in his favor, said the Headmeritz police officer, Alena Romova.
The Chairman of the Leitmeritz Natural Protection Community Lubomir Studnicka.
Now he's in prison and he's threatened with a prison sentence of up to three years.
The sorting garbage containers in Brno don't smell well
In Prague people can sort the beverage packaging, in the South Moravian localities you can find again on step and third the sorting garbage container.
And in Brno?
There you would have to reserve a few minutes to find the appropriate garbage tons.
I don't want to claim that the waste separation in Brno would not work at all.
But it seems to me that the councillors do not care enough about this problem, even if we are the second largest city in the Republic.
Brno is located in the waste separations in the Urwaldliga, not only because we citizens here in the sorting containers are always allowed to dispose of paper, glass and plastics only, but mainly because of the amount of garbage tonnage for such wastes.
Did they at some point in the center try to dispose of the PET bottles in a collection basket, for example?
This is art, it takes time and strong nerves.
The only place I've found by chance so far is the Moravia Square opposite the Gans.
Mr Unterka and his colleagues should not be angry, but that is far too little for me.
Apart from the fact that the waste separation is not a honey leak in other parts.
Therefore, quite a number of my friends do not sort the waste at all.
Out of cowardice.
It's too far for them to waste tones.
I'm not surprised.
I even offered to dispose of some glass and plastic bottles after the celebration.
But on the Konicova road, I didn't see any colour trash tones in sight.
Fortunately, I came to the right place while driving a tram.
But the garbage was almost gone.
That's still the center of Brno, which represents the whole city, isn't it?!
However, ecology and some kind of aesthetics probably leave the Brno Socialists cold.
You prefer to buy the city an ice hockey league that shames us all over the Republic instead of buying a few garbage tons more and offering the sorting of other raw materials for a cleaner brine.
I'm glad I could confirm my assumption with official statistics even after I've been looking for a while on the internet.
According to the data of the company EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the whole district of South Moravia.
The Paroubek budget has withdrawn the money for pensions and sickness benefits
After the left party gave more money to farmers and officials despite the government's view, no money is available in the budget for pensions, health care and construction savings.
But neither for government debt interest nor for international court disputes.
This causes even more problems to the government in the second half of next year, says Eduard Janota, Minister of Finance.
When the Social Democrats and Communists enforced the increase in salary for some groups, they calculated that the government was also saving money for sensitive expenditures, old age pensions, or health care. “This is just a drop in problems in the future, mining,” Janota says.
More and more interest is paid by the loans, and you have to refund the money someday.
Too much to choose where to take, the state cash is empty.
If the social benefits or costs for the public service are not reduced, the tax should be increased.
For all those to whom the left party now gave more money: the firefighter, the teachers, the farmers.
And later for her children.
In order to make pensions or sick pay, whose account has disappeared 1,8 billion, people need not be afraid to get this money.
But for the price that the state owes itself even more - in the next year, not only 163 billion will be missing, but much more.
In spite of the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will rise faster and, together with this, the costs and interest rates.
The State will need the money to compensate, then will no longer be sufficient to raise the VAT only slightly or to cut the motherhood money as the government did in its counter-deficiency package.
As a result of the money drop in favour of some electoral groups, five billion will also be missing next year for the extension of motorways and railways.
It is mainly the sections won in the competition that can no longer be re-projected and possibly approved.
Most of them get whatever is not free.
This means the delay or discontinuation of thirty large buildings, also the European money supply, warns the spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The CSSD has proposed that it resolves the flow of money salomonically - it attacks the CEZ share dividends, where the state owns the majority, and from which the money is then distributed into the transport funds.
The problem is that the level of dividends is never certain and it is not an infinite source.
Last year, CEZ spent 18 billion on the budget.
Each year, the dividends pay the environmental damage liquidation, the pension account is filled up and this money is also used as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
In addition, according to EU rules, the real budget deficit rises to the level of 5.7 percent GDP.
However, this does not end the carnival of the revolutions.
Almost three billion fell the budget for various compensations for victims of communism and criminal offences or for expenses for court disputes, even for the saving of buildings.
Whether the state is working without this money is not certain.
That's pure gambling.
If we lose an international court dispute, then we have to pay that anyway, Janota makes clear.
The Minister must then save the money in-house or, in the worst case, attack the government budget reserve.
A hundred million are also missing for the two-billion project, which is already underway, to allow on-line monitoring of what the individual authorities spend the money on.
The first stage starts in January.
If the Minister of Finance did not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and in this case sanctions would come, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will control two operating systems
Americans expect a mobile phone for the future, on which the user can switch between different operating systems by pressing a single button.
The plans presented look promising.
It's enough to just press one button, and from Windows Mobile will be Android in less seconds in change.
This is precisely what the American company VMware wants to imagine, which focuses primarily on the development of virtual software for the computer.
We allow you to run two user profiles on the phone at the same time.
You can switch between these, they can separate them into two home and work profiles.
Both will work in parallel, explained Srinivas Krishnamurti from VMware during the interview for the magazine Computerworld.
It was presented in November last year and introduced for the first time a few days ago.
There will be 2012 on the market.
Virtualization of smart phones is not fiction.
VMware has already successfully introduced the journalist to the smartphone test pattern with two operating systems.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with a 128 MB RAM memory that ran parallel to the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
Now VMware is working together with European and American operators on smartphone virtualization and customers are expected to come within the year 2012.
The hotel owners are tormented by the lack of snow on the mountains
Snowless slopes worry not only the Giant Mountains inhabitants.
The missing snow also scares people from ordering ski stays in hotels and pensions.
That's why you can still get free rooms in Giant Mountains for all winter dates including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
Our pages are frequently visited.
People go through the offers, set the prices, but meanwhile they are afraid to order binding.
And when they call us, they immediately ask if we think this year's Christmas will be on snow or, in Matsch, the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura, led us.
Those who want to keep the New Year's Eve in the spindle mill exactly according to their ideas should no longer hesitate to order.
Those who prefer saving and where the quality of the stay only comes second place can try to wait a few more days.
The Spindelmühle hotel owners now offer mostly only weekly stays for the New Year's Eve.
I think they'll still be trying to sell them for a while, but then they have to give up, and go into shorter times.
And then the free rooms will quickly disappear, estimated Jandura.
Free beds on all winter dates always offer the travel agency Ingtours in Vrchlabi.
Now most of us are interested in the Christmas week, which has not yet been sold out.
In our offer about half of the places are still free.
Therefore, we have already prepared some cheaper Christmas stays for the last moment, led by the director of the travel agency Ingtours, Petr Schiefert.
The New Year's Eve in Giant Mountains can also offer the Vrchlabi Travel Office, but there are fewer free places here.
Good sales also find the first fourteen days in February, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year the interest in winter stays is also negatively influenced by the fact that there is always no snow in Giant Mountains.
People are waiting for snow to fall.
Nobody wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snowed within a week, the Christmas will also be sold out, says Schiefert.
Conversely and a little better than last year, we managed to occupy the rooms at the Hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snezkou.
We are about five percent better than the previous year.
On the New Year's Eve and Christmas, we only have a few free rooms.
There is great interest in Polish holidays in Janua, and in February the business will also run well, informed the director of the best Pec hotel, Karel Rada.
The Hotel Omnia is also occupied 80 percent for New Year's stays at the central parking lot in Janske Lazne.
On the other hand, half of the beds remain free at Christmas at the latest hotel in Janske Lazne.
We were surprised this year by the fact that we are already about 60 percent occupied.
A bit weaker is in the meantime February, but at the moment when the snow comes, the interest in the stays in the Giant Mountains certainly increases, led by the director of the Hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
The Giant Mountains hotel owners are waiting for a bigger snow shower.
On Thursday it should cool down and if it comes to rainfall, it should be snow on the mountains.
But after that a warming will come again, Jiri Jakubsky informed from the location of the Czech weather office in Hradec Kralove.
USA: Repeat is mother of wisdom
It's almost funny, with which pupil-speech Barack Obama, the president with his call of clumsiness, repeats the strategy of his predecessor in the Afghanistan question, which he himself considered to be the most stupid.
When he finally sweated out his long-awaited Afghanistan doctrine, it became apparent that he was writing it down three years ago on the copy paper from the Busch-Irak scenario.
Not only that in the text he himself uses several times the kind of speech he used, as in Iraq, but he has even used the name of the Bush Declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: \"New Forward Road\" without having to chew.
Three years ago, he even criticized the Bush idea - fresh troops in Iraq plagued by the civil war - as \"unresponsive and in its wake karastrophic decision.
The following months, however, showed that the Bush strategy based on recommendations from the military was the only possible and very successful one that was no longer mentioned in the news about Iraq.
Bush's reputation was not improved by this, for objectively he left a much more grateful starting situation to his successor than expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will repeat itself.
In order to increase the contingent of troops, he again asked for the military, especially the commander-in-chief of the Afghanistan Operation General Stanley McCristal, who harshly criticized, despite the subordinating habits, the stabbing shooters in the White House.
He demanded 40,000 soldiers to be able to reverse the situation to the better.
The President hesitated for three months, but did not come up with a better idea, and he then betrayed the General by 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe he pressed the commitment for another 5,000, even though he himself originally calculated at least 10,000.
The highest problem with the entire Obama strategy is its plan to withdraw the troops from Afghanistan already in 18 months and complete this process within three years. The whole Obama doctrine leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that half the increase will bring the same effect as the measure in Iraq.
Despite the brotherly war of recent years, Iraq's society is relatively well structured, its leaders honor the values.
The Afghan situation is characterized by the contraindication - no one can rely on anyone and no agreements will be held.
Under these conditions it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces who are accustomed to changing their opinion every day.
The political institutions, even if formally established correctly, remain only sham buildings, behind which patriarchal tribal relations will continue to grow.
The balance of interests between the different ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially because of the insurmountability of the conditions that make Pakistan and Iran even more complicated.
The building of a \"actionable state\" which is the minimalist goal of the whole operation is also very unrealistic.
Time horizon of Obama's strategy influenced by its voluntarism
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only deteriorated further and now it is on the brink of explosion.
To believe that the little soldiers who broke out in the cry of war over the \"early return\" create a miracle here can only create a truly romantic soul that cannot be impressed by facts.
From the political point of view, the date for the withdrawal of troops is a lack of responsibility, because the Taliban will take on this as the indirect confession of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in the fighting in Afghanistan is a challenge.
Europe's politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their voters how Germany's or Italy's security is related to the war in the Hindu-Kush mountain suburbs.
Another possible factor that can radically affect the situation is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the sanctions on Iran do not work, a very difficult question arises for the United States as to whether the problem should not be solved with troops.
This question must be answered during the period during which America cries out to Obama for victory withdrawal from Afghanistan.
Each solution, however, will also mean a dramatic turn of the Afghan situation.
The only comfort patch for Barack Obama is the fact that it remains for three more years until the presidential election, and thus it remains enough time for him to take another strategy, which would prove to be a total failure.
Bank Goldman Sachs' managers no longer receive premium bonuses in cash
The leading executives of the US Bank Goldman Sachs no longer receive premium bonuses in cash this year.
This has been announced by the company, which therefore responds to the sharp criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers gets shares instead of the money, but they can only sell in five years.
In addition, the shares can be withdrawn from the managers in the event of excessive risk.
Goldman Sachs, according to Reuters Agency, is at the forefront of efforts to connect Wall Street's premium bonuses with long-term performance.
I believe Wall Street is aware of the continuing direction in which to go, led the former banker of the company JPMorgan, Douglas Elliott.
The problem lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs became the target of criticism after spending nearly 17 billion dollars on premium bonuses for the first three quarters of this year.
The total premium bonus during this year is likely to exceed 20 billion dollars, according to the Reuters Agency.
The high premium bonuses in the banking sector have become the hottest political issue with the start of the financial crisis in a number of countries.
On Wednesday, the UK reported that it intends to tax the bonuses of bankers that exceed 25,000 pounds once with a 50 percent tax.
Similar steps are also being taken by France.
This year, women won the Nobel Prizes in all disciplines, except in physics.
Five record women today took over the Nobel Prizes in the subject categories and literature in Stockholm from the hands of the King of Sweden Carl XVI. Gustaf.
In addition to the four women scientists, the German author of Romanian descent, Herta Müller, was among them.
The Nobel Prize for Medicine has received two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with her countryman Jack Szostak for research in the chromozone area.
The prize for chemistry has been given by Israeli Ada Jonath together with Americans, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for clarification of the ribosome structure and function.
The last Laureate awarded the Nobel Prize for Economics, which American Elinor Ostrom and her countryman Oliver Williamson have received for analyses of the economic report.
The only category in which no woman received a Nobel Prize this year was physics.
Today, scientists Charles Kao have obtained this prize for research in the fiber glass sector and George Smith, together with Willard Boyl, for CCD chip invention, which is the basis of all digital chambers, fax devices or astronomical remote tubes.
Each of these prize winners has received the diploma, Nobel medal and certificate of acquisition of the money prize.
It is ten million Swedish crowns in each category.
If there are several prize winners in each category, the cash price is divided among them.
Traditionally, the American President, Barak Obama, has already received the most expected Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo this afternoon.
In his speech, he has recognised the controversy of his appointment because he is only at the beginning of his path, and is also at the head of the country that is leading two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In keeping with his policy, however, he added that wars are necessary in certain situations for fighting world peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota is considering resignation. Klaus has invited him to the castle
On Friday, President Vaclav Klaus receives the Minister for Finance, Eduard Janota, who is thinking about his stay in the government, because he disagrees with the implementation of the State budget for the next year in the form of the release by the Parliamentary Assembly on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget and perhaps the stay of Janota in the Cabinet will be the topics of the Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the budget deficit is too high, which also further deepens the crisis of public finances.
On the meeting, the president spoke to Radim Ochat.
Janota wants to negotiate on Monday with the Premier, Jan Fischer.
According to the budget law, which now receives clause for signature, the Czech Republic should have a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
However, on Wednesday Parliament voted on the Left Party proposals on money circulation and raised the money for the state officials' salaries, for the maintenance of social benefits and direct wages for farmers.
The government has kept up with the proposals of social democracy that it is covering up the budget deficit.
Between the left party on the one hand and the government, clause and legal party, on the other hand, a sharp internal-political dispute arose, with the question mark emerging over the further work of the fishing official cabinet, on which the ODS, CSSD and Green Party agreed in spring.
Critics claim that the budget, as adopted by Parliament, practically liquidates the package of austerity measures enforced by the fishing government in autumn, and that, according to their understanding, they should end the state debt.
Klaus, who can sign the State Budget Act but does not have to, said today, during the discussion early with the entrepreneurs, that politicians have neglected for a long time the \"serious problem\" that represents the \"unsustainable deficit\" of public finances.
In his opinion, there is no good solution today.
An improvement could only bring about a strong government that could build on a broader consensus of political parties.
The ODS chairman, Mirek Topolanek, pointed out that the budget is terrible, and the government should consider its continued existence.
The ODS chair chairman, Petr Necas, told the CTK that the concept of the official cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and the Green Party obviously no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer referred to similar words as “strong utterances” in the editorial board.
The CSSD chief, Jiri Paroubek, responded to the Topolanek words that the budget deficit was horrible that the former government had prepared Topolanek for this year, exceeding 200 billion crowns.
As early as Wednesday, CSSD rated the approval of the state budget as a success for the next year.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Mandela was played in the new film by Clint Eastwood by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film \"Invictus: The Unbeaty\" shows the world much of the country, whose struggle and victories despite some criticisms that the main role was occupied by an American actor.
The story tells about sports, racial relationships and about Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid system in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, represents in his life history the American Oscar-Schauspieler, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that he was asked by the ninety-one year old Mandela if he could represent him in the Eastwood film.
Another significant role is taken by Matt Damon.
I told him: \"If I'm going to play you, I have to meet you.
The twenty-seven-year-old actor, who had received the prize for his role in the Eastwood drama from the box area of “Million Dollar Baby”, already represented the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, from which the end has become the slave holder, a fictional U.S. President, and also God in “Evan Allpower,” but only rarely anyone who still lives and is as important to many people as Mandela.
The former South African statesman was in prison for 27 years for his active activity in the termination of apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990, and for four years he became President of the country.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
\"Invictus\" is the Latin word for \"unbeaten\" and at the same time is the name of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The requirement was how to speak
The film depicts a real event in which Nelson Mandela joined forces with the captain of the South African rugby team Francois Pienaar to join the country. The new President Mandela knows that after apartheid, his people remain racially and economically divided.
He believes that he can agree his people through sports, so he decides to agree with the rugby players who belong to the outsiders around the world.
Finally, the South African team grows up until the world Cup of 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to bring the Mandela story to the cinema screen.
He had no other goal than to play this role so as to approach it as closely as possible to reality, said Freeman.
The biggest challenge was, of course, to speak as he did.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were in the same country, he would try to meet Mandela, eat dinner with him, and be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake Mandela's hand.
I found out when I shook your hand, I took over your energy, she was transferred, and I felt that I knew what you were feeling, he said.
For me, it's important to be another person.
Matt Damon in the film François Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team in which the white players have overwhelmed.
The actor said that he had six months to prepare for the role in the hard rugby world.
It was a great surprise for him when he first met Pienaner in his house.
I remember when I sounded at the doorbell that he opened and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, 'I look much bigger in the movie.'
Despite the obvious differences in the stature of the actors compared to their actual models, he has received positive reviews under the direction of the director Eastwood-Invictus: Unbeatable and one also speaks of prospects for an Oscar.
The film critic of the Daily Variety sheet, Todd McCarthy, summarized his evaluation in the following words: “This was very good history, very well performed film,
In the film reviews on the web pages rottentomatoes.com, Invictus has received 76 percent positive evaluations.
Light secret about Norway dissolved: the Russians have tested a rocket
A special light effect of unknown origin was observed across Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defense only yesterday agreed that an intercontinental ballistic rocket had been tested not far from the Norwegian border.
However, the start was again unsuccessful and the rocket known as \"Bulava\" which was originally supposed to be the pride of the Russian army will slowly become the nightmare of Russian generality as well as the Premier, Vladimir Putin.
Also his repeated presence on site at the rocket test had no positive effect on the success of the trial flights.
Bulava is usually not started at all or damaged in the air.
In the Russian newspapers, we already write about “Bulava” as being above a“ rocket that doesn’t fly”
A rocket that doesn't fly, but lights
This already 13th attempt, was normal at the beginning.
It was only at the end of the flight that technical damage occurred to the rocket.
The engine probably exploded in the third level of rockets.
This time, \"Bulava\" started from the nuclear submarine Dmitrij Donskij, which was under the waters of the White Sea.
This type of rocket enables the removal from the submarine.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light caused by an indeterminate flying object over north roads was actually the damaged “Bulava”.
In addition, the Norwegians have not doubted since the first moment that it was a Russian rocket.
This time, the generality has been withheld, claiming that one cannot clearly speak of a failure.
The first two stages of the rocket did not fall out and the accident only affected the third stage.
In the previous cases, the engines were similarly damaged in the first stage.
Even if no test start was made without error, the management of the Department of Defense considers only six out of thirteen to be unsuccessful.
The almost fifty percent success therefore meets the generality with optimism and thus continues to claim that \"Bulava\" will fly without problems and even carry up to ten hypersonic atomic blowheads with a total weight of up to 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
The legendary defence player Vjaceslav Fetisov presents himself in a professional hockey game at 51 years of age.
The former world champion, Olympics and Stanley Cup owner helps his team CSKA Moscow out in need, and is probably already on Friday's DHL against Petersburg.
Fetisov, who completed his career with forty years, in 1998, is currently President of the CSKA.
After Denis Kulja's injury, we urgently need another defence player.
Fetisov has regularly trained and agreed to support the team.
We only need to clarify some other formalities, the agency AP cited the coach of the Moscow club of Sergej Nemcinov.
In the meantime it is not clear whether the comeback of the famous hockey player will only affect one game.
I mean, Fetisov is one of those who can raise the morale of other players, led fellow players Nemcinov.
When Fetisov returns to the ice floor, he becomes the oldest professional ice hockey game after AP.
In the NHL, the legendary Stürmer Gordie Howe played a full season for Hartford with fifty-one years and was able to fine-tune 15 hits and 26 assistants.
The oldest of the famous five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful ice hockey players in history.
In the dress of the Soviet Union he won two Olympic gold medals, seven World Champions, and he also triumphed in Canada Cup as well as in the Junior World Championship.
In the second part of his career he also gained success in the NHL, where he twice raised the Stanley Cup over his head in the Detroit dress.
He has been a member of the ice hockey star room since 2001.
Hyundai handed over to the trade unions. All overtime is lifted
The management of the Nosovice automobile factory Hyundai agreed with the union on the abolition of all overtime hours.
Due to frequent overtime hours, the union announced its readiness to strike on Monday.
This was confirmed by the spokesman of the automotive factory Hyundai, Petr Vanek.
However, the management wants to agree with the trade unions over a Saturday shift this week.
We must not give up our production plan, which is a principle, therefore, on Saturday, 19 December, voluntary overtime was proposed for the reason that two layers of work would be worked, Vanek said.
The Sedmicka.cz website wrote that the company offered a 400 CZK bonus to employees who would work the Saturday shift.
The employees will also receive it in retrospect for the Saturday shift of November 28.
According to Vanek, the company has decided to change the type of motivation of employees for the proposed overtime hours.
Either they can pay the overtime supplement or they can take replacement leave for it on December 28th and thus extend the Christmas holidays, Vanek performed.
In addition, all Saturday shift employees will pay the fare and lunch.
Taking into account the fact that the overtimes were the most urgent and burning point regarding the demands and complaints of trade unions who had stopped production last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon with immediate effect on the withdrawal of all overtime hours for December, Vaněk stated.
The car factory staff were forced to work 2 hours a day after the eight-hour shift until last week.
At the end of the signing of the agreement, the trade unions' readiness to strike will be revoked.
Further negotiations between the management of the automotive factory and trade unions are scheduled to take place on Friday afternoon.
The trade union leader, Petr Kuchar, said on Wednesday that if they can sign up for the fulfillment of the demands and a joint document they are willing to raise the readiness to strike.
The situation in the automotive factory peaked last week, on Wednesday, when about 400 employees spontaneously strike because of constant overtime.
They also protested against the bad terms of payment and alleged Shikans.
The management held, however, that the employees had to make the overtimes to meet the automotive supply needs.
The trade unions also demanded that the employees who interrupted production last Wednesday not be sanctioned.
In the field of overtime, trade unions demand that overtime work be reduced to a minimum.
In addition, this year they demand the payment of 5000 crowns.
The Nosovice automobile factory Hyundai now employs 2000 people.
The production of the series was launched in November last year.
By this September about 80,000 vehicles were manufactured here, the current production capacity is 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that is also active in HIV-viruses,
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds to prevent the spread of HIV viruses in the organism.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also acts in the viruses that are already resistant to drugs.
This fact outweighs the disadvantage that the connection to common virus variants does not work as strongly as one of the already existing medicines.
The AIDS disease cannot be cured yet.
The patient can, however, prolong their life and prevent the proliferation of HIV viruses in the body.
However, your use is accompanied by a number of side effects.
Furthermore, incomplete suppression of virus propagation has led to the development of sg. resistant viruses, which are no longer effective.
The work of the experts of three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, of the VSCHT (Chemisch-Technological University of Prague) and of the University of Heidelberg opens the way to addressing virus resistance.
They have demonstrated that the substances known as metalocarborans affect the protein responsible for the proliferation of the HIV virus.
The metalocarboranes are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block virus multiplication in a way other than all the medicines used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, scientists come to new “improved” compounds, which have been prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding on the viral protein.
The metalocarboranes have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multiple cages consisting of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms and coupled with a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Home-tucking and resistant virus
HIV protease is protein of the HIV virus that is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV-Protease-related virus division, no mature viral particles would arise.
When we turn off the HIV protease, we also turn off the proliferation of the virus in the patient's body, explains the scientists in the press report, published by the Institute for Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the work published in the Science Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe whole series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are coupled by a short organic chain, which is then systematically further altered.
Something weaker but more reliable
The effect of these series of substances on HIV proteases has been tested in the reagent glass, also against their resistant (resistant) variants obtained from HIV infected patients.
The effect of metalocarborans on the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as in the clinically used medicinal products, but does not lose its effect on the resistance variants, which the medicinal products used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action as well as its additional properties, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical designs, makes the metalocarborans interesting compounds for further research aimed at developing effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlina Rezacova, Head of the Institutes of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry Laboratory of Structural Biology and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Conflict over budget. ODS went to fisherman who resists
The chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, described the approved budget for the next year as \"greedy\" and the government of Premier of Jan Fischer should in his opinion consider their continued existence.
The ODS declared the Prime Minister \"strong outspoken\"
It's supposed to be time for analysis.
The deputy ODS chairman, Petr Necas, said that the concept of the official cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and the Green Party obviously no longer works.
According to Necas, the Prime Minister has to decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in Parliament when it comes to the fight against the rising deficit, or whether it is his stay in office with the help of the left-wing Parliament.
The approach of ODS and the Social Democrats to the problem of public deficits is diametrically different, according to Necas.
On Wednesday, Parliament adopted the budget for 2010, although with Link Party amendment proposals over more than 12 billion crowns.
Parliament has increased the money for public servants' salaries, for the maintenance of social benefits and for direct payments to farmers.
The government has kept up with the proposals of social democracy that it is covering up the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should be able to manage 163 billion crowns.
The ODS has left the hall before the vote, so it has met the government's wish, because even the modified budget is only a less poor version of the budget provisor.
Disillusionment and senselessness
The Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, spoke of his disappointment and a sense of senselessness, whereas Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government still assessed the present situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota had seriously threatened his resignation in the event that the amendment would have been accepted, the situation would have looked different.
According to Czech television Janota has signed up for Monday after the government business at the Premier.
He indicated that he was considering his further stay in the office.
The reason for this is his disappointment at the budget's handling.
As far as fishermen are concerned for the further fight against budget deficit, according to Necas, the social democracy (CSSD) nominees, who have enforced the changes in the budget, have nothing to do with the government.
The Premier should also clearly state that he will resign if Parliament continues to adopt deficit-increasing laws, such as those concerning sickness and pensions or the law on service.
Topolanek: The ministers nominated by ODS did not err
It's the Prime Minister's business and the whole government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS have made no mistakes, Topolanek highlighted in a text message from the United States.
It has been mentioned that in some ministries there are alternate people who profess to TOP 09 who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that, if fishermen decide to refrain from fighting against the deficit levels of public finances, it is perfectly logical and correct that it is based on the left majority that is currently in Parliament,
He then alleged that he could not expect the support and tolerance of the citizens' Democrats.
I didn't think about it, and if it's going to be up to date, then I'll deal with it, said Minister of Defense Martin Bartak, nominated by the citizens' Democrats, the journalist in Parliament.
Premier Fischer flew to the European Council in Brussels in the afternoon.
The ODS returned at the request of the Premier
Necas at the same time stressed that the ODS would probably vote against the amended budget on Wednesday, if the Prime Minister would expressly ask the Members of the Civil Democrats to allow them to adopt the budget.
We do not appear to be orphans, we are not small children, so he responded to the question of whether the ODS was not pushed back in the political negotiations on the budget by the absence of the party chairman in Parliament and in the Czech Republic.
I didn't realize my voice would be missing.
Even when I gave up the mandate, I knew that in the coming months, it would be particularly about parliamentary Bolshevisation and destruction, Topolanek himself responded.
According to the new schedule of the CD (Czech Railway), fewer trains will drive at approximately the same price.
The Czech Railways will terminate or restrict some less-charged rapid and local trains as of 13 December, while other connections will be strengthened.
The total traffic volume will be reduced by two percent from the date of validity of the new roadmap compared with today.
Most tariffs including basic and customer fare are not changed.
For example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava area receive several connection options to the capital, the railway uses trains of the Pendolino type for this route.
The train will no longer drive to Bratislava (Pressburg).
Less speed trains will also drive on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route, in principle the direct connections from Prague to Letohrad will be reduced.
The biggest reduction is planning the railways in the district of Hradec Kralove (Königsgraz), a total of eight percent, with an increase in Prague and its surroundings.
Two night trains are also lifted on the Prague - Tabor - Budweis route and on a few days a week the operation of some quick trains on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route is reduced.
Among the biggest changes is the introduction of the new direct route from Milovice to Prague, currently the inhabitants of Milovice have to change to Lysa nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth traffic route of the Esko suburban transport system, whose opening is possible thanks to railway electrification from Lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
The long distances to the capital city will end in the destination station Prague - main train station.
The CD introduces more connecting lines SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and the trains to Sumperk/Jesenik will drive at the interval of two hours.
With the Pendolino the passengers can no longer drive to Bratislava since 13 December.
This year's account for regional railways: rise by 200 million
The motorways are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, the total railways will receive four billion crowns to compensate for the so-called loss of liquidity in the next year, just like this year. The local trains supply the districts, in total they will pay eight billion crowns next year, and the state will pay three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million Czech kroner more expensive.
For the local trains as well as the rapid trains, the railway has renewed a ten-year contract, until now the contract has always been concluded for only one year.
The railway praises the system, and perhaps it has not taken the price increase for the large majority of the tickets.
There are changes only for one-day network tickets CD Net and for cheap internet tickets eLiska.
For passengers without the customer card, the price CD Net is increased from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The eLiska price will then depend on the driven plug until now it was uniform for the journey between any district cities and cost 160 crowns.
Philippine Millitans arrest more than 50 people, the children were released.
Millinante today kidnapped 75 people in the south of the Philippines, including some elementary students and their teachers.
This has led the AFP agency, which originally only informed over 65 kidnapped.
All 17 children detained were released after eight hours, including a teacher.
It was abducted in the province of Agusan del Sur.
About 19 millitantes allegedly used the hostages as a living shield in flight from the police.
The local negotiators are now trying to produce the remaining hostage.
According to the agency AFP, the millitants are part of the New People's Army (NPA), which is the arms group of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AP, the police persecuted the kidnappers for the violence that demanded revenge between the two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, the right was imposed because of the recent massacre involving 57 people.
Among the victims of the 23rd November massacre, which coincided with the election to the governor's office, were 30 journalists.
Because of suspicion of participation in the massacre, the governor of this southern Philippine province and his father Andal Ampatuan, Patriarch of the influential Ampatuan clan, were arrested.
Muslim separatists are also active on the island of Mindanao.
But those who have resumed the peace negotiations with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The history of South Africa concerns everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Nelson Mandela
In the next few days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwoods comes to the American cinemas, Invictus: the Unslaughter, which includes part of the life story of the former president of the Republic of South Africa, Nelsona Mandela.
The role of the world famous fighter against apartheid has been given to Morgan Freeman, who had been allegedly chosen by Mandela himself some years ago.
Matt Damon has been awarded the role of performer of the legendary South African champion in rugby, Francois Pienaar.
With the film's start, there are also reactions by critics and the public.
Nelson Mandela
With full name he is called Nelson Rolihlaha Mandela, born 18 July 1918 in South African Mvez.
In 1988 he received the Sachar Prize, and in 1993 then the Nobel Peace Prize together with de Klerk.
He was elected President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
Great expectations are put into the film because it comes to cinemas at a time when South Africa is culminating in preparations for the World Championship, but at the same time the media are rocking the world’s public with frightening news about the rising racial hatred and discrimination of the inhabitants by the black ruling majority.
According to the news agency AP, the reactions to the new film in South Africa are by and large positive despite numerous reservations against the occupying of the major roles with American Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is still proud of his own words on the new film.
I have dreamed of this role for many years and have been well prepared for it.
Several times I met Nelson Mandela personally so that, as you say, I could receive his energy, he performed in the interview after the film's festival premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if we can get rid of Mandelas personality and his message with this film.
This is a history of South Africa, but it concerns every human being, he added.
In the dress of the rugby national team
The film is based on the book template by British writer John Carlin, freely translated “In the Role of the Enemy”: Nelson Mandela and the game that united the people portray the South African defender of human rights within his first presidential election period.
In the course of the film, Morgan Freeman strives to bring together two racially and day-to-day distinct populations and, like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also plays a role in the South African national rugby dress on the World Cup field, which was won by South Africa at the time.
For entering the lawn in the dress, which is almost like a sacred act in South Africa, Mandela harvested large ovations fourteen years ago, mostly from the white public and thus won the recognition of the white population.
The rugby championship may have made it possible for people to become a single people again, led by the rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only black player in the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa improves will only show itself.
However, the white South Africans are skeptical, as reported in the recent interview for LN der Rugby-Fan, Christopher Dawson, who fled from the country to Britain.
The championship starts on 11 June 2010.
In the Louny area, transformers burn for several 10 million crowns
In the morning, the fire broke out at the Transformer of the company Ceps in the switching plant near the municipality of Vyskov in the Louny area.
In the fire, according to the spokesman of Usti nad Labem, Lukas Marvan, took six units.
Originally, the firefighter wanted to burn out the transformers, but later it changed its view and now the fire is deleted with a mixture of water - foam and special solvents.
The cause was a technical defect, a transformer inner loop.
No one was injured, the Havare did not risk the safety operation of the management system, according to the company spokesperson, Pavla Mantova.
The damage has been estimated at several 10 million crowns, the damage will only be counted after the fire.
The destroyed transformer must be replaced by a new one, according to Mandova.
For more than 10 years, Cep's society has done nothing similar, mistakes of this kind are rare, she added.
The power supply was not interrupted according to the spokesman of the company CEZ for Northern Bohemia, Sona Holingerova, by the fire of the Trafostation, the functioning of households, authorities and companies was not affected.
A.G. Ceps operates in the Czech territory as sole operator of the control system, the electrical lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renews and develops 39 switching systems with 67 transformers, which transfer electrical energy into distribution system and line with a length of 4339 kilometers.
Jancura raises criminal ad for slander against three heads of CSSD.
Today, the student agency's owner, Radim Jancura, raises criminal charges for slandering three social-democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the district of South Moravia, Radko Martinek from the district of Pardubice and the head of the district of Olomouc, Martin Tessarik.
Jancura said this in a twenty-minute inteview in the radiojournal.
The complaint is related to the company's efforts to operate regional transport in some districts.
However, all regions have finally signed long-term contracts with the Czech Railway.
All three leaders attack us and say that we are taking out the roses, but we have only submitted the offer to the extent that it was agreed with them.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways because we would know the prices of the Czech Railways that were completed last week.
So we don't have anything other than to defend ourselves.
Because of this slander of the Society Student Agency, Jancura told the radio journal.
At the same time, he stated that he had evidence from all the districts that they had taken their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing an indictment for the European Commission.
Hasek holds the collection of criminal notices for the continued continuation of Jancura's media show, which serves him as a free advertisement for his company as well as for his own person.
Of course, I am ready to defend my good name and the good reputation of my district, and I also request other leaders to do so.
I assume that it will also become clear in this matter that it is Jancura who is manipulating the public and using false and false arguments in the matter of regional railway transport, said Hasek.
Jancura reported last week that he has invested several million crowns in advertising that will point to the detrimental step of the districts.
He told the radiojournal that he was interrupting the campaign after Christmas, and wants to continue it after New Year.
He stated that he would lead the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign was launched by Jancura after the districts agreed on the operation of the regional railway with the Czech Railway and had not issued tenders for the order in a high of 150 billion crowns.
According to Vancura, such conduct is illegal and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
According to Jancura, because of the criticism of train traffic in the districts, he was already a member of CSSD.
The only threat was if we didn't give up that we could lose the bus licenses.
He presented himself as a member of the CSSD, I know who it is, I don't say his name, said Jancura to the radiojournal today.
Free and voluntary vaccination against pneumococcals
As of January, vaccination against pneumoccals changes the habit.
She is the first to be free and voluntary for the families.
But even now, votes are reporting that mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococcals culminate.
The Institute of Medicine already sets the maximum prices of vaccines that health insurance must pay.
The experts are also aware of the vaccination procedure.
New vaccination
Vaccines free for August children
From January, children can be vaccinated for free against pneumococcals, which were born on August 2nd last year and later.
The condition is that they have not yet received a dose of vaccination.
Those who have started vaccination in the past year or earlier also have to pay further recovery vaccination themselves.
The first dose of vaccination must be given between the 3rd and 5th month of life of the child.
Last year, a quarter of the families had their children raped against Pneumokok.
The parents paid 1600 crowns and more for one dose.
Four doses are required for the vaccination of the youngest children.
Overall, experts estimate that health insurance for vaccination doses spends 300,000 to 450,000 crowns a year.
But they save in the treatment that the children would need without vaccination.
Until now, the state has spent about 500,000 per year on all land vaccinations of the children.
Mandatory vaccination was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcals cause middle ear inflammation, but also cause severe infections including cerebral inflammation and blood poisoning.
Pneumococcal infections kill up to 28 children up to 10 years of age after examination in hospitals per year.
Outside the Czech Republic, compulsory vaccination of children against pneumococcal diseases was introduced in about 40 countries.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccination could be mandatory in the future.
As of January, this is to be paid and voluntary by the insurance companies.
For example, the head of the Naelas Civil Association, Rudolf Kalovsky, mentioned that the vaccination would be better.
His association has been working for the Pneumococcal vaccination in the long term.
The experts at the international conference in which our association was involved were not very satisfied with our voluntary vaccination.
That's not quite ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy that we have managed to do at least that.
I think that's the way we have to go now, Kalovsky led.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococcals.
At this moment we do not consider this at all, his spokesperson Vlastimil Sesen said.
Voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, the doctors claim.
The chairman of the specialist company of practical pediatricians, Hana Cabrnochova, admits that voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
If all children were vaccinated, then we could think about reducing the number of repetition vaccinations, in a situation where the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccination was started as a voluntary one, but Cabrnochova says.
Experts expect more than 80 percent of parents to have their infants vaccinated against pneumococcals from next year.
The vaccination against pneumococcals is also groundbreaking in that it is paid as the first land vaccination of health insurance and not the state.
The insurance companies should spend the money for prevention to save them for further treatment, Cabrnochova is cold.
The doctors have to buy the vaccines themselves.
However, this is a concern of the practical pediatricians concerning the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original plan, vaccines should be purchased by the insurance companies and the doctors should then receive them on the same path as other vaccines issued by the State to them.
Some Members, however, feared that the insurance companies would be able to carry out \"the money out of health insurance\"
So doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves and wait until insurance pays them.
According to estimates, the individual practical doctors will have to invest 40,000 crowns per month, which is a significant sum.
It won't be easy, says Cabrnochova.
U.S. Artist's son involved in “Museum theft”
The son of the famous American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta was accused of trying to steal paintings worth 20 million dollars from his father's museum.
According to Pennsylvania police, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was taken into his vehicle with trailer when loading 90 paintings.
Frank Frazetta junior and another man would have used a excavator to penetrate the museum into the Pocono Mountains.
The 81-year-old Frank Frazetta Senior is famous for his portrayal of figures such as Conan der Barbar and Tarzan.
As reported by the Associated Press news agency, the artist stopped in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP quoted an unnamed police officer who said Frank Frazetta Junior could have been motivated by a family fire.
According to a police oath statement, Frazetta Junior claimed that he was instructed by his father, \"that he should enter the museum with all the means to bring all the paintings into a camp,
The agency announced that Frank Frazetta Senior was fighting to have granted any permission.
Labour defends budget and tax increases
Ministers have defended tax increases and expenditure stops announced in the preliminary report against criticism of opposition, economy and trade unions.
The Conservatives said that Alistair Darling would have had an opportunity to “done away” to show that he meant it seriously with the reduction of the deficit by pushing the decisions out until after the election.
The chancellor was also fired for targeting workers with low and medium incomes.
Its main proposals include a 0.5 percent increase in social security and a 1-percent capping limit of public earnings for 2011.
Social security insurers
On the other hand, trade unions have protested that low-wage recipients will be punished for a recession they have not caused and warned of upcoming problems,
The increase in social security - to about 3 billion UK pounds a year - has made the private sector angry, which says that this is a tax on jobs, although the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase limited to those earning more than £20,000 a year will affect about 10 million workers.
PROTECTION OF THE VORAB ETATH REPORT
Increased social security by another 0.5% from April 2011
This year the economy shrinks by more than the expected 4.75 %
New 50 % tax on banker bonuses
Discard 1 percent increase in corporate tax for small businesses
Control axles for electric vehicles and wind turbines
Increase in government pensions by 2.5%
According to estimates from the Treasury, someone with an annual income of £30,000 will be poorer by £90 per year and someone with £40,000 per year will be poorer by £190, while a person with £10,000 will be richer by £110.
Ministers said that their target of deficit recovery by 2013 was \"several decisions\" but they also said that 60% of the additional tax burden would be on the 5% of the top earners.
Minister of Finance Stephen Timms contended that the tax increases and expenditure stops outlined would be \"a drop on the hot stone\" compared to the necessary measures.
“These are large figures, and they will bring us the deficit half-life and this is absolutely necessary over the next four years,” he told BBC.
Timms said he was confident that the economy would return to growth by the end of the year.
The Labour Party's predictions of future economic growth, which influence the level of re-examination and the speed of deficit re-entry, were questioned after the treasury chancellor was forced to revise earlier figures.
In his opinion, the economy is likely to shrink by 4.75 % this year - far more than the 3.5% drop predicted in April - while the debt would be £3 billion higher than previously estimated.
‘Adjusted opportunity’
The Conservatives, who want to launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday to warn of Labour's \"school crisis\", said that the planned debt of 789 billion pounds over the next six years would be untenable.
They added that the Ministers failed to present a credible plan on how to repay this and to push “cynically” before difficult decisions until after the election, which must take place no later than June 2010.
“They didn’t say anything about what they were going to do,” said shadow finance minister Philip Hammond. “They had an opportunity to do this, and they let it pass,
\"The important announcements are made only after the election, whoever wins them,
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police be kept from future cuts, unlike the conservatives' proposals, who see the deficit capping coming faster and more quickly.
But the Liberal Democrats said that the money won by tax increases and expenditure stops is used to cover the expenditure for the next year, not to reduce the deficit, and therefore argue that the plans were \"built on sand\".
The BBC's political editor Nick Robinson said that at the time of the announcements - like the above adjustment in inflation for some invalidity pensions next April - the treasure chancellor would suspend the allegation of the capture of votes, as the money could simply be recovered next year.
Labour insists on providing extra assistance when people need it most and that the situation will be re-examined in September 2010.
‘Hohler Etat’
Although ministers have not announced any budget details beyond 2011, economists say that the pressure on public spending will only be borne in the medium term.
The recognized Institute for Tax Investigations said that the figures of the Treasury Chancellor would mean strong cuts in many areas, possibly even in the fields of transport, higher education, science and defence in the future.
“It only shifts the pain to later,” said his director Robert Chote.
\"The important announcements are made only after the election, whoever wins them, Roger Bootle, economic consultant to the business audit company Deloitte, added.
“This was only the hollow pre-Etat report.
FBI investigates “Failures of US citizens in Pakistan”
The FBI examines the arrest of five reported U.S. citizens because of the suspicion of extremist ties in Pakistan.
The men were arrested in a raid on a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern Pandshab province, the American Embassy in Pakistan informed the BBC.
The FBI said it will examine whether these are the same men who were reported missing last month in the U.S. state of Virginia.
The U.S. Foreign Ministry said that they are also looking for information about the men.
Three of them are to be Pakistani descent, one is Egyptian origin, and the other has a Yemeni background.
\"If they are American citizens, of course, we are very interested in the charges they are charged with and under what circumstances they are detained,\" said speaker Ian Kelly.
The FBI spokesperson Katherine Schweit said the authority was informed about the arrests and was in conjunction with the families of the missing students.
“We are working with the Pakistani authorities to find out their identities and the purpose of their stay there, if they are actually the missing students,” she said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington announced that the men were arrested in a house belonging to one of the students' uncles.
He said that the local police had already been interested in the house earlier and that no charges had been filed against the arrested men.
The Reuters news agency reported that Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton refused to comment on the arrests, but she said that the United States must work together with Afghanistan and Pakistan to eradicate the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people,
The five students were reported missing by your families in northern Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty condemns abuses in Iran
According to a report from the Amnesty International Human Rights Organization, human rights in Iran are still as bad as it has been over the past 20 years.
The report detailes \"use patterns\" by the regime, both before and after the contested presidential elections in June.
A man quoted in the report stated that he was beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran rejected earlier criticism of its human rights balance.
Officials said that such criticism was politically motivated.
After the contested election of President Mahmud Ahmadinejad, thousands of people were arrested in Iran and dozens were killed, leading to the largest road protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Thousands received prison sentences and prosecutors said that at least five people were sentenced to death.
The BBC-Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne, now in London, said that at the beginning of the protests of the highest leaders, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, recognized some of the allegations of abuse and ordered the closure of the Kahrizak-Straffanstalt.
But since then there has been no more tolerance to criticism from the authorities, our correspondent said.
‘False confession’
Amnesty International cited the 26-year-old computer science student Ebrahim Mehtari, who said that he was accused of \"working with Facebook networks\" and of protesting the election results.
“They often beat me in the face, ” he was quoted.
“I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in the neck, on my head .... They threatened me with death and they humiliated me “
After five days he signed a false confession and, still bleeding and half unconscious, released on the road, Amnesty told him.
The beaten presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some demonstrators who were arrested after the election were tortured to death in August and others raped.
The Iranian authorities denied the allegations of rape, but admitted that abuses took place.
Amnesty also called the case of a former prisoner who said that he had been detained in a container in a Kahritak criminal institute with 75 other than eight weeks.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian Parliament and the judicial authorities had set up a committee to investigate the riots after the election and the government's reactions to them, but said Amnesty that the mandates and the power of these institutions were unclear and the results obtained by the parliamentary committees had not been published.
The group said that at least 90 people were arrested in the last three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
Skihang was established in the Stadtpark
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn a landmark into a competition pist.
The ski slopes of this park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who fought for money prizes.
At the top of the slope in the Brandon Hill Park there was a short jump chance at the beginning of a 100 metre slope.
The student John Hickman, who studied medicine in the fourth year, said that there was a beautiful view of the top of the slope, but it was also very frightening.
It is a great view with all the lights of the city that shine beneath.
He added: “There are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country here - some of the right talents -
Prices were awarded for the best art pieces or tricks performed on the slope.
After the event on Thursday evening, the snow is left to melt.

Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters voted for a ban on the construction of minarettes and the concern about the alleged Islamization of Europe is widespread, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote a well-founded and well-thought report on whether Muslims can be integrated into one of Europe’s most explained secularized societies — and integrated.
Some readers will admire this new book for the author’s last work: “Why the French don’t Love Headaches,” (original title: “Why the French Don't Like Headscarves, (2006)), an elegant and highly argumentative study of a dispute that the country shared and employed for several decades and whose effects are still discernible today.
Bowen's latest book offers a broader and more cool spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what really happens in the area.
He spent months in mosques, schools and institutes, which now offer the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen calls \"Islamic spaces\".
He's a good listener, he's giving up debates between teachers and students about the issues they are most worried about.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or town hall (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it permissible for a Muslim to use a sentence-oriented banking system to get a mortgage?
These are seemingly profane matters, he claims, which make up daily life, quite unlike the political dramas that the media employ.
The author recognizes a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a known name, possibly with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, an Arab Muslim scholar and academic born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate about how it is possible to be, on the one hand, a good Muslim and, on the other hand, a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They don't have all the arguments on their side.
Conservatives are suspicious of the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists surveyed by Bowen are mostly inconclusive with their Salafi counterparts - advocates of purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia - which today show a small but influential presence among European Muslims.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism may be compatible.
But a convention requires giving and taking on both sides.
He asks how French political decision-makers (and the intellectual elite, who so passionately guard the separation of Church and State) really feel obliged to pluralism.
He indicates that Muslims may have experienced more harsh treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who, on the other hand, had to compromise their history with secular republicanism.
He recognizes a “sharpenment of the value screws” rather than a growing pragmatism.
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, you are inclined to say \"Yes, but not yet\"
The World’s Most Uncomfortable View
The Arctic changes faster and more dramatically than any other environmental region on earth.
The ice that marks it melts at alarming speed and takes life with itself that can't survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, shipping and fisheries interests have recently entered open water, with diplomats, lawyers and now also authors in their keel water.
Richard Ellis, an author and illustrator, draws a natural story of the icons of the north, the polar bear, on thin ice.
Applied in the complicated history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic researchers who have proved themselves on the polar bears during hunting.
Admiral Nelson's encounter with an polar bear as a brave 14-year-old fencing to the lake, who fought only with the gun-cold of his musket, is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bears caught swimming behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers were brought to zoos and circuses.
A circus performance at the beginning of the 20th century showed 75 polar bears.
Even today zoos still typically have a millionth of the living area of a wild animal. The climate is rarely suitable: the polar bear in Singapore was quite green from the algae growing in the hollow hairs of its fur.

Ellis refers to the reports of other authors and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters represent for the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, America, and Russia, the laying continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters use powerful storm rifles in helicopters and motor sleds-driving inuit to route their prey.
Ironically, the ice will remain the longest in the waters to the north of these two hunting nations.
In his new book \"After the Ice\" (original title \"After the Ice\", Alun Anderson, a former publisher of the scientific magazine \"New Scientist\", offers a clear and disturbing description of the science of the Arctic and a packed insight into how the future might develop.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of change.
But this is not because of a lack of explanation.
The pioneer journeys of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries caused the confusion of the pack ice for the first time.
Undersea boats measure the shifting grate during the Cold War.
A useful addition are satellite measurements and the large-scale deployment of measuring probes on icebergs, but still much is achieved by unscrupulous people camping outside in the cold.
Anderson takes a look at the strange, tiny world of the influx system within the Arctic ice formed by saltwater incinerators that are squeezed together during freezing.
But, starting from the bear on the ice up to the microscopic small wonders in the ice, all of them are threatened when once summer ice passes, which is expected to happen between 2013 and 2050.
“In a few months ... this could be We”
Marine children were among the 6,000 who settled in Arlington Kranzene
The Freed De'Angello Robinson traveled seven hours by bus to place a single crane on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other naval infantrymen, who took the trip from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the Arlington National cemetery to decorate graves, the day was a tribute to the men and women in whose footsteps they had walked.
In a few months, wherever we are brought back, we could be, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I would like someone to do the same for me, so I try to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers gathered on Saturday morning to place cranes on the graves of veterans in several sections of the Arlington Peace Court.
Morrill Worcester, owner of the Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, founded this tradition in 1992 when he and some others decided to decorate several hundred graves at the cemetery in Arlington.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition and Morrill and his wife Karen, who take this journey every year, continue in different cities along the way to perform events dedicated to the military and victims of terrorism.
Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America (Cranches throughout America), which extended the event to other states as well.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 cranes on the graves at Arlington-Friedhof, in areas on the Pentagon, on graves at Fayetteville National cemetery in Arkansas, in the Battery Park in New York and at the memory site for the United Airlines flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second time, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 for the purchase and transport of the cranes.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said she took the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a deceased professional soldier.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said this is her way of returning something that the victims brought.
She said this is a small contribution as we civilians can support our soldiers.
It's like visiting a family graveyard.
Packed in layers of warm clothing, the volunteers wandered across the extensive lawns and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers had the goal of reaching older graves from the 1st and 2nd World War and the Vietnam War, as they are not visited as often as the newer graves, according to the organizers.
The mood was joyful, children played and couples held hands while they carried the fresh pine branches to the graying gravestones.
Each round cranium was dark green with a small red loop attached to the upper part.
Section 60, located nearby and where mainly veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, remained almost calm.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 cranes to decorate this section, but the gloomy mood of the current wars filled this area.
Individuals cried openly, others prayed and families and friends stuck to each other in the icy air.
Some read out loud the names carved in stone, while others bowed down to small black and white square cards that had been put in the damp mud for those whose gravestones had not yet been finished.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who shed bitter tears in front of her son's grave.
She went 8 hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the graveyard of Marine Infraentery under officer David Shane Spicer, who fell in battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free ..., my son paid for it, she said.
“If I’ve been out for a long time, I want someone to remember him “
Contractors of the U.S. Government arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a contractor of the U.S. government who sold mobile phones and notebook computers in the country, said representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc. based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for customers, such as USAID, the U.S. authorities for international development and for the World Bank.
Consular officers of the United States interest in Havana tried to gain access to the prisoner who was arrested on 5 December.
The special charges have not yet been published, although under Cuban law a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost anything under the charge of the \"dangerous\" arrest.
All so-called counterrevolutionary activities, which include light protests and critical writings, are at risk of arrest.
Government hostile graffiti and statements are regarded as serious crimes.
Cuba has a growing blogger community led by popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, who often describes how she and her husband are persecuted and attacked by government representatives.
Sánchez has repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country to receive prices, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractor will probably increase the tensions between the Castro Brother's Communist government in Cuba and the Obama government, which had sought to make a \"slow\" approach to improving relations with the island.
The news of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times on Friday night.
The new U.S. policy places emphasis on the fact that the United States will make a return when the Cuban government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, although they are new and sought after products in a country where the average earnings of a government employee is 15 dollars per month.
The Cuban government has only allowed ordinary citizens to purchase a mobile phone since this year, they are used mainly for sending text messages, as a 15-minute phone call would cost a daily wage.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and at some government agencies, such as universities.
Cubans who wish to log in often have to report their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
In Cuba, the arrest of an American is rare.
Most of the few U.S. citizens who are in prison in Cuba sit behind bars for crimes like drug smuggling, Gloria Berbena, the U.S. Secretary of Interest in Havana, said.
Berbena said she couldn't give any further information about the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that would be legal in any other free society - the release of free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of the Human Rights Watch group, who recently issued a hard report on freedom in Cuba entitled \"New Castro, Same Cuba\", an appeal to the establishment of Raul Castro as a leader of the country replacing the sick older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the accused would be arrested, convicted and imprisoned very often within one day.
He said that probably every solution would be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, especially at the time when both countries are moving towards more dialogue.
Pakistani government representatives cover plan to send men to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities discovered on Saturday a supposedly leading head of a conspiracy aimed at sending five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill US soldiers, and said that they hoped this case could help to discover an extended network of terrorists who would search the Internet for radicalized young men.
Investigators said that they had sought an opaque insurgent, known as Saifullah, who had invited the men to Pakistan after he had found them because one of them had given consent to terrorist attacks on the website YouTube.
After their arrival in Pakistan, Saifullah became the leader of these men and tried to help them reach the remote area of Pakistan's tribal belt, which is the home of Al Kaida and its terrorist training camp.
But a representative of Pakistan's secret service who was informed of the matter said on Saturday, Saifullah could not convince the Al-Kaida leaders that the men are not part of a CIA conspiracy to subjugate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were held for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far away from the inhospitable mountains in the northwest, which have become a terrorist refuge.
They were considered part of a hidden operation.
Therefore, they were rejected, said the government official, who wanted to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The government official said that the men were not discouraged and continued to try to get the right recommendations to get access to the Al-Kaida camps when they were arrested by Pakistani criminal authorities.
The case of five men - who are still in Pakistan and who are being questioned by the FBI - underlines the crucial role of applicants in identifying future terrorists and possibly even more important in deciding who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, the U.S. Secret Service has made it a matter of utmost urgency to place human active items within Al Kaida.
The applicants of the organization act as pastors who do not let in those whose commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and those who might be spies.
American willow recruits are subjected to a special examination by A Kaida, analysts say.
However, due to their potential access to US goals and their propaganda value, they are also considered to be extremely attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst of the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said that in recent years, terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in regard to whom they allow access, because the U.S. secret services have become experts of their recruitment methods.
If you try to include someone in these groups, what better way could you go than to follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed? said Kohlmann.
The model is now based much more on the internet.
Tens of thousands of demonstrators call for climate action in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets on Saturday and demanded more effective action in climate protection by the negotiators at the Bella Congress Centre of the City.
Demonstrators said that 100,000 people had joined the event, whereas police estimates were more of about 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists lit small explosives near some government buildings in the city center.
On one day, when little happened during the climate negotiations funded by the UN, thousands of activists wandered through the city with transparent people in English, “There is no planet B, and one in Spanish,” said “The Earth says “Enough.”
Some stars joined the protest, for example the Danish model, the photographer Helena Christensen, who said that the journeys to Peru, the country of birth of her mother, make her aware of the heartrending problems the country is facing due to the already noticeable effects of climate change.
This is part of the motivation I have decided to take part in the great demonstration - to continue the word and appeal to the world leaders, to establish a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must now be done and there is no way around it any more.
The police stopped the demonstrators from approaching the Bella Centre too close and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly due to the fact that they were either masked or carrying pocket knives.
According to Danish law, these actions are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to a viewer who didn't want to be mentioned, since he was involved in climate negotiations, masked protesters in black clothing lit several explosives near the Copenhagen main canal, near which several ministries are located.
They threw them near the buildings, he said and added that they started as a light rocket, but then they were followed by “a few large explosions”.
Inside the congress centre, people gathered in front of TV screens to follow the demonstration all afternoon.
But the protest has apparently not reached the consciousness of the main officials, such as Su Wie, China's chief climate negotiators.
When asked if he thought that the demonstration had a constructive effect on international considerations, he replied in English: “This is something I was not aware of at all.”
He then moved to Mandarin and said: “Because the venue is big, I can’t hear what’s happening outside,
He found that it depends on the individual's perspective on whether the demonstration would harm or help.
It shows the concentration of the general public and various sectors on the issue of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, \"it can also be said that it disturbs the negotiations or freedom of other people,
Test data show persistent racial gap
Testimony to math performance last week was welcome good news for public schools in Washington D. C.
Although the Washington District is still far behind the schools of the country, which produce the highest performances, the testimony shows that the fourth and eighth graders have made faster progress over the past two years than cities that include Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
However, what is included in the latest figures of the National Assessment of Educational Progress - NAEP (National Assessment of Educational Progress) is the persistent gap of performance between African American and white students, both at local and national levels.
The average score of the white fourth graders from Washington D.C. rose in the last two years from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but their African-American counterparts only increased by three points from 209 to 212.
The performance gap actually rose from 53 to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of African-American eight-clusters remained essentially the same, he fell around a statistically negligible point from 245 to 244.
The average white student score was not included in the test data, as the sample size was not large enough.
The image over a six-year period is also not more encouraging.
The gap, which separated white and black fourths when the first NAEP was recorded in this district in 2003, was 60 scales (262 to 202).
And although the score reached by both groups has grown over this period of time, the difference with now 58 points has hardly decreased.
Last week, some of the district's leaders expressed concern that the results celebrated by Chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and the democratic mayor Adrian M. Fenty were largely driven by white students who are already powerful children anyway.
This indicates that we have raised the overall score by treating those at the upper end of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, Executive Board member of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that contributes to education equality in Washington D.C.
I do not jump up and down for a span of two or three points, said the Democratic Washington City Council member, Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth grade of Eaton primary school.
Brown, a frequent critic of Rhee's management style, said that the message of the audit point figures is that the city's middle schools need urgent attention.
Of course, you always want to see the positive signs that I respect.
But what scares me is that we do not spend almost the time and energy we need to use for our secondary school.
Rhee said the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of the weak students.
In this autumn, for example, some teachers are being trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson-Read-System, which aims at students in the upper classes of primary and secondary schools, which basic skills of reading have not been mastered at the beginning of their school career and which are significantly behind their equally old classmates.
Everyday mathematics, a curriculum that takes priority from kindergarten to sixth grade games and lifelong experiences, was brought to Washington under the former senior school inspector Clifford Janey and this curriculum is attributed to some of the NAEP progress reported last week.
I think that we must continue to work to make the best of the measures that are available to students below the grade level, said Rhee.
Others say that NAEP results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system while continuing to provide the additional money and resources for the low-performance schools needed to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, Professor of Education at the University of California in Berkeley, who investigated urban exam results.
The conventional remedy is to focus its resources and management reforms on schools located in the poorest areas of Washington D.C.
The objective could create political repercussions that are working against this important agenda item.
The weak point, of course, as with other urban school inspectors, is that they are trying to keep the white and black middle layer.
Our focus is on ensuring that we build a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in urban areas so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive excellent public education.
Janey, who is now a school inspector in Newark, said this week in an interview that one of the most important elements to closing the achievement gap is to extend the traditional public school year that is currently 180 days in Washington to compete with the charter schools.
One has to increase the school year to nearly 200 days to have the power to change, said Janey, who came with his teaching union last year to an agreement of 185 days a year, which he considered \"a milestone\" on the way to a greater increase in the next contract.
Higher education for more people than prospects for the future
The bus reaches the Gettysburg College with a loud pipe.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, rises out and blinks a moment while viewing the white columns, the brick facades and the emerald green lawn.
Graciela's parents have hardly completed high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, who was saved in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Their attitude and that of the other eight-clusters of the group who explore Gettysburg, where teaching costs $38,690 per year, was more of an ambitious visitor than that of an enthusiastic future student.
“Yes! I’ll be here soon,” cried Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the leader announced that they had now entered the building for natural sciences.
“Wow, really,” she said thoughtfully, when she was told about the low professor-to-student ratio of school.
The College in Pennsylvania was the 7th, which the children attended on their three-day tour and now they have taken up the intended message completely: the question is not whether to go to college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is a growing concern about the large number of Hispanic immigrants born in the United States who do not end high school or become pregnant as teenagers, on the other hand, there are also hundreds of thousands who receive college education that is necessary to get into the middle class.
In fact, one out of five of these second generation - from Hispano-Americans to college - is a remarkable achievement, as many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the United States without completing high school.
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because they show the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the country's workforce.
Those who examine powerful children say they often have a natural affinity for school and a drive to success that they inhabit.
Many of them also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But counseling programs also play a major role by helping Graciela and millions of children like them to get to college, especially if these efforts persist over a longer period of time.
If you look at low-income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them find their way through the system, then at some point a single measure will not solve the problem either, Patricia Gándara, researcher at the University of California in Davis, who examined Hispanic students.
We need to think about providing a supportive network for these children from preschool to high school.
The federal program that Gracielas college tour funded is a useful example.
It is known as GEAR UP - Switching up a gang - and provides more than $300 million a year for local school systems to start college preparation programs that start when income-weak students are in middle school and continue running until they have completed high school.
According to the U.S. Department of Education, the program has helped more than 10 million students, more than 60% of whom went to college since 1999.
Iraqi Ministry of Oil concludes contracts with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has been able to bring about the reconstruction of its damaged infrastructure at two auctions concluded on Saturday.
The 10 contracts concluded with foreign oil companies from the Iraqi Ministry of Oil suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are ready to play an important role in the renovation of the Iraqi oil industry, which has been paralyzed for decades by war and economic sanctions.
American companies were only able to book shares in two of the 10 auctioned fields for themselves.
Seven American companies had paid for participating in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only company that has made a bid has pulled the curfew.
Two American companies were able to conclude contracts for fields auctioned in June.
The thinly sown representatives of American oil multis at the opening of the Iraqi oil industry surprised the analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after 6 years of war and instead of U.S. companies, presented the way to Asiatic and European, said Ruba Husari, the publisher of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service.
There will be no further offers in Iraq for a long time.
Security concerns highlighted by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday and political instability due to the withdrawal of the U.S. military have probably stopped American oil companies from engaging more strongly in Iraq, which has the third largest proven oil reserves in the world.
US firms were in some cases disadvantaged because competitors, especially Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower wage costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not have to account for shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that could conclude contracts with the Ministry.
Larger U.S. companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which maintain close relations with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and in recent years with technical advice, have gone empty.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main actors in two of the contracts promised this weekend.
The state China National Petroleum Corporation has offered more contracts than any other company and has been able to go home with large packages of contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, said the spokesperson of the Ministry of Oil, Assam Jihad, that China is on the way to become one of the Great of the World Economy and a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company will be able to compete with its partners and fulfill its obligations to Iraq.
For the bid, pre-selected companies made bids, which were then compared to the fee per barrel of oil that the Ministry was willing to pay to increase the output of each field beyond the current level.
Top planners of the Al Kaida apparently killed in Pakistan
In an obvious U.S. missile attack along the Pakistani border with Afghanistan, this week a top deployment planner of Al Kaida was to be killed, according to representatives of the US counter-terrorism on Friday.
This would be, if it were confirmed, the second deadly attack on a highly responsible terrorist organization in this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani government representatives, were killed by a number of missiles that hit their vehicle near the city of Miran Shah in the province of North-Waziristan on Tuesday.
Local authorities reported that the missiles were fired by a drone type used by the CIA in Pakistan's lawless tribal belt.
They drove in a white vehicle towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, said an official representative of a Pakistani civil secret service from Miran Shah by telephone.
Local residents who were suspected of belonging to the militants ran to the spot and quickly took everything left of the “completely destroyed bodies”.
The local authorities were unable to confirm the victim's identity, but two representatives of the U.S. counter-terrorism argued indeterminate evidence that Somali belonged to the dead.
Somali was described as the leading military planner of the Al Kaida, who led terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was involved in controversies around the world, noticed a senior official who wanted to remain anonymous, and pointed to the delicate nature of the US air raids on Pakistani soil.
If you take on its central role as a given, this included planning attacks against the US and Europe.
He accepted strategic instructions from the leaders of Al Kaida and turned them into operations planning for possible terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. government representative said that Somali had risen rapidly in the Al-Qaida hierarchy and maintained best connections to other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to some Americans, said the second government representative, but this does not reduce the danger he posed to us and our allies.
If his death were confirmed, Somali would be the second leading Al Kaida or Taliban leader who has been killed since September, when Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a military group in the tribal area and three other top activists were killed in a similar attack.
Since the summer, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, the pace of the CIA's attacks by drones has decreased from an average of six operations per month to two, a website maintained by a non-profit organization.
The decrease may be based on improved terrorist tactics, which have taken steps to reduce their accessibility and at the same time brutally kill suspect informants, reported the page.
Leading UN Ambassador to Kabul will resign
The UN's leading ambassador in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would resign from his office in March, which would end a stormy term of office which was thwarted by allegations of widespread corruption in the Afghan presidential election supported by the UN.
It was not until the Obama government decided to send another 30,000 US soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN messenger said that he supported the increase in troops, but he also expressed his concerns that the US timetable for military withdrawal, which is to begin in 18 months, could cause other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the construction of Afghan security forces and by sending the right signal to Afghans that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a phone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also forced the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian aiders to assist in the political conversion of Afghanistan.
The increase in troops on the military side must correspond to an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said that he did not resign his office, but only fulfilled an agreement made in March 2008 against his family to remain in Kabul for only two years.
He said he wanted the notification to UNO.
The Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is now forwarding so that he has time to make a replacement.
What I said is that he better starts looking for a successor, said Eide.
When I came here there was a two-month vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to UN representatives, Ban started looking for a replacement.
The UN representatives say that he has given consideration to the Swedish-Italian-Stammed Staffan di Mistura, who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad and to the Frenchman Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who previously led UN peace operations.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was put to trial after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the country's presidential election and of hiding evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide rejected all accusations, but he also said that Galbraith’s accusations, which had been fired, had undoubtedly caused damage to the mission, because there had already been a great deal of skepticism regarding international interference in the election,
Eide said he recommended the appointment of a leading civilian representative to coordinate the assistance of the American-led armed forces in Afghanistan.
He also insisted that the UN leadership allow his successor to employ more personnel from the United States and other Western countries who donate to the Afghan mission and said that this would strengthen their confidence in their money being used properly.
Eide expressed his disappointment at the restriction of his forces in Afghanistan and said that the comprehensive UN settings undermined his ability to bring in capable people.
The UN rules are designed so that since May, he said, I could only set one person.
This is disastrous and should not go on.
U.S. Secretary of Defense Gates: Iran must expect additional sanctions
Minister of Defense Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world powers will soon be subject to “significant additional sanctions” on Iran because he has not participated in discussions on his nuclear plans.
Gates spoke to a group of about 300 U.S. soldiers in northern Iraq during a seven-day journey through the war zones in Afghanistan and in Iraq, playing down the prospect of a military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In Iran there are no good options to choose, he said in answer to a soldier's question of the likelihood of such a development.
“One of the things that lie on my mind is if we have learned something from Iraq over the past six years, which has had its own improbability to the war,
The Obama government considers a sanction package aimed at Iran's military and political elite, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the average Iranian.
He said that a package of positive and negative incentives is needed to convince the Iranian government that it is in fact less protected with nuclear weapons, because \"their people will suffer unfairly\" from the sanctions.
On Friday, in an opinion by the White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, the U.S. government has joined the European top politicians in warning that Iran must expect \"faithful\" consequences if it does not comply with the demands of the UN Security Council and its Atomic Surveillance Organization, the International Atomic Energy Authority, with its nuclear programme.
Iran continues to claim that the knowledge of nuclear technology should be gained only for peaceful purposes.
During talks in Geneva on 1 October, Iran said that it would resume discussions on the restriction of its nuclear program and give up a substantial portion of its stock of enriched uranium in exchange for urgently needed nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor.
The U.S. government has pushed for this kind of agreement to build trust between the two parties and to gain time for negotiations.
Iran, however, seems to have left negotiations on the provisional agreements since then -- in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership disagrees as to whether they should commit themselves to the United States.
The fact that Iran has simply left the international Community in relation to some of the proposals which it had already approved in early October has, frankly, brought together the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, in a way that it has never been in conjunction with important additional sanctions for Iran, said Gates.
President Obama set the 31st Dec. as a deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals before pursuing other options, including those that Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton once called 'depressive sanctions'.
In an opinion delivered in New York, the Iranian representative of the United Nations condemned what she called the Thursday, groundless and unfounded allegations, some members of the Security Council on Iranian nuclear activities, and said that they are willing to continue the talks with the United States and five other world powers, in order to achieve an appropriate long-term solution,
Gates, who had to return to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in the morning before he flew to the oil-rich Kurdish region in Iraq to meet the soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish government representatives in Irbil.
The tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq continue to be high, especially with regard to borders, property rights and the distribution of public revenue.
Gates pushed both sides to lower the conflict potential to prevent delays in the US plans to reduce American troops strength from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also tried to dispel the Kurdish concern about the imminent withdrawal of troops. U.S. representatives quoted Gates, who said to Masud Barzani, President of the Kurdish regional government, \"We will receive your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a united Iraq.
We will not leave you,
A change of course in the older China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters who gave them lectures that “Mother Earth is too tired to entertain other children - and “A baby more means a grave more”
These lessons have taught them so well that, as government officials in Shanghai, who were suddenly beginning to change the course due to the low birth rate and the ageing population this summer, and encouraged young couples to have more than one child, their answer was immediately and definitively: “In no case”
We have already invested all our time and energy into a child.
For a second child there's nothing left, Wang said, 31, a staff manager with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, which has produced two generations of notorically thick, intertwined single children, who are lovingly called \"small emperors\", a population crisis rises in the country.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple compared to 6 at the time that this policy entered into force, the UN provides:
Department of Population Affairs, while the number of population groups aged 60 years and older in 2020 is expected to rise from 16.7% of the population to 31.1% by 2050, far above the global average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is stronger in rich coastal cities with educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and older people accounted for almost 22 percent of the population of Shanghai reported, while the birth rate was below one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, Head of the Shanghai Urban Population and Family Planning Commission, said that couples must get babies at a very reasonable age to help reduce the ratio of the ageing population and alleviate the lack of labour in the future,
Shanghai will soon be \"as old\" but not as rich -- as the industrialised countries, such as Japan and Sweden, said.
A gradual relaxation
In the constitution of the country in 1978, China's one-child policy is probably the most controversial one introduced by the ruling Communist Party to this day.
Couples who violate this policy must face enormous fines -- up to their triple annual salary in some regions -- and discrimination at their workplace.
Chinese state representatives attributed it to this policy that the critical use of natural land resources could be avoided, whereas human rights representatives condemned abuses in the enforcement of politics.
In rural regions, some of the pregnancies that already had a child have forced them to quit.
Many couples also had sex-selective abortions performed, creating an unnaturally high relationship between men and women.
In recent years, government representatives for the population have gradually weakened their attitude towards one-child policy.
In 2004 they admitted more exceptions to the rule -- including city dwellers, members of ethnic minorities and cases where both husband and wife were single children -- and in 2007 the tone of many harsh slogans was softened.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at the University of Beijing, said that government representatives have recently discussed even more radical changes, for example, allowing couples two children to be singled out for a partner.
Shanghai became the first Chinese city in July, which launched an aggressive campaign to promote more births.
Posters that taught families to have only one child were replaced almost overnight by guidelines that describe in detail who comes into question for a second child and how to apply for approval.
The City Administration has sent out urban employees and volunteers for family planning to visit couples at home and to push information sheets under the doors.
She also asked for psychological and financial advice for those who had more than one child.
The reaction was not just encouraging, said family planning representatives.
Disillusionmenting reaction
Although officials from a rural small town in the outlying areas of Shanghai said that an upswing in the requests of couples who want a second child after the start of the campaign, the urban districts report no change.
In the municipality of Huinan with a population of 115,000, as an example, only four to five applications still apply per month.
Disillusioned Shanghai officials say that the number of births expected for 2010 in the city will still be around 165,000 despite the campaign -- slightly higher than 2009, but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of the Shanghai municipality of Caolu, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want more children.
They want to give their first best, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would like to have two children and this would also be legally permitted.
But they have, like many Chinese, only a minor health and life insurance from the government.
Without a social network, they say, this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West are wrongly assessing one-child politics as a human rights issue, Yang said, a civil engineer whose wife is pregnant with her first child in the seventh month.
Yes, we are robbed of the possibility of having more than one child.
The problem, however, is not simply a policy.
The problem is money.
Other couples give psychological reasons for their hesitation.
Wang, the head of staff, said she wanted only one child, because she was also a single child. “We were the center of the family and we used to have everyone take care of us.
We are not used to caring for others and don't really want to do so,
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old who belongs to a translation company, said it unblemished.
For parents of the middle class with double careers, by which the birth rate decreases, he said, it turns out to be successful and for this one has to be selfish.
The age group of today's 20- to 39-year-olds grew up to see their parents fighting during the early days of the Chinese capitalism experiment and they do not want to live for themselves in any way, he said.
Also a single child, he said, places huge demands on the time of the parents.
A mother must give up her social life for at least two years.
Then there is the space question -- \"You have to rebuild your home -- and life planning -- \"If the child is 9 months old, you already need to have a CV for the best preschools\"
Most of his friends are willing to go through this once, Chen said, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to achieve a higher standard of living, he said.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
UN Group Designs Emission Reduction Plan
The climate conference supported by the UN -- which has so far been characterized by wild poses and mutual accusations -- has again focused on Friday with the publication of a document that will record an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gases for the next 40 years, with industrial nations having to shoulder the greatest burdens in the near future.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases, showed both the remaining obstacles and the way forward.
But it has been seen as an important step forward in a negotiation that takes time, as next week more than 100 top politicians from all over the world will arrive in Copenhagen.
The text formulated by a separate UN Working Group for this purpose is silent about the amount of money that rich countries should give to poor countries so that they can boost global warming in the short and long term.
It also offers a range of options for key issues, including how industrial and large emerging countries can reduce their carbon emissions and how high the upper limit of the global temperature increase that policy makers would contribute.
The process is given great flexibility, according to John Coequyt, executive representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who designed the six-page document, has compiled a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the leading climate protection representative of the UN, Yvo de Boer, called “the great whole.”
It shows the basis for a possible agreement, in which industrial nations would together reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by 2020, compared with the 1990 limits, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent over the same period.
Together, countries could reduce emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Community has also given the talks on Friday an incentive by ensuring that over the next three years, US$3.6 billion per year will be made available to help poorer countries adapt to the effects of climate change - from mastering floods and droughts to avoiding deforestation.
Friday still brought the same verbal fireworks that had determined the talks last week.
The U.S. climate regulator Todd Stern has rejected formulations that demand binding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialized countries, compared with voluntary reductions for larger emerging countries, if they are not financed by the industrial nations.
This train announced that the Obama government is heading a harder line with China, as representatives of the Bush government not even two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without the rise of larger emerging countries and take measures, so Stern, who also complained that the text did not go far enough to ensure that the reductions could also be confirmed by outsiders.
Stern gave his opinion one hour after the Chinese Foreign Minister He Yafei's statement, which stated that it was either a lack of reason or a lack of responsibility to the leading American climate negotiator at the beginning of the week that he said that the United States would not help China financially to master global warming.
As a result, the future economic march of the great world powers has taken place both within industrial nations and between industrial nations and emerging economies.
The current struggle concerns the salvation of individual economies, as well as the salvation of the planet, with China and the United States, because of their corresponding obligations, while poorer countries claim that the two dozen most influential countries would ignore the scientific necessity to take more courageous measures.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the great powers are fighting about who should bear the cost of braking greenhouse gas emissions, as even affected countries have moved more aggressively to draw the countries with very high greenhouse gas emissions to account for their actions.
This is clearly a game that will develop a new economic predominance, according to Ulate, who is also active as a regional climate change consultant for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries most exposed to the impact of climate change stated that they would continue to struggle for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although the leading participants say that the talks will in the best case lead to a political agreement.
The alliance of the small island states with 43 members presented a 24-page draft contract on the early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who runs the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the offensive of the small island states exerts “political pressure on the entire political process,” partly because they are now united and demand measures from emerging countries, such as China and India.
The talks got a new urgency when the delegates focused on the fact that most open questions had to be clarified even before the arrival of the leaders to reach an agreement.
High-ranking representatives, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Vice-Ministers, escaped their planes and rushed through the corridors of the Bella Center to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences to cut off claims that will be negotiated during the next week.
The pure extent of the assembly -- 13,000 people enter the congress centre every day, guitar-playing activists organise nightly shows where they make fun of the countries that they think are betraying and selling, and contract designs are passed by hand rather than by e-mail -- already presents a challenge.
The intensity is only developing: almost all important ministers are now here and from Wednesday they will be 60 Heads of Government in Copenhagen.
We come to the Oberliga, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice-President for Global Policy of the Organization Conservation International.
The heavy weights come.
UK first 225 km/h fast train defines Monday feeling new
On Monday morning at 5 p.m. 13, a pipe will penetrate the darkness to announce a train departure that represents a revolution in traffic in Britain.
The first high-speed passenger train in the country will reach 225 km/h from Ashfort, Kent, to London St. Pancras, and 93 km/h in 38 minutes.
To Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, Dame Kelly Holmes will then board the first Javelin Pendler service from London.
He hopes that the new service Great Britain will eventually connect to an international rail network faster, more reliable trains, and will connect the large conurbations of the Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could become living commuter cities, working hours would be radically reduced, and the change of aircraft and car to train would reduce national carbon emissions and congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three major parties believe in this vision.
But the many billions of British pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable planning battle and fears of environmental damage could still be a brake in the UK's high-speed rails.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company founded in January to provide the government with a feasibility study, the Times said Lord Adonis will submit the report on 30 December.
This gives it a detailed route map of the next planned stage of the high-speed rail network.
The new railway line to connect London to the West Midlands will pass by a space of five metres to urban areas and to places where the impact on the environment is controversial.
In the free area, the plan will show the concept within a distance of 25 metres from the final route.
HS2 is also intended to create three options for a larger, northward leading high-speed rail network.
Lord Adonis will respond in spring.
The preferred proposed option is a Y-shaped route, where a single high-speed route would lead to the West Midlands.
The route would divide in or near Birmingham and a branch would lead west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another to the northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
“It seems to be the best functioning option,” said a railway insider.
After completion, travel time between London and Edinburgh would decrease to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first section, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow travelers to reduce the London-Birmingham route in 49 minutes, compared to a little over an hour today.
The designs offered the trains the opportunity to travel at a speed of 400 km/h, making the British rail network the fastest in Europe.
The first route was planned in such a way that 400 meters long trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 people can drive on it.
Up to 18 trains could be on the London-Birmingham line per hour.
This would, in turn, mean that in London a final station would be needed, on which 20,000 travelers per hour could be completed.
Given the spatial restrictions in the capital, it is expected that an existing railway station would be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Railway experts say that only St. Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether this plan should continue in his opinion or not, but the lengthy public consultation and planning measures mean that a final decision will only be taken after the parliamentary elections.
But even if it sets the wheels in motion, the rail network must be built in sections.
The trains would first have to switch from high-speed routes to existing rail routes in the north of Birmingham, which would continue to allow travel time between London and Scotland to exceed three hours.
This is considered to be a crucial point of knocking in order to ensure a change from aircraft to train, a measure of direction for the rail revolution.
Tax payers come up for mortgages for 75,000 pounds of a conservative
Alan Duncan, the leading member of the headquarters of the Conservatives, has charged thousands of pounds to the taxpayer each year for the cost of an orangery that he was able to build in his home in his constituency.
The jail speaker of the party, who was degraded by David Cameron, because he complained that underhouse members had to live by lean rations, raised his mortgage by 75,000 pounds to build an oak-wood factory at his second house in Rutland.
He allowed the taxpayer to charge the additional interest income, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
The representatives of the lower house approved the applications at that time, and they were also not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who carried out a review of the expenses of the lower house members. Last night Duncan said that the applications could have been, not even more clean or understandable.
Duncan, one of the richest underhouse members, owns a two-storey house in a village in his district of Rutland and Melton.
Nearby houses have reached a purchase price of almost one million pounds (1.1 million euros).
The ground floor includes kitchen, living room and dining room, but the Fees Office, a place to spend control of the lower house, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year he built a winter garden called the \"Orangery\" in the plans.
Neighbors described him as a \"Glashaus für Entertainment\"
Duncan was also not invited to comment on raising money during a recent investigation of his previous mortgage agreements by the Committee on Standards and Privileges.
The Committee released it last month after an examination of its expenditure on breaking the rules.
In 2004, Duncan transferred the security for a mortgage of over 271,406 pounds (300,000 euros) from his London House to his constituency, which he had bought in 1991, a year before his election as a Member of Parliament.
This week's published documents show that Duncan received approximately 1,400 pounds (1,500 euros) per month as a mortgage interest by March last year.
In April, his claims increased to more than 1,800 pounds (2,000 euros) per month.
The interest rate of Duncan's RBS mortgage has not changed during this time, suggesting that the total increase in the funding of the revenue was 75,000 pounds (85,000 euros).
The normal levelless RBS mortgage interest decreased from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March of this year, where it is still standing.
The latest documents published by the Unterhaus show that Duncan continued his claim for 1,250 pounds (1,400 euros) per month this May.
Duncan lost his post in September as the opposition leader of the lower house, after an undercover reporter filmed him when he said after the spending scandal that parliamentary members would live \"of lean rations\".
“In essence, working for the state means that one has to live by lean rations and how S****e is treated,
He said: “I have spent my money on my garden, and I have raised a claim for a disappearing small portion, measured by what belongs to me.
And I could have demanded the whole damn sum, but I'm not doing it,
The Member of Parliament, millionaire from his former career as oil wholesaler, was attacked for his spending the first time in May, as it became clear that he had requested thousands of pounds for his garden before he had explained with the Fees Office that this could be seen as excessive demand,
An activist, as a protest in Duncan's lawn, dug a hole in the shape of a pound mark after it became known that he had claimed 4,000 pounds (4,500 euros) over three years.
When he was questioned about the increased mortgage last night, Duncan said: “This was approved by the Fees Office as well as by Legg to raise value.
He added: “There is no debate on deviations and perspiration or an association of rules or similarities.
Everything is perfectly transparent and moves strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It could not be cleaner and clearer,
Come all your believers to admire Brighton's beach hut Advent calendar
Beach huts in Brighton have found a new life content for the winter months as an interactive Advent calendar.
“Beyond - an alternative church group that encourages spiritual discoveries through creativity, 24 owners have invited to decorate their huts with Christmas songs as a theme for every December day.
The event started on December 1st and visitors were allowed to watch the latest cottage every day from 17:30 to 18:30 with free mug wine and traditional Mince Pies, with dried fruit-filled pastries.
The so far selected Christmas songs are \"I saw three ships\", \"O come\", \"O come\", \"Emmanuel\" and \"The first Noël\", where the cottage decoration is the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an honorary minister of the Chichester Diocese and head of Beyond.
He said: “We want to make religion more important to people in a post-Christian society.
Why do we, as a church, expect people to come into a strange old building? I think the church should go to the people and organize enthusiastic celebrations.
The idea of the beach hut Advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends at dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastically creative and lively place and we try to express this through our spirituality,
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world for climate.
Tens of thousands of people around the world on Saturday and in Copenhagen have demonstrated to demand an ambitious and committed agreement on the fight against climate warming, where the police have made several hundred arrests.
At least thirty thousand people according to police, one hundred thousand according to the organizers, marched in the cold of the Danish capital, on the edge of the United Nations Climate Conference, which would lead to a conclusion by Friday, which could enter into force from 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish chairman of the Climate Conference, increasing mobilization in the world contributes to the climate, which is illustrated by these demonstrations that the \"political price\" of a failure in Copenhagen would be very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital took place a short time after the train passed, when a group of 300 demonstrators, dressed in black, had smashed shoe windows with patchstones and hammers, established a journalist of AFP.
Anti-unruly police officers have intervened immediately and without consideration.
The police have announced that, according to your assessment, most members of the Blacks Blocs were arrested in April, these extremely violent splitters, which have already become famous at the Nato Summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the demonstrators of the demonstration, has laid down the conditions under which hundreds of militant followers had been arrested, without discrimination, and has stressed that about a hundred of you were kept in the streets every Saturday evening, despite the extreme cold with handcuffs and sitting positions.
The more peaceful train has gone from Parliament towards the Bella Center where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 metres from the building without trying to get in.
A stage was installed to welcome the intended speakers, for an evening of candlelight, taking part in the former South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
Most of the demonstrators traveled from major European cities with bushes and trains, but also many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were present, as well as some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most of you with sky blue rain coins, have made a first appearance in Copenhagen in the morning, as you have followed the call of Earth's friends to form \"blue tides\" for climate adjustment.
Today we are going to the streets to demand a resurgence of environmental debt for the benefit of the south, said Lidy Nacpil, Philippine activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't move on and say: we have time, said Angelique Kidjo, singer from Benin.
There are rivers in Africa that dry out, watercourses where you can walk, as it has never been the case in the past.
For the first time in the history of climatic diplomacy, founded in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Agreement, the movement of critics of globalization has approached environmental organisations.
European deputy José Bové, the shape of the Globalization Critics, announced that he came to Copenhagen to link \"Climate Justice and Social Justice\": \"Today there are no differences between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world\"
The Asia-Pacific area, where many islands are located, which are particularly endangered as a result of warming, has provided the initial shot for the demonstrations.
About 50,000 people, according to the organizers in Australia, went to the streets.
In Manila there were several hundred people, mostly students who marched in red and hated bandanas in which you famous the solar energy.
In Hong Kong or in Djakarta, but also in Canada, marches of several hundred demonstrators took place in order to demand a vigorous approach to climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the network “350” gathered several hundred people, namely in Paris, Marseille (Southern), Lille (Northern), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
Some people have gathered in Geneva.
The separatist Abkhazia has elected its president, Georgia denounces that it is a “striking” here.
Abkhazia has elected its president on Saturday, which happened a little more than a year after Moscow recognized this pro-Russian separatist Georgian territory as independent, Tbilissi denounced the \"striking\"
About 131,000 people were called to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgian war of August 2008 for control of the South-Ossetian area, another Georgian secessionist area, recognized by Russia.
The electoral venues have closed GMT at 5 p.m.
Electoral participation was approximately 58% a few hours prior to the election, according to the Abkhazian Electoral Commission.
The first preliminary results should be announced on the night from Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including the previous president, Serguei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemns the election.
These elections are a farce.
On the other hand, the Georgian President, Mikheil Saakachvili, regrets that Abkhazia is now under a secure total occupation, said his press spokesman, Manana Manjgaladze.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognised the independence of this region with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world perceives it as a part of Georgia occupied by Russia.
After it separated itself from Georgia during the conflict between 1992 and 1993, with thousands of people dying, Abkhazia would like to prove by this choice that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, a new era, as an independent state, has declared Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claims to have chosen Herrn Bagapch.
She was one of the electors who went to choose a choice location located in a school in the capital Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian dominance is the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful landscapes on the black sea.
Large signs on which Bagapch is seen on the side of the Russian President and Head of Government, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are located throughout this small area, which has 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, located in the east of the country, the district chief, Beslan Archba, has prepared a warm welcome to the Russian representatives who have come to monitor the election.
We, the Abkhazian people, are grateful, he said at a small celebration, as an indication of the support of Moscow, especially with regard to the decision to acknowledge Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that soon your country will be recognized by the United Nations, Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian Parliament, answered and raised a glass of vodka.
On the other hand, the opposition, represented by the former vice president and two Russian businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticized the agreements made with Moscow last year, as the one in which Abkhazia left Russia to control the railway for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banba, claims to support neither the current government nor the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is necessary to win the election.
If none of the candidates reach this limit, a second round of elections must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: Demos around the world, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated throughout the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding treaty from the copenhagen climate conference, where the police, at any time ready for action, arrested about 700 people, at the edge of an important demonstration.
Thirty thousand people according to police, hundreds of thousands according to the organizers have demonstrated in the afternoon cold in the Danish capital, which by December 18th will receive delegates from 193 countries seeking an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
From Parliament, the peaceful train marched towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 metres from the center and did not try to penetrate.
A stage was built to welcome the intended speakers for an evening with candlelight, taking part in the former South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
Some moments after the train had passed, a group of demonstrators, dressed in black and armed with bricks and hammers, began to strike discs, found a journalist of AFP.
Anti-unruly police officers have circled you immediately and have intervened without consideration by throwing some of you on the ground.
The police have announced that 600 to 700 people were arrested and have made it clear that they are mainly members of the Black Blocs, these extremely violent splitters, which have already become famous at the Nato Summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
In the evening, a police officer suffered an injury by a patchstone at the chin during the incident, in which about twenty people were temporarily arrested. Four vehicles burned near an occupied house.
“We have the extreme groups in hand,” said Henrik Jakobsen, the police spokesman, while the helicopters of the order forces were on the air.
Most of the demonstrators who traveled by train or by car from German major cities, from London, Amsterdam or Milan, were Europeans.
However, there were also many Asians, including Chinese and Korean, and Africans.
Almost 3,000 people, mostly in the sky blue rain coat, formed in Copenhagen in the morning after the call of the \"Friends of the Earth\" to become a first group to represent the \"blue seas\" for climate justice.
“Today, we go on the road to demand that environmental debt be paid back to the people of the south,” said activist Lidy Nacpil of the Jubilee South Coalition of the Philippines in Copenhagen.
“We can no longer say: We still have time,” says the singer Angélique Kidjo from Benin.
“In Africa there are rivers that verge, there are watercourses through which one can walk, which was never the case before,”
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was launched in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of globalisation opponents has approached environmental protection organisations.
French MP José Bové, who is a European Parliament and critic of globalisation, said to AFP that he had come to Copenhagen to \"connect climate justice and social justice\" \"There is no longer any difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world\"
The organization Oxfam has mobilized several personalities, such as the Danish model Helena Christensen or the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, who turns to the masses.
The Asia-Pacific area, where many islands are particularly susceptible to global warming, has given rise to demonstrations.
In Australia about 50,000 people have gone on the road according to the words of the organizers.
In Manila, several hundred people, in the majority of students, dressed red with bandanas, made advertising in front of the city administration of the Philippine capital for solar energy.
In Hong Kong and Djakarta, hundreds of demonstrators have also gathered in an action against climate change.
In France several hundreds of people were gathered during the demonstrations organized by the 350 network, especially in Paris, Marseille in the south, Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the west and Lyon in the east.
In Geneva several people gathered.
The subjects of geography and history are, according to Chatel, strengthened by the school reform of high schools.
In an interview published in the Sunday newspaper \"Journal du dimanche\", National Education Minister Luc Chatel stated that subjects of geography and history are coming from high school reform, even if they are not taught mandatoryly in the terminals (12th year of school).
“The students of the Première (11st year of school) have now confirmed all four hours of the week and the same program - Mr. Chatel.
The Minister must overcome this hypocrisy because, according to him, \"the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile, but rather a concentration of the best pupils.
“The economic-social and literary profile (ES and L) should not become a sub-profile of the scientific one,” he said. “I have not yet heard many historians and intellectuals who would have been upset by the lack of historical-geographical education in the terminals on technical lyceen,” he said.
On Saturday, an IFOP survey published in Humanité revealed that nearly seven out of ten French (69%) criticise the state project of removing compulsory teaching in history and geography in the S (12th year of school with scientific profile) terminals. Many teachers and intellectuals also had to cope with this project, as well as the links and some representatives of the rights.
The Minister replied, however, that there was no question as to restricting the philosophy of the programme of terminals S.
Luc Chatel also defended the educational reform for teachers, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) called for a protest against the project for Tuesday, which, in her opinion, will fall victim to the educational training of future teachers.
The Minister stated that they were undergoing a professional qualification examination in Master 2 (M2) at the beginning of the year and that at the end of the year an approval examination will be carried out to examine their teaching skills.
They also perform internships during the year in M2 and then teach one year in front of the students as teachers in the internship.
He continued: \"If you add all the internships offered before the performance test, you will reach even more hours that you spent in front of the students, i.e. more than 300 hours,
The Minister finally stated that he wants to offer the individual right to education - a matter which does not exist in public education -
He confirmed once again that he would like to abolish the school card until 2012.
15 minutes for the climate at the Ecole Normale Supérieure
Fifteen minutes to talk about the commitment at the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, had to deal with on Saturday morning at the Ecole Normale Supérieure at Rue d'Ulm in Paris.
As a journalist of AFP found, Nobel Peace Prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first of the “Ernest” conferences, at which experts turn to the audience for fifteen minutes with filmed contributions.
Eduard Hannezo, 22 years old and one of the organizers of this day, on the edge of the conference, said that the name of this event goes back to the name of the students who gave the fish to the bassin of the school.
\"The experts were selected by the twenty discussion participants, even after their charisma, he specified.
“Climate warming can be talked about for hours, but the core goals can also be set in a few minutes,” said Jean Jouzel of the AFP, who before about 50 people spoke freely with the help of films.
“This is part of our role as a scientist,” he stressed in the hope that listeners might learn that “the Copenhagen conference is based on an absolutely serious scientific dossier,
The videos shot by these conferences will be available online from December 15th on the school page.
The next \"Eernest\" day is scheduled for February and will take place every two months thereafter.
late payment : angry prison guards, actions planned
The unions of criminal justice officials called on a general day of action on Friday to achieve that the premiums and overtime paid for budget reasons were transferred before Christmas holidays.
The second union of criminal officials, F.P.P.P.ITENTIaire, called on the employees, who have no duty to demonstrate and block it on Tuesday morning in front of the criminal justice institution, in order to draw attention to the \"the theft of what they are about to do.
The 3rd union of criminal law officials, CGT-Pénitentiaire, called for a strong mobilisation in the various prisons, on which the non-payment of the excess hours, night extras and Sundays in October will be burned as 'forgivable and unacceptable' in December.
The first union of criminal justice officers, the Autonomous Federal Criminal Institute Union (UFAP/UNSA), called for \"general mobilizations (...) to show dissatisfaction and anger,
The management of the criminal justice institute and the Ministry of Justice said that overtime has increased significantly in 2009 and that not all were planned in the budget. However, they guarantee that the remaining claims will be paid in January.
As the Ministry of Justice announced in the evening, Michèle Alliot-Marie sent a letter to the unions of law enforcement officers guaranteeing that the payment will be made next month.
“I am very well aware of the efforts of staff to keep our criminal justice system operational and modernized,” the Minister of Justice informed us in this letter.
\"I have ordered the management of the criminal justice institution to take immediate action so that such a situation, which has resulted in a lack of assessment of the overtime occurring, will not be repeated in the future, added Mrs Alliot-Marie.
The December wage thus falls short, except for the managerial staff, who enjoys high service and target premiums, the UFAP/UNSA explains for which the \"budgetary constraints\" must be maintained.
“This is an absolute scandal - the FO interregional union in Marseille is upset and announces to boycott all meetings and meetings up to new instructions.
“The staff will not go to work on Sundays and holidays, if the hours of October in December are still not paid. This is also true for their overtime hours - the FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne also threatens.
“In a time when more and more tasks are being imposed on us without more staff being hired, the attempt to enrich ourselves with staff funds is more than inappropriate, according to the Bordeaux CGT Association.
According to trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, and some are less affected than others.
In any case, however, it is wrong, stated the Secretary-General of the UFAP, Jean-François Forget.
Obama believes that he always distributes Christmas better gifts than he gets himself.
The American president, Barack Obama, who will spend Christmas with his family in the White House for the first time, has complained to the TV-talkmaster Oprah Winfrey that he always distributes better gifts than he gets himself.
On a special show broadcasted on Sunday evening via the ABC Channel, the president and his wife Michelle were able to see how they would spend the holidays in their new illustrious home.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family, will be with the party.
“Santa Claus loves Bo too,” Michelle Obama affirms, adding that the dog of course also receives a gift.
Michelle Obama rejected her husband's assertions about the quality of the gifts. “I made you beautiful gifts last year - she fucks the president.
“So please, ” he complained, “and pointed to the first lady’s pearl chain: “And who gave it to you?”
While this one-hour broadcasting in an unbridled atmosphere with the well-known television moderator Barack Obama had so vehemently supported during his election campaign, the president and his wife also talked about gifts they loved most as a child.
Barack Obama remembered a bicycle with ten courses and also a basketball that his father, whom he rarely saw, had brought to his Christmas from Kenya.
“I remember seeing my father once at Christmas and bringing me a basketball,” the president said.
“First in my life, I understood that I had this ball from him, ”
The First Lady reminded her of her doll house.
“I didn’t know how to arrange the furniture in one house at all, so I put them all on the wall instead of grouping them around the fireplace. But I loved this little doll house,” Michelle Obama told.
Johnny Hallyday again operates, RTL confirms that he has been transferred to the artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was operated again in Los Angeles due to significant damage after an operation in France. According to the people around him, the situation was under control, although RTL confirmed that the singer was transferred to the artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock musician was reoperated from Wednesday to Thursday at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles on the night after the American doctors found “damaged by the operation of a tape disc incident,” which he had suffered in Paris on 26 November, according to his production company in Paris, which added that these damages would have required a new operation.
The singer's production company nevertheless wanted to clarify that the situation was \"under control\" and announced that a new medical report would be available in 48 hours at the latest.
However, according to RTL, the partner during the final tour of the singer, Johnny Hallyday was transferred to an artificial coma to avoid “smercing and complications.
Only after 48 hours, however, had a little more certainty about the patient’s condition when he opened his eyes added RTL.
At the request of the AFP there was neither a confirmation nor a comment from the production company.
RTL also confirms that after its first operation in Paris, \"no draining has been carried out\" from certain sources.
The rocker had been operated at the Parc Monceau International Hospital for a disc incident.
The surgery planned for several days was performed by the neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor who had already treated many stars.
This was not available for comments to RTL on Thursday evening.
After Johnny Hallyday's operation, the singer was delivered to the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday due to a follow-up infection after the surgery.
On Thursday, the singer Eddy Mitchell, who is very close to Johnny Hallyday, felt that his friend was going through a “deep valley” right now. However, he assured you that you don’t need \"no worries\" to make the rock musician, since this is a good fighter.
“He had called me before he left for Los Angeles. I told him it was a mistake to put himself on an airplane for twelve hours after such an operation, that didn’t go that way,” Eddy Mitchell said.
On Wednesday evening, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, confirmed that Johnny Hallyday was “good at responding to antibiotics and that “inhibited infection”.
Mr. Camus also explained that he had spoken with Laeticia, the woman of the singer, and that he did not feel any particular distress.
Nevertheless, the concern about the singer's health had increased ever since he was hospitalized in July nine days after he fell on his yacht.
Two months later, to the general amazement of this, Johnny Hallyday had a “small intestinal cancer OP, which led to a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer recorded his long Tour 66 as a farewell tour as planned.
Since then, however, every health problem has been widely commented on. Fans and journalists have not escaped that the singer had difficulty moving on stage.
It was not until mid-November that the people surrounding him had to dement a return to the hospital.
Euro-2009/Short Railway: First place for Bousquet over its favorite distance
On Thursday, the French Frédérick Bousquet, three-time medal winner at the 2009 Swimming World Championships, won an international title about its favorite distance, 50m freestyle, at the Euro-2009 on the short track in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition, on which the polyurethane suits were allowed for the last time, there were only three world records, while a true record flood was expected.
A record was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 4 x 200 m layers and the other two by Russia at 4 x 50m layers of men.
Damage to Bousquet, who wanted to grab the 50m freestyle world record, whose record he holds in the large basin (20.94).
At one of the two kingly distances in swimming, 50m-freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman claimed himself in 20.53 sec. in a final with ten swimmers at the start (usually eight) - a premiere at international level.
Bousquet forced the Croats Duje Draganja (20,70) and the Russian Sergey Fesiko (20,84), but he failed to break the world record (20,30) as planned.
“One can always believe bigger and in the present case I have said that if the world record is in my reach, I will try to do so “
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers started in polyurethane suits, which are prohibited from 1 January 2010.
With 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations end their Epos in Istanbul, which began for the first time in 1999 during the same competition.
The combination has been used this time for the German Paul Biedermann, two-time world champion in the basin this summer in Rome and world record, not paid out at the end.
The young swimmer has not been able to improve his best time of 400m freestyle (3:32.77), yet he has spent the second best time in his career (3:34.55), in front of the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danes Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
“I haven’t given everything this time.
I knew I couldn't get a world record today, but I defended my title and fulfilled my task,
“Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future,” Biedermann explained.
USA : graveyard at Zola estimated at $1.5 million
A Roman tomb plate, which appeared to the French writer Emile Zola, was estimated to be worth $1.5 million on Thursday, according to Sotheby's art dealer.
This plate is two meters long and 63 cm high. It dates from the IIIth century after Christ and has always been rated with $150,000 to $250,000.
The marble, on which “four scenes of the Dionysus in a sophistic architecture decor, surrounded by satyrene and Bacchus figures, is a rare piece. There are only four or five of them in the world, explained Florent Heinz, Vice-President of the Assumption of Roman and Egyptian Antiquities at Sotheby's, on Tuesday opposite the AFP.
It was sold among hundreds of pieces.
“The sale is still running, but this part is certainly what the buyers have so far offered most of,” says the spokesman of Sotheby’s, Dan Abernethy, to the AFP.
The discovery of this acquisition of the marble part by Emile Zola goes far back.
The record was at home for almost 300 years in Rome in the famous collection of the Borghese family, after which she appeared in pieces with French actress Cécile Sorel, who found use in her bathroom of her Paris hotels and with Paul Reynaud, Minister in the III French Republic and President of the Council before Marshall Pétain came to power.
The next fifty years are in the dark.
When searching the Louvre database, Florent Heinz discovered that this record was part of a “Embly Zola legacy,” which was opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of the “Thérèse Raquin” and the “Fresko”-Rougon-Macquart.
Zelayas exit attempt from Honduras towards Mexico has been destroyed
On Thursday, Mexico had declared the conditions for the transfer of the fallen Honduran President Manuel Zelaya on domestic land as no longer compatible, after the coup had rejected this line as unacceptable by the coup government.
After a telephone conversation with President Zelaya that night, everything seems to indicate that there is no agreement on the possibilities of carrying out this transfer, the Mexican Minister for Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa, said.
According to the immigration authority, the aircraft submitted by the Mexican government, which had arrived in Salvador on Wednesday for the purpose of the transfer of M. Zelayas, returned to its destination.
The coup government wanted to ask M. Zelaya for \"repudiation\" and for political asylum under guidance for him abroad.
However, the fallen president refused to do so because he wished to return to Mexico as the welcome head of state.
The coup regime \"has suffered a resurgence by trying to give up on my expense (...), they wanted me to resign - said on Thursday M. Zelaya to Radio Globo, in which he has frequently spoken since the beginning of the political crisis that has been continuing in the Central American country for five months.
I can stay here good and happy for ten years, here I have my guitar, added the crashed president, who had fled to the Brazilian Embassy of Tegucigalpa two and a half months ago, under attacks of some chords.
The Mexican Embassy has presented us with a request for guidance, but unfortunately we cannot accept it, since it does not include a request for asylum, on Wednesday Oscar Raul Matute, Minister of the Interior of the Push Government, had declared against the Honduran radio HRN.
In no country for asylum, I had answered Manuel Zelaya in an interview with the Telesur Channel, which is located in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras, he had stressed, would only take him as president of the Honduran people.
On Wednesday, the rumors of an outing M. Zelayas had mobilized the supporters of the fallen president who had opened up for the Brazilian Embassy and gathered around them, and the military had intensified its commitment.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the position of the coup government.
This, according to his assessment, revealed the marginal character of this government in view of international standards.
Zelaya, who had approached the socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, had fallen on 28 June, on the day of the popular survey organised by him to prepare his reelection, against the advice of the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
He returned from his exile in Costa Rica on September 21st, and had fled to the Brazilian Embassy.
He leaves this, he is imprisoned for high treason, of which he is accused by the judiciary, according to the coup government.
The coup president Roberto Micheletti succeeded in organizing a presidential election on 29 November to dismiss M. Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo had been recognized by the United States in the course of the controversial election, by the Latin American countries, such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil, on the other hand.
Three days later, the cogress had voted massively against M. Zelayas' return to office until the end of his term on 27 January.
Wall Street in the upswing, the United States trade balance feeds optimism
On Thursday, the New York Stock Exchange concluded with a high, the figures of the American trade balance testify to a price recovery of the United States shares and their partners: the Dow Jones has reached 0.67%, Nasdaq by 0.33%.
According to the figures at the end of the stock market, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has increased from 68.78 points to 10.405.83 points, the Nasdaq, in turn, dominated by technology, from 7.13 points to 2.190.06 points.
The extended Standard & Poor's 500 index was written at 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1.102.35 points.
There is good news from different industries, Lindsey Piegza of FTN Finance judged.
However, this remains anecdotal under the premise that the market is focused solely on “half glasses”, so it reduced.
According to Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are primarily fixed on the figures of the US trade balance, which shows an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter.
The United States trade deficit fell by 7.6% to $32.9 billion in October as compared to September.
In contrast, analysts were expected to increase in deficits.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The great novelty is the increase in the total volume of trade, especially in goods exports, which reflects the economic growth of the United States' main trading partners, said Christopher Cornell from the company research economy.com.
In return, unemployment in the United States has risen at all expectations last week and has now reached the level of 474,000 requests.
However, during the last four weeks, when the average for new jobseekers fell to the low point of the year, Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors stressed.
The bond market has fallen.
The profitability of government bonds to 10 years has increased to 3,482% compared to 3,432% of Tuesday's evening, the profitability of bonds to 30,492% over 4,408% of the previous evening.
Cuba: Hundreds of Partisans in Power Pfeifen -Damen in Weiss - from
On Thursday, a few hundred partisans standing in Cuban power expelled the wives of political prisoners from Havana for the purpose of the World Human Rights Day, as well as a different scapegoat, because of which a good dozen dissident was temporarily arrested.
In order for the forty women in Weiss to be married or close political prisoners, the government's partisans were picked up under Raul Castro, just as they were on foot in the centre of the capital to demand the liberation of the political prisoners, a journalist confirmed the AFP.
Low with the Yankies!, \"Söldner\", \"the street belongs to the revolutionaries\", \"It lives Fidel and Raul\" the authorized partisans with raised fists rocked the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civil agents who appeared to ensure their protection,
A similar demonstration against the \"Damen in Weiss\" had taken place in Havana on the eve of the evening, in which there had been neither injuries nor arrests.
In the Havana district of Vedado, on the other hand, a dozen dissidents, who also took part in the demonstration on Thursday in the face of the International Day of Human Rights, were temporarily arrested by civilians, confirmed a reporter from the AFP.
According to this journalist, the police forced dissidents built by the government to enter into civilian vehicles under the use of force.
The temporary detention of dissidents under such circumstances is usually limited to just a few hours.
As a candidate for the Sakharov Prize awarded by the European Parliament in 2005, the women in Weiss organized an unauthorised march for the purpose of the \"Please for the release of all political prisoners\" whose number, according to the dissident list, of about 200 persons, one of the leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Hector Maceda, is sentenced to 20 years in prison.
M. Maceda belongs to the group of 75 Cuban dissidents imprisoned in March 2003, from which to date 53 are behind grids.
The Cuban authorities feel the regime opponents as 'söldner' or 'agents' in the service of the declared archenemy, the United States.
A rarity in itself is the fact that Cuban television reported on the demonstration events that took place on Thursday between militant pro-government fighters and counter-revolutionaries.
Cuba, led by a unitary party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of impeding rights and freedoms, in particular freedom of expression.
Insanity kills eighty-eight years with the knife and leaves 5 wounded in Clichy-la-Garenne
One with two knives of armed madness on Friday against late afternoon at the main business time in downtown Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Sine) killed an eighty-seven and injured five more people.
According to the first survey, the 28-year-old attacker had injured the eighty-year-old from previously unexplained cause in or before a pharmacy on the Boulevard Jean-Jaures with two knives, and this, according to police information, under the presence of witnesses.
The old man, born in 1929, is the result of his injuries, according to a police syndicate Alliance in the hospital.
In or before the same pharmacy, he linked a couple to a pregnant woman.
The man, about in the three-sixties, has intervened and was injured.
The first two victims were severely killed in the hospital, where the eighty-year-old died.
The other injured person is at risk of life, as according to police sources, vital organs appear to be affected.
The pregnant woman has become ill as a result of the events and is supposed to have been hospitalized in the state of shock, according to a police source.
The armed man, who seemed to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs according to police records, should immediately have escaped the street, which is the same as Boulevard Jean Jaures.
He would have injured two more passengers, apparently by chance: a thirty-six and a forty-six-year-old, the latter by both heavy.
The scenario remained in the dark in the evening.
He had been armed with two flesh knives, which he wore crossed behind the back, declared on the spot Arnaud Pressé, a responsible member of the Syndicate Alliance of the Hauts-de-Sine area.
Several passersby, including young people, should have tried, according to the AFP’s evidence, to bind up the mad.
I saw a guy in the three-sixties with a green vest.
Three young people tried to step in.
They didn't make it because the guy was well built, Alberto reported, a waiter of a nearby bar.
A horde fell upon him, he added, including a city policeman who broke his wrist.
Still on the Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at the height of house number 61, two city police officers, including her superior, tried to arrest the armed man and were injured with knife strikes, according to police information.
The event took place in one of the main battles of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there is a number of shops.
Passengers have come to me to tell me that there is an injured person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old person lying on the ground, I put her in first-aid position and noticed a clapping wound in the stomach area, told Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, the AFP.
Five minutes later, a second person, about thirty years old, was injured by cutting wounds.
The authorities of the State Police have finally arrested the man who did not carry identification papers.
The prosecutorship of Nanterre has commissioned the District Conference of the Criminal Police of Hauts-de Seine (SDPJ 92) to clarify the case.
The madman was hospitalized on Thursday evening.
In view of his condition, he has not yet been heard in court.
A police source does not exclude him from being delivered to a nervous ward.
According to another police source, there were six police officers in order to bind him to the Clichy Police Commissioner, where he had been carried off.
He was in a state of exaggeration, like \"all the spiritual confused of this kind, in which the forces were set free during the Tathergang\"
USA: Polanski's lawyer once again calls for the suspension of criminal prosecution
The lawyer of the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski has called for the repeated painting on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, western United States) to drop the criminal prosecution against his clients, who are currently in his place of residence in Switzerland due to a seat disturbance of more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, lawyer of the director of the “Pianist” has accused three judges of the appeal court in the second district of California of gross trial errors at the time of the trial in 1977.
Before he added that the conduct of the Judge Laurence Reittenband, who had been charged with the case, allowed a cold to run down the back of him at the time of the trial, said M. Hummel,
According to him, the now deceased judge Rittenband, before falling his judge's right, had discussed with a prosecutor who was supposed to have told him that Roman Polanski had earned breeding house, which represented a grave procedural error.
This discussion was launched in the documentary “Roman Polanski: wanted and desired” (Roman Polanski: persecuted and coveted), specifically by the prosecutor David Wells in question.
M. Wells had finally declared at the end of September that the authors of the documentary had been \"beyond\".
Should the Court refuse to terminate the criminal proceedings, Mr Hummel would require the management of a process which would allow him to present the evidence for his argument.
On the other hand, the prosecution has repeated the evidence already explained in the first instance, i.e. that a discussion on the abolition of the offences charged to the accused cannot be seriously considered, as long as Roman Polanski does not appear before the court.
The 76-year-old director had fled the United States in 1978, even before the announcement of the penalty measure for \"illegal sexual relations\" with a minor of 13 years.
Since that time, he has not traveled to the United States.
The deputy prosecutor of Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, had stated that Roman Polanski must be “da to attend the trial”
Would you like to spread the message in this matter, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, who escape is a way out?
In her opinion, the filmmaker is asking the Court for a favor and therefore disregards its authority,
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to announce their decision, even pointed out that there are other refugee alternatives.
Hummel was not the only one who had applied for the imposition of criminal prosecution against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also demanded the suspension of the criminal proceedings.
She recalled that her client would no longer bear to be harassed by any reviving of the Polanski affair and added: “No one in this room can say that this procedure was just.
Thirty-two years are enough,
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland, at the instigation of an American arrest warrant.
After spending two months behind the grids, he was then sentenced to house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad, expecting a possible extradition.
Wall Street is slowed by the rise of the dollar and shuts down without a price.
On Friday, the New York Stock Exchange closed off without price in a market that was torn between better than US indicators and an increase in the dollar: the Dow Jones won 0.63%, the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
Based on the final figures available for closing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen by 65,67 points to 10,471,50 points while the technologically dominated Nasdaq has placed 0.55 points to 2,190,31 points.
The extended Standard & Poor's 500 index increased by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106.41 points.
“Certainly, the market is quite quiet,” stated Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
\"It remains very limited, the volume of trade has become very low and I think this will remain so by the end of the year,
The trend has been supported by the publication of better economic indicators than planned, which have contributed to improving the market view on the solidity of the economic recovery, together with the analysts of Charles Schwab.
In the US, retail sales in November increased by 1.3%, which means that two months after each other and far more than planned.
Furthermore, the confidence of American consumers has improved significantly in December, at 73.4 compared with 67.4 in the previous month, according to index preview of the University of Michigan.
However, the indexes were hampered by a new rise in the dollar rate, which has reached the highest level over the euro for two months, thus pushing ''the sectors susceptible to the economic situation down', said Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
The technological values have thus lost something on the ground.
The bond market has declined.
The return on the treasury bond over 10 years has risen by 3,540% on Wednesday evening compared to 3,482% and the bond over 30 years to 4,497% compared to 4,492% of the previous day.
Miss World election again in South Africa
After a month's tour through South Africa, the 112 candidates for Miss World's title will cross the last hurdle on Saturday to realize their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world and to watch this in front of a billion television.
During this great beauty fair, which will be held for the second time in a row in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already reached their ticket to the semi-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were selected to Miss Sportive or Miss Topmodel during their African stay.
This was a true strudel of pleasures.
Beautiful cities to visit, such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Hoorn, was simply exceptional.
I've seen many things and had lots of experiences!, Miss Sierra Leone said with great enthusiasm.
This competition will take place for the ninth time in South Africa and will be broadcast live on Saturday, at 5 p.m. (15 p.m. in Central European Time) from Midrand, north of Johannesburg.
I couldn't imagine a nicer country to hand over my crown.
This experience was just fascinating.
I am happy to have made this experience twice, highlighted Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of South African summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges of experience with candidates and the rediscovery of \"athem-causing landscapes\".
After a month of gala, rehearsals, encounters with the press and Safari, the miss now focuses on competition.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to step into the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, who was elected in 2000 and will also be present in this election, as well as imitating Aishwarya Rai, who was elected in 1994 and became both Bollywood stars.
It is, of course, the dream of every woman to be crowned once as the most beautiful woman in the world, but it is not just about the appearance here.
We are ambassadors of our country and I want to come home with the crown, throws Miss India with a broad smile.
According to the organisers, this 59th edition is underlined with music and dance.
The candidates are defiled in traditional dresses and not to forget, in the bath suit.
The performance is presented by a television moderator, the Chinese Angela Chow, by the ex-beautiful queen from South Africa, Michelle McLean and by a responsible member of the Miss World Committee, Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it has the world with a little to offer warmth and pride to receive, assures Julia Morley, Chairman of the Miss World.
The candidates made a safari, as last year, visiting the famous township in Soweto, but this time by bicycle and local cuisine.
The meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who gave them his hand, was very unusual.
Not usual for a head of state, Miss Sierra Leone noticed.
Her most beautiful memory, however, remains undoubtedly the release in Cape Town (South West) to the World Football Championship in June 2010, a kind of country, to throw a little more for this event.
I'm wrong with people I could probably never approach.
I will certainly return to the 2010 World Championship, promising Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
The news about Johnny Hallyday, according to his son David, is very positive.
The news about Johnny Hallyday is \"very positive\" assured his son David on Friday on his arrival at Los Angeles Airport, where he visited his father, who has been in the hospital there for a few days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, everything is running very well, David Hallyday told the press when he left the plane, in which he arrived from Paris shortly after 1 p.m. (21 MEZ).
The singer's son, who made a relaxed impression, assured him that he would enter the Cedars-Sinaï hospital on Monday, where Johnny Hallyday was delivered to Paris on November 26 because of a bacterial subsequent infection following an operation at a tire disc incident.
The singer was put “this night in Los Angeles into an artificial coma to alleviate his severe pain and to perform his treatment, the press service announced.
Johnny Hallyday was transferred by the doctors of Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles to an artificial coma, in which he was delivered to Paris on Monday because of a bacterial subsequent infection following a tapestry operation on 26 November.
The singer had to undergo another operation on the night from Wednesday to Thursday due to the sick changes caused by the last intervention.
On Friday morning, his wife Laeticia attended a school event in the French high school of Los Angeles in which her daughter Jade went to school, she found a photographer of the AFP.
The head of the orthopaedic and traumatic surgery department at the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer at the Los Angeles Hospital on Monday.
The producer severely burdened the neurosurgeon Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who operated the singer at the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris on 26 November.
We were told that he set up the purest massacre.
The surgeons of Los Angeles said they were completely disarmed, said Mr. Camus.
I heard that maybe you're going to initiate a court proceedings, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday has traveled to Los Angeles far too quickly and this has been done with the permission of the Paris surgeon,
I personally phoned this doctor, who assured me that he viewed this trip as completely unproblematic, which was very surprising, since I already had two tape disc operations behind me, he added.
Shortly before, he had announced at RTL that the singer had apparently left the hospital after the operation, without drainage, without anything.
Dr Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artist environment.
He had operated the actress Marie Trintignant, a few days before her death in Vilnius, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he practiced at that time.
In 2007, he also operated the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to absorb a hematoma after brain bleeding.
However, he is also a doctor with a doubtful reputation, who has been sentenced several times because of failed operations and not to forget because of tax withdrawal and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, lawyer of the Board of Doctors, called him \"a man without scruples\" who has to be \"responsive\" to the board of directors and \"everything else as recommended\".
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux gave a statement on Friday about his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
This said that the intervention would have been “perfectly ongoing and the post-operational investigations would have been “normal”.
The surgery called for no bleeding and therefore did not require drainage, he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have been running since late summer, seems to be in question.
It is quite clear that it is a little too short for a continuation of the tour on January 8 (in Amiens), said Mr. Camus.
The UDF Party Alliance (Union for French Democracy) becomes energetic and urges the Nouveau Centre Party to stop using its seal
On Friday, the Party Alliance, supervised by François Bayrou's MoDem Party, reacted to a victory attempt by the party once founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, on the side of the president of the Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morin, and urged him to use this seal on no longer a document.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to take over this UDF seal, as he believes that François Bayrou would not be worthy of defending this political legacy after he had reached the left hand.
The Minister of Defense, whose party partner is UMP, also wanted to reaffirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
He had received support from Mr Hervé de Charette (former UMP, now with NC), who claimed the ownership of the UDF as the first to request it at the National Institute for Industrial Affairs in 2004.
However, the office of the UDF party alliance supervised by François Bayrous's friends silenced and made it clear that they did not disqualify and set a time limit for the minister and the honourable Member, under the threat of judicial persecution, to cease using this seal and to transfer it to the property rights of the brand.
In the last few days you have made numerous statements that you would suggest your political movement to +take over the UDF seal+, the party alliance wrote in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 office members, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the MoDem Party and Senator Jean Arthuis of the centrist alliance.
You also believed that you would have the right to print the name of this movement +Nouveau centre+, the slogan + today's UDF +, on its political material and on the website of your website.
As you know, you have no right to use this seal, the UDF's office explained and urged the NC party to \"remove the mention of the name UDF from all material as well as from (their) website\"
Furthermore, it was requested by Hervé de Charette - to transfer the property rights of the brand to its statutory owners -
If you refuse to do so, we will bring an action against you to respect the law and to defend the legitimate rights of UDF members, warning the signatories.
In their letter, they emphasised that since 1978, “UDF has been a full political movement and reminds us that Morin and his friends “have taken the choice” to leave them in 2007 in order to establish a competitive movement, as others had already done in 2002 to establish the “UMP” party.
The Nouveau centre party therefore has no rights to use the UDF seal (Union pour la démocratie française).
They continue to recall that the last UDF Congress adopted the three-year accession to the MoDem Party in 2007, as well as the establishment of a business office to defend “the material and moral interests” of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As far as Hervé de Charette is concerned, the office continues, \"at the time he applied for the brand name, he had not been a member of the UDF for three years, but of the UMP.
He benefits in scandalous and fraudulent ways, from the lack of deposit of the acronym UDF to carry out this for himself.
In addition, you should bear in mind that this carelessness is in the best way to turn into a crime, and ironize the NC's strategy: \"We seem more worthy in politics, as well as in life, to make ourselves a name instead of trying to get out of anonymity by, in a fraudulent way, applying a name to which one has no legal claims,
Affaire Liliane Bettencourt : François-Marie Banier is condemned for exploitation of weakness
On Friday, the Court of Nanterre decided to judge the artist François-Marie Banier in order to determine whether, as the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt claims, he had used a weak moment of eighty years to swallow up part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, who is known for his star photographs, will have to be responsible for exploiting weakness in court on April 15 and 16, 2010, a crime that is punished with a maximum imprisonment of three years and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will in fact be a process in this affair worthy of the Saga one of France's richest families in which mother and daughter fatten themselves and at the same time have the reins of the cosmetic imperium L'Oréal in hand.
However, the 15th Criminal Chamber also ordered a medical examination of the 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt, which is jointly conducted by three doctors.
The Erbin and the Chief Actress of L'Oréal has so far refused to undergo such an investigation, particularly under the conditions provided for by the Nanterre prosecutor's investigation.
The doctors appointed on Friday will present a report before 10 March 2010, which will tell you clearly whether and at what times Liliane Bettencourt may have found himself in a state of weakness.
I think she'll undergo these investigations.
I'll talk to her, the lawyer of Mrs. Bettencourt, Me Georges Kiejman, after the trial.
As far as the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, is concerned, he is very satisfied with the decision of the court.
This is an excellent novelty (...). The report will prove that he (Banier) manipulated this old lady, who has to be protected, he affirmed.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter has initiated a criminal lawsuit against François-Marie Banier, photographer and all-round artist, and accused him of exploiting her mother's weakness for years to cover up donations of a total of one billion euros in the form of bank checks, insurance policies or paintings.
On the other hand, Liliane had always refused to be manipulated by the photographer, whom she sees as a long-standing friend.
Although the court had to examine the admissibility of Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers' action, the pleas of the lawyers on Friday resulted in a large family debacle.
For example, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer called for three of his client's letters to her notary (1999, 2003 and 2005), in which she wrote that she distrusted the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyer.
According to her lawyer, Liliane Bettencourt added: “Please tell my daughter that I have written to Banier for fifteen years, once or twice a day.
Since I married Françoise, I have never been able to speak since she married,
The prosecutor of Nanterre is again of the opinion that the applicant had no right to respond in such a way, especially because in the last few days a guardian has refused his request to initiate a judicial protection proceedings against her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt is fully legal, is not under protection and has no warrant.
No one has the right to act in their place - confirmed the representative of the prosecutor, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
The court has now decided to issue a judgment after the trial for the admissibility of Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers took place.
Manager revolution or the end of Strategic Early Enlightenment?
If nothing changes to the leadership of the large French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been for nothing ...
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies in relation to its employees, said the position of the companies vis-à-vis consumers before the marketing revolution: it is for the staff to join, values, determines the best, as it used to be, on the consumer products, to be dependent on the technicians in the factory.
By putting the customer at the heart of the companies, the marketing revolution has given the strategies of conquering the markets in the place ... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products separate factors on customers' preferences again regularly!
Demobilisation of employees can lead to fatal demoralization.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the tip of a much larger phenomenon that affects employees in particular.
This demobilisation has a negative effect on the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, especially those of F&Eund, which is even more crucial for those of economic intelligence.
In fact, the IE ( Intelligence Economist = Economic Intelligence) - of all parties involved (...) calls for proactive action and a forward-looking approach - it claims from the employees a commitment which fully contradicts the instructions of authoritarian management.
That is why we are calling for an operational revolution, which would involve putting the employees at the center of the company's concerns equally next to the customers.
The very conditional benefit of internal polls
Will internal polls, such as the questionnaire, which Orange has submitted to its wage recipients, encourage this revolution in terms of management practice?
I'm afraid, unfortunately.
First of all, because I was able to find that the whole fabric in view of a new situation after many reasons finally reached the priority of doing what it always did.
Also because authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power - increases proportionally to the importance of its own failure.
And finally, because most executives have a highly simplified idea of human behavior.
Starting from the major engineering schools, their interpretation of psychology is mechanistic.
By intellectual comfort, they take over the old behaviorist theory, which has recently been reactivated by the U.S. - neurosciences - and has been unwittingly widely disseminated by research institutes and the media.
Thus and by suggesting that it is possible to launch the \"hebel\" (sic) to engage employees, a current Le Figaro.fr survey published by Ipsos strengthens the executives in an attitude towards a mechanistic control system that is inappropriate for today's world.
Identify and measure the mobilisation factors
Instead, a business revolution necessary for the smooth functioning of modern enterprises requires the adoption of a definitive view of human behavior.
It is to integrate a fundamental protocol in any consideration or practice of governance: the commitment of the company to the beneficiaries is only possible if it clearly appears to be a means of achieving some of their dreams, their ambitions and their projects.
At present, only the studies from the multifunctional analysis take on this concept of motivatement of employees.
These studies have shown that they assess their company on the basis of a given doxa, which allows them to assess what it offers them to achieve their life goals through their perceived image of the company.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilisation factors, the managers of the companies can control, predict and predict their social performance and place their human resource management back in the right place.
They create a fertile soil that is favourable for the coordinated development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
Oslo's speech: the “just war” brings Obama praise from the right
On Friday, American rights welcomed Barack Obama's speech held in Oslo on the eve of the evening and was pleased that the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009 defended the concept of the \"just war\" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives who had mocked the award to Obama on October 9 this time applauded the President's speech, following the example of the former Vice-Presidential candidate in the 2008 election of Sarah Palin.
I liked what he said, Palin explained the face of the right wing of the Republican Party in the daily USA Today and added that she herself had spoken about the theme of a \"sometimes necessary\" war in her own published memoirs.
The war is, of course, the last thing I think Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We have to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who has inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, has tried to justify the use of force in Oslo on Thursday; a way to explain his decision from nine days ago to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, expressed the view that the president had done very good work in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really very good, and the former president of the House of Representatives, who particularly acknowledged the reference to \"the existence of evil in the world\" in the words of Obama.
In some parts, I felt this speech as historical, Ginrich, who was interviewed in the radio broadcast \"The Takeaway\".
The previous Member, who is regarded by some as a possible candidate for the 2012 Republican nomination to the 2012 presidential election, said that he was pleased to have seen a \"president of the Left\" who reminded the members of the Nobel Committee that they were \"not free and could not afford a price for peace if the use of violence would not exist\"
For Michael Gerson, former writer of George W. Bush and now editor at Washington Post, Obama has held a very American speech.
In addition to being a ‘cosmopolitan’, as it always does, he, like an American president, spoke when he pointed out that Europeans are living in a safety bubble that they have not created themselves and that they do not do much for their protection, according to Gerson.
Among the few unconvinced rights, former UN ambassador John Bolton, a fake of the era Bush, described the speech on the website of the National Review Online as “slow, high-level and uninspired“
To the left of the president, democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is alarmed at how Barack Obama defends the armed forces.
Packing the war under the cover of justice, the massacre can be easily justified to the innocent, he warns.
However, the press of the moderate left will continue to be commendable on the side of the President.
The Los Angeles Times, which still believes that the Nobel Prize was awarded to Obama, called the address itself a speaker like him known for his talent as “Monumental Work”
The speech in Oslo offers a roadmap to control international decisions against the conflicts, poverty and oppression, so the California daily inspires.
The New York Times believes that Obama “proclaimed the necessary discourse, and calls his speech “dark and exemplary at the same time”
Drivers: Three marathons for an agreement that ensures the supply of Christmas
After a three-week negotiation marathon, the trade unions of the road association and the TLF - the only employer organization that remained to the end - came to an agreement on Friday evening ending the strike order and the threatening heavy supply passport at Christmas.
At the signature meeting on Friday evening, the Secretary of State Dominique Bussereau, who was responsible for transport, welcomed the agreement, which was launched on Wednesday morning after several weeks of negotiations.
After a second night of negotiation, the negotiators separated in hopes of signing the agreement on the late morning.
And this although the three employers' associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had left the meeting.
However, it took more than six hours from the beginning of the meeting at 11:00 until the conclusion of the agreement and only at 18:00 was the agreement signed.
The conflict “had caused a great deal of damage to the company, and it was to be feared that it would affect the holidays at the end of the year, as Bussereau said.
The agreement provides for a 4% increase in wages for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest wage groups (international transports).
The hourly rate for workers with the lowest wages thus rises from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros.
“That’s not a lot, but we’re starting a little bit,” said Patrice Clos (FO).
Activists are now required to stop blocking supply centres.
\"There will probably always be some contradictions, however, which are not satisfied with the agreement, he adds.
The TLF chairman Philippe Grillot spoke of a \"good agreement\" although it was difficult to give these wage increases in view of international competition,
According to him, the increase is 170 euros monthly for the low and 100 to 120 euros for the high pay groups.
“This agreement is based on the sound understanding and respect of employees,” says Maxime Dumont (CFDT), whereas Thierry Douine (CFTC) spoke of “an historic agreement”.
Richard Jaubert (CGT) expressed himself in this regard on \"an acceptable compromise\"
The agreement also provides for an increase in travel costs by 3% and for the maintenance of the total road transport budget in the first half of 2010, which will enable, in particular, to address the issue of 13 months' salary and the modernisation of collective agreements.
M. Bussereau recalled that \"the reduction in taxes for employers of EUR 100 million was the subject of an amendment by the Government on the draft law of corrected finances for 2009, which was adopted by the National Assembly on the night from Thursday to Friday.
The Government calls for an identical vote from the Senate.
The signature of the TLF allows the agreement first to apply to the undertakings affiliated to this organisation and then to apply in case of an extension by the Minister of Labour for the entire professional status.
This will be the case “in the shortest time,” assures Bussereau.
The opposition of employers' associations can only delay the procedure.
The FNTR Association called for 'deductible trade', because the EUR 100 million had already been promised to the sector to compensate for a portion of the carbon tax,
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but to avoid drowning the Gans eaters on the near Christmas days, the Unostra complains.
For the Otre Association, the agreement is threatening to raise a large grave for small and medium-sized enterprises in the industry over the next 12 months.
Line RER A: Disruptions this weekend, trade unions are not satisfied with the proposals of the RATP
The disturbances on line RER A, the largest motorway network in France for the Greater Paris area and the Île-de-France, continued on weekends, while a meeting on Friday, the 2nd day of strike between trade unions and the management of the RATP (independent Paris passenger transport administration), allows strikers to continue to wait with their demands for wage increases.
At this important shopping weekend before Christmas there were no trains between 10:00 and 20:00. On the central line (between La Défense and Nation) only one of two trains and outside the central line was only one of four trains ready for use.
The connection to the trains of the SNCF was interrupted in Nanterre Préfecture, which forced travelers to change.
The Galleries Lafayette department store chain, which counts 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that \"the RATP is trying to connect the big businesses technically,
The line RER A passes through the Paris Balling Room from west to east.
The section of the RATP connects the towns of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre, as well as Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday about one of two trains was scheduled for the main traffic time, and almost none during the low traffic time.
As already on Thursday there was no crowd on the railways, as the residents of the Île-de-France had turned to the situation.
So early in the morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less crowded than usual, especially because of the lack of gymnasiums.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, engineer (29), said he would have stood up an extra one-and-a-half hours earlier to get to work on time,
The SNCF, who had planned to provide services to travelers by staff and regulars, pointed out that there had been no interruptions at Saint-Lazare station.
The trains operated from the SNCF on line RER A or towards Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or sailed over Saint-Lazare station to ensure the connection to the metros.
On Saturday and Sunday, general meetings of the strikers were held again, during which the results were reviewed, which the associations had classified as \"durable\" after the meeting with the leader on Friday afternoon.
The RER Managing Director proposed the specific preparation of a protocol for line RER A with regard to all relevant aspects, working hours, professional careers, etc.
However, this is not what the drivers want. According to Thierry Garon (Sud), they demand a long-term wage supplement.
The CGT was outraged that the RATP itself put its wage increases in brackets and stressed that the lead “is not able to solve a problem, while this was also possible for the long-distancers and the SNCF.”
The RATP made it clear that a new meeting would be planned for Monday to \"completely examine working conditions\".
This also shows the associations that the company “ignores the weekend drivers”
In the morning about 150 drivers were looking for a committee in Paris.
It was renewed that it rejected any discussion during the strike until date, and a meeting after a calming of the situation.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened to expand to line RER B after an announcement by Unsa and Independants.
The associations demand a wage increase of 120 (unsa) to 150 Euros, of which 30 Euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Independants). In addition, they complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this route on which millions of travelers travel daily.
The riders of the line RER, who have years of professional experience, receive a gross wage of 2,200 to 2,700 euros and a salary of 600 to 650 euros for shift services as well as Sundays and holidays.
Turkish Constitutional Court dissolves pro-Curdic Party. Decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court announced on Friday the dissolution of the pro-Kurdish main party of the country; a decision followed by immediate angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision threatens to make the work of the government enormously difficult, which seeks to reach the Kurdish community in order to put an end to the conflicts that have been raging for 25 years.
The party for a democratic society (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a \"state of activity detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity\" according to Hasim Kiliç's president four days after the decision was made to the press.
According to Kiliç, the decision would have been unanimously taken by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes required to be suspended. Moreover, he pointed out that 37 of the leaders of the party, including President Ahmet Türk and Parliamentary Aysel Tugluk, were excluded from political action for five years.
Furthermore, the judge announced the abolition of parliamentary immunity that Turkey and Tugluk enjoy, as well as the confiscation of the party's goods.
The DTP now has 21 seats in Parliament (of 550).
The party leaders said before the verdict that Parliament would rather leave Parliament than act as a partyless parliamentarian.
The decision followed a procedure initiated in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Turkish Federal Court of Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya. He accused the DTP of following the \"shows\" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many other countries.
Numerous observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
However, the party assures that there is no connection to the PKK, but refuses to call it a terrorist organisation and calls on the government to negotiate.
The decision of the Constitutional Court functions between the Government, which is committed to countering the Kurdish community and proposing a number of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurds, in order to defend the support of the PKK by the Kurds and put an end to the conflicts.
The leaders of the DTP confirm that a resurgence of tensions in South-East Anatolia could result in numerous demonstrations against the terms of detention of the PKK chief Abdullah Öcalan in recent weeks led to clashes with the police.
Since the announcement of the court, thousands of demonstrators gathered in front of the DTP premises in the million city of Diyarbakir in the southeast, mostly populated by Kurds.
The order forces used tear gas grenades and waterlights when the demonstrators began throwing molotov cocktails and stones.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
According to the judgment, Türk assumed that the decision of the court “will deepen the despair even further.
\"Turkey cannot clarify this (Curdish, d. editorial) question on the basis of a party's ban, he explained to the press.
The government, consisting of a party resulting from the Islamist movement, also regretted the decision.
“We oppose the closure of the parties by principle.
This does not solve the problems, according to Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
\"This decision is a torpedo of the democratic opening which was supported by the government, according to the political market observer Ahmet Island.
“You can obviously focus on a reaction of the PKK, ” he adds.
On Thursday, the PKK was known for an attack that killed seven soldiers in the north of Turkey three days earlier, one of the most brutal attacks in recent months.
The snow break can come
A really crisp winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to harass the citizens, says the winter service manager of the FES.
So that its employees can try and master the entire vehicle technology.
In the weekend it could be so far for the first time, according to meteorologists.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
The FES will proceed according to a precise plan.
As soon as it snows flat in Frankfurt and temperatures are below zero degrees, 20 so-called A-strips with large-scale vehicles will be driven off, explains Brauburger.
These include major traffic and transit roads such as the Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
But also fire access, public transport routes, pedestrian zones and routes with falls, such as Atzelbergstraße.
The FES service begins at three in the morning.
The approximately 1040 kilometers would need to be scattered in a maximum of three hours with moisture salt, which is better liable.
That's why the FES starts at three o'clock at night, \"that's why the routes are free until professional traffic starts\"
It would be difficult if it only snowed at 7.30 p.m.
Then we have a problem, says the winter service manager, \"because no one is ready to make the scattering vehicles take place\"
Only after that, if it does not continue to snow, are supply and opening roads, including the Council-Beil-Straße, along the line.
The last priority is sideways and sideways.
There will be complaints, we know Brauburger.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES foot people are given priority on the road, danger points and transitions.
The FES is usually unable to take care of all the bike paths.
There is a special service in Frankfurt, which keeps an eye on the bridges from 22 to 4.30 p.m., says Brauburger.
Since it gives on this quick smooth, as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees, the scatter is on the way.
If necessary, they will also be called by the police.
The cradle of dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like many other meat-eating dinosaurs: the two meters long and 1.50 meters tall animal ran on two strong hind legs, had a long skull with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with sickle collars and a long tail.
If the species had lived a few million years later, it would have been nothing special.
But Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body characteristics, reports Sterling Nesbitt from the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the journal Science of Thursday.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in today's New Mexico, which was then in a dry zone of the Pangäa supercontinent at the equator.
Tawa opens a new window to the early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
He shows us much about the relationship, the spread and characteristics of early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began digging on the Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
We have sometimes found a dozen dinosaur-knot one day, which is unparalleled for deposits from the trias, reports team member Randall Irmis from the Utah Museum of Natural History.
Some of the bones quickly identified the researchers as new species.
In the course of excavation, they gathered the remains of a total of five individuals.
Fund confirms theories about Dino Early History
The name Tawa comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it is an extraordinary finding: \"Dinosaur fossils from the trias are extremely rare, most of them only single pieces of fracture are found,
Other dinosaur experts do not necessarily share enthusiasm.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander from the University of Bonn.
The dinosaurs first appeared some 230 million years ago after the current teaching.
However, many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, which is why the assignment of these Ur-Dinos is usually controversial.
For example, the experts are debating when the oaks split into their three main development lines: the meat-frozen theropods, which later included the Tyrannosaurus rex, the Velociraptor and the birds, which were known as \"long-haul\" four-legged sauropods and their relatives, and the plants eating Ornithischia (bird basins), among which were, for example, the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
After the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hallae is an original theropod.
It shows an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
At the skull of Tawa hallae, researchers found, for example, clues about air bags, as they also possess the descendants of the theropods, the birds.
Thanks to the air sacs, the breathing of birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
In Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were apparently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropod with air bags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related line of the huge Sauropods later also had air bags and light-building knots, it is likely that the common ancestor of both groups had already produced this useful innovation.
At least three migration waves to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs had lived in South America so far, researchers have concluded that the echoes appeared there for the first time.
Thus, the three development lines separated early and spread from South America across all the continents, which at that time still formed a single landmass as a supercontinent of Pangäa.
For this reason, the fact that the team together with Tawa hallae found the remains of two more, not particularly closely related theropods.
The three cannot be descended from a common immigrant ancestor, the researchers argue.
We believe there were at least three waves of migration to North America, says Alan Turner from the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the science study.
There are also contradictions, of course.
An even older species, Silesaurus, belonging to a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in present-day Poland, says Bonner Paleontologist Martin Sander.
His opinion might be distorted, because in South America there are just a lot of primitive Dino fossils preserved, while on other continents there is hardly anything to be found.
How the dinosaurs managed to develop from a relatively rare sideline of the reptiles strain to the dominant land vertebrates of the Earth's Middle Ages is still mysterious.
During the Trias, the dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of today's crocodiles and the airsaurs and with numerous other echoes.
Towards the end of the Trias, dinosaurs spread around the world and developed many new species, while the relationship at the border from the Trias to the Jurassic.
Success story did not last forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There may have been a mass death that the dinosaurs accidentally survived, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted so they could beat the competition out of the field.
The success story did not last forever.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact helped a group of animals to flower, who had also developed in the trias and since then had eaten up a shaded area: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
Professors at the University of Toronto are located at the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley in California.
There are lecturers from Naples from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police space of the occupied casino of Frankfurt Goethe University is beating waves worldwide.
278 professors and lecturers of Goethe University, but also of universities throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America solidarity with the protesting students on the campus Westend.
In a statement written in German and English, \"misfavourable\" they are the police intervention initiated by the Bureau.
University President Werner Müller-Estler had left the building occupied by students and teachers in the education strike in the past week because walls and works of art had been mutilated.
Five students were injured.
The damage, the signatories judge, did not justify \"the violent dissolution of self-organized courses of students and teachers by a police command\"
The space represents an “unacceptable intervention” in the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves to \"deligitize and criminalize the protest\" and distract from the content.
The Bureau withdrew from the necessary discourse.
The lecturers call for the immediate attitude of criminal persecution.
The majority of the occupiers did not support the damage, it says.
Protest legitimized
The youth of the Verdi trade union and the German union federation also solidarity with the students.
The protest is legitimate expression of a growing concern for one's own future, says Verdi Country Youth Secretary Alexander Klein.
Hessen's Minister of Science Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) defended the actions of the United President and the police.
We are grateful to the President-in-Office.
Destruction and occupation are completely unacceptable means, she said in a current hour on Thursday in the Wiesbaden Landtag.
We have understanding for the protest, but no understanding for vandalism, according to the CDU Landtag deputy Peter Beuth.
Otherwise, the opposition factions saw SPD, Green and Left.
The CDU takes painted walls for a pretext to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (left).
Instead of dealing with the students' arguments and demands, one has cleared up.
The Left has submitted an application requesting the Minister of the Interior to report on the use of police.
New Silicon Valley
For many years it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to western visitors.
Selenograd, one of ten districts of Moscow's capital, was in the Soviet Union a strictly guarded site for secret arms research.
Today, the municipality with its 216,000 inhabitants, 37 kilometres from the Moscow Centre, is considered the \"Russian Silicon Valley\"
Significant research and production sites for micro- and nanoelectronics are located here.
Since September 2008, representatives Selenograd had established contacts with the Frankfurt Science Location Riedberg - with the university institutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were several visits to each other and on Wednesday, Selenograd and Riedberg signed a protocol for closer cooperation in Frankfurt.
Moscow Vice-Chairman Juri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation, signed for Frankfurt planning deputy Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of FIZ and small and medium-sized companies will travel to Selenograd for a seminar of the scientific research focus.
Scientific exchange
This is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
FIZ companies are allowed to walk on the growing Russian market.
Conversely, Russian science companies want to take orders in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electron Engineering, the large corporations of Sitronics and Rossijskaya Elektronika.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a \"socialist planning city\" for arms research.
Selenograd (literally translated \"Green City\") received its name from the forested hill landscape in which the research facilities are embedded.
Stuttgarter Brakeklotz
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be adjusted high enough.
For the supporters of the project, it is simply and simply a matter of \"the new heart of Europe\"
S21 is much more than laying down a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project, which will overthrow the city of the Baden-Wurttemberg state capital for a decade in a cureless construction site chaos.
Stuttgart 21 emerged from the spirit of the 1980s.
Headway stations with tracks that ended in the middle of the city were then considered to be 19th-century transport fossils, which acted like brake blocks of modern rail, as it once took a lot of time to span locomotives from the back to the front.
Enter, hold short, continue - so you should go.
And that's why the main railway stations should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a transit station, which is about half the route of the trans-European rail magistrate between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava, is therefore the slogan of the \"Herz Europas\"
S21 is now actually being addressed, although the visions of the 80s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have recognized that in the Hessian and Bavarian big city it is almost unpaid to implement the downswing.
However, headway stations no longer have an entry and exit problem, since there are modern turning trains with motor vehicles and steering cars at both ends.
Nevertheless: Stuttgart 21 next to the ICE new construction line to Ulm is now under way.
National and municipal politicians have enforced it.
The railway is involved, also because the risks of the largest single infrastructure project in the Republic are borne by taxpayers and not by the State Group.
The project can still be justified in a number of ways.
It creates new urban space, which - one believes the computer-generated graphics of the planners - is equipped with lots of green.
For the rail transport system, S21 is harmful.
The railway station and the extension of the route are designed for passenger transport, to which huge growth was attributed - typically in the 80s.
At that time, there was not yet the competition of the cheap flyers.
However, modern transport policy must first be to strengthen freight transport, as transport on the rail is much more environmentally friendly than by truck on the road.
However, the new construction line is not suitable for freight trains due to heavy increases.
Even more serious is the fact that S21 is indirectly tangenting to many other railway projects.
A total of six billion euros will be spent in the Swabians.
That's the official number.
Experts think ten to 15 billion are realistic.
In the next decade, the money will be missing at other nodes and bottlenecks in the network.
A total of sixty major projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the extension of the well over 180 kilometres long route through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987 the road has been built in the time-looping pace.
It would be urgent to press the tube right here.
But S21 will act as a brake pad.
The Rhine Valley is becoming a bottleneck for international freight transport: in the heart of Europe.
Government verifies judgment on the airport
The state government has left it open in the Wiesbaden Landtag whether it will go into revision against the judgment of the Hessian Administrative Court (VGH).
The CDU/FDP Coalition has commissioned experts to legalize the more than 400-page VGH judgment, said Minister of Economic Affairs Dieter Posch (FDP).
The VGH in Kassel had written on this day that the country had to re-regulate the night flight ban in case of construction of the planned north-west railway at Frankfurt Airport.
The approval of 17 flights between 23 and 5 a.m., as the State Government provides, is not compatible with the legal protection of the population from nightly air noise.
The coalition must decide whether it is against the judgment in revision by 4 January.
The opposition criticized this move and urged the representatives of the government to refrain from a revision at the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD group leader Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel called on CDU and FDP to return to their promises made before the election to a night flight ban. Otherwise, this would be worth \"word break\".
It's fucking hard to keep his word, said Green-Chief Tarek Al-Wazir in play on the FDP election slogan \"We're holding word \"
Minister Posch rejected the allegation of Schäfer-Gümbel, but the state government tried to arrive at their night flights with \"right-winging and trickery\".
An accurate legal examination takes their time.
The coalition does not want to operate on the basis of a \"fast first impression\".
We need a right-wing decision, Stefan Müller (FDP).
As they represent the opposition, the statements of his group on the night flight ban had never been.
US banks pay back help
The crisis-scattered U.S. large banks strip off their state fetters.
On Wednesday, the Bank of America paid back the help from the Tarp Bank Rescue Fund to a total of 45 billion dollars (about 30 billion euros).
And the Citigroup also plans to refund state aid according to a report by the U.S. broadcaster CNBC.
In doing so, the institutions intend to eliminate the restrictions that have been imposed on the adoption of the money, such as the limitation on the payment of manager boni and the payment of high fees.
The Bank of America had spent well 19 billion dollars of fresh money on investors over change bonds.
She took the rest of the sum from her own cash box, which was, among other things, well filled by savings sales.
Bank Chief Kenneth Lewis expressly thanked the American taxpayer on Wednesday evening: The cash injection helped over a very difficult time.
The House had raised itself to the climax of the financial crisis with the takeover of the Investment Bank Merrill Lynch.
The Citigroup also intends to raise money on the capital market for the exemption from its liabilities to the State.
As early as Thursday, the US bank could announce a $20 billion increase in its capital, CNBC reported calling for circles.
A Citigroup spokesperson didn't want to express himself.
In June Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already paid back their help.
Quick Choice
It all went faster than expected.
As soon as two weeks after the ZDF Board of Directors pushed the acting editor Nikolaus Brender out of office, the transmitter may present a successor.
Last evening, the board wanted to vote on staffing.
Peter Frey, head of the ZDF headquarters studio in Berlin, was considered a favorite.
However, there was no confirmation from the transmitter - officially to avoid the procedure.
However, it may also have played a role in not further damaging ZDF's agent Markus Schachter, nor should this proposal be passed on to the Board of Directors.
Frey, Schachter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 board members.
The result of the vote was not yet established at the end of the editorial session of this issue.
Two weeks ago, Schachter failed in the Board of Directors with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Only seven members spoke out for Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's election was a herring defeat for treasurers, but one expected.
Because the majority of the Union in the Board of Directors had already signaled weeks before the election that Brender did not want to confirm in office.
The opposition to the chief editor of the Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch had been organised.
With the argument that among Brender the ZDF's news broadcasts had been lost to switching rates, he refused another term of office of the highly respected editor-in-chief.
Until shortly before the election, there was therefore protests in which political influence on the ZDF was cast.
Finally, even 35 state lawyers had joined the debate, which Kochs considered to be constitutionally unconstitutional.
It has nothing to do with it.
To person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and romance.
After that he worked at the South West Funk and the Frankfurt Rundschau.
In 1983 Frey moved to ZDF, initially to the \"Today Journal\"
Following stations: 1988 to 1990 personal speaker of the editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 head and moderator of the morning magazine until 2001 head of the ZDF foreign policy; since then head of the ZDF capital studio.
The Greens announced a constitutional complaint after the election Brenders, who was elected journalist of the year from the Medium Magazine industry magazine on Wednesday.
Kochs Widerpart of the Board of Directors, the Rhineland-Palatinate Prime Minister Kurt Beck, said last week that the countries should change the ZDF state contract so that staff proposals from the agent cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, a withdrawal of party politicians from the supervisory bodies of the ZDF also excluded Beck.
Brender's expected successor Peter Frey had recommended himself to the Board of Directors with a clever move - by severely criticizing the board immediately after the Brender election.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, both shadows could nominate him for the position of editor-in-chief and elect the Board of Directors, without being suspected of taking a party member into office.
In the party arithmetic, Frey is assigned to the left liberal anyway.
Study is discouraged
Partly success for the students: After a year of the education strike, the Ministers of Culture of the countries finally joined on Thursday: at a meeting of Ministers of Culture and University Rectors Conference, both sides agreed to want to improve the terms of study at Bachelor and Master.
Students should be able to cope with their studies in the future.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the burden of testing: basically, each study module should only complete with a single test.
In addition, the workload of the students should be reviewed and \"a realistic and reasonable measure\" ensured.
In addition, politics and universities want to simplify the recognition of examinations between universities both within and outside Germany.
The countries committed themselves to making joint structural specifications more flexible for Bachelor's and Master's degree programmes.
In addition, there should be no different national arrangements.
Less testing
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, Minister of Culture and Uni-Rectors have carried the winged word of the better studyability in the mouth.
Now it was filled with a concrete content for the first time.
The so-called Accreditation Council decided to reduce the number of tests in part dramatically: “Each module usually concludes with just one test,” it says in a 30-page paper, which aims to partially re-regulate the admission of studies.
With the ‘significant reduction in the burden of examination’, the Accreditation Council Chairman Reinhold Grimm stated that a ‘feal development should be stopped which significantly affected studyability’,
In addition, the \"studiability - future \"the crucial criterion\" should be in the design process.
Modules such as content should therefore be \"strengthened to check whether there is unnecessary consent of the students in the choice of the
Events would be avoided.
Students would have \"a need to maintain spaces, enable and promote their own initiative\"
The rules should apply when approving new, but also when reviewing existing programmes.
These must be “recognized” every five years, however, which means that it will take until 2015 until all studies have been reviewed.
Ten accreditation agencies, established by the countries, are responsible for this.
The Ministers of Culture had asked the countries in October, with emphasis, to have an impact on the agencies so that the filling of substances is not too large and the examination regime is not too strict.
In individual states, universities and universities have already agreed with the State ministries on appropriate measures.
As the only country to date, Rhineland-Palatinate has granted additional resources for the further development of the Bologna process.
The main aim of the money is to set up tutoring programmes and to strengthen study counselling as well as examination and foreign offices.
Land and universities want to use ten million euros for this purpose.
At the beginning of 2010, the government intends to bring a novelty of the Higher Education Act to Parliament.
After this, only one test is required for the completion of a study model.
Study design is designed to be more flexible, as well as to ensure recognition of performance at other universities and to facilitate access to the Master.
By the end of next year, all courses in the country will be reviewed for their degreeability.
On Thursday, the government and opposition had again argued on the terms of study in the country.
In addition to praise, however, there was criticism of the decisions.
The Federal Board of the Juso High School Groups called for the design of education policy to take place in future, no longer \"closed doors\" of ministers and university principals.
After the educational strike, students should now also be treated as \"contributed to a little\"
The future academics received support from the President of the University Rectors Conference (HRK), Margret Wintermantel: \"We need students' experiences, she said at a meeting with the Ministers of Culture on Thursday, with whom the HRK discussed a joint reform paper.
The Association of Education and Science (GEW) did not go far enough in all of Bonn's decisions: it called for a legal claim that would allow any graduate with a Bachelor's degree to have access to a further master's degree.
On the other hand, countries must ensure that, for today's generation of bachelor's students, sufficient Master's courses are available tomorrow with the best possible study conditions, says GEW's Board member Andreas Keller.
The countries need to set significantly more teachers.
However, the Minister of Culture did not comment on a freer access to the Master.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
Entry into Germany and out is pretty almost no control... - is the starting line of a poem by poet Werner Söllner, in which this in disturbing speech-fetching theme addresses the arrival experience of a dissident who has gained freedom but at the same time has lost his language.
In 1951, Werner Söllner, born in Banat, Romania, first worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a lecturer in a children's book publisher before moving to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded various literary awards, in 1993 he held the legendary Frankfurt Poetik lectures at Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been the head of the Hessian Literature Forum at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
Last Tuesday, he took care of considerable extra-literary views during a conference in Munich, which involved \"German literature in Romania in the mirror and mirror of her securitate acts\".
Söllner leaves a statement in which he stood before Romanian-German co-authors, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer, as IM for Romanian intelligence securitate.
Together with some of the present, Söllner received the German Language Award in 1989.
The recruitment attempts had begun slowly, first in 1971.
I am, closed Söllner, \"so someone who has not resisted the securitisation of securitate attempts,\"
The lyricist Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time as the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and its unparalleled literary confrontation with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene, and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, is shaken by a case that makes the abysses and the decline of a political system known to be based on surveillance and emphasis.
Werner Söllner is, as far as can be said after the previous knowledge, not only perpetrators, but also victims.
In his securitate act, IM Walter played a role, according to Söllner's confession of literary scientists Michael Markel, referring to the positive influence of IM Walter for him.
He said that Markel was able to get him out in all the points he had made for him at that time.
It would be a moral need for him to make this remark.
Söllner's explanation was unexpected in the form and in front of this audience, but it is not surprising that the confession of a former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian intelligence service is not.
Germany had been a cozy reserve for Securitate Spitzel, Herta Müller had already written in July at the time after she had read her own file, 914 pages.
The persons concerned, as one might suppose, are speculated and in some cases probably also knew which clear name was hidden behind the cover name Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Unlike in the present country, the handling of the residues of the securitate monitoring is still very diffuse.
A systematic explanation has been driven and disabled over the past few years.
One of the Birthler's respective National Councils on the Reprocessing of Securitate Acts (CNSAS) was established only in 1999, but the publication of the files has since been rather dragn.
Only since 2005 has there been a law governing the administration of files.
After the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, a former securitate chief from Temesvar gave an interview about the prize winner.
You have a psychosis, after all, you only interrogated her once.
The infection of power meant being able to express itself quite unhesitatingly in the form of freedom of expression.
Certainly, the case of Söllner, as so often in connection with silent guilt, raises inevitable questions.
Why not now? Who was hurt? The healthy response of the listeners to Söllner's confession lets hope that the continuation of this chapter will be determined more by the desire for knowledge than by guilt and shame.
For the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Sampling Supplement Champions League
It seemed as if there was just an adretted foreign servant dressed from a very nice Christmas party on which a sports article manufacturer had distributed Goodies, when the new VfB coach Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag of the equipment, rose to a C class in the middle of the night.
The man with the distinctive glitches was allowed to chauffe because of the still foreign city.
Otherwise he would have been able to drive himself too - alcohol was not in play at last, and the 55-year-old was just as low.
Had been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow work is going on.
Or let's get going.
In the words of the Swiss first three days before, “we have reached the eighth final, namely in the Champions League, thanks to the 3:1 success against Unirea Urziceni from Romania,” but we must not let ourselves be blinded by the success: it will be a brutal hard fight against descent,
The much more important task is ahead on Sunday.
It is then necessary to repeat in Mainz the king's class performance in the league everyday.
And to put off the weaknesses again after the fast three gates through Marica (5th), Tribulation (8th) and Pogrebnyak (11th).
Exemption
The Eighth Final of the Champions League (Hinspiele 16/17. + 23/24 February/ Replay 9/10. + 16/17. March) will be released in Nyon on 18 December.
So the joy over the fulminant status of the Babbel successor remained the same.
Not only with the supposed deliverer of salvation, who had given self-confidence, commitment and joy to the insecure Stuttgart professionals in the short term.
I went to the players and told them to dwell on their strengths, and stopped them to be more courageous, Seelerklempner Gross explained the simple successful recipe, which under Therapist Babbel no longer had any effect.
He has employed a certain magic, admitted Babbel's advocate Jens Lehmann, \"when a new impulse comes in football, things sometimes happen that you wouldn't have thought possible,
And Sami Khedira, who, thanks to his dynamics as the best player in the race, has been trying to describe the \"phenomenon\" with the proverbial \"fresh wind\" and the workings of the new superior: \"He is a man who intervenes and demands discipline.
That's what we need in the present situation,
Under Babbel, it had obviously been lacking.
The VfB Stuttgart is not over the mountain yet, warns sports chief Horst Held
The VfB Stuttgart, however, needs particular constance.
Like Gross, players and managers also avoided overestimating the victory against a weakened and totally overburdened defence of Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen at 0:4 the evil awakening had come, giving Khedira to consider.
And sports chief Horst Held said that although one season goal was achieved, the other was even further away.
We're not over the mountain yet.
Held on his 40th birthday, even after the first victory in his home for three months, the event of the weekend, which in the form of a television interview by Torhütter Jens Lehmann, was fresh up immediately before the start of the game.
There are decisions that others make and not Jens, Herot countered the harsh criticism Lehmanns.
He had shown leadership weaknesses to the board and had decided to change the coach on pressure of puberating fans.
Even that his free day had been deleted after games, Lehmann valued it as a sign of lack of sovereignty and disfavor.
Lehmann's statements were, \"indeed by pure selfishness, rekindled hero and announced consequences for the final man.
They probably won't be friends for life anymore, the two forty-year-olds.
After all, however, they agreed with everyone else that without the preliminary work done by the dismissed team the playfully and violently strong idea would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had \"a big part in the success\" said Herot and Lehmann unisono - and the man also agreed with the plastic bag.
WM-Fight in heavy weight
Hot duel in Bern: Always provoked challenger Kevin Johnson World Champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title after the WBC version.
The judge's judgment was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains box-world champion in heavy weight.
The 38-year-old Champion, after the WBC Association's version, defeated the US-American Kevin Johnson in the night of Saturday (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko it was the third successful title defense after his comeback in October 2008.
Before that, the Ukrainian was the world champion of the WBO and WBC associations twice.
Unfortunately, it didn't work with the K.o. that everyone expected.
Klitschko built his balance sheet on 39 victories in 41 professional struggles, and twice he had to give himself due to injuries.
==References====External links==*Official website
About 17,000 spectators in the Bernese Arena wanted the 2.02-meter-long Klitschko to dictate the fight with his left hand.
The eleven centimeters smaller Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, did, however, repeatedly escape the blows of the world champion, so that Klitschko could not achieve his dangerous rights decisively.
Overall, passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and only tried to get over the rounds.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his beatings rarely met the world champion.
After all, he is only the second boxer to Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who went over the full distance of twelve rounds with Klitschko.
The challenger had provided for some vertebrates before the struggle in the Swiss capital.
He insulted Klitschko as a \"healing zombie\" who \"cannot do anything right\"
On Friday the Champion was then provoked to push Johnson's sunglasses from the nose to see his eyes
Fourth victory after Klitschkos Comeback
Klitschko was also victorious in his fourth battle after his comeback on 11 October 2008.
After almost four years of austerity, he had beaten Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered \"his\" WBC belt, which he had had to leave camp-floss before.
This year he then forced Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba in his title defenses and in September Chris Arreola from the USA.
In this fight I just got off a beat and I am physically very good in shape, Klitschko had founded the quick return to the ring.
His dream, however, remains the union of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is world champion of WBO and IBF associations.
However, the British David Haye wears the belt of the WBA, after it was able to unthrone Nikolai Walujev in November 2.13 metres.
Haye had previously canceled a battle against Vitali Klitschko scheduled for September in summer.
In fact, his promotion company is already planning the fight against Klitschko in the London Wembley Stadium.
Case Kunduz
Frontal attack from the opposition: Green Group Chief Jürgen Trittin called Defense Minister Guttenberg a liar because of false information about the Kunduz affair.
SPD and Left call for clarification from the chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to recent findings on Kunduz's air raid, the opposition Secretary of Defense Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has subjected a conscious deception.
The Minister said to the deadly bombardment on two tankload trains from September, \"Knowledge the Untruth,\" said Green Group Chief Jürgen Trittin on Saturday in the ARD news broadcast \"day sight\"
It's called the country: he lied.
The order to kill was issued in violation of the rules of the International Security Force for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the substance of the report that NATO had read to Mr Guttenberg, said Trittin.
On Friday it was announced that the attack was not only about the destruction of the kidnapped truckmen, but also about the intent of killing two Taliban leaders.
According to Nato investigation report, up to 142 people were killed or injured in the US air raid requested by the German Kunduz commander Colonel Klein.
On Saturday, the German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) called on the Green, SPD and Left to express themselves immediately before the Bundestag and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms Merkel has to clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the Afghanistan policy of the Federal Government - and whether Chancellor, Federal Army and News Service have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and Grünen-Kollegin Renate Künast demanded.
Government spokesperson Ulrich Wilhelm strongly rejected the criticism.
The Chancellor's Office did not influence concrete operations of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, doubts were also raised at the presentation of the Ministry of the Backgrounds of the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to information from the SPIEGEL, the two Guttenberg have correctly and fully informed about the background of the tank loader attack.
Officially they had denied the existence of the Nato reports and kept the Minister's sensitive details.
However, in the context of the two top officials, they reported that they had even pointed out several reports to the Ministry of Defense, including a two-page document by commander Klein and a field hunter report.
In the meantime, Wichert will have asked for clarification of the matter in a letter, reports the \"Frankfurter General Sunday newspaper\"
He hasn't received an answer so far, he says.
The Ministry did not comment on the allegations on Saturday and pointed out that this would be clarified in the Federal Day Investigation Committee, which intends to be constituted next Wednesday.
Dream Worlds
Some see images in wadem state and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in the case of mental illness and drug abuse, the boundaries between imaging and reality are blurring.
As long as it happens in sleep, everything is fine.
If we lie in our dark rooms with closed eyes, we may give ourselves unhindered the wildest ideas and imaginations.
However, those who experience traumatic conditions in wakefulness, see and hear things that others do not see or hear, are usually considered crazy or dry in the modern Western world, at least as special ones.
However, such images and voices do not only arise in mental illness or drug abuse.
The same neuronal processes that enable us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels sometimes cause the boundaries between dream, madness and reality to fade.
Dream-like altered state of alertness can occur in the most diverse forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case madness.
Even though triggers and effects may differ, the visions of the mystic Hildegard of Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, shamanic rapture, psychoses and hallucinations can be traced back to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of the neuronal messenger substances of the brain - all pre-existing dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - is removed and the interaction of different parts of the brain is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and mad thoughts occur very often during schizophrenia.
The gravity no longer has power over him
The connection between madness and dream has employed philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of dreaming in the awake state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, in 1861, stated a “great similarity of the error with dream conditions” - for Sigmund Freud, the dream was even a psychosis, with all the inconveniences, delusions, sensationalities of such a “
It is autumn 2001 when Henning T. turns into a comic figure.
His body is two-dimensional and quieschbunt.
The gravity has no more power over him, it floats at the ceiling.
He's feeling a ride.
Behind him winged devils with blood-red, distorted frats, tooth-breathing.
They hunt him, kick him with heavy, flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels the pain all over the body.
Loud, vicious voices drone from walls and radio.
He can no longer bear them, the voices that mutilate and insult him.
Henning T. pulls two cables out of the stereo system, knocks them into a sling and attaches them to a hook on the ceiling.
He climbs on a speaker and lays the slings around his neck.
Jump.
The blade is loosening.
This is to be a lesson for you, shout the voices in drum-fettering choir, \"go to the clinic and let you heal\"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychoses, the last is 2 years back, the first nearly 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoaffective paranoid psychosis, he is also manic-depressive, he takes medications, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
In psychosis, I have experienced the worst fear and the deepest despair, he says.
The truce images are cruel reality
About one percent of the population suffer from schizophrenia at least once, and psychiatric clinics treat it as the second most common disease after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, people are usually no longer able to distinguish between the inside and outside world, they are born into a superior condition that can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship or persecution.
Especially common is voice hearing - voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also not rare.
The person concerned is no longer able to separate important from unimportant, the brain can no longer filter out disruptive signals, the consciousness is flooded by impressions.
Like the dream, psychosis also opens the locks for a flood of ideas and fantasies that derive deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is subject-centered, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, senior physician of the General Psychiatry Hospital at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The Schizophrene is located in the center of the event, everything has a meaning directed to it.
At the same time he is in a passive role, he, like in a dream, is overwhelmed by the events and cannot actively shape them.
Schizophrene therefore often feels threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A reality balance is usually not possible for them, the truce images are cruel reality, awakening is excluded.
Once in life to have experienced a hallucination
Unlike dreams, says Fuchs, “but the sensual and spatial structure of reality that is perceived in psychosis remains in principle,
The mad thoughts and hallucinations are in reality, the alienation of experience takes place in the real framework.
Why exactly our brain beats caprioles, researchers still face puzzles.
Exceptional conditions can cause any person to lose reality in a short time, says Fuchs.
But not everyone will develop psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic cause of schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that the genes are not the only determining factors.
Researchers believe that minimal brain damage is present in affected persons.
We suspect that the neuronal maturation of the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development, due to a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy for example, explains fox.
But there remains a mystery as the disruption of the neuronal system comes about, which, in addition, does not even manifest itself for many years at first.
Also, environmental influences play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be triggers for psychosis if the disposition is present.
Also hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis as they intervene into the transmitter system.
When our brain runs hot
The crazy thing is, psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive drugs to get rid of them, others spend money on drugs to get which, says Lübeck psychology professor Erich Kasten.
Whether truggles are perceived as pleasant or unpleasant is often just a question of the point of view.
Box has been collecting reports on hallucinations and thugs for ten years, and last year he evaluated his results in the book \"The Irreal World in Our Head\".
Hallucinations are one of the typical companion appearances of psychoses, but also of surprisingly many other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as borderline or depression, they often include diseases such as migraines, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's disease and brain trauma.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions the brain of healthy people is hallucinating itself.
Hallucinations, says caste, are composed of memory contents that are normally held back.
They arise when brain areas in which sensory perceptions are processed are overactive or too little inhibited; when our brain is running hot or even when stimulation is lacking.
Drugs can trigger this condition just as much as brain damage or psychosis.
But it's also a move, stress, care, or other mental conditions.
In recent studies up to a third of the respondents indicated having experienced hallucination at least once in life.
In summer 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, living in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and visiting the high school.
A very normal girl, actually.
If there weren't the pictures and voices.
In the break it may happen that a sloppy boy with long, dark hair addresses it.
When it answers to him, the fellow students look at it surprised - nobody else sees or hears this boy.
She thinks the shy girl is a spooky daydreamer, but Sarah K. doesn't dream, she knows.
She's awake, she hears and sees this boy, just as she hears and sees the girl in the bank next door.
She can even feel his presence, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is that she likes the boy.
Am I crazy?, she sometimes asks.
But she knows that this boy and the other daring images are not real and disappear again.
At night, the appearances are most frightening
Often the trug images are also a burden.
When she sits in the classroom, she sometimes cannot follow the teaching material, because the teacher in her eyes and ears just presents a new fellow student, while explaining mathematical equations for all others, both listening and visible at the table.
At night, the appearances are most frightening.
If she is waiting for sleep in her dark room, which is far too rare and far too late, she often cannot distinguish whether she is awake or already dreaming whether the pictures she sees, the frats or the girl with the bleeding cuts on arms and legs, appear in front of her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, she screams at the figures.
Parents and friends don't tell them they think they're crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She passed the Abitur last year and lives with her friend.
A year ago the hallucinations stopped.
Since contacting the psychologist's box on the Internet, she knows exactly that she's not crazy.
Wahn is also a work of art from despair
If a person is socially isolated or suffers from horse riding, he is very likely to have hallucinations after a while, says Caste.
I suspect the brain is then underworked and even provides for its entertainment.
Sarah K., a single child, was afraid of other children as a little girl, she often played alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at age 13 that the man she calls Dad since she can think of is not her physical father.
Since the same areas of the brain are active in visual and acoustic hallucinations, which also process real impressions and noises, it is difficult for those like Sarah K. to distinguish truffle images and reality. “Every experience, says caste,” takes place in the brain, and reality takes place there.
Hallucinations are also images that cause the brain to develop, so they act as real \"
Also, nocturnal dream images value box as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychosis.
In contrast to schizophrenia, mental healthy people are able to recognize their truce images as unrealistic.
Caste therefore advises his patients to value hallucinations as a special ability.
Limitation between dream and hallucination
Unfortunately, in our too conscious world, imaginary experience is mostly pathologized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief physician of the Hospital for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy of Florence-Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a severe, painful disease, but it also offers positive, creative - madness is also an art work of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has explored the so-called one-iroid form of experience, a special form of traumatized changed consciousness.
Oneiroides are highly complex, detailed quasi dreams, which the experiencer considers real and which he cannot distinguish from the state of growth even in the aftermath.
The uneiroid state of consciousness arises in trauma or disease-related extreme situations, for example in polyradiculitis patients who experience motor paralysis when fully conscious.
When a person is threatened by self- and world loss, for example by persistent, complete inability to move, he replaces the life-threatening real situation with his own, imaginary world disconnected from reality, Schmidt-Degenhard says.
A kind of boundary between dream and hallucination.
Since the management of a situation is not possible in reality, a world change takes place, but the real situation is present in the imagination.
An intense form of sense-building and meaning-making in an inconvenient situation that enables us to make our own design ability not to go into a nothing of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
Zurich's art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his one-iroid experiences in his book \"Respiration of Hearts\" as the soul's rescue action.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness follows a cardiovascular operation with subsequent heart transplantation for days on travel, while his body is sentenced to motionlessness at the intensive site.
Clausen dives into a self-created world, visiting strange times and places: he experiences himself as a beggar, old man, on board a train sanatorium, a robot watching over his health.
In the early Middle Ages, he lives under nobles who produce roosters from blood.
When dragged by a Greek on the motorcycle in its home country, he surfs the Alps with his hospital bed and meets a Korean mafioso.
He goes completely up in the imagined happening, everything is real, even later in the memory.
These inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream for Clauses.
Dream is a different state, he describes his experience.
In contrast, the memories of mental journeys can still be understood after years and in additional details.
More clear and intense even than real experience.
The intensity of this experience blows the horizon of our other life-world experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, oneiroides, psychoses, hallucinations and drug abuse show how fragile our inner images of external reality are also in the watch.
Any change in the state of consciousness, sums up the psychologist caste, \"can lead to a deformation of what we call reality\"
An experience that can also be enriching.
The snow break can come
Burda
Children are expected to take over the publishing house at 27 years of age
The new publisher Kallen is an intermediate solution: in the long term Hubert Burda wants to give his company into the hands of his two children, he told the SPIEGEL.
The holding is also expected to be 100 percent of the family in the future.
Hamburg - The publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the long term in the hands of his children.
Both children inherit at 27 years of age and have the firm will to enter the company, the 69-year-old told the SPIEGEL.
We have carefully regulated the details.
The question of whether they are also active in the company is only after that.
The question is also whether they are able to do so.
It is not possible to introduce 7500 employees to their children if they are not sufficiently qualified.
This is also what the children are doing and the company is doing.
On Thursday, Burda announced that he would withdraw from the Chairman of the Board of Directors from January and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
The 52-year-old Kallen has been a board member with Burda since 1999.
First he was responsible for technology.
Later, with the Treasury area, responsibility for corporate assets came to the fore and after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer also those for direct marketing, abroad, printing and finance.
For the first time, this does not make a family member at the top of the publishing house.
Burdas children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who is now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
The naming of kallen also serves to bridge “10, 15 years,” says Burda.
In the future, the holding should also belong to 100 percent of the family, said Burda.
Looking at the cases of Schickedanz and Schaeffler, Burda said that even family businesses are not safe from the fall: “This always involved families who were infected by a desire for capital that had completely speculated and thought they could rise to the very big player.
My strategy was never that.
He had “no world power dreams,” Burda said.
I don't see myself as the political preceptor of this country, as it was Springer, and I don't want to play in the world league with 'Time', these shops have become too big.
Perfect Beauty
Everything you want in terms of beauty and well-being is now available to you.
This is at least what El Corte Inglés has done, which recently opened a shop with an area of more than 1000 m2 in the shopping center in Callao (Madrid), where everything revolves around the body care.
In the wellness area, which is located on the eighth floor, you will find among other well-known companies such as Hedonai, who provide a dehairing with laser; Spaxión, with rooms for relaxing and beauty treatments; the hairdressers Luis & Tachi, Marina d'Or with a fitness studio or L'Occitane with their natural cosmetics.
However, there is also a food department, which results from its tea house with more than 130 different teas.
Enjoy a relaxing massage together with your partner while at the same time having a fantastic view of the capital, or for two hours renting the relaxation area to put your own “beauty party” on the legs with eight girlfriends and then relax in the whirlpool or with massages and a glass of champagne, these are just a few of the many possibilities that Spaxión offers.
The total area is 250 m2, which is divided into 12 rooms for the latest facial and body treatments as well as for hydro therapy.
For example, for cavitation in the fight against cellulitis or with vibrating surfaces.
The fitness studio also has this type of equipment, there are also virtual trainers who take care of the training units of the customers and thus offer them a completely personal training.
You start a training unit by entering a personal password on a touch screen located opposite the devices.
After that, various videos show you how to perform your training units properly.
The director of the fitness studio assures that 15 minutes (including uplifting and stretching exercises) are fully sufficient to train the body muscles.
And if, after you have trained your body, you still want to take a look at the hairdresser salon, Luis & Tachi has a room where treatments for the recovery of hair, shine and health are offered for your hair in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to be the key words for this wellness area in the middle of the city, which is always open from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. in the evening 365 days a year.
The most varied decolletes
Christmas is getting closer and closer and therefore it is again a good opportunity to copy the look of the stars and get their hard dresses into our wardrobe.
The shape of the decolleté, which is very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the points that must be considered.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie has chosen an exaggerated and very complicated decolleté. You can only guess about that.
Endesa and Barcelona with electric car
The electricity company Endesa has created the LIVE office together with the city of Barcelona.
This is a project for the development and promotion of the electric car in the Catalan capital.
The LIVE office (logistics for the introduction of the electric car) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the introduction of the electric car in the city and make agreements on mobility by managing, coordinating, subsidising, etc.
On the other hand, the MOVELE project is being developed to promote the electric car and the opinions and actions of the sectors concerned.
This is an attempt to advance the means of transport of the future.
3 ‘Electric Cities’
However, Barcelona is not the only city involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville are also participating in this project.
These are the three cities selected by the government in the MOVELE project to accelerate the introduction of the electric car.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the government of Catalonia (la Generalitat).
This framework agreement aims to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These activities are, among other things, such activities associated with energy and in particular their performance.
However, it is by no means the only initiative to participate in the end in the promotion of the electric car.
The company participates in standardisation groups across Europe and maintains a wide range of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees \"a horizon of tranquility\" for the automotive sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, prophesies of the Spanish automotive industry, who is the country's biggest exporter, \"a horizon of peace\"
In presenting the economic report for 2009 by the President of the Government, Zapatero reminded once again of the measures that the Government has launched to support the automotive sector during the year.
“Without the plan on the competitiveness of the car industry, we would have a panorama of neglect and the closure of some of our main production plants today,” said the President of the Government.
\"Thanks to this plan and the willingness of car manufacturers to produce in Spain in a very competitive industry in the future, we can see a quiet horizon for the approval of this industry, which is our largest export industry, he added.
He also recalled that the plan on competitiveness, which is part of the overall plan for the automotive industry (PIA), provided 800 million euros for projects of 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which in turn provided investments of more than 3 billion euros.
The Head of Government stated that these investments are intended for the development of new models, as well as for the modernization of the already existing products and processes.
Zapatero also underlined the government's measures to stimulate demand, in response to the 2000E Plan, which is applicable in cooperation with the Autonomous Communities and the automotive manufacturers.
According to the Head of Government , this plan allows for an average reduction of 6% in exhaust gases in new vehicles sold on the Spanish market, which in turn leads to a \"strong increase\" in approvals which increased by 40 percent in November.
On 20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
In Madrid, the first edition of the International Classic Automobile Fair is held, an exhibition for professionals and lovers of the world of motors.
This fair will be held from 5 to 7 February 2010 at the Pabellón de Cristal of Casa de Campo in Madrid.
On an exhibition area of 20,000 square meters, 200 domestic and foreign exhibitors will introduce their brands.
You can not only marvel at classic motorcycles and vehicles, but you will also find all the only conceivable articles related to the world of engines at the ClassicAuto Madrid.
For example, the exhibitors at the fair can find accessories, spare parts, components, fabric accessories, accessories, publications, miniature cars, etc.
Hundreds of articles from the world of classic engines, which will inspire the collectors and lovers.
Among the companies participating in this trade fair are Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, restorations; Coupe-Francisco Pueche, sales and restoration of automobiles, specializing in Mercedes Benz.
Tests of competence in the field of external affairs
In addition, the sales activities at this fair are complemented by parallel events: meetings, sports vehicle exhibitions, skill tests, events and competitions.
Skill tests with classic cars and motorcycles are also carried out on a specially set-up race track in the exhibition area.
Mazda3 i-Stop: Environmental sportiness
Mazda wants to prove that sportiness is clearly compatible with protecting the environment.
For this reason, Mazda recently introduced the automatic stop and start system of the engine, baptized on the name i-Stop, a device which is currently only available for the 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
This second generation of Mazdas 3 is a result of their good grades in the overall picture.
The final processing, the design of the vehicle, the comfort, its road behavior, the mechanics, the i-stop system ...
All these aspects are very good at the new Mazda3
Starting with the front seats, you can see that the front seats offer an excellent ergonomics and good hold.
The steering wheel is also excellent.
In further consideration of the unit, which consists of the instrument board and the armature board, it can be found that Mazda, with a variety of buttons and switches, is located in the striking colors red and blue, on the same line as the Japanese trend towards a futuristic interior design.
This style reminds us in part of the style of Honda Civics.
Therefore, it can be said that both the Mazda 3 and the Civic, both Japanese models, stand out from the novelty of the German automobiles, especially from the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to exceed.
The passenger compartment of these two Japanese compact cars offers more than the appropriate comfort, so that four adults can drive the car comfortably.
To all of these comes a large and clearly shaped trunk.
The stop and start system is now only available for the 2-liter petrol engine with 150 hp and a 6-speed circuit.
This engine is a real pleasure. It comes through its fineness, its quiet noise, its performance and its low consumption.
And all those who don't travel many kilometers a year should consider this i-stop with petrol engine because of its great comfort in the connection and its low consumption, even though Mazda's diesel models are the most sold.
With regard to the equipment, the so-called Sportive Model selected for the trial is a special feature, since it has a much larger number of elements from the serial equipment.
From the serial equipment, the assistant for the track change (RVM) in particular points out that this eliminates the dead angle, as well as the controls for traction and stability, the speed control, the light-sensitive internal mirror, the on-board computer with a large screen, the sensors for parking, an independent air conditioning, rain and light sensors, Bluetooth and audio bluetooth as well as the chromed 17-inch rims.
Furthermore, this version still includes, as if it were not enough equipment, the Premium package, which contains the following for an additional 1,500 Euros: in addition to other elements, especially the learning-able Bixenon headlights and the BOSE sound system with CD loader.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is particularly outstanding with regard to the materials used, because of its driving behavior and variety of equipment.
Furthermore, those who do not travel many kilometers a year can also buy the i-stop version, which is only available with a 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
The only negative on this model is its somewhat high price, which is between 21,770 Euros for the luxury model and 23,270 Euros for the proven sportive model.
However, as a counterperformance at this high price, the Mazda3 offers us every day on the New Highest Pass.
A Premier with Much Glamour
L. A. rolls out the red carpet of sensuality for Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premiere of \"Nine\", the stars, dressed in models that look as elegant as sexy, shined more than ever.(Photos: Gtresonline).
Our “pe”, as elegant as ever, opted for a dark “lady” dress.
The promises of FonPeek
Peek is too limited, a device with which you can only read its emails without the possibility of seeing certain attachments or surfing through the internet.
It enjoyed its five minutes of fame when it chose Time magazine as one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the street is rather unlikely, but the idea in itself is of particular interest to young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek costs very little and has a very low flat rate, for example, only half of the price of an iPhone's flat rate.
After the company has seen the success of this, it has brought two new devices to the market: one designed for Twitter, the other with a life-long free service for data, in contrast to the Peek, at which you have to pay a six times higher price.
Fonpeek, presented yesterday at the event Le Web, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same boundaries as its American counterpart, but it has a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price for the telephone, about 12 euros a month, includes roaming for all of Europe.
Those who travel around the world with a smartphone already know what it means to refrain from all the data in order to read its emails as soon as you have crossed the country border or when you are desperate for a café with WIFI (or a connection with Fon).
The idea of roaming with flatrate is incredibly seductive and should have been possible for a long time.
It is true that some telephone providers already offer special contracts and prices for foreign stays, but my experience requires a doctoral degree in physics and a good glasses to read all the small prints.
The repeated criticism by the European Commission regarding affordable roaming tariffs across Europe has almost always been ignored.
Outside of one's own country, one is always afraid to read his emails and that is right.
That a small device such as FonPeek (although it is always amazing that it has the name Fon, although it does not have a Wifi/WLAN) can offer this type of tariffs, means that the telephone providers have to think slowly but safely and start to consider different ways to use their data network.
Kindle is another good example of this, in its prices it includes downloading books and further requests on the Internet.
Without vetage and without hooks.
This is an internet-capable device and you only pay for it one single time, namely when you buy, and not month by month.
And that's exactly what I expect one day from FonPeek to be able to buy with life-long Internet access as it already offers in the United States.
And that's not because I want to buy it.
I read my emails by phone, thank you.
So I expect this because I believe that it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
Michelle's Fetish Color
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the American First Lady.
Even at Barack Obama's office as President of the United States, she appeared in a dress and coat of this color and again chose the same color to accompany him with his, no doubt, second most important moment in his life: the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama wore very similar models on both occasions: besides that it was almost the same color - a shiny green yellow -, the clothes consisted of three parts - dress, jacket and coat made of the same fabric, and to this she wore a somewhat coarsely embroidered or a necklace.
It even goes so far as to suggest at first sight that the First Lady of the United States wanted to follow the example of the Princess of Asturias and decided to wear the same dress on more than just one occasion.
However, the two dresses differ very much in the type of fabric they are made of.
At the inception she wore a dress made of lace and in Oslo a made of patterned samt.
The accessories were also different: for the first time, green shoes with semi-high paragraphs and for the second time, a decent model, but gold-colored.
The hairstyle was also different every time: the hair was raised on this occasion as a hair collar, while the previous one was wearing the hair open.
75% of working mothers have had problems working because of their motherhood
Discrimination in work has increased in recent years, especially in the younger women who want children.
This results from the study carried out by CSIC in collaboration with the Institute for Women on fertility and career of women in Spain,
The survey of 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 leaves no doubt about this: 75% of women in employment see their career opportunities restricted on the labour market due to their motherhood.
The study reveals that there are major differences in the decision to set up a family and the number of children depending on whether women work or not, and if so, what kind of profession they exercise.
Those of them who do not do any other work outside the house, work only half-days or do not have a fixed contract, become mothers and have more children.
In contrast, women with a firm position, especially in the public sphere, move to the establishment of a family and motherhood and therefore have fewer children.
“The women in the age group aged 35 to 49 years with a fixed job get their first child on average only 3.7 years after the merger, a number that increases to 4.1 years for women with a fixed job who have taken longer to achieve this and who have brought them together and the first child only much later.
Furthermore, the type of work has a major impact on motherhood, although less than the calendar in terms of willingness to receive, explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that must be taken into account in the age of women in marriage and the first child.
According to survey, the age at the time of marriage and the first child is all the higher, the higher the level of education.
This difference could also be observed in women of equal age.
For example, women in the group aged 35 to 49 years, depending on whether they have only the primary education or higher education, were on average aged 25.1 or 32.1 for the first time.
In addition, depending on their level of education, there is a further difference between women.
While the women marry before their first permanents and receive their first child, the women with a middle or high school degree do so in a different direction and first seek a permanent position and then marry and then get their first child, Delgado notes.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
L'Oréal Paris has recently added a new name to its ever-needed list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year the German actress will be the image of various products of the brand and will also say the well-known advertising phrase \"Because you are worth it\".
The main actor from “Joyeux Noël” will be one of the most elegant actresses on an international level, thus becoming another famous hanging sign, as before her Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her were the last to join this exclusive club the actresses Evangeline Lilly -Lost - and Freida Pinto -Slumdog Millonaire -
With men, the cosmetics company also only has exceptional messages: Patrick Dempsey - Grey -s Anatomy') and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's acting colleague in Lost -
The UK fashion industry’s prize ceremony

On this occasion they all appeared.
The ex-model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, chosen as the best model this year.
Manuel Vicent's Poker Game
Manuel Vicent presents in \"Poker of the Ace\" (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) to the three-to-one X-ray images of writers who accompanied him in his literary life (and, in some cases, in real life).
He does not use a predictable and frightening genre (short biography, life and work), but looks for a similarity to the glowing heartpiece of the Creator.
The journey is exciting and Vicent does not spare any horrors or enlightenments.
Furthermore, this book is a delicious reading pleasure, it is also a moving call to read and read again and again.
Here are some excerpts from the book.
About Albert Camus: “When I read his pages, I found out that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but rather a spiritual, almost sensual drive, just as I always felt it, without having found words for it: joy as opposed to unhealthy destiny, morality without guilt and innocence without any God,
About Samuel Beckett: “Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote about what he had in his blood, not in his mind, between powerlessness and ignorance, with an appalling poetic humor, without any sense, like the knife blade that almost killed him,
About Graham Greene: “Our husband was drawn into her hands by this woman with a passion that lasted for thirteen years, whose flesh united the emotions of adultery with the pleasure of repentance, a spiritual privilege which consisted of coming to heaven on the path of destruction,
About James Joyce: \"The Odysseus\" was published in Paris by Sylvia Beach in 1922. It is one of the 8,000 summits in the world's literature, one has to climb up on the north wall, on the wall, at which the best climbers try again and again to reach the New Mountaineers.
About William Faulkner: “It was a funny cauze.
He sometimes said about himself that he was the heir of a landowner's estate and again he said he was the son of a black man and a crocodile.
Both dreams were evidenced by a certain size,
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer picked up the mad cry, which was heard from a bridge out of that personality from Munich, so that his echo was brought in his literary manner to the night of the 20th century. This he did on a journey, on which he fled from himself, with a speech full of violence before the worms, to the afterworld.
About Dorothy Parker: “One day she knelt down and prayed: my dear God, I beg you to do all you can to stop writing like a woman,

About Pío Baroja: \"What else did Martín-Santos do than try to influence Joyce into Baroja?
What did Benet mean if he did not lead Baroja to the weapons of Faulkner?

Fiery Aggression
My 70-year-old mother spent last week walking through our district in the village of Fuenlabrada, when suddenly a group of young people between 15 and 18 years of age lived next to her and our dog, our dog is a minstrel that we took out of the animal's home and weighs just six kilos, and then from a cheerful sky they missed him two steps and hurt him severely.
We can't get our disarmament in words, because it's incomprehensible to us, because the fun should be in a cheap aggression against a small and helpless animal, which of course was carried out on the leash.
In addition, the suffocation attack that a woman who was walking comfortably got when she tried to correct these people because of the incident, she was even afraid of her own life, because if such a madman attacks a dog, he may be the same with a woman, a child, an older lord, or perhaps even with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The incident occurred in an ordinary quiet district at five o'clock in the afternoon on a very usual Tuesday.
The dog's been hauling all day.
Of course, we have paid notice at a nearby police station, but we have great doubts as to whether this is going to happen at all and to prevent any prejudices from beginning, we only want to make it clear that the cowardly criminals were Spanish.
Our disarmament over the event has prompted us to show this incident.
We cannot understand what must happen in the minds of these young people that they find a cheap attack on a helpless animal funny, on an animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and persons remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
In cooperation with the Spanish Transport Safety Foundation (Fesvial), the tire manufacturer Michelin launched a campaign to promote helmet use, especially among younger motorcyclists, as both companies announced today.
This initiative is designed to highlight the importance of helmet use, as it is ultimately the only protective element that can prevent head injuries or even death in case of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of their commitment to road safety, which includes “more than just designing and producing products that are becoming more and more secure every day, and further reaffirmed that they are also helping with other actions of educational and informative character to get a step closer to this goal every day.
This new campaign to promote helmet use on the motorcycle, which runs under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will be distributed in a first stage posters to over 500 motorcycle workshops in order to achieve the best possible distribution.
Finally, Michelin stressed that transport safety is a constant concern for the company, and precisely for the reason that, as a manufacturer of tyres, they are always committed to two-wheeled vehicles, one of their main objectives must be the development of ever safer products.
The sale of small trucks increases a bit again
After almost two years, the car market for small transporters finally starts to see some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles approved in Spain in November mean an increase of 12,6 % in terms of 2008, and, what is much more important, they are the first increase even after 22 consecutive months with a steady decline, in terms of the figures presented by the Anfac and Ganvam Autoretailerverband.
However, these good figures are currently only available with great caution, since the reference data used for the comparison of November 2008 was a particularly bad marketing year with a 60% decrease over the previous year.
However, it must be borne in mind that, apart from the increase in the last month, the total approvals of these 11 months are still 40% below the sales figures of the previous financial year.
Since January, a total of 95,853 vehicles have been sold, but this number includes all vehicles from which the small transporter market is made up: passengers' cars, pick-ups, small transporters, small delivery cars and lighter small-cars/cars.
Furthermore, there are still the same thunderstorms in the sky, most of which attract demand, because even though some of the vehicles are purchased by private individuals, the bulk of sales go to small and medium-sized enterprises, which in almost 100% of all cases buy with third-party financing.
In this way, other factors must be included, such as the increase in unemployment rates or the duration of the bad economic situation, as the result of the money gap of the credit institutions.
In this panorama and in contrast to passenger cars, financial support for the purchase of a 2000E vehicle has helped little.
However, this plan is not only intended for private individuals, even self-employed and small businesses are entitled to purchase a small carrier up to 3.5 tons with a CO2 emissions that may not exceed 160 grams per kilometer, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Not long ago Ganvam had reminded us that it is absolutely necessary on the part of the State to pay special attention to these small-loaders as well as, of course, to the industrial vehicles (cars and buses).
The car dealer's association prophesies for 2010 a year similar to the one just past for which it expects a sales failure (for passenger cars and land cars) of 19%.
Support for brake maneuvers in critical situations is now required
As with the ABS anti-blocking braking system at that time and as with the stability control ESP, the emergency braking aid systems must be mandatory in the European cars.
In fact, they are already mandatory for all newly approved passenger cars and light small transporters, for the remaining vehicles a carnage period was set by the end of February 2011.
The measures adopted by the European Union are aimed at improving the protection of pedestrians, but these braking systems can also help to prevent many accidents due to their operation.
The task of the emergency brake assistant is to exert more pressure on the brakes in the event of a critical brake maneuver, which the system recognizes on the brake pedal based on the brake strength performed by the driver.
However, this system does not exercise this pressure until the end.
According to an investigation commissioned by the component manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles, a third of the drivers involved in an accident were no longer able to step on the brake pedal before the collision, and half of them had not stopped with full force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The brake aid, on the other hand, intervenes with maximum force in the braking system and thereby reduces the brake time and thus the brake distance that a car lays down during the braking process.
According to a study by the EU, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be prevented each year if all cars were equipped with this type of emergency braking assistant.
There would be even fewer accidents - one reckons that any fourth accident could be prevented with personal damage - as soon as the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems become popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that detects obstacles (via radar or camera) and warns the driver, while at the same time exerting light pressure on the brakes.
When the driver responds, the system helps him to increase the pressure on the brake pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the gear is already inevitable, the brake assistant exerts the maximum pressure on the brakes to keep the damage as low as possible.
General Motors shifts the plan for Opel until January
While the staff of the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) were already informed by Nick Reilly, the new Chairman of General Motors (GM) Europa, that the production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April, probably on 8th, according to Javier Ortega, the American vehicle manufacturer points out that he needs more time to complete the rescue plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new Chairman of GM Europa, wants to achieve that the page concerned already gives its consent to each point of the plan in advance.
And for this reason it may be that the final document, which will first be submitted to the workers and then to the governments of the countries in which there are works, will be moved until the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, GM is assured that it will make a decision on the sale of Saab in the next few days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on American car makers to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in touch with some potential new buyers.
One of these buyers might be Geely, who also likes to buy Volvo, but the option of the Dutch manufacturer of Skype sports cars, which has been covered by the Russian group Converg, is becoming increasingly demanding.
If none of these buyers had an agreement, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to close Sab at the end of the year, if it has not been sold until then, will continue to be maintained.
Tax of Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive jewels, the engineers used Boxster S as the basis and really managed to make it easier by 80 kilos, bringing only 1,275 kilos to the scales.
In order to create something like this, they were the first to abandon the automatic folding roof, which was replaced by a tent canvas roof with manual drive, so that you have saved 21 kilos; thanks to the aluminium doors used in this model such as the GT3 disappearing - another 15; by taking out the air conditioning again 13; on the other hand, you have reduced the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres, thus another 7 kilos were saved; by installing sporty Bacquet seats another 12 and with the light 19-inch rims five again.
Then one had another six kilos less by the rejection of the audio system CDR-30 and by the exchange of door handles by handles from fabric reached the missing kilo.
Although it is also available with the PDK double coupling gearbox, the trial was carried out with a 6-way hand-drive vehicle, mainly on the smaller land roads of California, on mountain tracks that were really very rough.
In his driving behavior, he can only be given the note impeccably.
The reduction of his weight, however, did not mean that he would no longer be so safe on the road.
It is rather the opposite of the case: for a long time we have no longer tried such a small and light model, which gives a feeling of great safety at the curves, even at high speed.
He is a small athlete capable of warming his muscles at a low pace in the required time until we give him orders to shave, brake, recover, and then get back to the new everything out of his engine ...
He does everything he is told. The car does everything we show him with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to its steering, which is as communicative as well as precise.
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon.
A motor sound for all tastes
The sound of his V6 boxer with 320 hp (10 more than the boxster S) has been very successful and you can still increase it with the 'sport' option as well as with a system that can change the engine noise, which was already used for the first time in the Panamera.
The acceleration power is unimaginably brutal, no matter whether it's off the stand or on the return acceleration.
The suspensions are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the land roads on which we drove with the Boxster Spyder was already quite damaged, but the car got the hit holes well.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do on the entire line; and that, although we found ice in the morning gray and roll split on some of these curves in the morning morning morning morning.
In summary, it can be said that it is an ultra-light car, a car with which you have an indescribable ride pass, as it might otherwise be rather rare and in it there is much more than just a small improvement of the boxster Ss.
The car will enter the market in February 2010 and cost 70,831 EURO.
Bag Girl'
The singer, a bus friend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of the cosmetic line Coco Cocoon and an opportunity starlet at the fashion shows of 'maison', she presents her evil face with the same neck rigidity as her pockets of Chanel.
Much more than \"Bad Girl\" or \"It Girl\" she is a \"Bag Girl\"
The Baskonia gives itself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral, despite the many outstanding players in the team of Dusko Ivanovic, celebrated an excellent triumph with 82-91 on his visit to the complicated Maccabi Electra football field and thus comes to first place within his group after the large-scale performance of Mirza Teletovic, who was with eight triples the best of his team (29 in the evaluation).
The team from Vitoria was able to replace the significant failures of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large dose of use and teamwork, even if they had to wait until the bitter end for their victory.
The great hits from the perimeter with 16 rated triples contributed to their final victory.
The game began with the lead of the bluerods, who from the beginning sat on the top of the advertisement board.
Since the first four baskets of the team from Vitoria were already coming out of the perimeter, it was already worth noting that they had come to the field with well-armed wrists.
They were English and Teletovic, mainly responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was hardly different, only that the team from Álava opted for an indoor game of Barac and for the game of Eliyahu, who was received when he returned to the team with peeps and applause, which is his home to further expand their advantage until the break (34-43).
Teletovic has already started to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, even though the “minus six” rating of splitters already suggests that this would not be the best evening of Brazilians.
Nevertheless, despite the clear advantage in the break, the game was not yet decided and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Vitorians that not everyone wins on their playing field, and thanks to the ever-raging “hand of Elijahs,” they returned to the game.
Eidson and Pnini played a key role in the fact that the \"Yellows\" turned the rudder (50-49).
Even more disadvantages
The team of Ivanovic, injured, but everything other than dead, had to prepare a few games with safety to get air again and with one of them suddenly came the gun of Mirza Teletovic, which with three almost consecutive triples and with the support of English and Ribas, made sure that on the advertisement board was displayed once again a restorative distance from (54-67), which the host could be decorated at the end of the third quarter with (57-67).
The Alavesen were exposed in the last quarter, and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already announced that they would not allow anyone to take away the victory they had honestly earned in the first three to three minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson, who were the best of their team, did not reassign their team by three points from the line (70-77).
Despite this, and although splitter due to fouls was put out of place, Ivanovic's team did not give up, defended himself well and even though the Israelis still picked up in the last minute (80-85), the game had already lost a winner and Tel Aviv for the first time in this season.
Injuries prevented Unicaja from getting the forehead
Unicaja lost his voice in Greece against Olympiacos and had to take the lead in Group B of the Euroliga, which was marked in a game marked by the failures of the players of Unicajas (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially during the internal game, which facilitated the Greek victory.
The team from Malaga was not afraid of the mood in the Hall of Peace and Friendship nor of the opposing team, which may be one of Europe's strongest and has a lot of money.
Thanks to their featured game in first quarter, the Andalusians were allowed to dream. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two of them by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, blinded the hosts with 12-18 in the 9th minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the one Unicaja, even though the local team with an internal game between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis managed to show the advertisement board in the 13th minute 22-20 in their favor, the minute in which, due to an action, it had almost come to the beating between the two Americans Beverley and Williams, and for which reason both were disqualified.
The Greek team began to get warm at last and its superiority on both sides of the game, while the departure of the English Joel Freeland due to an injury and the three themselves caused mistakes of Carlos Jiménez left clear traces of Unicaja.
Among her players in the interior and the Lithuanian forerunner Linas Kleizas, with his triples, they increased their advantage in the 19th minute to 44-32.
A pick-up hunt was impossible
The third quarter was characterized by many attacks against the team of Olympiacos, which, despite its 19 losses, proved superior and even managed to compensate for the difference between 66-48 and the 27 minute game played in Malaga, which in turn caused the group's leadership to fluctuate.
Unicaja tried to get rid of the many failures and the shooting that injured Robert Archibald during the game.
Despite the many disadvantages for the Unicaja, in the 31st minute thanks to the leadership and the triples of Cook and the use of Lewis, there was again some hope for 66-57.
Nevertheless, it was actually impossible since the Olympiacos, as soon as he attacked and showed his superiority with centimetres within the basket area, was not to be brake.
Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic managed to raise the basket difference to 81-62 in the 37th minute, and Unicaja had to be beaten and had to take the lead in Olympiacos.
How much should you earn because of your profile in Facebook?
The users of Facebook can now experience their salary thanks to the new application Trovit, the search engine with most ads of real estate, job offers and cars in Spain, which they should earn because of their profile.
The tool - How much to earn - calculates the user's salaries on the basis of more than 140,000 job offers available at Trovit in Spain. A form in Facebook is available for users to enter their profession, professional experience, age and the city in which they work.
After a week after the application was available for the first time, the search engine found out that the Spanish worker was on average feeling “badly paid,” explains the person responsible for the product Trovit, Albert Ribera, in a press release.
The Spanish are the worst paid according to the data Trovit has available through its search engines in Great Britain and France.
A British programmer receives an annual gross salary of 45,226 euros and a Frenchman 31.059, unlike the 24,000 euros earned by a Spanishman.
As a result, a truck driver has an annual net salary of 34,247 euros in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 euros in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid job in Spain is that of a waiter with 11,592 euros a year net; followed by the work of a salesperson with 14,725 euros and that of a worker with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after places on the Internet in the last three months are those of a driver, half-day jobs and social workers.
Brazil calls Zelaya a date to leave
The Brazilian government has set a time limit for the stay of Manuel Zelaya in her message in Tegucigalpa.
The President dethobene of the Office shall leave the diplomatic representation by 27 January 2010 at the latest if his mandate expires officially
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegate of the Brazilian Embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that \"Mel\" was aware that before that date he must have left the message in which he had found asylum since September 21.
“He is aware of the need to go on January 27, as his mandate on that day expires and he has to look for a new accommodation,” he said.
The transmitter also quoted the ex-presidents, who confirmed his intention to leave the message before the appointed date: “My point of view is to go as soon as possible, logically, with the return of the government of Brazil,” Zelaya explained on the phone.
After the elections on 29 November (with which Porfirio Lobo emerged as winner), Zelaya assured him he would remain in the Brazilian Embassy until January.
However, this week he tried to get refuge in Brazil.
This failed, however, in Zelayas' refusal to recognize the status of an asylum-seeking politician who wanted to force him into the de facto government chaired by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you!
After the most seductive days since last spring, when the inflation of assets was the prevailing mood in the markets, uncertainty has returned to the markets, which is in no way surprising, as this is its natural state, in an environment where the brokers make decisions about a naturally uncertain future.
The measure applied to stabilize markets was to compensate the debt with the direct purchase of assets and to allow the liquidity to be released at interest rates which move around zero so that banks can buy assets to account for them.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets are as good as they are completed and, without questioning their heterodox policy on liquidity, start to strike some sand in the gearbox, as the BCE näc already predicted with its annual increase taking place next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without these heterodox measures and we are just witnessing a reversal in reducing risk premiums.
The liquidity of the stock exchanges and the differences in the company bonuses are rising again, even though they are far from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
The States were forced to state the private risks and the government debts were rising again.
One now relies on quality and the USA, Japan and Germany are the preferred place of refuge for investors, which in turn leads to an increase in the differences in the countries of the euro area in terms of Germany.
Spain has hardly been affected by this episode of instability until now, but then came Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new revision down to the assessment of Spain.
On the other hand, a certain uncertainty does not cause the defenders of moral risk to remain silent, which once again tried to raise awareness to the global economic policy leaders of what they had caused, as they had diminished the devastating effects to which the limitation of loans led to the loss of jobs, when they would have actually decided a new day to give thanks.
Nevertheless, what happened in Dubai points to a tribal war between the Emires in order to restore power in the Emirates and development in Greece was also predicted earlier.
A government that conceals the sovereign debt, elections and a new government that pulls on the same strand.
Prodi made it in Italy to Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal to Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense that in the beginning of the year, Ecofin is saving Hungary from non-compliance with its foreign payments and is therefore eligible for a euro-member country to stop fulfilling its obligations.
On the other hand, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and to take its citizens into the duty to maintain the stability of the state funds when necessary.
Yes, we are, as expected, faced with an episode of normalization of risk premiums, after some deviations on too high amounts, it would now be within expectation.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to worry as long as the differences in government debt increase at the same speed as the European company boni.
However, if European differences were to be reduced and Spanish continued to increase, this would be a special Spanish risk.
Standard & Poor's is a farce. While the previously preferred indicators force a large part of the market research institutes to prefer their scenarios for recovery and correct their 2011 scenario upwards, including the OCDE and the European Commission, which come back with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, all this does not promise a long life despite warnings.
It seems to be an excellent opportunity to purchase Spanish shares, although at the moment it is said that it is “precaution when driving”.
Connected branches
The chairman of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to appear in front of Parliament's Subcommittee yesterday, where during these days the strategy on Spain's energy supply will be debated over the next two decades.
After his appearance, followed by the chairman of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press a few points about what he had submitted to the Subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to the chairman of Iberdrola, by 2020 Spain will have to invest 50 billion euros and another 60 billion from that date until 2030, in the sense that the current nuclear power plants continue to operate.
If this were not the case, the investments needed would not amount to 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that one should no longer invest in an increase in energy production capacity, but in distribution networks and international associations.
As of 2020, the question will change and performance should be increased.
Its proposal focuses both on gas and coalworks with facilities for the capture of carbon dioxide and, of course, on renewable energy.
In this case, he assumes that 18,000 MW will be needed more under the precaution natural by other “support energies”
Galán, who believes that the draft set for a sustainable economy, which was just adopted by the government, is on a line with what his company has called for, in no way wanted to say anything against this law, how to create incentives for national coal consumption, which would be exactly the opposite of all policy strategies in the fight against climate change.
In the long term, he felt, one would clearly point to this direction, despite some \"single\" measures, as the chairman of Iberdrola pointed out.
Be it as it is, Galán believes that the decisions on investment, even if they are long-term, should be made, as it will take some time and a stable remuneration framework must be created to tackle them.
Ferrovial receives the \"handling\" from Aer Lingus at ten airports
Ferrovial's subsidiary for services at airports on the ground, Swissport, is the preferred partner of the Irish Flugesellschaft Aer Lingus for luggage service at ten European airports where they are represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The agreement, for which no figures have been announced so far, has been drawn up for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the government of Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a protocol for cooperation to create an innovation centre for intelligent infrastructures.
The alliance plans investments ranging from 20 million to 2012, of which 50% will be of Ferrovial.
One of the Centre's tasks will be to examine energy efficiency at motorways and airports.
Acciona competes with Hochtief and Bouygues for its first motorway construction in Australia
Acciona is fighting for the approval of his first motorway in Australia, a market in which they are already represented as energy and water companies.
The construction around it is a tunnel that will cost 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about 1.047 billion euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German Hochtief are its competitors.
A 5 km long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for Acciona to establish itself in the country as a construction and highway operator.
The city administration wants to have completed the construction at the end of 2014.
After the administration decided on a public-private cooperation (PPP is the English abbreviation) to advance the project according to a business plan established by Ernst & Young, the administration is already in possession of a final list of candidates for construction and toll management.
In the expectation of the offers presented in May, the estimated investments amount to $1.7 billion in Australian dollars (1.047 billion), with three consortia competing in the last phase, mainly from European construction companies.
The group called Transcity is headed by Acciona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first company is one of Australia's largest construction companies, while the second with its headquarters in Italy is one of the best civil engineering specialists.
Against Acciona's team, the Northern Direct consortium is formed by the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield, which is responsible for the infrastructures and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium, which is in the narrowest choice, is called LBRJV, formed from the capital of the Australian Leighton (the subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, which in turn belongs to ACS), the native Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bildinger Berger) and the French company Razel, which specialises in public construction.
The Australian infrastructure market promises huge construction and privatisations, but has a hurdle to overcome, as it is only by buying a local construction company to gain access.
A strategy followed by the aforementioned companies Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and which must only be pursued by the Spanish construction giants.
Even ACS has gained access to this market only by its participation of 30% in high depth, owner of the said Leighton.
Millions of assets
Acciona places great importance on this geographical area for the sector in which it is already well known as an energy supplier and in the desalination industry due to its activity.
Among other activities, it already has its large windmill park (192 MW) in Victoria and is leading the group of companies that have been commissioned to build and manage Adelaide's desalination plant with a budget of 700 million.
Its aim is now to consolidate itself in these two areas and to use these synergies to gain access to the branches of construction and infrastructure.
The underground toll line, which is promoted by the Office of Infrastructure of the City of Brisbane and called Northern Link (Northern Tobreder), has the purpose of connecting the western motorway in Toowong with the bypass road in Kelvin Grove (see map) on a length of 5 kilometres by tunnel. This is the major measure of the disturbance on the streets of Brisbane.
The schedule issued by the City Administration foresees the allocation for summer 2010 and the start of construction work in December next year.
Even if this toll line is to be opened for transport in the last few months of 2014, it is expected that construction work will continue until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
It has two tracks in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Government of Queensland participates in financing with 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros).
For high depth Brisbane is already a big business.
Australia is granting high depth, which yesterday signed a contract with the government of 154 million, again and again considerable orders.
The ACS sub-company will improve the infrastructure of the domestic broadband network with fiber optic cables through its local subsidiary Leighton.
This improvement will create fast Internet access for 400,000 people and will employ the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the King George Tower's construction project with 27 floors in the Australian city of Brisbane. Construction work has not yet begun and Hochtief has received 129 million for this purpose.
In the United Kingdom too, in Manchester, Laing O'Rourke competes for the construction and administration of two schools for 25 years.
The initial investments amount to 75 million euros.
FCC receives the order for a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
Thanks to its subsidiary Alpine, FCC has provided the construction of a tunnel over 2.1 kilometres in length for a motorway in Slovenia over the sum of EUR 64,5 million.
The company received this contract only a few days after it received the surcharge for construction work to expand the Bosruck tunnel (Austria) to over 130 million.
In this way, Alpine enhances its experience in tunnel construction.
The start of construction work is planned for the beginning of 2010 and its implementation will take over 32 months.
Sra. Rushmore receives advertising from Renfe
Renfe has attributed advertising and marketing services to Sra. Rushmore for the next two years over a sum of approximately three million euros a year, the railway company informed.
In this contract there is also the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Sra. Rushmore was selected among 16 agencies, which presented itself to this competition of Renfe, from which 4 came into the final round, among them TBWA, which has been responsible for advertising over the last three years.
From now on, Sra. Rushmore will be tasked with the design and production of the campaigns.
Punish over 63 million for France Télécom for the withdrawal of competition.
France Télécom has imposed a fine of over 63 million euros for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean regions of France.
According to the Authority, the telephone provider has restricted competition in fixed network and mobile phones by signing exclusive contracts, price plans and loyalty programmes for consumers on the edge of regulation.
Together with this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company has accumulated more than 560 million euros in penalties since 1994 due to the disability of its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday has even been increased, since the authority who is guarding over the competition believes that France Télécom has committed similar offences in the past and has therefore returned.
Trade in applications
On the other hand, the French company’s subsidiary has followed the example of other telephone providers and has opened an application trading page on the Internet to increase revenue from business that does not come out of the telephone.
In principle, this application website of Orange is active in France and the United Kingdom.
One must wait until 2010 until this site is also available in other countries, such as Spain.
The match at the Champions League has brought Madrid and Barça to 476.4 million since the beginning.
The Champions League has developed into a source of revenue for the football club since its creation in 1992.
So much that Real Madrid and Barcelona have since taken 476.4 million, bringing them the third and fifth place of football clubs that have earned the most money in the league.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
To win UEFA's Champions League not only brings glory to itself. It is also one of the major revenue sources of the major clubs.
According to the UEFA, the League distributed up to 5,362.5 million euros to the 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) who have been participating in this event since its founding in the 1992/1993 season.
Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona benefited from this distribution.
The white club is third in Europe, which earned the most money through its participation and the only one that won the trophy three times next to the AC Milan.
The last winner of the former European Cup in 1992 is the fifth.
The list leads Manchester United and Bayern München, two teams that also took the most money through their participation in the last Champoins League.
And that, although they lost against Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only third of the countries that could take money through the Champions, although it has more titles than everyone else (five, unlike four bie Italy, three at England and two at Germany).
Distribution
This obvious contradiction is explained by the complicated monetary allocation procedure applied by UEFA.
In this financial year, the organization, chaired by Michel Platini, expects revenues of 1,090 million by the Champions League.
The UEFA 413.1 million for fixed payments, each of the 20 football clubs participating in the qualifying round (including the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition to the 550,000 euros for each game they fought, those who fought for a participation received 3.8 million by their mere presence.
There is also a bonus for winning (800,000 euros) and for one team (400,000 per team). Clubs that have come to the eighth finals receive three million each; the four that have come to the quarter finals, 3.3 million each.
The last four get 4 million each.
The winner earns 9 million, unlike the second one, which receives 5.2 million.
Thus, a football club receives at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million in fixed revenue.
In turn, Barça earned 2.5 million with his victory at the European Supercup in August.
However, the variable payments for which 337.8 million are planned are still available.
This money is allocated proportionately to the value of each single television market.
The Spanish belongs to the first and has 4 assigned places.
The master of the last year receives 40% of the allocated money, 30% of the second, 20% of the third placed and 10% of the fourth place.
The other part is distributed depending on the number of games they play during this year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million for 29.9 % of Sous
The Nueva Rumasa Group yesterday had details of the purchase of shares, with which it wants to purchase a ceiling between 25 and 29.9% of Sos' capital.
A percentage which does not force them to make a public tender (opa) due to the number of shares.
In concrete terms, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1.5025 per share, which is paid out to ten years and with an interest rate of 1% per year due to this shift.
Last night, the Sos shares ended at EUR 1.85, which is why Nueva Rumasa rated the company 18% below the market value.
According to Nuevan Rumasa, the price of 1.50 Euro reflects the real assessment of Sos.
The offer is associated with the appointment of eight of the 15 consultants.
The group from Jeréz gives shareholders a 15-day deadline to share their interest in selling their shares.
CNMV assured that it had not been informed of this offer, although the company Ruiz Mateos confirmed that it had come into contact with the Authority.
At one conclusion, the deposit would amount to 611.7 million, while the value of Sos is 25.4.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure his management.
The brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar announced the appointment of María Luisa Jordá as head of the internal book review in an attempt to stay at the edge of possible purchase offers and the judicial quarries of his ex-managers.
A decision to become the first woman to have a high post with the food company.
This is a newly created post, which is directly under the chairman of the group.
This is all but free from polemics because the company is engaged in a judicial battle because of the suspicion of diverting more than 230 million of Sos to other Salazar family societies.
It cannot be excluded that Sos will continue to shift capital over the next few months.
In view of Salazar's credit yesterday, ex-consultants Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) came before the National Assembly and confirmed that they had approved the shift of 212 million without knowing their determination.
CNMV approves Paternina’s public exclusion invitation to tender submitted by the investment company Mer
The National Stock Exchange Commission (CNMV) approved the public exclusion invitation to tender for Federico Paternina submitted by the investment company Mer on 9 October.
The Supervisory Authority stated that it approved this invitation to tender after it had been demonstrated that the conditions were met by the law enforcement laws and that the content of the statement of the notice presented, according to the changes made last December 2nd, can be considered as sufficient.
CNMV has also announced that this offer is aimed at the acquisition of 55.008 shares of Federico Paternina at the price of 7,65 Euros per share, which is in turn 8.95% of company capital composed of 6,142,786 Euros in shares approved on the Madrid and Bilbao Stock Exchanges.
It has also been announced that 5,592,778 million shares have been established, which cannot be transferred until the conclusion of the tender and whose price has been fixed by Federico Paternina in accordance with the laws of law.
New vehicle assessment programmes
In these days of storms and accidents, not only do the KFZ workshops deserve
Every day, thousands of vehicles engaged in an accident are dragged into the workshops, where an expert must assess the damage caused and the cost of repair.
No single accident is the same and calculating the cost of parts and hours of work can be a long and complicated task.
The calculation of repair costs of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros by hand, including parts and hours of work, may take up to two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest computer science tools, it is a matter of minutes
Therefore, almost 100 % of experts use this type of system.
The service and application providers for the evaluation of accidents and repairs collect the information they receive from manufacturers to process it thereafter and offer it to their customers in the form of a useful programme.
In Spain, Audatex, part of the American group Solera, is the market leader; 80% of all opinions are produced with their products.
The two other companies competing with the tool market for assessment and preparation of a report are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data that manufacturers provide is anything but simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, Sales Manager of Audatex, 63 manufacturers and importers are working together, each of them providing the information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed is increasing, up to the point that over the last five years more versions, variants and motorisations have come on the market than over the past fifteen years.
As soon as a new car enters the market, work begins for the companies.
It is a difficult task, because every single of the Aber thousand parts of the vehicle must be catagolized and its price entered.
In addition, a “intelligent - graphic image” is created by each model, on which you can click on different parts of the vehicle.
If this is a much sold model, work can be completed in one week if the procedure progresses quickly.
If this is a less used car, it can take up to three or four months. At present, Audatex has 99.2% of the cars sold in Spain with complete information.
Among the more exclusive models, for example, they have information about the Porsche models, but not about Ferrari or Lamborghini.
With regard to the vehicle park driving on the roads, it is more than 99%.
For the performance of documentation and the production of databases, Audatex has eight centres (Spain, France, Germany, the USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) distributed worldwide and each of them specializes in certain brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanics professionals) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million euros annually in the development of these databases.
Each month they record 2.5 million data and their customers receive the updates every second day.
The development of this enormous flow of information allows companies to use them in different ways and thus offer different products.
The most common use is for repairs and repairs, but there are also tools for managing scrap parts, depending on the country, or for calculating the error or residual value of a car.
The only company that informs about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer this offer in Spain, but in the United States.
In the transparency of the products Audatex offers, you can easily get an overview of the type of support they provide to industry experts.
This company offers ten different tools, with the star of AudaPlus products being a standard solution for accounting for accidents for the auditors.
It includes vehicles, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the painting prices.
This tool is paid depending on the purpose of use, i.e. for each opinion.
It is most expensive for customers who rarely use it for a maximum of ten times a month, namely 5.75 euros per month.
On the other hand, each insurance company, which makes thousands of opinions, negotiates the price with Audatex.
With other products, such as AudaVIN, you can completely identify a vehicle and the equipment with which it ran from the assembly belt only on the basis of the chassis number.
AudaGlass deals with the vehicle panes, and AudaSubastas is an open-source service for the trade market, which can be offered for vehicles that have been declared total damage.
Your statistical service is very useful in identifying trends, conducting geodemographic analyses or in order to obtain information on the deviations by brand and model.
For example, it is possible to examine how many models of a particular car brand had to go into the workshop due to panels or how many of them were involved in a serious accident during a given period of time.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to developing this type of computer tools.
It distributes other Gt estimations, which are also intended for auditors and provides digital images in the same way, access to parts or prices and official working hours of the manufacturer.

Increase of accident cars on the Internet
In the past October, the Group Solera Autoonline bought a discfom on the Internet for the sale of accident vehicles and motorcycles.
This purchase meant the payment of 59.5 million euros for 85% of the company's capital, which could increase to the remaining 15% next year.
The purpose of this purchase was to offer its customers more services and value increases, with the possibility of gaining access to a huge international market.
This assessment and purchasing service applies exclusively to industry professionals, such as insurance companies, auditors, car rental companies, workshops, scrap sites and car dealers, who have to register before their activities.
This platform was founded in Germany in 1996 and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, 500,000 of them alone in Germany.

According to Spanish legislation, a vehicle whose chassis number has been unregistered shall no longer be allowed to drive on the roads, but certain non-damaged parts may be used as spare parts.
However, the historic-value cars may be re-authorized even if they have been unregistered after difficult administrations.
Cost estimate of the workshop in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the Audatex company ensures that the user receives a cost estimate in just four steps:Identifying the vehicle, searching the spare part, creating and creating a cost estimate.
The easy use of these systems is a basic condition, especially to convince the older professionals, who are usually more or less opposed to the use of these new computer techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, 666 of which are passenger vehicles, 109 land cars, 137 motorcycles, 78 small transporters and 44 trucks.
Of course, you need a computer with internet connection for use.
After the model to be repaired has been identified using the chassis number, a graphic of the respective model appears and then the required spare part is selected.
The user can include variables such as the price of working hours, ups or discounts and then print out the cost estimate and pass it on to his customers.
AudaTaller, however, is not a tool for reviewing such as AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalog.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop does not include estimated working hours.
The cost of use for this tool is 350 euros a year, an amount that the customer can pay without further delay.
Currently, the Audatex company is working to offer these images in three-dimensional format as well.
This is an innovation that auto-mechanics have been waiting for a long time, because you can select a door with it, for example, and then completely reverse the image to look at the inside.
