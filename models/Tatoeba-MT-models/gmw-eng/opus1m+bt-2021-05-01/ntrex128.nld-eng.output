Members of the Wales National Assembly are worried that they will be ‘compared with Muppets’
There is a stir among the members of the Wales National Assembly through a proposal that their title would be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament - Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal is a consequence of the plans to change the current name ‘Welsh Assembly’ to ‘Welsh Parliament’.
Members of the National Assembly of various political parties are concerned that the new name will come across ridiculously.
A member of the National Assembly of Wales of the Labour Party said that MWP ‘swims on Twp and Pwp'.
For readers outside Wales: twp is Welsh for crazy and pwp is Welsh for poop.
A member of the Wales National Assembly of the Plaid Party said that the group as a whole is ‘unsatisfied’ and has proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welshe Conservative Party said that his party was ‘open’ to the change of name, but noticed that the words MWP and Muppet look very similar.
In this context, the Welshe letter W is pronounced as a short one.
The Commission of the Wales National Assembly, which is currently preparing legislation to carry out the change of name, said: ‘It is of course the members of the Wales National Assembly themselves who take the final decision on their new title.’
With the Government of Wales Act 2017, members of the National Assembly of Wales were given the right to change the name of the Assembly.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which showed that most people felt that the National Assembly should be rebaptised to Parliament.
As regards the title of members of the National Assembly, the Commission proposed ‘Welsh Parliament Members’ or WMPs, but the MWP option received the most support in the public consultation.
At present, Members of the National Assembly would propose alternatives, but President Elin Jones will have difficulty reaching a consensus, and in a few weeks' time she will have to submit a bill on the changes.
The reform legislation also includes other amendments to the way the National Assembly works, including rules on the suspension of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the system of committees.
Members of the National Assembly will definitely be able to vote on their new title when they debate legislation.
Residents of Macedonia will vote in a referendum on the amendment of their country's name
On Sunday, voters voted to change the name of their country to ‘Republic of Northern Macedonia’.
The popular referendum was organised in an attempt to resolve a pending dispute with neighbouring Greece, which itself has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighborhood means that the country would claim its territory and has repeatedly objected to Macedonia's requests to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who is opposed to the popular opinion on the change of name, said that he will not take into account the outcome of The referendum.
However, advocates of the referendum, including Premier Zoran Zaev, state that the change of name is simply the price to be paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The bells Saint Martin's silences, those of Harlem have trouble.
‘The older people I spoke to said that here used to be a café and a church at every corner,' said Mr. Adams.
Today there's no café here, no church to trace.'
He said it's understandable that cafés have disappeared.
‘People now have social contact in another way,’ he said.
‘Cafés are no longer the living room of the district, where people regularly pass by.’
However, he is concerned that the proceeds of selling the assets of the churches will be less long if the leaders expect, ‘and they will be back at the beginning’.
Churches, he adds, could be replaced by apartment buildings with flats where the kind of people would live that would not help in the remaining refuges of the neighborhood.
‘The vast majority of people who will buy flats in such buildings will be white,’ he says, ‘which will cause these churches to be closed even faster, because it is unlikely that the people who move to these flats will become members of the church community.’
Both churches were once built by a white church, before Harlem became a black metropolis: the metropolitan community in 1870, Saint Martin's 10 years later.
The original church of white Methodists left in the 1930s.
A black church congregation from the neighborhood took over the building.
Saint Martin's was taken over by a black church under the direction of Ehrwert John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of shopkeepers in 125th Street, an important shopping street in Harlem, where blacks could rarely get a job or be promoted.
In 1939 the building was seriously damaged, but when the parishioners of Ehrwert Johnson planned to rebuild the church, they also bought a carcasses.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Honor Johnson and his successor in Saint Martin's, proudly called the beard ‘the bells of the poor'.
The expert who played the carcasses in July referred in a different way to the instrument: ‘a cultural treasure’ and ‘an irreplaceable historical instrument’.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first beacon in the world ever played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who moved 18 years ago to the larger beacon of the Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather said Saint Martin's hadn't replaced him.
The events of the last few months in Saint Martin's are a complicated story of architects and contractors, some hired by the laymen of the church, others by the diocese.
The Consistorie (the governing body of the parish consisting of laymen) wrote in July to express her concern that the diocese would ‘count the costs’ to the consistor, although the consistory had not been involved in hiring the architects and contractors who had sent the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency of the diocese.
Shark wounded 13-year-olds who dived to crabs in California
Saturday, on the first day of the crab season, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy who was dying of crabs in California.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. in the morning near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had spent about half an hour with friends on Saturday when he heard the boy screaming for help. Together with a few others, he peddled to the boy to pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that he first thought the boy was calling because he had caught a lobster, but then he realized “that the boy was crying, ‘ I’m bitten!
I'm bitten!'
His key leg was completely open,' Hammel saw as he approached the boy.
‘I shouted that everyone should leave the water, ‘There is a shark in the water!'.
The boy was taken with a helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is said to be in danger of life.
It is not known which shark species is responsible for the attack.
Strandwacht Captain Larry Giles told us in a press conference that a shark had been mocked in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was then concluded that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim was seriously injured by the upper body.
The authorities closed access to Ponto Beach beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours with a view to research and safety.
Giles noted that more than 135 shark species live in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's wants to break through the British beauty market
Sainsbury's competes with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and directs beauty departments where specialized assistants work, such as in large warehouses.
The initiative is part of a strategy to conquer the British beauty market, worth £2.8 billion and continues to grow, while selling fashion and household items continues to decline. The larger beauty departments are being tested in 11 stores across the country. If they prove successful, they will be introduced into even more shops next year.
The investment in the beauty market is also a result of the fact that supermarkets want to fill the ranks where ever there were televisions, microwaves and interior items.
Sainsbury's wants to double its beauty offer and offer 3,000 products, including for the first time brands like Revlon, Essie, Twezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also gets more space, with a tableau per brand, as in shops like Boots.
The supermarket also brings its boutique make-up back to the market, now that most products are suitable for vegans, some younger shoppers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, perfumery will test the Fragrance Shop concessions in two Sainsbury's shops. The first one was opened in Croydon, south London, the second one will be opened later this year in Sellly Oak, Birmingham.
As more and more people are shopping online and buying small quantities of food on a daily basis in local supermarkets, supermarkets need to make more effort to convince people to shop with them.
Mike Coupe, Chief Executive of Sainsbury's, says that the shops will look more and more like warehouses, now that the supermarket chain captures it against discounters Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food.
Sainsbury's integrated Argos sales points into hundreds of shops and has also opened a number of Habitats since both chains were taken over two years ago. According to the company, the sales of food increased and the acquisitions generated more returns.
The last time the supermarket tried to give its departments beauty and pharmacy a make-over, that became a flop.
Sainsbury's cooperation with Boots began in the early 2000s, but cooperation ended when a conflict arose about distributing the revenue from the pharmacy division in the supermarkets.
This is a new strategy since Sainsburys sold its 281 pharmacies in the shops three years ago for an amount of 125 million British pounds to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
Lloyds would also play a role in the plan, by adding an extensive range of luxury brands for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury's, said: ‘We have completely changed the setting of our beauty department, making it more enjoyable for our customers.
We have also invested in the specialized training of our employees, who will be ready to give advice.
With our offer of brands, we offer something for everyone, and thanks to the attractive surroundings and convenient locations, we make sure that our customers like to buy their beauty products from us, and no longer shop in the old way.'
Peter Jones 'wounding' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from deal of 11 million pounds
Peter Jones, one of the stars of Dragons Den, is 'wounding' because TV presenter Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from a deal of 11 million pounds with his lifestyle business. She wants to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for Truly, their brand for homewear and accessories.
The company of Jones and Willoughby will be compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old present of This Morning announced on Instagram that she's leaving.
Peter Jones of Dragons Den is racing on Holly Willoughby, because she has recently withdrawn from their profitable lifestyle business to focus on her contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was ‘wounding’ when Willoughby announced at a difficult meeting in the headquarters of the company in Marlow, Buckinghamshire that she was not spending enough time on Truly, their brand for homewear and accessories due to her new contracts (with a value of about one and a half million pounds).
The company is compared with the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow and is expected to double Willoughby's fortune of an estimated 11 million pounds.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she would leave Truly, Jones moved to one of his holiday homes abroad.
One source said: ‘Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
It would ensure its long-term future, and produce enough for the next decades.
Everyone was blinded when she decided to withdraw.
No one could believe his ears last Tuesday, because the launch was planned for soon.
The warehouse of the main establishment in Marlow is full of products ready for sale.'
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter, one of the most profitable stars in Britain, could cost the company millions, as a result of the large investments in products from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear, and as the launch could lead to further delays.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, who have three children, have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, became president of the company in March.
The two sets often go together on vacation and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's television production business.
Willoughby will soon become M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as the presenter of the I'm A Celebrity programme on the British ITV.
A source from Jones' entourage said last night: ‘We have no comment on his business affairs.’
Hard language “and then it was love between us”
He joked about the criticism he would get in the media about a comment he made that some people would find ‘unsuitable to a president’ and about his positive view of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump imitated a news anchor when he said:
‘I didn't give up anything.'
He added that Kim is interested in a second meeting. Trump described their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards the dismantling of nuclear weapons in North Korea.
But negotiations on nuclear weapons removal have been held.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, top diplomat Ri Yong Ho of North Korea told leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea does not see a ‘agreement reaction’ by the United States after the first disarmament initiatives of North Korea.
In the meantime, the United States continues its sanctions to pressure the boiler, he says.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech during the election rally.
‘We do it very well in North Korea,’ he said.
‘We were close to a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a fantastic relationship.\"
He said that his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim have led to positive results, the rocket tests have ended, hostages have been released, and the material surpluses of American military have returned to their own country.
He also defended his unusual approach to his relationship with Kim.
‘It’s as easy to behave like a president, but instead of 10,000 people trying to access these pressing arena, there would be about 200 people standing here,’ Trump said, while he was in front of the public.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroyed an island, killing hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told that their aid was not needed.
Although more than 10% of the Lombok population had lost their homes, no national disaster was announced, which is a requirement for international aid to be launched.
‘In many cases, unfortunately, it is clear that they are not requesting international aid, which is difficult for us,’ said Mrs. Sumbung.
Save the Children is creating a team to travel to Palu, but it is not certain that the help providers from abroad can work locally.
Mr Sutopo, spokesperson for the Agency for Relief in the event of national disasters, said that Indonesian officials were still evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international organisations would be authorized to assist.
Although Indonesia is constantly plagued by earthquakes, the country is still very poorly prepared for the anger of nature.
In Aceh shelters were built to hide from tsunamis, but you rarely see them along other coasts.
That there was no warning signal for tsunamis present in Palu, even though there was a warning of force, probably contributed to the number of deaths.
It can also be difficult to travel from one Indonesian island to another in ideal circumstances.
National disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that was in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days before the ship reaches the place of the disaster.
The improvement of the portless infrastructure of Indonesia was one of the core points of President Joko Widodo's election campaign, and he has already spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But President Joko's government has a lack of funding, and that while he hopes to be re-elected next year.
President Joko is also pressured by persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Islamic majority today follow a rather conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to leave their homes because Christian and Islamic gangs fought on the streets, with machetes, arrows, bows, and other primitive weapons.
Look at: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool provides impressive equalizer against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge protected Liverpool last Saturday from losing Chelsea in the Premier League, with a goal in the 89th minute, during a race in Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he stood at a distance of about 30 meters from Chelsea's goal, at the time his team was standing behind with 1-0.
He tapped left against the ball and then kicked in the direction of the far pole.
The ball flew high above the criminal area, in the direction of the upper right corner of the net.
He developed the jump of Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
‘It was very difficult to reach that position, to reach the ball, and players like Shaq always play as much forward as possible,' Sturridge said to LiverpoolFC.com.
‘I saw Kante approaching and daring an attempt. I didn’t really think about it, I just kicked on the ball.’
Chelsea was at rest with 1-0 ahead, after a goal of the Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues hit the ball with his heel to Mateo Kovacic, after which he rushed through the middle field to Liverpool's playmate.
Kovacic did a quick one-two on the middle field.
After that, he gave a beautiful stairway, which enabled Hazard to reach the penal area.
Hazard was faster than the defense and kicked the ball with his left foot past Alison Becker of Liverpool in the net, next to the rear pole.
Liverpool plays on Wednesday at 15 o'clock in the group phase of the Champions League against Napoli, at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea takes it in London on Thursday at 15 o'clock against Videoton in the UEFA Europe League.
The death toll of tsunamis in Indonesia runs up to 832
The death toll of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, said the Agency for Relief in National Disasters Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings that were collapsed as a result of the earthquake with a force of 7.5 last Friday, including waves of 6 m high, said spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a news conference.
The city of Palu, where over 380,000 people live, is full of ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after woman has been stabbed
This morning, a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, after which a murder investigation was opened.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55 in Grayson Mews in John Street. The body showed stab wounds. A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police ask locals to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Police inspector Brian O'Hagan said: ‘The investigation has only just begun, but I want to ask anyone who has been around John Street in Birkenhead and who has seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to ask everyone, in particular taxi drivers, to contact if they may have filmed something through a dashcam, because they can have information that is essential for our research.'
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found is a local resident of Birkenhead and that she was found in a building.
This afternoon friends who thought they knew the woman on the spot to ask questions about the place where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police have confirmed that they are currently informing the victim's family.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has tried to enter his apartment, but was told by the police that no one can enter or exit the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what happened.
The residents are now told that it will take hours before they can return home.
A policeman would have told someone that the area is being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared crying on the spot.
She keeps repeating, ‘What a shame!'.
At 14 o'clock, two police cars were inside the deposit, and a third were just outside.
Within the deposit, a number of agents watched the apartment building.
If you have information, you are asked to send a message to @MerPolCC, to call 101 or to contact Crimestoppers at number 0800 555 111, with log 247 of 30 September.
View of Cromwell to the British Parliament is the latest victim of the 'rewriting history'-rel
The banishment of the statue would be a poetic justice for the Taliban-like destruction of the many cultural and religious objects of art carried out by his fanatic Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Dr. Crick's suggestion as ‘dwaas' and ‘an attempt to rewrite history.'
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: ‘It was inevitable that the current debate on removing statues would lead to the vision of Oliver Cromwell just outside the Houses of Parliament.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the last century.
The beautiful image of Cromwell, made by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, testifies to the opinion that prevailed in the 19th century and is part of the history of a figure that, according to many people, is still to be recognized.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: ‘Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether this is a perfectly correct picture, debate is still under way.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure representing one side of that gap.
His achievements as Lord Protector must also be recognised and remembered.'
Angry pig kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in the southwest of China, according to reports in the local media.
The man, of whom only the surname ‘Yuan’ is known, was found dead at a stable on the market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou. His artery was pierced and he was in the blood, reported the South China Morning Post Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares for the inning of pigs at a pig stalk, on 30 May 2005, in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He was said to have traveled from Yunnan Province on Wednesday with his cousin to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and turned open a door to a neighboring pig stalk.
According to the cousin, there was a large male pig with blood on its mouth in the pig cage.
A forensic study revealed that the pig killed the farmer of 250 kg, according to the report.
‘My cousin's legs were bleeding and mutilated,' said the cousin named ‘Wu', according to the newspaper Guiyang Evening News.
On images of surveillance cameras, it can be seen that Yuan arrived on the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was neither Yuan nor his cousin.
A market leader told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent others from attacking while the police collected evidence on the spot.
It is said that the Yuan and market authorities are negotiating a compensation for its death.
It is rare, but there have been cases of pigs attacking people before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injury to the man.
Ten years earlier, a pig of 300 kg pushed a farmer from Wales against his tractor until his wife chased the animal away.
When a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba at CBC News testified that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the taste of blood can trigger aggression.
\"They're just playful.
They're just kids, very curious, they don't want to hurt people.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect,' he said.
The hurricane tail Rosa brings heavy rain to the southwest of the US
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening from now that she has reached the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring heavy rains to the north of Mexico and the southwest in the next few days.
With a wind speed of 135 km per hour, Rosa was a hurricane of category 1, at 5 o'clock on Sunday morning, and was 620 km from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough begins to form above the Pacific Ocean, which moves eastward toward the west coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the peninsula of Baja California on Monday as a tropical storm, tropical humidity is pushed northward, to the southwest of the US.
Rosa will bring 10 centimeters of rain to parts of Mexico Monday.
Then, tropical moisture that reacts with the approaching trough will cause widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, 2 to 10 cm rain will cause dangerous floods, debris flows and possibly soil disturbances in the desert.
Tropical moisture will cause precipitation of 5 to 8 cm per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected to rain from 5 to 10 cm in parts of the southwest, especially above most of Arizona.
There are sudden floods possible with rapidly worsening conditions, as the tropical rains can be very widespread.
It is strongly discouraged to enter the desert on foot when the tropical rainfall threatens.
The heavy rainfall can surround ravines in deserted rivers, and storms will produce local winds and dust.
The approaching trough brings local heavy rains to parts of the coastline of southern California.
There is rain of 1.5 cm possible, which could lead to small debris flows and smooth roads.
This would be the first rainfall of the region in the rainy season.
Distributed tropical rains will approach Arizona Sunday night until Monday morning, after which the rain Monday end of the day and Tuesday will be more spread.
Heavy rainfall will spread over the Four Corners on Tuesday and will continue to fall until Wednesday.
In October, the temperature in the US can fluctuate greatly, as the North Pole becomes cooler, but the tropics remain quite warm.
This sometimes leads to huge differences in temperature over short distances.
There is a beautiful example of impressive temperature differences in the middle of the US on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is almost 20 degrees.
In the coming days, the constant summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
In much of the middle and east of the US, October would be expected to start warm, with temperatures all over that fluctuating around 30°C, from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
In New York, Tuesday can be 27 degrees, which is about 10 degrees warmer than the average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows that until mid-October the opportunity is high at above average temperatures in the Eastern United States.
Over 20 million people attended Brett Kavanaugh’s hearing
Over 20 million people looked at Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, one of the six television networks, at one of Brett Kavanaugh, the woman who accused him of an assault reportedly taking place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued, while broadcasts interrupted the regular programming for Friday's surprise: an agreement arranged by Jeff Flake, Senator of Arizona, to investigate the charge for a week.
Ford told the Senate Committee on Justice that she was 100 percent sure that a drunk Kavanaugh was taunting her and was trying to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh stated in a natural testimony that he was 100 percent certain that this had not happened.
It is likely that over 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen checked on Friday.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
No figures were immediately available for the other networks that sent out the hearing, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people who look in an office.
In comparison, this is about as for a playoff of a football match or for the Oscar performance.
Fox News Channel, which gives Kavanaugh all the support, had most viewers during the day of the hearing: an average of 5.69 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
ABC followed with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million viewers, MSNBC had 2.89 million viewers, and CNN had 2.52 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
Even after the hearing, the public remained very interested.
Flake was the central figure of the events on Friday.
After the agency of the moderate Republican issued a statement that he would support Kavanaugh with his voice, the cameras of CNN and CBS registered on Friday morning that protesters were shouting at him when he tried to take the elevator to a hearing of the Commission for Justice.
He stayed standing for a few minutes with broken eyes while he was being shamed, live on CNN.
‘I am right here for you,’ said one woman.
‘Do you think he's telling the people the truth?
Someone cried: ‘You have power, while so many women are powerless.’
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and just before the elevator closed, he added that he would say more during the hearing.
The various broadcasters sent out everything live when the judicial committee had to vote hours later on the appointment of Kavanaugh in the Senate.
But Flake said he would only vote in favour of that understanding that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the nominee by the next week, something the Democrats of the minority insist on.
Flake was convinced, among other things, by his friend Chris Coons, Senator and Democrat.
Flake took his decision after a conversation with Coons and several senators.
Flakes' choice was important because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the necessary votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'a political game' around Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Premier Theresa May politicians criticized her plans to leave the European Union of ‘a political game’ with the future of Great Britain and undermine national interests.
Prime Minister of Great Britain Theresa May will attend the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Great Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, on the same front page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson stressed his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for the Brexit, saying that her proposal that Great Britain and the EU should pay each other's taxes was ‘absurd'.
Shooting Party Wayde Sims: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson as suspect of the death of LSU player
The police arrested a suspect for the shooting in which Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU, was shot.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and is in prison for suspicion of murder, said Baton Rouge's police.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police saying Sims lost his glasses during the battle.
The police found the glasses at the crime scene and found Simpson's DNA on the glasses, reported WABB, a CBS television station.
The police interrogated Simpson and later declared that he had known that he had shot Wayde with death.
His deposit is set at $350,000, the Advocate reports.
On Friday, the head of the municipality in East Baton Rouge published a preliminary report stating that the cause of death is a gunshot wound in the neck.
The report states that the Fugitive Task Force of the Louisiana State Police, the crime lab of the state police, the police of Southern University and local residents all contributed to the investigation that led to a arrest.
Sports Director Joe Alleva of LSU thanked local police for his ‘commitment and desire for justice.'
Sims was 20 years old.
He was 198 cm tall and grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
Last season he scored an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per race.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the team ‘chapot' and ‘in shock’ was killed by Waydes.
‘This is an event you always hope it will never happen,’ Wade says.
Volcano spews as in Mexico City
The ash being spilled out by the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern regions of the capital city of Mexico.
The National Centre for Rampenprevention warned the Mexicans last Saturday to stay away from the volcano, after activity was picked up in the crater and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded in a 24 hour period.
The center repeatedly detected rumble and vibrations.
On social media, photos of a thin layer of ash appeared on highways in areas of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in activity in the volcano, which is located at 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, the first time since September 2017, when an earthquake with a force of 7.1 hit the scale of Richter central Mexico.
The volcano, called ‘Don Goyo’, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence activists succeeded with the riot police, while thousands participated in rival demonstrations on the occasion of the first anniversary of the vote on independence in Catalonia that disintegrated the region into two groups.
A group of masked pro-separatists who were held back by the riot police called for eggs and powder paint agents, creating dark dust clouds in the streets that are usually filled with tourists.
Later on the day, gunshots broke out with the police, and the officers pulled their bat up to stop the fighting.
For more than an hour, pro-independent groups sinned: ‘Do not forget, do not forgive’, while their opponents called ‘Long live Spain’.
Fourteen people were treated for slight injuries they experienced during the protests, reported the local press.
The tensions continue to rise in the region of independence, one year after the referendum of 1 October, which Madrid considers illegal, but is celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The voters expressed themselves overwhelmingly to become independent, although the rise was low and the people who opposed separation were boycotting the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1000 people were injured last year after the police had tried to stop the vote in the voting offices in the region, resulting in violent screenings.
Pro-independence groups had camped on the ground on Saturday night to prevent a demonstration to support the national police.
The demonstration continued, but it was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who, along with his wife, attended the separatist protest, said that he was no longer hopeful about Catalonia's prospects of becoming independent.
‘Last year we experienced one of our most beautiful moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy because they could vote, but now we're stuck,' he said.
Although the Catalan pro-independence parties won an essential victory in the regional elections in December, even though it was idle, this year it was difficult for them to build on their success, because many of their best-known leaders are absent, either in their own exile or in captivity, in anticipation of a trial about their role in organizing the referendum and in calling independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old manager who filmed the protest in support of the police on his phone, said that the conflict was raised by politicians on both sides.
‘The tensions are getting higher,’ he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who has been in provisional custody since the end of last year, declared that he is participating in the European Parliament elections next year.
‘A candidate for the European elections is the best way to complain about the decline in democratic values and repression we have seen from the Spanish government,’ he said.
Londonderry: men arrested after house was rammed with a car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car was repeatedly rammed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place on Thursday at 7.30 p.m. local time in Ballynagard Crescent.
Police inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building themselves were damaged.
Perhaps a crossbow on the car has been fired at some point.
Livingston wins 1-0 against Rangers thanks to the goal of Menga
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston gave them the victory
Livingston surprised the Rangers and caused Steven Gerrard's second defeat in a series of 18 races since he was manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal made the difference and Gary Holt's team came to equal height with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team failed this season to win a competition during the Premiership. They have to take it Sunday against leader Hearts, who has eight points ahead of them.
But first the Rangers Rapid Vienna received Thursday in the Europa League.
Livingston is still unbeatable. The team has won six consecutive matches in his department, and coach Holt hasn't had any defeat since he had Kenny Miler replaced last month.
Livingston misses opportunities against strong visitors
Holt's team had long been able to achieve a lead for the first goal, because their direct way of playing caused all sorts of problems at the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but did not succeed in finishing it with a goal. Next Alan Lithgow, who picked up Craig Halkett's headball, kicked the ball over the target.
The home team let the Rangers play with pleasure, waiting for his chances to be calm and confident.
And that ultimately led to the crucial goal.
The Rangers allowed a free trap and Livingston provided an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to create a chance for Menga, who scored from the criminal area.
At that time, the Rangers had had all the time, but the defense of the home team was insurmountable and goal man Liam Kelly had not yet had much to do.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos made sure Kelly had a goal.
Scott Pittman kicked the ball at the feet of Rangers goaltender Allan McGregor and Lithgow missed the goal after a performance by his colleagues from Livingston.
As a result, Livingston's prison area was under threat, but they were denied each time. Two times, a prison was refused, one after Halkett's attack on the intruder Glenn Middleton and one for handball.
Livingston's Phenomenal - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont van BBC Scotland in the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They played excellently without exception and continued to exceed expectations in their race to the top.
Their playing style and the composition of their team has almost changed since their return to the highest regions, but in particular Holt deserves much recognition for the way he has raised the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Commander Halkett was fantastic, with an excellently organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall walked on the tops of their toes during the entire race.
The Rangers, however, did not know how to break.
Even though they have often played very well under Gerrard, this time they did not reach their usual level.
Their final phase was not good enough (they succeeded only once in lowering the home team) and the Rangers will now realize that they need to play better, because they are somewhere in the middle of the classification.
Erdogan is received with mixed feelings in Cologne
Under a radiant blue sky and with a broad smile, the leaders of Turkey and Germany went to breakfast together in Berlin on Saturday (September 29).
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They do not agree on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan left for Cologne for the opening of a gigantic new mosque.
Cologne is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
The police called for security reasons when they stopped the crowd of 25,000 people to gather for the mosque, but many sympathizers came near to see their president.
Hundreds of demonstrators, many of them Kurds, also voiced their voices, condemning Erdogan's policy and the decision of the German government to welcome him to the country.
The rival protests reflect the division of a visitor who is praised by some German Turks as a hero and accused by others as autocrat.
Traffic accident in Deptford: cyclist dies after collision with car
In London a cyclist died in a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, at about 10.15 local time.
The driver stopped the car and the ambulance staff were present, but the man died on the spot.
A few months ago another cyclist died in an accident with flight crime on Childers Street, about a mile and a half from the Saturday accident.
The Metropolitan Police said agents were trying to identify the man and his nearest family.
The road is closed in several places, buses are redirected and automobile drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Sixcipiers injured in disorder of order
Six disciples were injured in a breach of order in a heavily secured prison for men, according to the prison office.
The riots broke out on Sunday at about 9.30 a.m. local time in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and are still in progress.
Specialized ‘Tornado’-cipiers are used to resolve situations where eight prisoners are involved in one section.
The capers were treated there for slight injuries in the face.
A prisoner spokesperson said: “There have been specially trained prison personnel employed for a recent incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and those responsible are at least referred to the police and may have to stay behind bars longer.'
In HMP Long Lartin, more than 500 prisoners remain, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that after being attacked by a prisoner, the director of the prison was treated at the hospital.
And in October last year, the riot police were called to prison for a serious disturbance of order, with personnel being attacked with billiards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden floods (with potentially positive effects for drought areas)
It is rare for tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that is exactly what will happen at the beginning of next week. This is because the remaining energy from hurricane Rosa is moving across the southwest of the desert area, which brings risks for flooding.
For Monday and Tuesday, the National Weather Service has already issued warnings for sudden floods for the west from Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, and the southeast of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to hang right over Phoenix on Tuesday, and it'll be raining already on Monday evening.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that ‘since 1950 only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or depression in the area of 200 miles from Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.'
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimetres of precipitation, with isolated quantities up to 15 centimetres in Arizona's Mogollon Rim.
Other parts of the southwest of the desert area, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, will probably get 3 to 5 cm rain, and here and there is 10 cm possible.
For areas not at risk of flooding, Rosa rain can be a blessing, as drought affects the region.
Although floods are very worrying, part of this rainfall is likely to be favorable, as the southwest is currently experiencing a drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, the map on which current droughts are indicated, slightly more than 40% of Arizona endures at least extreme drought, the next highest category,' reported weather.com.
Rosa's route reaches the mainland via the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa is still on hurricane strength on Sunday morning at a maximum wind speed of 140 km per hour, 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moves north at a speed of 20 km per hour.
The storm hits cooler waters in the Pacific, weakening them.
That is why it is expected to arrive Monday afternoon or evening with the power of a tropical storm in Mexico.
Heavy rains may fall in parts of Mexico, resulting in a significant flood risk.
‘Respiration of 8 to 15 cm total is expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with up to 25 cm possible,’ reportedweather.com.
Rosa moves northward across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the border with Arizona on Tuesday mornings as a tropical depression, which will then take place Tuesday night through Arizona and south of Utah.
‘The greatest danger expected of Rosa or her tail is very severe rainfall in Baja California, the northwest of Sonora, and the southwest of the desert area,’ said the National Hurricane Center.
This rain is expected to lead to life-threatening sudden floods and debris in the deserts and landslides on mountainous terrain.
Attack in Midsome Norton: four arrests on suspicion of attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was wounded on Saturday at about 4 o'clock local time in the Excelsior Terrace district in Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition is ‘stable’.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested at night in the Radstock area, according to Avon and Somerset police.
The police ask anyone who might have filmed something of what happened to report.
Trump says Kavanaugh 'had been under the community, the anger' of the Democratic Party
'A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party,' said Trump during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that during his appointment procedure Kavanaugh was constantly 'under the community, the anger' of the Democratic Party
On Thursday, Kavanaugh witnessed to Congress, and he strongly and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford's suggestion that he had sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also witnessed her suggestion during the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that the ‘American people saw ‘the beautiful and incredible character, the quality and the courage’ of Kavanaugh that day.
‘A voice to recognize Judge Kavanaugh is a voice with which one of the most complete legal opinions of our time is recognized, a lawyer with an excellent state of service,' he told the crowd of advocates in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the appointment of Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of the Republican rise in the interim elections.
‘One of the most important elections in our lives takes place over five weeks.
I'm not taking part, but actually I'm taking part,' he said.
‘That’s why I come up with great candidates everywhere.’
Trump explained that the Democrats are on a mission to 'offer resistance and hinder us'.
The first important procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh is expected to take place no later than Friday, a top employee of the GOP leadership told CNN.
Hundreds kill by Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, and the toll is increasing
In a large earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 384 people were killed, many of whom were swept away from the ground when gigantic waves crashed on the beach, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Friday for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu, when waves of at least six meters high struck on land at the time it began to shimmer. Many people were falling and the waves were destroying everything on their path.
The tsunami was the result of an earthquake with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
‘When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, there were still people on the beach. They did not walk away immediately and thus became the victim of the tsunami,’ said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the Indonesian agency for help in natural disasters BNPB during a briefing in Jakarta.
'The tsunami also led to other dangers: he dragged cars, tree trunks, houses, he hit everything on the land,' said Nugroho, who added that the tsunami had traveled at a speed of 800 km/h across the open sea before reaching the coastline.
Some people climbed a tree to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
On aerial photographs released by the agency for help in natural disasters, it is evident that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges have been distorted and collapsed and a mosque has been surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal town remained rocked by aftershocks.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) stated in a statement that the energy released during the massive earthquake of Friday was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb that had fallen on Hiroshima during World War II.
It is possible that the geography of the city, which is at the end of a long, narrow bay, has increased the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as ‘significant’ and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
Some fatal victims were trapped under the debris of collapsed buildings, he said, about 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and damage could be even greater along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter.
The communication with Donggala ‘is completely flat, we have no information at all’, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people,’ said the Red Cross in a statement. The Red Cross staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
‘This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse,’ said the Red Cross.
The organization received much criticism on Saturday because she had not said that a tsunami had hit Palu, although employees said the waves had reached the country within the time the warning had been given.
In amateur images shared on social media, a man on the upper floor of a building is panicking at people on the street shouting down to warn them that a tsunami is coming.
Minutes later, a wall of water falls on the coast and buildings and cars are swept along.
Reuters could not verify the images immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power failure that cut off communication around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army is currently sending cargo aircraft with relief equipment from Jakarta and other cities, said authorities, but the evacuees still need food and other basic needs.
The city's airport is only reopened for assistance and remains closed to the public until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
Tsunami death toll rises above 800.
It's very bad.
While the employees of the World Vision from Donggala have arrived safely in the city of Palu, where employees in the courtyard of their office are looking for shelter in tents of deck row, but pass by on the way to tarnishing, Doseba said.
‘They told me that they saw many homes that were destroyed,’ he said.
It's very bad.
Even when relief groups began the difficult task of launching emergency aid, some complained that certain foreign aid providers with a great expertise could not travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, goods and personnel from abroad can only be authorised if the location of a disaster is declared as a national natural disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
‘It is still a disaster at the provincial level,’ said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
‘As soon as the government says, ‘O.K., this is a national disaster’, we can provide international assistance, but that status has still not been proclaimed.’
When the second night after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday fell on Palu, friends and family of the missing people kept hoping they would find their loved ones alive, as in the miracles that people like to hear from terrible natural disasters like this one.
On Saturday a little boy was taken out of a sewer.
On Sunday, relief workers released a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days with her mother's corpse next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which had taken place earlier this month in Indonesia.
His students were also stuck at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi.
‘As a veteran in the paragliding world, I carry my own emotional load,’ he said.
Mr. Gendon told us that the news that the Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed had spread into the paragliding community and that in the hours thereafter he had desperately sent WhatsApp reports to the athletes in Palu, who participated in the beach festival.
However, in his messages only one grey fink appeared instead of two blue finks.
‘I think that means that the messages have not been delivered,’ he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 while supplying cash machine in Newport on the Levee
Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was filling a cash machine in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport police.
The driver had just laid a cash machine in the entertainment complex and wanted to fill it with money, said Inspector Dennis McCarthy in the message.
While he was working, another man ran from behind Brink's coworker and stole a bag of money ready to deliver.
Witnesses saw several suspicious flights, according to the press release, but the police did not say how many people were involved in the incident.
Those who have information about the identity of the perpetrators are invited to contact Newport's police at number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes its name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
Last Saturday he announced the change on Twitter with the words: ‘The creature formally known as Kanye West’.
The 41-year-old West has been called Ye for a while and used this nickname as a title for his eighth album, which came out in June.
The name change was announced in the run-up to his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to introduce his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singers Ariana Grande, who cancelled her performance during the show for ‘emotional reasons’, says the maker of the show.
Ye is not only an abbreviation of his current artist's name. Earlier West told him that the word has a religious meaning for him.
I think that ‘ye’ is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’, said West earlier this year, when he told about the title of his album at radio presenter Big Boy.
‘So I am you, I am us, we are.
I moved from Kanye, which means ‘the only one’, to just Ye, a reflection of the good in us, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is rather a reflection of who we are.\"
He's not the only famous rapper changing his name.
Sean Combs was formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who previously worked with West, has already worked with and without the link sign and the capital letters.
Mexican President promises not to use forces against civilians
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, Mexico's elected president, has promised never to use military power against civilians, and the country stands on the eve of the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday on Tlatelolco Plaza that he would “never use military violence to suppress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, military troops fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people, during which period left-wing student movements occurred throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities.
He said that young people often become members of criminal gangs due to unemployment and lack of opportunities to study.
United States must double the funding of A.I.
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States must double the amount spent investigating A.I., says investor and A.I. specialist Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for all Google, Microsoft and Apple.
He says this in response to the announcements about A.I. coming from various departments of the U.S. government, despite the fact that the US does not have a formal strategy for A.I.
In the meantime, China announced its plan last year: by 2030, the country wants to be number 1 in the field of A.I. innovations.
‘The budget for research into A.I. would already be a good start, given the fact that all other countries are so far behind the US, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in A.I.,’ said Lee.
A doubling of funding could lead to a doubling of the chance of the next major achievement for A.I. in the US, said Lee this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book ‘AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order' was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Synovation Ventures, who has invested in Face++, one of China's most important A.I. companies.
In the 1980s he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an A.I. system that defeated the best player in American Othello, and later was manager at Microsoft Research and President of the Chinese department of Google.
Lee expressed his appreciation for technology competitions organised by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and early when the next race would take place, as it would help to discover the next visionaries.
In the US, researchers often have to work hard to get government subsidies, said Lee.
‘China doesn’t take our best academics, the companies do,’ said Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have acquired the best powers of universities to work on A.I.
Lee said that American efforts in the A.I. would also benefit from a change in immigration policy.
‘He who is doctoring in the A.I. area should automatically be offered a green card,' he said.
The Chinese National Council issued its development plan for the next generation's artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The Chinese Foundation for Natural Sciences gives financial support to academic institutions' staff, just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations give money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, designed to involve partners from industry and the academic world in the initiative, and announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence (Restricted Committee on Artificial Intelligence).
And this month, DARPA announced that $2 billion would be invested in the AI Next Initiative.
The NSF is currently investing over $100 million in research into A.I.
However, the US legislation that should lead to the establishment of a National Security Committee on Artificial Intelligence has been in the loop for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on possible change of name of their country
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people voted in a referendum on the possible change of their country's name to ‘Nor-Macedonia’, which would resolve a dispute with Greece that has been drawing on decades ago and would no longer hinder Greece's Macedonian application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province also known as Macedonia, and it says that the name of its northern neighborhood means that the country is claiming Greek territory, and therefore Greece opposed its veto against the inclusion of Macedonia in the European Union and NATO.
The two authorities concluded an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalists believe that the change of name would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he will not vote in the referendum and through a boycott campaign it is not certain that the required rise of at least 50% will be achieved, so the referendum may not be valid.
The voter's question is as follows: 'Are you in favour of NATO's membership and the EU accepting the agreement with Greece?'
‘Proponents of change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, find that the price to be paid is worth trying to become a member of agencies like the EU and NATO. Macedonia is one of the countries that arose when the former Yugoslavia broke apart.
‘I am voting today for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because that will lead to a safer life for all of us, said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, sufficient Members have indicated that they will respect the outcome, which will determine it.
The amendment of the name would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The National Election Committee said that there had not been any reports of irregularities at 13 o'clock.
However, the rise was only 16 percent at the time, compared to 34% in the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters came to vote.
‘I come to vote because it’s important for my children. Our place is in Europe, said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voters in the capital Skopje.
Premier Zoran Zaev of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018, during the referendum on the change of name of the country that would open the way for membership of NATO and the European Union.
Before Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov set up a small stage and placed chairs for tents that were placed by people who were boycotting the referendum.
‘We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to participate as a full member, not through a back door, said Kavadarkov.
‘We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of European-Asian integration.'
Premier Zaev says that NATO's membership will generate much-needed investment for Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20%.
'I am convinced that the vast majority is more in favour of it because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,' said Zaev after delivering his vote.
He said that a ‘yes’ as a result would be ‘a confirmation of our future’.
An opinion poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research revealed that between 30 and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, less than the required rise.
Another poll conducted by hot Macedonian TV station Telma TV concluded that 57% of respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% would vote yes.
If the referendum is to be successful, the rise must be 50% plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it came into power in May last year.
Look at: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes full defense of Brighton and score
Last Saturday, Sergio Aguero and Raheim Sterling made short measurements with Brighton's defense at Etihad Stadium in the English Manchester. Manchester City won the 2-0 match.
It looked like a penny whistle, how Aguero scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentine peak was first played in the middle field.
He raced between three Brighton defenders, right in the open field.
There, Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He managed to pass a defender and was also too quick for some others on the brink of Brighton's criminal court.
Then he gave a pass to the left, where Sterling waited.
The English attacker used his first action in the criminal area to return the ball to Aguero, who used his judge's shoe to defeat goal man Mathew Ryan with a shot in the right side of the net.
‘Aguero has trouble with his feet,' coach Pep Guardiola of Manchester City told the press.
‘We decided to let him play 55 to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky he was scoring a goal at the time.\"
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the first advantage in the Premier League.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball when he was standing deep in Brighton's playing field.
He sent a beautiful pass along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane held the ball for a while and then sent Sterling to the second pole.
The Sky Blues player typed the ball just before it was too far.
City takes place on Tuesday at 12.55 p.m. against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group phase. The race takes place in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in the German Sinsheim.
Scherzer wants to play along and it doesn't make the Rockies easy to reach the play-off
Now that the Washington Nationals have been eliminated for the playoff, there was little reason to force a new start.
However, the always competitive Scherzer hopes to play Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still consequences for the Rockies' participation in the playoff. They currently compete on the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have at least won a game card for the playoff thanks to their 5-2 victory against the Nationals last Friday, but they still want to do everything they can to secure their first section title.
‘Although there is nothing left for us, we can at least prick with the knowledge that the atmosphere here in Denver will be optimal with this audience and the other team will probably play at the highest level that I would encounter this year.
Why wouldn't I want to play with that?\"
The Nationals still have to announce who will be on Sunday, but are supposedly inclined to set up Scherzer as a pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, was in the injection field on Thursday and would still pitch next Sunday, although this is normally his rest day.
The right hand thrower of Washington is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strike-outs in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump organizes meeting in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court, while talking about the importance of the Republican rise in the interim elections.
‘All we have already accomplished is at stake in November.
One of the most important elections in our lives takes place in five weeks.
This is one of the really big elections. I am not taking part, but actually I am taking part. That's why I come up with great candidates everywhere,\" he said.
Trump continued: ‘We see a terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, we see it happening now.
And they are determined to take power back, whatever they have to do for it.
It doesn't matter who they hurt, who they have to push away to gain power and control. That's what they want: power and control, but we won't give them that.'
The Democrats, he said, are on a mission to 'offer resistance and hinder us'.
‘And we've seen that in the last four days,' he said, calling the Democrats ‘boss and mean and false and lying.'
He named the name of the Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who sits in the Senate Committee on Justice, which led to loud appeals from the public.
‘Do you know what she answered?
Have you leaked the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh, no, I'm waiting for one... that was really a bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen.\"
Labour is no longer a broad church.
The party is intolerant to people who say what they think
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, that was no surprise.
After all, I am the latest in a whole series of Labour parlement members who have been told that we are not welcome just because we say what we think.
My colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she was resolutely opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was punished with the censorship motion because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
Of the importance of a responsible economic policy, of national security, of Europe, ironically enough such issues as those where Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated: “We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
And that was also the case during most GC meetings on Friday evenings during the eight years that I am already a local Labour Parliament member.
Unfortunately, today it is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a ‘more gentle, softer' policy has long been forgotten, if it had ever begun.
It becomes increasingly clear that a disparate opinion is not tolerated in the Labour Party and every opinion is assessed on whether or not it is acceptable to the Party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader. Colleagues who, as far as I knew, had a political view similar to mine, suddenly expected me to reverse and take a position that I would never have agreed to, from subjects such as national security to the European single market.
Every time I speak to a public, whatever I say, there are differences in social media that call for the rejection of my candidacy as a member of parliament for the next elections, where the politics of the centre is exposed and I am told that I should not be a member of Labour.
And that's just what I'm going through.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments to my address are generally political.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who have daily to deal with a flood of sexist or racist reactions, but do not let themselves be intimidated.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this period of politics is that there appears to be a normal view of different parties.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer those broad churches and with any ‘motion of distrust' or change of selection rules, the party becomes more petty.
For the past two years, I have often received advice to hold back, not just loudly proclaim my opinion and then I would ‘not get into trouble’.
But I didn't go into politics for that.
Since I became a school child of Labour 32 years ago, provoked by the neglect of the government of Thatcher, which literally caused my classroom to collapse, I have always advocated better public services for those they need most, both in my role as a councillor and in my role as minister.
I have never kept my politics hidden, nor in the last elections.
Everyone in Nottingham East had clarity about my policies and my disputes with current leadership.
To those who have promoted the motion on Friday, I can say one thing: when the country moves on to a Brexit that will harm families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But actually I have only one message, and it is not addressed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether they are members of Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that threats to reject my candidateship as a member of parliament for the next elections or political opportunities will not prevent me from acting according to what I believe is in your interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeaten Ayr on the way to the top
Two late try's may have pulled the end result slightly, but there is no doubt that Ayr is right in triumphing in this wonderful competition of the day in the Tennent's Premiership.
They are now at the top of the classification, the only unbeaten team of the ten.
In the end, both their superior defense and their better chances of the home team winning were satisfied, and coach Peter Murchie was allowed to be pleased.
“We’ve had a hard time in our games so far and we’re still unbeaten, so I’m a happy man,” he said.
Robyn Christie van Melrose: ‘All honor to Ayr, they have made better use of their opportunities than we do.’
Grant Anderson's try in the 14th minute, completed by Frazier Climo, led to an advance for Ayr, but by a yellow map of Rory Hughes from the Scottish national team (which he got during the Warriors contest) Melrose was able to speak the numbers and Jason Baggot managed to break a try.
Climo provided a penalty with an extra advance for Ayr and scored a conversion after a solotry just for the rest. Thus it became 17-5 for Ayr after the first half.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's try, followed by a conversion of Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
The match was long silent for a serious injury by Ruaridh Knott, who was run on a bran card, and once the race was restarted, Ayr was able to continue running through a try by Stafford McDowall followed by a conversion of Climo.
Then Ayr's commander Blair Macpherson got a yellow card, and again Melrose reckoned with the extra man when no conversion followed a try by Bruce Colvine at the end of a game where the pressure was very high.
However, the home team returned, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card because he tapped Climo without the ball, MacPherson took care of the rising Ayr-maul for a touch-down on the penalty-line-out.
Climo took care of the conversion, and did so almost immediately after the restart again, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's box and sent halfback Gregor Henry away for the fifth try of the home team.
Star of Still Game is ready for new career in the restaurant world
Actor Ford Kieran from Still Game looks like he's going into the corner. Apparently he's appointed director of a restaurant business.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and in which he himself acts with his comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the last in the series, and it seems that Kiernan's life after Craiglang is already planning.
According to official information, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the story, but a source from the Scottish Sun caused Kiernan to search for a way to participate in the ‘blowing restaurant business’ in Glasgow.
'The sea is ours': the country enclosed Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific Ocean
Marine patrolling in La Paz.
Public buildings are waving an ocean blue flag.
On all marine bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the motto is: ‘The sea is ours.
It's a duty to win them back.\"
All over Bolivia, the memory of the coastline that the country has had to face after a bloody 19th-century commodity conflict with Chile is still alive, just like the desire to re-enter the Pacific.
That hope may have reached its highest point in recent decades, since Bolivia is awaiting a judgment of the International Court of Justice, which should be held on 1 October after five years of deliberation.
‘Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and naturally looks forward to the result with positive prospects,’ said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians across the country will look at the Court's ruling on large screens, hoping that the Tribunal in The Hague will plead for Bolivia's benefit that after decades of petty talks, Chile is obliged to give Bolivia sovereign access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic native president, who stands for a controversial campaign for re-election next year, is also much at stake with the decision of Monday.
‘We are very close to returning to the Pacific,’ he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will probably not decide for Bolivia, and even if so, little would change.
The UN body established in the Netherlands does not have the power to grant the Chilean territory and has indicated that it will not determine the outcome of any possible discussions.
Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law, says that the decision of the International Court of Justice falls only six months after the final decision.
And the prospects for a positive result from Bolivia have certainly not improved, on the contrary, the situation may have become even worse over the last four years.
‘The case around access to the sea has been capped by the current Bolivian government,' said Zárate.
The warlike rhetoric of Morales has all the good will that Chile might have completely undermined, she claimed.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their discussions at a certain time, but it will be extremely difficult to continue the discussions.
The two countries have not had their ambassadors in each other since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representing Bolivia in The Hague, denies that the court's decision was taken unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia “will have an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of international relations with Chile” and an opportunity to “end 139 years of disagreement, with mutual advantages,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, is using the maritime issue as a political cross.
‘Bolivia will never give up his right to access the Pacific,’ he added.
‘The verdict is an opportunity to see that we have to leave the past behind.'
North Korea says nuclear disarmament is only possible if it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never remove its nuclear weapons if Washington cannot trust it.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to live up to the promises made at a summit between the leaders of the rivals in Singapore.
He said this at the time that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be about to restart the nuclear diplomacy in progress, more than three months after the summit in Singapore with Kim Jong Un from North Korea.
Ri says it is an 'utopia' that the lasting sanctions and the American objection to a declaration ending the Korean war will ever get North Korea on its knees.
Washington is not inclined to agree with the statement without Pyongyang taking important steps in the field of disarmament first.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But scepticism prevails and it is doubted that Pyongyang is serious when he says that he would refrain from an arsenal that the country probably sees as his only way to guarantee his safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest collection of huge head coverings, soon to be purchased from you nearby
If you want to expand your hat collection or keep the sun completely out of your eyes, do not search further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed a series of crazy oversized head coverings for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, a striking move during the Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats were not to think away from Instagram this summer and these designers have sent their eye-blinding creations the catwalk.
The striking piece of Valentino was a gigantic beige hat decorated with a forty-eight wide edge that hung across the eyes of the models.
Other oversized accessories were watermelons occupied with gemstones, a magic hat and even a pineapple, but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
In many of the colourful masks, the lips were closed. They looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation looked like diving equipment, complete with snorkel and glasses, while another looked like a molten ice cream.
And if you want to follow this daring fashion, you're lucky.
Stylishwatchers predict that the huge hats will find their way to the clothing stores near you.
The giant hats may have been inspired by 'La Bomba', the straw hat with a two metre wide edge that everyone wears, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the highly impractical hat that appeared everywhere on social media also provided another great creation on the catwalk: a straw beach bag that was almost as big as the model in bathing suit that the bag was silting with.
The red orange raffia bag, set with raffia fringes and finished with a white leather hinge, was the most striking piece in the La Riviera SS19 collection of Jacquemus during Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I expect to see big hats and beachbags in the shops next summer. Since the designer has made such a huge impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for extra large accessories.'
John Edward: Languages skills essential for world citizens
The independent schools in Scotland have an excellent state of service in the field of academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with a series of excellent exam results, as well as individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other initiatives of the whole community.
With over 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the best service to their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen career and their place as world citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a customised school curriculum, we see modern languages remain popular and desirable subjects within schools.
Nelson Mandela said: ‘When you talk to someone in a language he understands, you reach his head.
When you talk to him in his own language, you reach his heart.\"
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the recent exam results of this year we can deduce that languages are on top of the ranking, with the highest success rates in independent schools.
In total, 68% of students who studied foreign languages scored a high score.
The data, collected from 74 schools affiliated with SCIS, shows that 72% of students received a high score (‘A’) in Mandarin, while 72% of students received a German, 69% of students in French, and 63% of students in Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now valued as much as STEM subjects (science, technology, technology and mathematics) in independent school programs and elsewhere.
A study by the UK Employment and Skill Commission in 2014 revealed that 17% of the obstacles to filling jobs were attributed to a lack of language skills, according to employers.
Language skills are thus becoming increasingly important to prepare young people for their future career.
Now that more and more jobs require language skills, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career one chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future with such skill for life.
Communicating directly with people from abroad automatically gives a multilingual person an advantage over competition.
According to a YouGov poll of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75% were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to engage in a conversation. French was the only language that exceeded 10%, with a total of 15%.
This is why investing in language education is now important for today's children.
Several languages, particularly those of emerging economies, will offer children a better chance of finding a meaningful job.
In Scotland schools choose which languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while other schools will teach languages most important to the United Kingdom when they look ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest is, there will always be different languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers specializing in this area.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills needed to succeed, regardless of the future.
It cannot at present be denied that languages in a global business environment remain vitally important for the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
Modern languages must actually be regarded as 'international communication skills'.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron makes Sunday his debut at the Lakers in San Diego
Fans waiting for LeBron James' first match at the Los Angeles Lakers, waiting is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play Sunday in the opening race before the season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he will play is still to be determined.
‘There will be more than one, and less than 48,’ said Walton on the official Lakers website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said in a tweet that James will probably play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers schedule for the six races prior to the season.
‘At this stage of my career, I don't need any competitions before the season to prepare me,' he said.
Trump election rally period in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts this evening in Wheeling, West Virginia, on a long series of election rallyes
It's the first of five planned rallies of Trump in the coming week, including stops in places that he's been ignored, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote on the appointment of the candidate for the vacancy in the Supreme Court has been held, Trump wants to build support for the upcoming interim elections, because the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress when voting in November.
What time does Trump's rally start tonight in West Virginia and how do you look online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, launched tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018, at 19 h.
You can view Trumps rally in West Virginia online via the livestream on YouTube.
Trump will probably be talking about the hearings for this week's Chief Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who were charged with sexual misconduct now that Kavanaugh is being accused and the Senate may be waiting a week to vote on his appointment while the FBI is investigating the case.
But the main objective of this series of rallys is to help the Republicans who are candidates for the November elections to get more elan.
President Trump's campaign leadership said that these five rallies are intended to ‘encourage volunteers and supporters, while the Republicans are trying to protect and extend the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives,' says Reuters.
‘Control over Congress is so important for its program that the President is traveling to as many states as possible now the busy campaign season begins,' said a spokesman for the Trump campaign who did not want to be mentioned by name against Reuters.
The rally tonight at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be discussed in the Pittsburgh media, said West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday the second time last month Trump visited West Virginia, the state he won in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the Senate of West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is left behind.
‘It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to give him a boost in the polls,’ said Simon Haeder, a politician at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA is willing to fight to keep hope alive in the run-up to Sunday singles
After three one-sided sessions the foursomes of Saturday afternoon may have been just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The shimmering sling of opportunities is a fully invented sport concept, but one that players really believe in, and especially in competitions like this one.
So who is currently getting the best chances?
‘They first had a six-point lead, and now that’s only four more, so we find so much that happiness is currently on our side,’ said Jordan Spieth before he left at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage of standing for four points while there are still twelve in the game.
The Americans, as Spieth said, find that they have a little wind in their sails, and there are many things that give courage, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long and each scored three points of the four.
Spieth has been a fearful opposer from tea to green and he gives the good example.
The typical throat sounds he makes when he plays well became louder as his round progressed and he achieved a crucial pit with four winnings when he and Thomas got two points behind after two races.
His well with which they won the race on 15, was followed by a similar scream, the kind from which you can deduce that he believes the American team has not yet been defeated.
‘You have to dig deep and just worry about your own game,’ said Spieth.
That's all these players can do right now.
18 holes to print your stamp.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of the Ryder Cup.
This remarkable but wonderful European duo has four in four and can do nothing wrong.
‘Moliwood' was the only duo that did not play bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the back nine on Friday morning they avoided bogey's.
As a result of this series, and the way they seem to exchange energy with their noisy audience, they are the players who have to be beaten Sunday. If Fleetwood or Molinari wins, he will be the most popular player ever to book a European victory when the sun goes down over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time with different holes.
However, it is premature to speak of a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short measurements with Sergio Garcia, the fourball hero of that morning, when he formed a duo with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front knee led to a backsliding for the Spanish and the Swedish that they no longer came across.
Sunday, however, there is no one who can help you get in your back.
The four-balls and foursomes are so fascinating to see through the interactions between the duos, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and the way a strategy can change in an eyebrow.
The European team has played its best so far and has a fine lead in the run-up of the last day, but this foursome session has also shown that Team USA is willing to engage in the fight, something that some, especially in the US, have challenged.
Europe takes the lead with 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe begins with a beautiful lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup. After the four-balls and foursomes of Saturday they are represented by 10-6 in the United States.
The coveted duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led their team with two victories more than Tiger Woods, who had difficulty, thus leading them four points in Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who wanted to lose the trophy she had lost in Hazeltine two years ago, was stronger than the blundering Americans in the morning four-balls, with a score of 3-1.
The US offered more resistance in the foursomes, where it won two races, but could no longer catch up with its backlash.
Jim Furyk's team has to score eight points during the 12 singles competitions of Sunday in order to preserve the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in line, while he and Molinari, who were nicknamed ‘Moliwood’ after a sensational weekend, are only the second duo in the history of the Ryder Cup winning four points in their four opening races.
After setting up Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-balls, they were beautifully played together and defeated a disappointing Woods and American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau with a powerful 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two races on Saturday, occasionally showed a magnificent move, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in four-balls and foursomes and seven in line.
Justin Rose, equipped for the morning four-balls, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and together they defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the number one and three of the world, with 2&1.
Nevertheless, it was not a lease for Europe on this pleasant day with a breeze to the southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who won the Major three times, and Justin Thomas set the standard for the Americans on Saturday with three points.
After a tough match with 2&1 from the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls, they later defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4&3 in the foursomes, after losing the first four holes.
It has only happened twice before in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team has been able to catch up with four points at the beginning of the singles, although the Furyk team has enough of the same game, since they currently have the trophy in their hands.
But now that they've been in second place for two days, a counterattack on Sunday seems too high.
North Korea says it will “in no case” unilaterally disarm without confidence
On Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea told the United Nations that the continued sanctions lead to more and more distrust in the United States and that under such circumstances the country could in no way give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN Annual General Assembly that in the last year North Korea had taken ‘significant goodwill measures’, such as stopping nuclear and rocket testing, dismantling the nuclear testing site and the promise not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“We don’t see any corresponding reaction from the US, however,” he said.
‘Without any confidence in the US there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances we will in no way disarm ourselves unilaterally.’
Although Ri repeated the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a ‘fascinated' approach to denuclearisation, where North Korea would be rewarded as further steps were taken, he did not a priori reject unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang used to do.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump during the first summit between an active U.S. president and a North Korean leader on 12 June in Singapore, when Kim promised to work towards the ‘denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula’, while Trump promised guarantees for the safety of North Korea.
North Korea is striving for a formal end to the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to reconcile the harsh international sanctions against North Korea.
“The US urges ‘denuclearisation first’ and increases the pressure by sanctions to achieve their goal in a compelling way and even by objecting to the ‘explanation of the end of war,’ said Ri.
‘The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an air castle of people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that the constant sanctions only reinforce our distrust.\"
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, something that the American leader had raised earlier in the week at the United Nations.
Instead, the Minister stressed three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: ‘If the other party were with this issue of denuclearisation South Korea and not the US, the denucleation of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such an impasse.’
Yet the tone of Ri's speech was considerably different from last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korean missiles on the American continent would be directed after Mr Evil President Trump Kim called a 'racetman' on a suicide mission.
Trump, who threatened to completely destroy North Korea last year, praised Kim this year to the United Nations for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said that much still needs to be done and that sanctions must continue until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no timetable for this: ‘Whether it takes two years, three years or five months, that doesn’t matter.’
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The enforcement of the sanctions of the Security Council must be enforced vigorously and firmly until we have realized the full, final, verified denucleation.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has carried out unanimous sanctions against North Korea to significantly reduce funding for Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic missiles programmes.
Pompeo met Ri outside the UN General Assembly and said he would go back to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
A few hours after he left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made, North Korea bemoaned him from setting \"godlike demands\".
North Korea promised this month, at a meeting with Moon, to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States were to take \"compliant measures\".
He said that Kim had told him that the ‘agreementary measures’ he wanted were security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore, and steps towards normalising relations with Washington.
Students from Harvard follow the course on the importance of sufficient rest
A new course at Harvard University this year ensures that all students get more sleep, in an attempt to combat the growing macho culture in which it seems cool to study all night and drink a lot of caffeine.
A professor found that the students of the world's largest university often have no idea of the basic principles to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, Professor of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School, a specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, set up the course. As far as he knows this is unique in the US.
He got the idea of starting the course after giving a talk about the influence of sleep loss on learning.
'At the end of my speech, a girl came to me saying, 'Why do I just hear this now, in my last year?'
She said no one ever told her how important sleep is, which surprised me,\" he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is organised for the first time this year, explains to the students the basic principles of how good sleep habits help improve academic and athletic performance and how they also promote their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, the university decided to organize the course when it was found that students had a serious sleep deficit during the week.
The course lasts for one hour and includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one of the parts, the students see a picture of a dormitory, where they click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise equipment and books to learn more about the effects of caffeine and light and how sports performance is affected by sleep shortages, and the importance of a routine when going to bed.
In another part, participants will hear how long - term sleep shortage increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Using a campus background, with interactive icons, participants are encouraged to think about their daily routine.
‘We know that we will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we think they have the right to know all of this, just as people have the right to know what effects the choice of cigarettes has on their health, Czeisler added.
The culture of fairness on a night-to-night study still exists, he says, and due to modern technology and the increasing pressure on students, sleep shortage is an ever-increasing problem.
Provide enough sleep, of good quality, must be the student's ‘secret weapon' to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said, and even to avoid weight gain, because sleep shortage causes them to feel constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from Calfornia who is studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to prepare the course, after which he attended a course with the professor when he studied at Harvard in his first year.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to make sure that the course was available to everyone on campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all students to follow a similar study program before they come to the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler advises students to set an alarm for their bedtime, not only an alarm to stand up. They also need to be aware of the harmful effects of the ‘blue light’ of electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt your circadian rhythm, making it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal is to undermine Gerrard's men
The Rangers saw their competition again disappointing as Dolly Menga scored and the weak team of Steven Gerrard defeated with 1-0 in Livingston.
Ibrox's team hoped for a first victory in a competition since they defeated St Johnstone with 4-1 in February, but Gary Holt's team took care of the defeat, almost the second of Gerrard as manager in 18 races. His team is now eight points behind Hearts, which continue to run at the top of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored seven minutes for the rest, and the Rangers failed to score the equalizer.
The Rangers now descend to the sixth place, Livingston rises to the third, with only a difference in number of goal compared to Hibernian.
And the Rangers could get even more problems, since border judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after apparently an object was thrown to him by the supporters of the visitor team.
Gerrard made eight changes in his team. They crossed Ayr and went to the half finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt stayed at the same eleventh for Livingston, who knew how to cut off the Hearts last week. He would have been excited about how his well-trained team managed to block the opponents at every move.
The Rangers may have had the most ball, but Livingston did more with it.
They had to score after two minutes, when Menga first fired the ball and Scott Pittman had the goal of Allan McGregor in the vizier, but the middle fielder couldn't finish it.
A deep free trap of Keaghan Jacobs reached Commander Craig Halkett, but his fellow defender Alan Lithgow kicked against the rear pole.
The Rangers managed to take control, but they seemed to hope for a good outcome rather than really believing in it if they could approach the goal.
Alfredo Morelos found in any event that he was entitled to a criminal punishment when he and Steven Lawless clashed after a quarter of an hour, but referee Steven Thomson removed the request from the Colombian.
The Rangers were only able to shoot at the target twice in the first half, but Liam Kelly, who used to be a target of the Ibrox, was able to stop the headball of Lassana Coulibaly and the tame shot of Ovie Ejaria with ease.
Livingston's opener in the 34th minute may or may not be in the extension of the general game course, no one can deny that they deserved this, even if it was just for their hard work.
Again, the Rangers were not aware of Jacobs' deep game pattern.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained cold-blooded and chose Menga, who easily stepped the ball into the target.
Gerrard caused an interruption with the Coulibaly/Ryan Kent. This had almost immediate consequences when the wing player Morelos passed, but an impressive Kelly raced off his line to stop the ball.
But Livingston continued to force the visitors to play a kind of game that Livingston liked to play, while Lithgow and Halkett continued to kick long balls.
Holt's team could have increased its lead in the final stage of the match, but McGregor stood up and blocked Jacobs, after which Lithgow came out of the corner wide.
Invaller Glenn Middleton of the Rangers asked for a prison after an accident with Jacobs at the end of the game, but Thomson looked the other way again.
Almanak: the inventor of the Geigerteller
And now a page from the almanac of our ‘Sunday Morning': 30 September 1882, today exactly 136 years ago, for who can count well... the day on which the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm ‘Hans' Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called a counter.
Since then, the Geigerteller has not been able to think away from science, and also became an icon in pop culture, for example in ‘Bells or Coronado’, a 1950 film with the unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans at first sight:
Man: ‘What the hell is that?'
Rogers: ‘That’s a counter-teller, used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
If you set up this headphone, you will hear the effect of the atoms released into the minerals by the radioactivity.\"
Evans: ‘It’s really banging now!'
‘Hans' Geiger died in 1945, almost a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name remains relevant.

In the method, immune cells are removed from a patient, after which the cells in the labo are adjusted in such a way that they can ‘see’ the protein HER2, which is common in all types of cancers. Then the cells are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have a highly promising vaccine. ”
HER2 ‘stimulates the growth of different types of cancer', including breast cancer, ovary cancer, lung cancer and intestinal cancer, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar way of removing immune cells from patients and ‘learning’ these cells to tackle cancer cells has already been shown to work in treating a particular type of leukemia.
Kanye West drops off pro-Trump-tirade and wears MAGA-pet after its appearance in Saturday Night Live.
That didn't run as he hoped.
Kanye West was issued during a broadcast of Saturday Night Live after an incompetent performance in which he preached to US President Donald Trump and said that he would become Presidential candidate in 2020.
After bringing his third song of the evening, Ghost Town, with a peek on his head with the text Make America Great Again, he turned off a tirade against the Democrats and repeated that he supported Trump.
‘Many times when I talk to a white person, she asks, ‘How can you be sympathetic to Trump now? He’s a racist!'
If I was worried about racism, I'd been out of America for a long time,' he said.
The broadcast of Saturday Night Live began with a parody in which Hollywood star Matt Damon struck the dragon with the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh in the Senate Committee on Justice in connection with the alleged assault of Christine Blasey Ford.
The tirade of West was not sent out, but comics Chris Rock uploaded them to social media.
It's not clear if Rock wants to stick the dragon with West with his post.
West also complained to the public that he had been taken backstage under fire for his hat.
‘They've been taunting me backstage.
They said, \"Don't step on stage with that hat.\"
They hurt me!
And then they tell me I'm apathetic,\" he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: ‘Do you want to see what apathetic looks like?’ He said he would attract her superman-cape, ‘because that means you can’t command me. Do you want the world to get better?
Give me some love.\"
From the audience, at least twice the call came and the cast members of SNL seemed embarrassed, according to Variety. The magazine was heard by a present: ‘The whole studio was suddenly silent.’
West was the last-minute replacement of singers Ariana Grande, whose ex-friend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with a performance of the song I Love it while he was dressed like Perrier bottle.
West received support from the conservative group of TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: ‘To one of our bravest spirits: BEDANKT THAT YOU TROTSEERT MASSA.’
But talkshow-presenter Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply ‘normally himself, and that's wonderful.'
‘But I do not choose to reward anyone who is damaging, supporting and exploiting my community (by buying music or clothing or supporting his ‘art’).
He's free to do whatever he wants.
We too,' she added.
Before the show began, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name. From now on, he says, ‘the creature formally known as Kanye West’.
He is not the first artist to change his name. He was preceded by Diddy Puff, also known as Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Colleague rapper Snoop Dogg has also named Snoop Lion and the late musical legend Prince once changed his name into a symbol and then into The artist formally known as Prince.
Indictment of attempted murder after stinging in restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed on Friday in a restaurant in east Belfast.

The charge will be examined by the Public Ministry.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington pulls out to toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role of swordfighter Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones of HBO.
But the 31-year-old actor is heading for the macho hero's stereotype and says that young boys often think they have to be tough to gain respect when watching such roles on the screen.
In a conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he found that ‘there was something wrong’ and asked himself how the problem of toxic manhood should be tackled in the age of #MeToo.
Kit, recently married to his co-star of Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, who is also 31, admitted that he is strongly convinced that the problem must be addressed.
'This is a very important question for me personally at the moment: where did it go wrong with our masculinity?' he said.
\"What did we teach men when they grew up, causing us to face this problem now?\"
Kit thinks that television might be partly responsible for the increase of toxic maleness, due to his very male personalities.
He continued: ‘What is born and what has been learned?’
What's being taught on TV and on the streets that makes young boys think they should be a certain kind of man?
I think that is one of today's major questions: how do we change that?
Because something clearly went wrong for young men.\"
In the interview he also admitted that he will not act in prequels of sequences of Games of Thrones when the series ends next summer, because he is ‘complete with battlefields and horses’.
As of November, Kit will play in a revival of True West by Sam Shepard, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a conqueror.
The actor recently revealed that his meeting with his wife Rose is the most beautiful result of Game of Thrones.
\"I met my wife during the series, so that's how I've kept up with my future family and my life from now on,\" he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the great love of Kits character Jon Snow, in the fantasy series that was awarded an Emmy.
The couple is married in June 2018 on the estate of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China reports that the number of Chinese with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
Health authorities say that more than 820,000 people are affected by it in the country.
It was only in the second quarter of 2018 that 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the vast majority of new cases, the diseases were transmitted through sex, which was not the case before.
In the past, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China through transfusions of contaminated blood.
But the number of people who are running out of HIV in this way is now almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, compared to the same period last year, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
The transfer of HIV via sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has no longer been punishable in China since 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be widespread.
According to the country's conservative values, it is estimated that 70 to 90% of men who have sex with men would eventually marry a woman.
Often the diseases are transmitted through insufficient protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication in the context of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staff employee has leaked data from Republican senators and proceeds to ‘dangerous lies' and ‘complot theories'
The U.S. Congressman Maxine Waters goes against the allegations that one of her staff members has placed the personal data of three U.S. Republican senators on the lawmakers' Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles Democrat claims that the allegations are spread by ‘extremely-right’ parties and websites.
‘Faiths, lies and even more mean lies,’ Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published data would include, among other things, the private address and the private telephone number of U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The data appeared online on Thursday. They were posted by an unknown person in Capitol Hill during a hearing of the Senate Committee on the allegations of sexual misconduct at Brett Kavanaugh, candidate judge for the Supreme Court.
The leak came after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
According to conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, the IP address indicating the source of the posts was linked to the office of Waters and contained information from a Waters employee, said the Hill.
\"This unfounded accusation is completely false and a flagrant lie,\" said Waters.
‘My coworker, whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these false accusations, was in no way responsible for leaking this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and a flagrant lie.\"
The declaration of Waters was quickly coming to criticism online, including by former press employee of the White House Ari Fleischer.
‘This denial sounds angry,' said Fleischer.
‘You can see from this that she does not have the temperament to be a Congress member.
If a person is accused of something he has not done, he should not get angry.
He shouldn't rebel.
He must not question the motives of the prosecutor.
He must remain calm and serene.\"
Fleischer appeared to compare the reaction of Waters with the criticism of the Democrats of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of excessive anger during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who wants to take over Waters' place in the mid-term elections, also gave his opinion on Twitter.
‘Heavy, if it is true,’ he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had informed the relevant services and law enforcement agencies of these false accusations.
‘We will make the perpetrators known,’ she said, ‘and they will be held legally liable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to my staff workers.’
Review: Johnny English Strikes Again - weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
In every new film with a British impact, we are now traditionally looking for references to the Brexit, and this appears to apply indeed to this revival of the Johnny English franchise, the comical action films with a sleepy spy in the lead, which started with Johnny English in 2003 and was re-introduced in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is this airy suicide about how bad we are doing the latest export product for our country?
The incompetent Johnny English with rumbling eyes and flexible facial features succeeds in sending everything in the hundred, including his second comeback. From his name you can already deduce that he is a common comic character designed for cinematographers in countries where they speak a language other than English.
He is, of course, the foolish secret agent who, despite his bizarre claim of smooth glamour, has a little Clouseau, Mr Bean's wing and a grunt of that guy who contributed one note to Chariots of Fire's theme number during the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
He is originally based on the traveler and the international mysterious man Atkinson once played in the TV spots of Barclaycard (which everyone has forgotten in the meantime) who always leaves behind a certain chaos.
His latest portrait of Johnny English contains one or two beautiful moments.
I thought it was wonderful how Johnny English approaches a helicopter in his medieval armor and the rotor blades to tap his helmet.
Atkinson is able to show in this film how much talent he has for physical comedy, but the humor is rather weak and crazy enough excessive, especially now that the “serious” film series such as 007 and Mission Impossible self comedies include as ingredient, and do so well.
The humor seems to be intended for children rather than adults, and Johnny English's stupid disaster is less original and focused on me than the jokes without text of the character Bean playing Atkinson.
The constant theme is now that Great Britain is in great trouble.
A cyberhacker has infiltrated the supersecret spy network on the web, making the identity of all active secret agents of Great Britain known, to the great abduction of the agent in function, a unfortunately small role of Kevin Eldon.
That is the drop that makes the bucket overflow from the prime minister, a pretentious woman with problems at her head and terribly unpopular as a policy. Emma Thompson does her utmost with this character that reminds Teresa May, but the script doesn't offer much material to cooperate with.
According to her intelligence advisors, she must employ a retired spy, since each active spy is compromised.
And that means the stunting Johnny English himself, who is now working as a schoolmaster in a chic setting, but is unofficially teaching about undercover work. Here are nice jokes in the story, because the espionage lessons of English are what make school or rock think.
English is quickly banned at Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former sad help Bough, replayed by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, and his wife is captain of a submarine, a turbulent and jovial role under Vicki Pepperdine's level.
The Batman and Robin of the disastrous conditions of Her Majesty's Secret Service are thus back in action and meet Olga Kurylenko's bloodthirsty femin fatal Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is unfortunately in favour of the charms of the charismatic technology billionaire who claims to be able to solve the British computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start at their odyssee of clumsy dolle fun: dressed as waiters, they set fire to a beautiful French restaurant, they kicked her on board the luxury yacht of Volta and English enqueued pure anarchy when he tried to use a Virtual Reality headset to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
For the latter, all registers are opened, but no matter how well-intentioned and stormy the scene is, she does a little bit of thinking about children's television.
It's not all very original.
And just as with Johnny English's other films, I ask myself: can the British film industry really not consider the role that the talent of Rowan Atkinson brings honor to?
Labour denies that the party is planning to have British people work four days a week but being paid for five days
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn would consider a radical plan in which British people work four days a week but get paid for five days.
The party is said to want bases of companies to pass on the savings they do as a result of the revolution of Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) to their employees by giving them an extra day holiday.
For example, employees can enjoy a three-day weekend, but still earn the same amount.
According to sources, the idea is ‘past' in the economic agenda of the party and plans to turn the country's balance sheet towards the workers.
The transition to a four-day working week was already approved by the Association of Trade Unions, which is a good way to ensure that workers can benefit from the changing economy.
A high-level source from the Labour Party said to The Sunday Times: “To expect a policy review will be announced before the end of the year.
‘It will not take place from one moment to another, but a four-day working week is a goal that fits within the party’s objective to make the balance sheet in the economy look more beneficial to workers and that also fits within the overall industrial strategy of the party,
Labour is not the first party to support such an idea, given the fact that the Green Party had already promised a four-day working week in the national election campaign of 2017.
However, the aim is not yet supported by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “A four-day working week is not a party’s policy plan and is not considered by the party,
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour conference last week to clarify his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back the power of the 'faceless drivers' and the 'profits' in utility companies.
The Shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not recover the full value of their share, as a Labour government could apply 'reductions' based on perceived misconduct.
He also confirmed that there are plans to include employees in the management councils of companies and to set up inclusive property funds (Inclusive Ownership Funds) to provide 10% of private sector shares to employees who can earn up to £500 a year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell '60 Minutes' whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh can change their mind
The FBI's investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination for the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question of whether the findings of the FBI could ensure that Republican senators withdraw their support for the candidate.
In an interview broadcasted on Sunday at '60 Minutes', correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could discover something that could cause them to change their mind.
Kennedy seemed to be more open than his South Carolina colleague.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I told the hearing that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the accusation came out, and I asked him, \"Did you do it?\"
He was resolute, determined, indisputable,
However, Graham's voice seems to stand wall-proof.
“My opinion of Brett Kavanaugh is fixed and the accusation should contain dynamite,” he said.
“As for Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett strongly denied it,” added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And no one mentioned by her could verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see any new developments,
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has contributed to reducing poverty?
This Saturday will be held in New York's Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event where a very impressive line-up to stars will take place and which has an equally impressive mission: the end of poverty in the world.
For the seventh time again, tens of thousands of people will come to Central Park for the Global Citizen Festival. Not only to enjoy acts like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes but also to generate awareness for the real goal: ending extreme poverty for 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was first organised in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a group of international stakeholders who hope to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
Concertgoers who wanted to have a free ticket for the event (unless they were willing to pay for a VIP card), had to complete a series of tasks, or 'actions', such as volunteering, e-mailing a world leader, making a telephone call or generating a meaningful awareness for the purpose: an end to poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen Festival been, with another 12 years to reach this goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert an appropriate way to convince people to demand a call for action or is this just another form of 'clickivism', giving people the feeling that they are making a real contribution by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
According to Global Citizens, more than 19 million 'actions' have been recorded by supporters since 2011, focusing on a wide range of different goals.
According to Global Citizen, these actions have contributed to global leaders' commitment and policy proposals worth more than $37 billion to change the lives of 2.25 billion before 2030.
Early in 2018, the Group cited 390 initiatives and declarations based on the actions, at least 10 billion of which have been paid out or brought together by sponsorship actions.
The group estimates that the funds obtained so far have had an impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Among the most important declarations of intent is that of The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and executives from the United Kingdom with the aim of 'helping children realize their full potential'. This group has pledged 35 million dollars to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the help of the British government, donors, other national authorities and global citizens like you can make a footnote to history from the social injustice that is malnutrition,” said Tracey Ullman, ambassador to The Power of Nutrition, the public at a London concert in April 2018.
The group also announced that, after more than 5,000 actions had been sent in which the UK government was asked to improve the food situation for mothers and children, the government announced a project, the Power of Nutrition, that 5 million women and children will achieve with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the Global Citizen website in which the request was made - why do you think that we can put an end to extreme poverty -
The group replied: “It will be a long and difficult road, sometimes falling and falling.
But, like civil rights and the anti-apartheid movements in front of us, we will eventually succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are a few of the artists who will perform this year during the New York event presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States can use the navy to block Russian exports of energy - Minister for Internal Affairs
Washington may take his \"if necessary\" refuge in the Navy to prevent Russian energy from coming to the market, including in the Middle East, said Ryan Zinke, the US Minister for Internal Affairs, as mentioned by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria, where the country acts at the invitation of the statutory government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe they are only in the Middle East to be able to act in energy, as in Eastern Europe and the southern flank of Europe,” he said, according to the report.
And according to the officer, there are ways and means to counter this.
“The United States has that option, with the Navy, to ensure that the shipping routes remain open and, if necessary, to block them in order to ensure that their energy is not on the market,” he said.
At an event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, Zinke spoke for invited persons, a group without a profit mark that affects itself as the 'stem of the energy consumer' in the US.
He continued and compared Washington's approach to Russia with Iran's approach and noted that these did not differ substantially.
“The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less the use and replacement of fuels,” he said and referred to Russia as a country with only a 'art', with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump government is trying to stimulate the export of natural natural gas to Europe and replace Russia, a country which offers far the cheapest option for European consumers.
For this reason, officials of the Trump government, including President Donald Trump himself, try to convince Germany to withdraw from the 'unfit' pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which, according to Trum van Berlin, has made Moscow's 'captain'.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, worth 11 billion dollars, will double the current pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is just an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's strong opposition to the project is only controlled by economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe we agree with the idea that energy should not be used to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers themselves,” said Aleksandr Novak, the Russian Minister for Energy, after a meeting with Rick Perry, the U.S. Minister of Energy, in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position triggered a response from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The Federal Association of German Industry (BDI), the leading industrial organisation in Germany, has called on the US not to interfere with the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third power interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federal Association of German Industry (BDI) after a recent meeting between German chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren 'thinks it seriously' to take part in the presidential elections in 2020, says the Senator for Massachusetts
Elizabeth Warren, the senator from Massachusetts said Saturday that she is \"serious about thinking about it\" to take part in the presidential elections after the mid-term elections.
At a local meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was thinking about participating in the elections.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington to restore the damaged government, and this also means that a woman in the top position is in the top position,” she said, according to the political news magazine The Hill.
‘After 6 November, I will seriously consider choosing to be President’
Warren went out against President Donald Trump at the meeting in the town hall and said that he was sending “this country in the wrong direction”
“I am troubled by what Donald Trump brings to our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been open in her criticism of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, \"Of course, we have to wait for an investigation from the FBI before we vote on it\"
However, an opinion survey published on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own attachment considers that it should not be preferred in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the \"probable\" voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not be elected, according to an opinion survey by the Political Research Center of Suffolk University and the Boston Globe.
Twenty-two percent were in favour of being elected.
The investigation showed that there was more support for former Governor Deval Patrick, 38% before a possible candidate and 48% against.
Other names of prominent Democrats associated with possible participation in the presidential elections in 2020 are former Vice President Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, Senator from Vermont.
Biden said he would make an official decision in January, according to an Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin talks about PTSS of Track Palin at a election meeting of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after he took office in September.
He was arrested and charged after a report of domestic violence Monday night.
“By what my own son has to experience, what he is experiencing now that he is back, I understand other families experiencing the consequences of PTSS and the injuries with which some of our soldiers return,” she told the audience present at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest “the elephant in the room - and said about her son and other veterans - they come back a little different, they come back and they get harder, they come back and ask themselves whether there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots and all the other military forces have given to the homeland -
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and was charged with domestic violence and assault on a woman, interference in a report on domestic violence and possession of a weapon under influence, according to Dan Bennett, police spokesman in Wasilla.
Washington D.C. and 18 states support the protest against a new asylum policy
Eighteen States and the District of Columbia support a legal protest against a new policy in the United States, refusing asylum to victims on the run for gang violence or domestic violence.
Last Friday, representatives of the 18 states and Washington D.C. have made a statement as 'friend-of-the-court' to the Washington court in support of an asylum-seeker who is fighting this policy, NBC News reports.
The full name of the complainant in Grace versus Sessions case that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy has not been announced.
She says that her partner, and his violent sons who are members of a gang, have abused her but that U.S. officials rejected her application for asylum on 20 July.
She's on it in Texas.
The lawyers of the states supporting Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of people apply for asylum in the US, as countries that have major problems in gangs and domestic violence.
The US's new asylum policy has reversed a decision of the 2014 Board of Immigrant Appeals, in which it became possible for immigrants without documents on the flight for domestic violence to request asylum.
Karl Racine, the Attorney General of Washington D.C., said Friday in a statement that the new policy \"for decades ignores state, federal and international legislation\"
'Federal legislation requires that all applications for asylum be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application and such an obstacle is contrary to that principle' in the declaration of the 'friend-of-the-court'.
The lawyers continue to argue that the policy to deny immigrants access to the US is damaging the economy of the US, because these immigrants are likely to become new entrepreneurs and the country 'provides the necessary labour'.
Jeff Sessions, the Minister of Justice, ordered judges not to grant asylum to victims of domestic and gang violence in June.
“Asylum is available for those who escape their country because of persecution or fear on the basis of race, religion, nationality or membership of a specific social group or political viewpoint,” says Sessions in his announcement on 11 June of the policy.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all problems, even if these problems are serious, with which people get to make every day, anywhere in the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu while the number of dead doubled in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
“It feels very tense,” said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, trying to comfort her feverish baby in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute new bodies arrive in ambulances.
And clean water is scarce.
Residents returned to their devastated homes and searched for valuable things they could still use in their door - to - door possessions.
Hundreds of people have suffered injury and the hospitals have been overpopulated, in so far as they have not been damaged by the earthquake of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
Some injured, including Dwi Haris, who had suffered a broken back and shoulder, rested outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated outside because of the risk of severe aftershocking.
Tranen filled his eyes as he told about his feelings when the devastating earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pressed against the remnants of a wall - told Haris to a correspondent from the Associated Press and added to it when he and his family were in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife call for help, and I didn’t hear anything later.
I don't know what happened to her and our child.
I hope they're safe.
US ambassador accuses China of 'intimidation' with 'propaganda ads'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper posted an advertisement of four pages in an American daily, in which the mutual benefits of trade between the USA and China were expressed, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
American President Donald Trump last referred to the paid annex of China Daily in the Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of interference in the U.S. Congress elections of 6 November, a charge denied by China.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere with the US elections marked a new stage in Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China, according to U.S. officials quoted by Reuters.
Although it is normal for foreign authorities to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in an escalating trade war, in which they have imposed higher import tariffs on each other.
China's retaliation rates early in the commercial war were specifically aimed at meeting exporters in states like Iowa, who supported Trump's Republican Party, as Chinese and American experts have said.
Terry Branstad, US ambassador to China and long-term governor of Iowa, an important exporter of agricultural products to China, said that China had affected American workers, farmers and businesses.
“China, as Branstad wrote in a statement in Des Moines Register of Sunday, now doubles the intimidation by publishing propaganda ads in our free press.”
“By spreading this propaganda, the government of China uses freedom of expression and a free press, a long cherished tradition in America by placing a paid advertisement in Des Moines Register,” wrote Branstad.
“In contrast, at a kiosk in the centre of Beijing, you will find inconvenient voices and you will not see any true reflection of the diverse opinions the Chinese people may have about the difficult economic course, because the media are firmly under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that \"one of China's most prominent newsletters has refused to publish his article, if he didn't tell what news magazine this was.
By the Kavanaugh debacle the Republicans alienated female voters from themselves just before the mid-term elections, warning analysts
Now that many important Republicans are working around Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate for the Supreme Court, and defending him against various accusations of sexual violence, analysts warn that they will experience a setback, especially among women, during the upcoming interim elections.
The emotions surrounding this issue have become enormous, and most Republicans have already let themselves know that they want to continue voting.
“These things cannot be reversed,” said Grant Reeher, professor of politicalology at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, to The Hill for an article that appeared on Saturday.
Reeher said he was wondering if the attempt by Senator Jeff Flake (Republican, Arizona) to plead for an FBI investigation at the last moment will be sufficient to satisfy the angry voters.
“Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday, they haven’t forgotten it tomorrow and they haven’t forgotten it in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior consultant and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday, according to the news paper from Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, demonstrators — November is coming — during their demonstration in the hall of the Senate, while the Republicans who controlled the Justice Commission chose to approve Kavanaugh's candidacy, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported Mic.
“The enthusiasm and motivation for the Democrats will reach a record height,” said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, to the news site.
“People say it’s already high, and that’s true.
However, it can still continue, especially among floating female voters in the outlying regions and among younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who often do not vote even though they do not agree with the President,
Even before Ford’s public testimony, in which she further explained her accusation of sexual harassment against the candidate before the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that there could be a setback if the Republicans were to press on with the appointment.
“This has become a confusing mess for the Republican Party,” said Michael Steele, former party president of the Republican Party, earlier last week according to NBC News.
'It is not only the vote in committee, or the final vote or that Kavanaugh takes place in court, but it is also the way in which the Republicans have dealt with this and how they have dealt with it, Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, a group that helps Democrats to be elected, makes clear to the news channel.
However, the Americans appear to be divided about the question of who they believe after Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a small majority signing out on the side of the latter.
A new opinion survey by YouGov shows that 41% of respondents firmly believe Ford's testimony and that 35% believe or believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they thought Kavanaugh certainly lied during his testimony while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After Flake's suggestion, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's accusations and at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford stated last week to the Senate Justice Committee under oath that Kavanaugh had attacked her under the influence of alcohol when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed his genitals to her at a festival during the time they both studied at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans a new Internet to address Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, starts a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project of technology legend, is a company based on the open source platform Solid by Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which persons have access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that 'world domination' is the leading idea behind Inrupt.
“We have to do this now,” he said about the startup.
‘This is a historical moment’
The app uses Solid's technology to enable people to create their own 'personal online data storage' or POD.
It can store lists of contacts, activity lists, an agenda, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available together through one browser and all at the same time.
What makes POD unique is that it depends entirely on the user who has access to what information.
The company calls this 'personal empowerment through data'.
The idea behind Inrupt, according to CEO John Bruce, is that the company provides the resources, processes and necessary skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week on, developers of technology around the world can create their own decentralized apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not going to talk to \"Facebook and Google about introducing or not introducing a complete transformation that will put all their business models on their heads at once,
\"We do not ask for their permission,
In a post on Medium published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the mission (of Inrupt) is to deliver the commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new web, which is built on Solid,
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even after the start of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain as founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I am incredibly optimistic about this new era for the web,” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: spiritual and carrier of Victoria Cross from WO I honored
The only clergyman of the Church of England who acquired a Victoria Cross as a military during World War I is honored 100 years later in his birthplace.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann received the distinction following the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, four days later he was killed by a sharp shooter and never knew that he had fallen into the highest British military honor.
A memorial stone was revealed by its two grandsons during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of the grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was 'brilliant symbolic' that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after the fact for which his grandfather was distinguished.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion on 29 September 1918 on the Saint-Quentin Canal in a very dense fog and under heavy fire from field gun and machine guns,
Later he stormed through to the line of fire and led the line forward before he ran only to a field gun and turned three members off the detention.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sharp shooter on October 4, 1918, a little more than one month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather’s actions were “something that I know I can never touch, but something that makes me feel humble too“
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a cliff after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that \"he felt very honored to be able to play a role in the parade, and added that \"the bravery of a real hero is evident from the support he receives from a large number of people\"
Fans of MMA stayed up all night to see Bellator 206 and got Peppa Pig in place
Imagine, you've stayed awake all night to see a follow-up Bellator 206 and you won't see the most important moment.
The San Jose bill mentioned 13 battles, including six in the main section, and this was broadcast all night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were ready for their fight, viewers in the United Kingdom were surprised when the transmitter switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were outraged because they had stayed awake especially for this fight all night.
One fan described the transition to the children's program on Twitter as \"a bad joke\"
“After 6:00 a.m., government regulation should no longer show content that is not suitable for children, so we had to switch to the children’s program,” said Dave Schwartz, senior vice-president for marketing and communication at Bellator, when he was asked for the broadcast.
‘ ‘Peppa the pig,’ yes,
Scott Coker, company president of Bellator, said that they are going to adjust their programming to ensure that the viewers in the United Kingdom are also given a chance in the future.
“I think we can solve this problem with a view to the return race,” said Coker.
“But it’s six in the morning here on a Sunday and we can’t discuss anything until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
We're working on it.
When I made the transition, there went a lot of texting back and forth and believe me, these weren't all just kind.
We tried to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a public problem.
I can promise that this will not happen second time.
We limited the broadcasts to five nights instead of six, as we normally did, we tried to make it even better for the fans, but we just went too far.
It's an unfortunate situation,
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'inferior' because of his sexual orientation
The Olympic skier Tom Daley says he felt inferior during his youth because of his sexual orientation, but this gave him the motivation to succeed.
Twenty-four years of age said that until he went to further education, he didn't realize that 'not everyone is like me'.
In a conversation at Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 with Lauren Laverne, he said he had expressed himself about homosexual rights to give 'hope' to others.
He also said that parenthood had contributed to his being less attached to winning during the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the regular presenter of the long-running show has taken a few months off because of illness.
Appearing as a bribe to Laverne's first program, Daley told him that during his youth he felt 'less' than others because it was 'socially unacceptable to like girls and boys'.
He said: “Today those feelings, feelings of being less and of being different are really existing facts that have given me the strength to succeed,
He wanted to prove that he was 'someone' so that he wouldn't disappoint people if they finally got behind his nature.
The winner of two bronze Olympic medals has become a prominent campaigner for the LGBT community and used his presence at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he was happy that he could live openly without further consequences and that he wanted to give others 'hope'.
The three-time world champion said that the fact that he fell in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Back, whom he met in 2013, 'was completely surprised'.
Daley married the Oscarwinner last year, who is 20 years older than him, but said the age difference had never been a problem.
“When you’re so young to endure so much, he took part in his first 14-year-old Olympics and his father died of cancer three years later, it’s hard to find someone in your own age group who has experienced the same highs and lows.
The couple became parents in June of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said that his \"whole perspective\" had changed.
“If you asked me this question last year, I would have answered that it was all about winning a gold medal, ” he said.
“But you know what, there are more important things on earth than winning gold Olympic medals.
My gold Olympic medal is Robbie.
His son has the same name as his father who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father had not accepted that he would die and one of the last things he had asked if they had already received the tickets for London 2012, because he wanted to sit on the first row.
“I couldn’t get it over my heart to say, you won’t be there to sit on the first row, Dad,” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing and not until his breathing actually stuck and he died, I could finally acknowledge that he was not invincible, ” he said.
Daley competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics and won bronze.
“I knew I had dreamed about this all my life. Diving for a home public at the Olympic Games, there’s no better feeling,” he said.
It was also the inspiration for his first choice of music, Proud by Heather Small, that had strongly attacked him on his way to the games and that he still got chicken skin from.
Desert Island Discs is to be listened to on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, not in shape, on bank at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will establish a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th match in the Ryder Cup, but he has to find his shape to make no sad milestone.
Mickelson, who participates for the 12th time in the two-year event, a record, was placed on the bench by the team captain Jim Furek for the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the centre of the action, as he has often done for the United States, the winner of five majors distributes the day between supporting his teammates and practicing on the driving range, in an attempt to find out what it is short of.
Because he was never known for his straight drives even on the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the close fairways of Le Golf National, where the long grass of the roughs wandering balls routinely punishes.
And if the job isn't frightening enough on its own, Mickelson will meet the ever-accurate Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open in the ninth match on Sunday, against which is coupled with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four the matches this week.
If the Americans behind four points at the beginning of the 12 single matches are well started, Mickelson's match can be absolutely crucial.
Furyk has shown confidence in this man, even though he could honestly say hard otherwise.
“He fully understood the role he had today, hit me on the back, hit his arm around me, and said he’s ready tomorrow,” said Furek.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He was admitted to the Hall of Fame and he contributed so much to these teams, in the past, but also this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play only two matches.
I was expecting more of it, but it's like it is and it's the way we were supposed to act.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else,
Mickelson can improve Nick Faldo's record on Sunday for the highest number of played Ryder Cup matches.
It can also mean the end of a Ryder Cup career in which he has never completely matched the highlights of his personal career.
Mickelson has won 18 matches, 20 lost matches and 7 equal games on his behalf, but Furyk said his presence had a certain amazing influence on the team.
“He’s funny, he’s sarcastic, he’s caught, he likes to get jokes with people, and he’s a great guy to have in the team, so he explained.
“I think the younger players liked to keep him crazy occasionally last week, that was funny to see.
He has so much more to offer than just his game,
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows that great advance can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that the comfortable advance ahead of the single matches on the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a less comfortable situation.
Deen made his debut in the competition in Valderrama in 1997, where the team with Captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead on the Americans, but finally the finish line passed with the smallest possible margin: 141⁄2-131⁄2.
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a great advance in Valderrama; we had a great advance in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but just so far,” Bjorn said, calling here, after he had seen the lights of 2018 win with 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, well for a 10-6 advance on Le Golf National.
So history shows me and everyone else on the team that this isn't a game yet.
Everyone will have to be fully involved tomorrow.
Go to work and carry out the plan on the right one.
It's not over until the points are on the board.
We have a goal, and that's this trophy winning, and we have to keep focusing on it.
I keep saying it, I focus on the 12 players we can have, but we are also aware of the people on the other side, some of the best players in the world,
Rejoiced at the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never go ahead in this area.
Tomorrow is another challenge.
The individual performance will be discussed tomorrow, and that is another very different discipline.
It's great to be out there with a partner if it's okay, but when you're just standing there, your skills as a golfer are really being tested.
That's the message you need to tell the players, try to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
So now let's get your partner going and he's got to get the best out of himself, too.
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furek, expects his players to perform better individually than as partners. The exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who conquered three of the four points.
Furyk itself has experience with both sides of this kind of reversal on the last day, as a member of the winning team in Brookline and as a loser when Europe realized the 'Miracle of Medinah'.
“I remember every damn word of that speech,” he said in answer to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had picked up his players for the last day.
“We have 12 important matches for the bow tomorrow, but let’s try to get started, as in Brookline, or as in Medinah.
When we have the momentum, there will be a lot of pressure on the matches in the middle.
We have agreed our line-up on this and send the men on the way in the order that we think is best and, you know, we're going to try something out of the high hat tomorrow \"
Thomas has the job of trying to lead the open-minded, and Rory McIlroy is in charge of the first match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the first half of the battle.
“I chose this group in this order, because I think we’re so constantly covered,” said Bjorn of his selection of single players.
The new warship of Germany was again postponed
The latest frigate of the German Navy should have come into service in 2014, replacing the outdated warships of the Cold War, but it will take at least one year before it is ready, due to defective systems and rising costs, reported local media.
The operation of the 'Rheinland-Palatinate', the leading ship in the brand new Baden-Wrootemberg class frigate, is now postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the news magazine Die Zeit that cites a military spokesman.
The vessel should have been part of the navy in 2014, but the worrying problems after delivery have plagued the fate of the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wortemberg class ordered by the Navy in 2007 serve to replace the obsolete frigates of the Bremen class.
As far as we know, they have a powerful cannon, a series of air repellent and anti-ship rockets and a form of stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic features.
Other important features are longer maintenance cycles, it should be possible to put the latest frigate up to two years behind each other, far from the home ports.
However, the constant delays mean that the advanced warships, designed to give Germany the opportunity to project its power overseas, are already out of date by the time they are taken into service, notes Die Zeit.
The fatal frigate F125 has already taken the newspaper heads last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the vessel into service and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy sent a ship back to a shipbuilder after delivery.
There is little known about the reasons behind this return, but German media cited a number of crucial 'software and hardware defects' that would make the warship useless if used in a battle mission.
Software defects were particularly important because the Baden-Wroottemberg-class vessels were operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, helping the manpower on the frigids of the older Bremen-class.
It also became apparent that the ship had a serious weight, which would reduce performance and limit the capabilities of the navy to further upgrades.
The 'Rheinland-Pfalz' weighs 7,000 tons, which is twice as much as ships of a similar class used by the Germans in the Second World War.
In addition to the defective hardware, the prize card for the entire project, including the training of the crew, becomes a problem.
It is said to have reached a dizzying € 3.1 billion compared to the original € 2.2 billion.
The problems that the latest frigates have in their grip are particularly important because of the recent warnings that the power of the German Navy is diminishing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the parliamentary defence committee in Germany, acknowledged that the navy actually has a lack of operational ships,
The official said that the problem has grown over time as a snowball, as old ships were removed from operation but no replacement vessels were supplied.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wroottemberg class were yet available to be included in the navy.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
New research carried out on an estate in the Scottish highlands tries to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
The hope is that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and will contribute to future conservation activities.
The study carried out by scientists of the National Trust for Scotland follows the usual and the small dwarf bat, the brown large parent bat and the water bat at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment is placed on key locations around the estate to monitor the activities of the bats throughout the season.
Employees of the NTS and volunteers will also conduct mobile investigations using hand detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the crevices of the bat and what kind of what does.
A map of the habitat and a report are then produced to make a detailed picture of their behaviour on a landscape scale.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Conservation Adviser, hopes to show the results of which areas of the habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of pastures and how we can best maintain forests for bats and similar species.
Fleer mouse populations in Scotland and the rest of the UK have declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities that affect sleeping sites and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lightnings can also pose a risk, such as aircraft catchers and certain chemical treatments of building materials and attacks by domestic cats.
In reality, bats are not blind.
However, their nightly hunting habits make their ears more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching a prey.
They use an advanced echo location technique to determine the position of insects and obstacles in their flight route.
In the NTS, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, bats are taken very seriously.
The NTS has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, inspections of sleeping places and sometimes rescue actions.
The organisation has even set up the first and only reservation for bats in Scotland at the Thrave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of the ten species of bats of Scotland live.
Landscape manager David Thompson says the estate is the ideal territory for the bats.
“Here in Threave we have a great environment for bats,” he said.
“We have the old buildings, many very old trees and the right habitat.
But there is so much not yet known about bats, and therefore the work we do here and at other locations will help us to understand better what they need to be able to thrive,
He stresses the importance of monitoring bats before maintenance operations are carried out, as the possibly unconscious destruction of a sleeping place can lead to the death of 400 female bats and their boys, possibly eliminating a full local population.
Bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill them, harass them or disturb them or to destroy their sleeping grounds.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish official for the Bat Conservation Trust, has asked the public to make a contribution to help.
She said: “We still have to learn a lot about our bats and many of our species, we just don’t know how their populations are doing”
Ronaldo rejects charges of assault while his lawyers prepare to prosecute a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo's allegations of assault qualified as 'fake news' and said that people 'will promote themselves' by using his name.
His lawyers are about to sue the German weekly Der Spiegel, in which the allegations have been published.
The tip of Portugal and Juventus is accused of assaulting an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is also accused of having paid her $375,000 to keep silent about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Through a video for its 142 million followers on Instagram Live called Ronaldo, 33, a few hours after the allegations were reported, the reports 'fake news'.
“ No, no, no, no, no.
What they say today, fake news, - says the winner of five Gold Balls on camera.
“They want to promote themselves by calling me my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by calling my name, but that's part of the business.
I am a happy man, and through and through well - the footballer added to this, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a lawsuit in which they want to prosecute Der Spiegel for the accusations they called 'an intolerable reporting of suspicions in the field of privacy', according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz, lawyer, said that the footballer wants to compensate for the 'moral damage for an amount corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years'.
The alleged incident took place loudly in June 2009 in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga, according to the report, returned to the footballer's room, where, according to the accusation, he raped her anal, as read in the charge filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that after the alleged incident, Ronaldo fell on his knees and told her that he was a good guy for '99%' but that he is sometimes abandoned that 'one percent'.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that this was mutually beneficial.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that there were photographs taken of her injuries in a hospital, but that she later agreed to an extrajudicial regime because she was 'banged for the consequences' and because she was worried about the 'public humiliation'.
The 34-year-old now says that she wants to make the scheme invalid because she is constantly traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to go from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged assault and this summer he left for the Italian giant Juventus in a deal worth €100 million.
Brexit: the United Kingdom 'will regret it forever' as car producers leave
The United Kingdom 'will regret it forever' if it loses its status as world leader in the field of car production after Brexit, said Greg Clark, Minister of Economic Affairs.
He added that it was 'careful' that Toyota UK had told BBC that if Great Britain would leave the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily stop production in the Burnaston factory, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” said Clark.
The Japanese car producer said that the impact of delays at the border in the case of a 'no-deal Brexit' job would be costly.
The Burnaston plant, where the Auris and Avensis of Toyota are made, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other countries in the European Union.
“My vision is that when Great Britain crashes from the EU at the end of March, we will see production in our factory collapse,” said Marvin Cooke, the managing director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other car products in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also expressed their fears about the consequences of a departure from the EU without agreement for the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW has already shown that it will close the Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
Most concerns the car manufacturers are about risks in the supply chain in the case of a 'no-deal Brexit'.
The Toyota production line runs on the basis of the 'just-in-time' principle, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and in the EU for cars made on order.
If, on 29 March, the UK leaves the EU without a deal, there may be unrest at the borders which, according to industry, can lead to delays and shortages of components.
Toyota cannot store more than one day in stock in the factory in Derbyshire, so the company had to know, and that is why production would be halted in that case.
Clark said that Theresa May's Chequers plan for the future relationship with the EU has been 'exactly aligned to avoid those border controls'.
“We have a deal. We want to have the best deal, which will not only enable us to continue the current success, but also to seize this opportunity,” he told the listeners of the BBC Radio 4 programme Today.
“The proof, not only of Toyota but also of other producers, is that we must be able to continue with these very successful supply chains.”
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but warned in the longer term that the additional costs would affect the company's competitiveness and that this would ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years, who is a representative of the Unite trade union at the factory, said that his members are increasingly worried: “In my experience, once these jobs have been lost, they never come back.
A public spokesperson said: “We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU,
The meeting of Trump and Rosenstein can be delayed again, says the White House
The crucial meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein can still be postponed for a week, while the fight over the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, continues, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Attorney Robert Mueller, who is investigating the Russian influence of the elections, links between Trump's and Russia's assistants and potential obstacle to justice by the President.
The question of whether Trump will dismiss the deputy attorney general and thereby endanger Mueller's independence has been going on for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of wearing a microphone to hold talks with Trump and to dismiss the president via the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied this report.
But when he went to the White House last Monday, rumors were about to start his dismissal.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then with the United Nations in New York City, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he wanted to dismiss Rosenstein 'Liver not', but then the meeting was moved to avoid a conflict with a hearing of the Senate Justice Committee, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, would both testify.
On Friday, Trump gave the FBI orders to conduct a one-week investigation of the charges against Kavanaugh, thus delaying the vote in the entire Senate.
On Sunday Sarah Sanders, Trump's press chief, appeared on Fox News.
Asked for the Rosenstein meeting, she said: “There is no date for it, it could be this week, but it could also be postponed for a week, given all the other things going on with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I always want to keep the press up to date.
Some reporters had difficulty with this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the scarcity of press conferences was not caused by a rejection of the 'anxious' TV journalists, though, she added: \"I will not deny that they are trying to draw attention to it,
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
'The President makes more question-and-answer sessions than any President before him,' she said, without giving evidence: 'we have looked at the figures'
Press conferences will still take place, said Sanders, but if the press has the chance to ask the President of the United States directly questions, that is infinitely better than talking to me.
We're trying to do that a lot and you've seen us do that many times over the past few weeks and that'll take the place of a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States,
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public sessions or during press conferences with dignitarians who are visiting.
Press conferences with only the president are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why, he made an open and at times bizarre appearance for the collected reporters.
Minister for Health writes a letter on Brexit to NHS Scotland employees from other EU countries
The Minister for Health has written a letter to the EU staff working in the NHS Scotland to express the gratitude of the country and the wish that they continue to work with the NHS after the Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter less than six months before the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish government has already declared itself prepared to bear the costs of applying for a fixed status for EU citizens working for decentralised public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer negotiations between the UK and the EU continued, and these autumns the expected decisions will be taken.
However, at the same time, the UK government has also scrutinized preparations for a possible scenario in which no deal is reached.
I know these uncertain times must be for all of you.
That is why I should like to stress again how much I appreciate the contribution of all staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that enhance and enhance the work of the NHS and provide benefits for the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is sure you're at home and we'd like you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing an emergency operation after head injury
The Tennessee State Tigers linebaccor, Christion Abercrombie, underwent an emergency operation yesterday after he had suffered a head injury in the 31-27 lost match against the Vanderbilt Commodores, reports Mike Organ of the Tennessean.
Rod Reed, the head coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the accident occurred shortly before rest.
“He came to the sideline and fell into it more or less, ” said Reed.
The trainers and the medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen directly on the side line before they put him on a stretcher and took him for further research.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had come from the operating room at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there are still no details about the type/size of the injury' and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury has occurred.
Abercrombie, a 'redshirt sophomore', is in his first season at Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He was tapped a total of five times on Saturday before leaving the field, making this season a total of 18 times.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher lows when they buy a house in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher lows when they buy a house in the UK and the proceeds are used to help the homeless according to new plans of the Conservatives
This action will have to neutralise Corbyn's success in attracting young voters
The increase in the lows is levied on persons who do not pay tax in the UK
The Ministry of Finance expects this to bring in £120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher rents when they buy a house in the UK and the extra income is used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn, who attracts young voters with promises to ensure more affordable homes and to relate this to many of them.
The increase in the lows is levied on persons and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, with the additional revenue being paid in an attempt by the public authorities to combat homelessness.
The surcharge, which comes on top of the current lows, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second houses and houses purchased for rental, can go up to 3%.
The Ministry of Finance expects to collect up to £120 million a year in this way.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the new construction in London is purchased by people who do not live in the UK, which raises prices and makes it difficult for starters to get a foothold on the landlord.
Many prosperous areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become virtually 'spook cities' because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson had pleaded for a reduction in the lows to help young people buy their first house.
He accused large construction companies of keeping prices high by buying up land and not using it and called on May to abolish quotas on affordable houses in order to restore the 'domestic housing' in Great Britain.
Corbyn has announced a remarkable series of housing reforms, including rent ceilings and an end to exposure without negligence.
He also wants to give local authorities more opportunities to build new houses.
May said: “Last year I said that I wanted to spend my time as prime minister in restoring the British Dream, that life will be better for every new generation.
And that means that our defective housing market needs to be restored.
Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be as simple for people who do not live in the UK, and for foreign companies, to buy houses here as it is for hardworking British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a house has become a too vague dream and the humiliation of life without a roof above the head is already too real,
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland'
Jack Ross, Sunderland's boss, says it's his \"ultimate ambition\" to ever become manager of Scotland.
The Schot, 42, enjoys the challenge of reviving the North-East England club, which is currently third in League One, at three points from the first place.
He went to the Stadium of Light last summer after returning St Mirren to the Scottish Premiership for the previous season.
“As a footballer, I wanted to play for my fatherland.
But I was selected for the B-team, and with that the choice was off - told Ross to Sportsound on BBC Scotland.
“When I was a child I saw with my father Scotland often playing in Hampden Park and it’s something that continues to attract me.
However, this possibility would not come until I'm successful in managing a club,
The predecessors of Ross as managers of Sunderland include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former boss of Alloa Athletic says that he was not intimidated to become the successor of these established names at a large club, he had previously refused advancements from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
\"Succes for me is currently being measured by 'can I make this club return to the Premier League?'
Due to the structure and facilities at this club, it should undoubtedly be in the Premier League - he says.
“It’s not a simple task to achieve this, but I can only see myself as successful if I bring back the club there again”
Ross is only three years in his career as manager, after a period as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months in the coaching group of Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from degradation to the third division and transformed St Mirren from on the edge of degradation to winning the Championship in the next season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his career as a footballer at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“It was probably a crossroads, ” he recalled from the moment he took the lead at Alloa.
“I really believed that management was the right choice for me, much more than play.
It sounds bizarre, because I did the best I did, I earned quite well and knew a few reasonable highlights.
But football can be heavy.
There's a lot of things you're faced with weekly.
I still have that, given the stress and pressure of the business, but management just feels good.
I've always wanted to be a manager and now that I'm real, I'm so good in my skin, as I've never felt in my adult life,

The perfect time for a pint is 17:30 on a Saturday, reveals research
The heat wave in summer has increased the revenue of British pubs who have difficulty surviving, but have also put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Groups with pubs and bars saw turnover rise by 2.7% in July, but revenue in restaurants was 4.8% less, the figures show.
Peter Martin, CGA’s CGA Business Advisory Office, who collected the figures, said: “Continuous sunshine and the fact that England participated in the World Championships longer than expected meant that July showed a similar pattern as June, when the pubs had 2.8 percent more turnover, with the difference that the restaurants were getting even harder.
The 1.8% fall in the turnover of restaurants in June, was only worse in July.
Pubs and bars aimed at beverage sales were best performed, with a better LFL growth (like-for-like) than that restaurants went down.
Pubs who are also on the sale of food are also members of the sun, but not as dramatic as the restaurants.
Looks like people just went out to drink.
In pubs and bars under management, the alcohol turnover was 6.6 percent higher for the month, while food turnover was 3% lower,
Paul Newman, RSM analysts for the leisure and hospitality industry, said: “These results are continuing the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and impact of important social or sporting events remain the main factors for the turnover in the outdoor market.
It is therefore no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, even though a turnover of 4.8% per year-on-year is particularly painful given the constant cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the operators focusing on food and only time will learn whether the more moderate temperatures of August could give the necessary respite,
The total turnover growth in the pub and restaurant sectors, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the decrease in the introduction of new brands.
In the Case Peach Tracker, the turnover monitor for the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the UK, the performance data are collected and analysed by 47 operational groups, with a combined turnover of £9 billion. This is the established benchmark of the industry.
One in five children has a secret account for social media that they keep hidden from their parents
One in five children, some not older than 11 years old, has a secret account for social media, that they keep hidden from parents and teachers, reveals a survey
Survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the growth in 'false Insta pages'
This news has strengthened the fear that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of students say they have a 'head account' that they show their parents too.
One in five children, some not older than 11 years old, makes accounts for social media that keep them hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed rapid growth in the 'false Insta accounts', a reference to Instagram, the site for sharing photos.
This news has reinforced the fear that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of students say they use a clean 'head account' to show their parents, while still having personal accounts.
A mother who accidentally reached the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter found out there a teenager who asked others to 'strangle' her.
The research, carried out by Digital Awareness UK and HMC (Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference) of independent schools, found that 40% of 11 to 18 year olds had two profiles and that half agreed to keep up with personal accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HCM, said: “It’s disturbing that so many teenagers are lured into creating online spaces where they are not found by their parents and teachers,
Eilidh Doyle becomes the 'stem of the athlete' in the Scottish athletic council
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the council of the Scottish athletic world, as non-executive director at the general annual meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scotland on the job and in the field and President Ian Beattie described her election as a great opportunity for the drivers of the sport to learn about her extensive experience at an international level over the past ten years.
“Eilidh enjoys a great deal of respect in the athletic community of Scotland, the UK and the world and we are sure that the athletics in Scotland will greatly benefit from her election in the council,” said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I am happy to be able to serve as a vote for the athletes and I hope I can contribute and help manage the sport in Scotland -
The American who won 200 metres and 400 metres during the 1996 Games in Atlanta, two of his four gold Olympic medals, and who now regularly comments on BBC, could no longer walk after a TIA.
He wrote on Twitter: “Today a month ago I had a TIA.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors told me that only time will tell if I will recover and to what extent.
It has been very hard work, but I am now fully recovered, I have learned to walk again and do my flexibility exercises today!

Advertise breast pump in which mothers are compared to cows, distribute online opinion
A company that makes chest pumps has distributed the online opinion with an advertisement comparing sucking mothers to cows being milked.
To mark the introduction of what is called 'the most quiet portable chest pump in the world', Elvie, producer of consumer technology, has released an ironic, music videos inspired advertisement to illustrate the freedom this new pump has offered to collapsing mothers.
Four real mothers dancing in a hay-filled barn on a song that contains lyrics like: 'Yes, I'm milking myself, but you can't see anything' and 'In case you didn't see it, these are no udders, these are my breasts'.
The chorus then continues with: 'Pomps, pumps, pumps, I feed the babies, pumps, pumps, pumps, pumps, I milk the lady's.
However, the ad, which was published on the company's Facebook page, has immediately provided an online controversy.
The video has been watched 77,000 times and has attracted hundreds of comments, especially mixed reactions from viewers, in which many people say that the dairy industry's 'horror' is being condoned.
“A bad choice to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they must be expected to produce milk, but in their case the babies are taken away within days of delivery - is written in a response.
Elvie's chest pump fits discreetly into a food beha (Elvie/Mother).
Another noted: “Of course, this is traumatic for mother and baby.
But yes, why don't we use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies,
Another person added: “This ad is so far from reality.
Others defended the ad and a woman admitted that she found the song 'hilaric'.
“I think this is a brilliant idea.
I would buy it if I were still breast-feeding.
That pumping made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little weird, but I haven't looked for too much.
This is a genius product - someone wrote.
Someone else had the following comment: “This is a funny ad, aimed at moms who bats (often in the workplace or in a toilet) and then feel like being just a cow.
This advertisement does not appear to be positive or negative about the dairy industry,
At the end of the video you will see the group of women who are all dancing with the pump discreetly hidden in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the understanding that many women who bat sometimes feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no wires or snakes and fits discreetly into a food bra, so that women have the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out while they are on bats.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother says: “The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a tough and provocative introduction.
By comparing collapsing mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to place the bat and the associated challenges in the spotlights and at the same time show in an entertaining and understandable way how the new pump will provide for an incredible sense of freedom.
This is not the first time Elvie's pump gets the front page.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the catwalk of Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly move to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of detained migrant children has reached a peak, although the number of monthly cross-border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the harsh rhetoric and harsh policy introduced by the Trump government makes it more difficult to bring children to sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves are undocumented immigrants and are afraid of endangering their own chance to stay in the country by registering for a child.
This risk was increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households should hand over their fingerprints and that these data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified to the Congress that his organization has arrested dozens of people who have signed up as sponsors for unguided minors.
The organisation later confirmed that 70% of the arrested had no prior criminal record.
“A little more than 80% of the people who are sponsors or family members of the sponsors are illegal in this country and a large part of them are criminal strangers.
We're in the process of pursuing these people, said Mr. Albence.
In an attempt to process the children more quickly, officials introduced new rules, which required some of them to appear before the court within one month of the start of the detention, instead of within 60 days, which was the standard, according to the employees at the shelter
Many of them will stand before the court through a video conference, rather than in person, to advocate their application for legal status for a immigration judge.
Those who are deemed not to be eligible for help will soon be deported.
The longer the children remain in custody, the greater the risk of becoming anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent eruptions or escape attempts, according to the employees at the shelter and according to reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
Advocates said that these concerns are stronger at a larger facility, such as Tornillo, where the signs that a child is struggling are ignored more often because of the size of the camp.
They added that moving the children to the tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can contribute to the trauma that many of them are already struggling with.
Syria recommends the US, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
In a speech for the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Muallem also called on Syrian refugees to return even now that the war in the country is in the eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Vice Prime Minister, said that the foreign troops are illegally located on Syrian soil, under the pretext of combating terrorism and that 'this will be dealt with accordingly'.
“They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions,” he told the Assembly.
According to Moualem, the \"war on terror is almost over\" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been destroyed and driven away from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue this holy struggle until we have freed all Syrian territories from terror groups and from an ‘eventual illegal foreign presence’
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly in training and consulting the Kurdish troops and the Syrian Arabs fighting against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops in the war torn country.
With regard to the refugees, Moualem said that the conditions are favourable for their return and he bewildered 'to spread some Western countries irrational fears', causing most refugees to stay away.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate this return,” he said.
‘They are politicizing a case that should only be a humanitarian problem,’
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid for Syria will be available until a political agreement is concluded between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
Diplomats of the United Nations say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib, the last important bulwark of the rebels, has created the possibility to start political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey has turned away a large-scale attack from Syrian troops supported by Russia on the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that this agreement had 'clear deadlines' and said that he hoped that military action would focus on jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front linked to Al-Qaeda, who would be 'cut off'.
Staffan de Mistura, the UN Member, is hoping to convene the first meeting of a new committee consisting of members of the government and the opposition to draft a constitution for postwar Syria and to pave the way for elections.
Moualem made clear the conditions of the Syrian government to participate in the committee and said that the work of the panel should be restricted 'to the revision of the articles of the present Constitution' and he warned against interference from outside.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump would win the elections in 2020 unless, as many 'liberal' viewers probably hope, his presidency is ended prematurely by a settlement procedure and scandals.
In what would undoubtedly be 'the most dramatic final of a presidency ever'.
At the moment, however, there are no signs of sight fatigue.
Since 2014, the prime-time viewing figures at CNN have more than doubled to 1.05 million and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during prime time, compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, and 'The Rachel Maddow Show' of MSNBC is at the top of the reviews for cable programs with 3.5 million viewers on evenings with important news.
“This is a fire that attracts people, because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, the responsible behind the ABC drama ‘Designated Survivor’ a series about a minister who became president after an attack destroyed the Capitool.
Nell Scovell, an experienced writer of comedy and author of 'Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club' has another theory.
She remembers a taxirite in Boston for the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he was going to vote on Trump.
Why? She asked.
\"He said \"Because he's making me laugh,\" Scovell told me.
There's entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike all the others on TV, the storylines coming from Washington can influence the future of Roe v. Wade or determine whether immigrant families can reunite or affect the status of the world economy.
Turn off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond being a well-informed citizen, when you see that you've been sitting for six hours looking at a panel of experts discussing the use of sources from the 'deep background' by Bob Woodward in his book 'Fear', who are talking about Paul Manafort's jack of peaforts that cost $15,000 ('a garment full of overmouth' according to The Washington Post) and who discuss the implications of the colorful description by Stormy Daniels of the, uh, anatomy of Trump.
In any case, I'll never be able to look at Super Mario in the same way.
“What he does to give you the idea that it’s a reality show is in part that he stops something new every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of ‘Pawn Stars’, about the rotating role division of the Trump show and the daily plot changes (a fight with the N.F.L., Kim Jong-un praise swinging).
You can't afford to miss a episode or you have the idea you're running behind.
When I reached Fleiss earlier this week, it was sunny and 26 degrees outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he was inside watching MSNBC while he was recording CNN.
He could not get rid of the screen, with Brett Kavanaugh appearing before the Senate Justice Committee and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
“I remember that we were doing all those strange shows, not so long ago, and that people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization’” Fleiss told me.

Money from outside flows into the most exciting intermediate elections for the House of Deputies
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania sees a flood of money, thanks to a recasting of an electoral district, which requires two seated national representatives to fight for the same seat.
The recently reclassified district of Pittsburgh meets the Democratic People's Representative Conor Lamb, who has acquired his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb must take it against another sitting official, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, who has much overlap with the new 17th district.
The cards were reclassified after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January judged that the old districts were unconstitutionally divided ('gerrymanding') in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has led to a knockout in the field of campaign financing between the financial poor of the two major parties, the DCC (Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee) and the NRCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a nicked victory in a well-thought-out special election for the 18th district of Pennsylvania.
This seat had been occupied by a Republican for more than ten years, and President Donald Trump had conquered this district by 20 percentage points.
According to political experts, the Democrats have a small advantage.
The US has considered punishing El Salvador for aid to China and has disregarded it
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama Beijing had already recognized and received little negative response from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and he owned a hotel in Panama until his partners turned out to be the management team of the Trump Organization.
Officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the United States have decided to withdraw the U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the 'recent decision to stop recognizing Taiwan' said Heather Nauert, the spokeswoman of the Ministry, in a statement earlier this month.
But punishments were only considered in the case of El Salvador, because the country received $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, for control of narcotics, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including reductions in financial support and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country with high unemployment and high murder rates.
While the internal meetings continued, North American and Central American officials held a high-level conference, focusing on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in the efforts to prevent migrants from moving to the United States.
But by mid-September, some top officials from the government knew that they wanted the conference to continue, making it impossible for all possible criminal measures to be taken against El Salvador.
The plan is now that Vice-President Mike Pence will give a speech at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the government's commitment to the meeting, say diplomats.
And the three U.S. messengers have returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any harsh messages about Washington's criminal measures.
A spokesman for the White House on behalf of Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal discussion subject to anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who is also close to the government and also spoke on the basis of anonymity.
Study history
The next step may be the report by the special prosecutor Robert Mueller on the possible counter-acting of Trump's justice, for which heavy evidence has now become publicly known.
Mueller is also likely to focus his research on co-operation between Trump's campaign and Russia in an attack by Russia on our elections.
When the Congress changes color, Trump must be responsible for that institute, just as he is ready to address himself again to the electorate, and perhaps he must go to court for a jury.
That is a lot of food, and I do not want to suggest that Trump's fall is inevitable, nor that of his equivalents in Europe.
There will be choices to be made by all of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, who will determine how long the battle will last.
In 1938 German officers were ready to launch a 'coup d'état' against Hitler, but only if the West had resisted and Checho-Slovakia had supported in Munich.
We failed and therefore missed an opportunity to avoid the years of bloodshed that followed.
The course of history revolves around such oblivion points and the irreverent march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are currently faced with various of these types of points.
What will we do if Trump dismisses Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who has the fate of the investigation of Mueller?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since the time when this magazine reported that he had, last year, suggested to take up talks with the president in secret and that he had speculated on the suitability of the president for his office.
Rosenstein says The Times's report is wrong.
“How will we react if the FBI’s newly requested investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or not fair, or if he is appointed to the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of assault and unfair testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the mid-term elections for a Congress that will call Trump to account?
If we fail in these tests, democracy waits for a very long winter.
But I think we won't fail because of the lesson I've learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador's residence.
She survived, immigrated to America and sent me away, 60 years later, to light candles for the Sabbath on that table on which a swastika was pictured.
With that as my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?

Graham Dorrans of Glasgow Rangers is optimistic about the race against Rapid Wien
Rangers receive Rapid Wien on Thursday and know that a victory over the Austrians, after the impressive match in Spain against Villareal earlier this month, places them in a strong position to qualify in Group G of the Europa League.
Due to a knee injury, the middle-fielder Graham Dorrans could not play his first match of the season until the 2-2 match at Villareal, but he believes that the Rangers can use that rash as a jumpboard to better results.
“It was a good point for us because Villareal really has a good 11th number,” said the 31-year-old.
“We entered the game with the idea that something was going to be won and the game came out with a point.
Maybe we could even have won at the end, but over the whole game seen, an equal game is probably an honest result.
They were probably better in the first half but when we came out in the second half we were the better team.
Next Thursday is a new great European evening.
Hopefully we can get three points but it's going to be a difficult game because they also had a good result in their last match, but if the public is behind us, I'm sure we can push through and we can get a positive result.
Last year has certainly been difficult, from everything that happened to my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a feedback factor on the club.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it, and the training is good.
Hopefully we can push through now, leave behind us the last season, and get successful again.
Women cannot sleep because of fear of retirement
Despite the fact that the participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they would like to receive care, few people discuss this with their relatives.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide investigation said they were talking to their spouses about the costs of long-term care.
And only 10% said they talked to their children about this.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t take the steps necessary to conduct this conversation,” said Holly Snyder, Vice President for Life Insurance at Nationwide.
Here we start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to care if you don’t make your wishes known in time.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how to receive care, as these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Take a financial advisor in the arm: Your counselor can also give you advice on how to pay these expenses.
Your long-term financing options, may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover these expenditures, or employ your own funds as insurance, as long as you have money.
Set up legal documents: Avoid legal struggle when insurance is to be used.
Make sure you have a health care proxy so that you can designate a trusted person who can oversee your medical care and ensure that the professionals comply with your wishes in case you can no longer communicate.
Consider also a proxy for your financial affairs.
In that case, you select a trusted person to make financial decisions on behalf of you and to make sure that the invoices are paid if you can no longer do so.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine your elderly father or mother encounters a medical emergency and is on their way to the hospital.
In that case, can you answer questions about medication and allergies?
Put these details in a written plan so that you have the information at hand.
“It’s not just the financial matters that matter, but who are the doctors - asked Martin.
‘What medicines are used?
Who cares for the dog?
Make sure that plan will come,
Multiple times shot with air pressure gun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air - pressure gun as he walked home after a night out.
The victim, forty plus, was in the Oxford Grove near Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was hit in his chest, abdomen and hand.
Agents described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a 'random act'.
The victim didn't see who attacked him.
His injuries are not life threatening, and the police have called witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, said officials, and the expectation is that the death toll will continue to rise.
As the means of communication have been eliminated, the official authorities have not yet received information from the Regentschaft Donggala, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the quake with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
Over 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after the disaster took place.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Celebes and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Celebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city fourths its 40th anniversary when the tsunami struck.
Donggala is a rainy town extending over 300 km along the coast of northwest Celebes.
In 2017, the Regents, an administrative region just below a province, had an estimated population of 299,200.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main activities in the economy of the province of Central Celebes, particularly in the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are mostly located in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have been regularly hit by tsunamis over the last hundred years according to the Indonesia Disaster Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami claimed more than 200 lives and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck in the west of Donggala in 1996, killing nine.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is often hit by earthquakes.
Here is a list of some of the most severe earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Atjeh on north Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries and claimed a total of 226,000 lives along the coasts of the Indian Ocean, more than half of it in Atjeh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes took place on the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake with a force of 6.8 on the Richter scale took place south of Java, the most densely populated island of Indonesia, and caused a tsunami that hit the south coast and claimed almost 700 lives.
2009: An earthquake with a force of 7.6 on the scale of Richter reached the city of Padang, capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people found death.
2010: An earthquake with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale hit one of the Mentawai Islands, off the coast of Sumatra, and caused a tsunami of more than 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and claimed around 300 lives.
2016: An shallow earthquake hit the Pidie Regent in Atjeh and caused destructions and panics, as the people were reminded of the destructions of the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time, there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people found death by crashing buildings.
2018: Several earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist country Lombok, where more than 500 people were killed, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be temporarily stranded.
Oldest son of Sarah Palin arrested on charge of domestic violence
Track Palin, Sarah Palin's eldest son, Alaska's former governor and vice president candidate, has been arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Palin, 29 from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfered with a report of domestic violence and offered opposition during the judgment, according to a report released on Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged rape, he took the phone off her.
Palin is held in custody in the house of conservation Mat-Su with a deposit of $500, reported KTUU.
He appeared to the judge on Saturday and declared himself \"innocent, certainly\" when he was asked to do so, the network reported.
Palin is charged with three violations of Class A, which means he can be sentenced to one year in prison and fined up to $250,000.
He is also charged with a class B violation, which is punishable with a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
It is not for the first time that Palin is charged with criminal offences.
In December 2017, he was accused of mistreating his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, then called the police to report the alleged abuse.
This case now serves the veteran court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of abuse in the domestic atmosphere, interference with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon under influence in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he had hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by a veteran group after she had linked her son's violent behavior to PTSS, which he would have held to his service in Iraq.
Indonesia, earthquake, tsunami: hundreds kill
At least 384 died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The earthquake with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale has led to a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been shut down while the expectation is that the death toll will rise in the next few days.
The earthquake took place just next to the centre of Celebes, which lies northeast of Jakarta, the Indonesian capital.
There are circulating videos on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami reached the coast.
Federal prosecutors claim a rare death penalty for suspect of a terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York demanded the death penalty for Sajfoello Sajpov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City, where eight people were killed, a rare punishment that had not been executed in this State since 1953.
According to the charges, Sajpov, 30, used a rented Home Depot truck to attack a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, killing pedestrians and cyclists who came on his way.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Sajpov has deliberately killed the eight victims and has committed serious bodily harms, according to the declaration of intent in which the death penalty is demanded, which has been submitted in the Southern District of New York.
For both charges, the death penalty is possible, in accordance with the document submitted to the court.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury has approved the prosecution with 22 charges, including eight charges of murder for a racket, typically a charge used by federal prosecutors against organized crime, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required 'substantial planning and preparation' according to the prosecutors and they described the way in which Sajpov carried out the attack as 'grey, cruel and corrupt'.
“Sajfoello Habiliboellajevich Sajpov has caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erliy, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco, is in the intention statement.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been more than ten years since a death sentence was required in the Southern District of New York.
The suspect, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers but was ultimately sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple executed after two years earlier convicted of espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were both executed by the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Sajpov, from Uzbekistan, did not show any resentment in the days and months following the attack, according to judicial documents.
He let the detectives know that he felt good about his act, the police.
Sajpov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the charges.
He also asked to hang the flag of ISIS in his room in the hospital, told the police.
He did not plead guilty of the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Sajpov, said he was \"naturally disappointed\" with the prosecutors' decision.
“We believe that the decision to require the death penalty instead of accepting a confession in exchange for a life imprisonment without the possibility of inequity will only prolong the trauma of these events for all concerned,” said Patton.
The defense of Sajpov had earlier asked the prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Conservative Member of Parliament says NIGEL FARAGE should lead the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised today to mobilize a 'people' army' during a protest at the Conservative Party Conference.
Ukip's former leader said that politicians should \"feel hot\" by Eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May's own parliamentarians suggested that he lead the negotiations with the EU.
The conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the participants on the march in Birmingham that the UK would already be out if Mr. Farage Brexit had been Minister.
But the challenge facing May in reconciling the highly divided ranks is underlined by two conservatives who are pro-Remain and who participate in a separate protest meeting against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister struggles to keep her Chequers compromise on the ride while being attacked by Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Fellows maintained that it will continue and will try to close a deal with Brussels despite the setbacks, thus forcing Eurosceptici and Labour to choose between their package and 'chaos'.
Bone said at a meeting of Leave Means Leave in Solihull he wants to throw 'Chequers in the messman'.
He proposed that Farage should be reimbursed and that responsibility should be given for the negotiations with Brussels.
“When he was serving, we would be out of it now, ” said Bone.
The member of parliament for Wellingborough added: “I will support Brexit, but we must throw Chequers into the messman.”
To clarify his opposition to the EU, he said: “We have not fought in two world wars to be inferior.
We want to make our own laws in our own country,
Bone pointed out that public opinion had changed since the 2016 referendum: “The idea that the British population has changed its opinion and wanted to remain in the EU is completely untrue,
Conservative Brexite Andrea Jenkyns also participated in the march and told reporters: “I’m just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition does not vote, it is unpopular within our party and with our activists going from door to door and making sure we are elected.
Drop Chequers and listen.
In a directed message for May, she added: “Premiers keep their jobs when they keep their promises,
Farage told the meeting that politicians should \"feel hot\" if they want to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
“This is a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them ‘we’re not gonna let you get away with this’”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to put fire on our political class, which is about to betray Brexit.
We mobilise the national army of this country that has brought us victory in the Brexit referendum and we will never rest until we have become an independent, sovereign, proud United Kingdom again,
In the meantime, Remainers marched through Birmingham and concluded this march with a meeting of two hours in the city centre.
A small group of activists swaaid with flags on which Tories Against Brexit stood, after the establishment of this group in the weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour High House, made jokes about the security problems of a party app of the Conservatives at the beginning of their conference.
\"These are the people who tell us that they can provide IT systems and all technology for Canada plus, for the driftless frontier, for free trade without borders in Ireland,\" he added.
It's a full farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, “he added to this.
Warren plans 'good thinking' about candidacy for presidency
Senator Elizabeth Warren says she'll \"think well about her candidate for the presidency\" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat told about her future at a meeting in a town hall in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent criticism of President Donald Trump, wants to be re-elected in November against Geoff Diehl, Republican Member who was co-chair of the Trom campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She has been the center of speculation that she might be fighting Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in a town hall since Trump came to power.
A present asked her if she would prefer the presidency.
Warren replied that it's time for women to go to Washington to restore our defective government and that includes a woman at the top,
Arrest after shooting Wayde Sims of LSU
The police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, told Saturday that a suspect was arrested after shooting Wayde Sims, basketball player from LSU on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at an ET press conference at 11:00.
They gave a video free of the shooting incident on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man who was seen in the movie.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near Southern University campus on Friday morning.
“Wayde Sims got a gunshot in his head and died of its consequences,” police officer Murphy J. Paul told the press on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde stepped forward to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson has been questioned and has been known to be present at the crime scene, in possession of a gun and shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson has been arrested without further incidents and is held in custody in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims was a 1.98 meter junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 matches and started in 10 matches last season. He had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per match.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is approaching world title after Sebastian Vettel let him win after team orders
When Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday it became clear that team orders from Mercedes would play a role in the race.
Bottas knew a good start from pole position and left Hamilton almost entirely in the cold when he defended his position and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel entered the pits and left Hamilton in the busy group's tail, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes entered the pits a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came on his head again after a wheel-on-wheel action, which forced the Ferrari rider to release with countersix spaces on the inside after a double movement in the third curve.
Max Verstappen started from the last place and was seventh after the first round on his 21st birthday.
Then he was a leader of the race for a long time, because he stayed with his choice of bands and worked on fast finish, so that he could pick up Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth place.
Eventually he went to the pits in the 44th round, after which he could not increase his speed in the remaining eight rounds, so that Raikkonen became fourth.
It's a difficult day because Valtteri did great his best all weekend. He was a real gentleman and left me by.
The team has done its best to place one and two, said Hamilton.
That wasn't a good body language.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein at a Saturday election meeting on the fact that she was not the source of Christine Blasey Ford's leaked letter, in which the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, was accused of assault.
Speaking at an election meeting in West Virginia, the President did not directly mention the testimony given by Ford to the Senate's Justice Committee. Instead, he revealed that what took place in the Senate showed that people could be 'common, unkind and untrue'\"
“The only thing that can happen and the beautiful show that takes place in the Senate in the last days, when you see the anger, when you are the people who are angry and mean and unkind and untrue,” he said.
\"When you look at the press releases and the leaks and then say 'oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.\"
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you leaked?
You remember her answer, you leaked the document, \"oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak.\"
Well, wait a minute.
No, we didn't lect, he added to this, in an imitation of the senator.
In July, the letter stating the charges to Kavanaugh's address was sent to Feinstein by Ford and was leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that her office was leaked.
“I didn’t keep Dr. Ford’s accusations hidden, I didn’t leak her story,” said Feinstein to the committee, according to The Hill.
“She asked me to go with it confidentially and I treated it confidentially, as she had asked,”
But the president did not believe her denial, and he commented at the meeting on Saturday night: “I’ll tell you something, that wasn’t a good body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen,
Further to his defense of the High Court candidate, who is accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the President suggested that the Democrats use the allegations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power, with all necessary means.
You see the communality, the unkindness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to drive to seize power and get back control, the president would have said, according to a Mediaite report.
Elite League: Dundee Stars against Belfast Giants: 5-3
Patrick Dwyer made two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars approved the loss of Friday in the Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning the return match with 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had two goals in leading Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier scores.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team along before Dwyer led the Giants again.
Francois Bouchard made the equalizer for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen with two goals assured the victory.
It was the third loss in the Elite League this season for the men of Adam Keefe, who had to settle a backseat on Friday night to defeat Dundee with 2-1 in Belfast.
It was the fourth time this season that the two teams met, with the Giants winning the previous three races.
The opening goal of Dwyer came in the fourth minute at 3:35 on an assistant from Kendall McFaull. David Rutherford gave the assistant with which Beauvillier doubled the lead, four minutes later.
In a busy opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt gave the lead for Cownie's equalizer at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that the Giants took the first break when he made his second goal of the evening at the end of the first period.
The home team resumed and Bouchard brought them back to an equal position with a power-play-goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran then combined well to help Nielsen run Dundee for the first time in the race, late in the second period. He ensured victory with the fifth goal for his team, halfway in the last period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of the last five matches, play at home against Milton Keynes in their next race on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies while ensuring that hundreds can escape the earthquake in an airplane
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is honored as a hero after he died because he made sure that a plane with hundreds of people on board could rise safely.
More than 800 people were killed and many were missing after a severe earthquake hit the island of Celebes on Friday; an earthquake that subsequently caused a tsunami.
Powerful aftershocks still plague the area and many are buried under the tip of the city of Palu.
Despite the fact that his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wild and moving traffic gates of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu Airport.
He continued to ensure that Flight 6321 from Batik Air, which was at the time ready on the runway, could rise safely.
Then he jumped out of the traffic tower when he thought it was crashing.
He died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said that his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reported ABC News from Australia.
We had a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“It breaks your heart when you hear it, ” he added.
In the meantime, the authorities feared that the death toll could rise to a thousand and informed the country’s disaster agency that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“People assume that the death rate is still rising because many bodies are under the rubble and have not yet reached it,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves reaching a height of six meters have destroyed Palu, where Sunday's mass funeral ceremony will be held.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute bodies are brought in by ambulances.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-arms are looted everywhere,
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said: “The Indonesian Red Cross is engaged in a race to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find.
This is a tragedy already, but it can get much worse,
President Joko Widodo of Indonesia arrived in Palu on Sunday and he said to the military present: “I appeal to all of you to work day and night so that all tasks necessary for evacuation are completed.
Are you ready for it, CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok, where more than 550 people lived.
Flight crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says one man is missing after a crash in the lagoon
The airline that carried out the flight crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says that one more man is missing after having previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew members had safely left the sank plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that one male passenger is missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said they worked with local authorities, hospitals and detectives to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to the questions for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew, after the plane was hit by water during landing at the Chuuk Islands airport.
The authorities announced on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday and that everyone's condition was stable.
What caused the crash and what the exact order of events is still unclear for the time being.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both say that the plane has landed in the lagoon and missed the landing track.
Some witnesses believe that the plane was fired across the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane was approaching the airport very low.
“That’s good news,” said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he himself and some others succeeded in wading through the water that came to their mouths to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also said that the stewardesses were panicking and shouting and that he had a non serious head injury.
The U.S. Navy announced that seafarers who were working nearby on a yard also helped in the rescue work by bringing people to the coast by means of an inflatable boat before the plane continued to sink in about 30 metres of deep water.
Aviation Safety Network data show that in the last 20 years 111 people have been killed in crashes of air carriers registered with PNG, but none of them relate to Air Niugini.
Analist sets the timeline of the night on which a woman is burned alive
The prosecutor closed his requisite on Friday in the reopening trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, analyst of the U.S. Department of Justice, gave a few hours of testimony as a witness expert in information analysis.
He made clear to the jury how he had used cell phone call records to capture the movements of the 29-year-old suspect, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, in the night she let her live.
Rowlett told us that he had received the location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was at Chambers on the night of her death, which contradicted his previous claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the records showed that his mobile phone was at Chambers during the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford again.
Sanford was in the witness bank on Saturday and told him he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis spoke the truth when he told him he was at Sanford in his truck during that night, Sanford said he was \"lying because my truck was then in Nashville.\"
Another inconsistencies was that Tellis had told him that he knew Chambers about two weeks after she died.
The mobile phone records indicated that they only knew each other for one week.
Rowlett said Tellis knew the text, calls and contact details of Chambers' phone some time after the death of Chambers.
“He knew her from his life, ” said Hale.
The defense begins on Sunday with the slot arguments.
The judge said he expected the jury to start the deliberations later that day.
The High Width: What is 'conscious hip hop'?
A hiphoptrio wants to discuss the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol states that hip hop is alienated from the origin with political opinions and the signs of social problems.
They want to return to the roots and make 'conscious hip hop' popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently experienced a revival in Britain by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.

A New York child girl is challenging a couple for the judge because of a 'racist' text
A New York-based child girl challenges a couple to the judge for dismissal for discriminatory reasons, after receiving a wrongly sent text in which the mother complained about 'a black man like that'.
The couple deny being a racist and call the trial 'depressing'.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, showed her abduction when she discovered that the new baby girl, Giselle Maurice, turned out to be a negroid woman when she met her on her first working day in 2016.
'NEEEEE WERE TO'N SWARTE', Lynsey wrote Plasco-Flaxman in a message to her husband.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it to Mrs Maurice twice.
According to the American newspaper New York Post, when she realized her blunder, the \"uncomfortably\" Plasco-Flaxman was disillusioned, Mrs Maurice said that her former childess, who was African-American, had done bad work, and that she had therefore expected a Filipino.
Ms. Maurice was paid for a working day and was then sent home with a taxi.
Now Maurice challenges the couple for the dish to receive a compensation of $350,-- per day for the 6 months for which she was hired to bivage internally with the family, though without contract.
'I want them to feel that you just don't do something like this,' said Maurice last Friday in the New York Post, adding, 'I know it's discrimination.'
The couple were concerned about the claim that she was a racist by saying that it was reasonable to dismiss Maurice after, by insulting her, they feared that they could no longer trust her.
\"My wife sent her a message that she didn't want to send her.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists,' said husband Joel Plasco to the New York Post.
'But would you leave your children to someone who insulted you, even if it was by accident?
Your newborn baby?
Don't worry about it.\"
Compare the case with 'depressing', Plasco said his wife expected a baby in two months and 'was in a very difficult situation'.
\"Are you going to persecute someone like that?
That's not so sympathetic,' the investment banker added.
While the trial is still under way, public opinion is quick to capitalize on social media, where it is raised for behavior and reasoning.
Paddington's publishers feared that the public would not have much interest in a talking bear, revealed newly revealed letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the approval of the book, said of the letter: 'It is difficult to get into the shoes of someone who first reads it, even before the first publication.
With what we now know about Paddington's huge success, it's very enjoyable.\"
She told her father who, before he was inspired to write the children's book about a small toy bear, as a cameraman worked at the British station BBC, was optimistic about whether his book would be rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book 'bitter sweet' felt after his death last year.
Regarding Paddington, whom she describes as 'a very prominent member of the family', she told me that her father was secretly proud of the ultimate success.
She said, \"He was a quiet, humble man.\"
'But since Paddington was so lively for him, it almost looked like a child's performance; you're proud while you haven't done anything for it yourself.
I think he was experiencing Paddington's success.
Although Paddington was the creation of his own imagination, he himself honored the bear for its success.\"
My daughter was dying and I had to tell her on the phone.
Immediately after landing her daughter was taken to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors tried to save her life in vain.
'Nad had called several times to say that it looked very bad and that it was expected that she would not make it,' said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
'Then Nad's call came to say she would die in two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, \"Tashi, I love you so much.
We'll be together soon.
I'll be with you again.
The drugs that the doctors gave her to keep her heart pumping slowly worked out and left her body.
She had died some time before, and this process eliminated everything.
I could only sit there knowing what was going on.
I couldn't feel sorry, scream or cry, because I was in the middle of all sorts of people and families.
I really had to grow up.\"
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, who was now grieving about her daughter's death, stepped into the plane with the other passengers, who had no idea what trial she had to go through.
\"No one knew,\" she said.
\"I sat down with my head, and the tears kept coming.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I got an overwhelming feeling of compassion for Nad.
I felt he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.\"
Routing women paste messages on bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who have been lost by suicide are strong enough to hold others back from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place inspiring messages and phone numbers that can call people in need for help on a bridge in Wales
Mrs. Davis's son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he first became depressed and he committed suicide at the age of 18.
\"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day,\" she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45 years old and living in Lydney in the English county Gloucestershire, tells us that her son was a promising chef with a stingy grin.
\"He was known for his smile.
It was always said that his smile illuminated every room.'
Yet he already stopped working for his death because he was deep in the well.\"
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old, found him having robbed himself of life.
Mrs. Davis said, \"I am constantly worried about a chain reaction.\"
Mrs. Davis made the cards; 'to let people know that there are others you can go to and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't keep silent - talk about it.\"
Mrs Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs Davies for years, lost Mark who was her partner for 15 years, not long after his mother died.
\"He didn't say he was feeling sad or depressed or something,\" she said.
\"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was all on the ground on First Christmas Day - when the children took out their presents he didn't look at them at all.'
She said his death was a great trauma for them, but they have to deal with it: 'It divides the whole family.
It drives us apart.
But we must all continue and continue to fight.\"

Brett Kavanaugh's future uncertain while FBI research starts
'I thought that if we could indeed get what he asks for, a research limited in time and scope, we might be able to create a bit more unity', said Mr Flake last Saturday, to which he added, that he feared that the committee was falling apart, in the midst of a firmly anchored arrangement within the party.
Why didn't Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to launch an investigation?
Their restraint has everything to do with timing.
The interim elections have been in five weeks, on 6 November and, as expected, the Republicans are doing badly, their attempts to get their husbands elected in the highest court in the country are seriously complicated.
George W. Bush has already called with members of the U.S. Senate to lobby for Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, and thus got to know his wife, Ashley, who was the Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI has finished the report?
Then there is a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can count on at least 50 votes in the Senate, and that would allow Mike Pence, Vice-President, to issue the determining vote to confirm Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court.
Number of overruns in North Korea 'overlay' under Kim
According to a South Korean legislator, the number of North Korean overruns to South Korea has dropped since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, quoted from data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, explains that there were 1,127 survivors last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park notes that stricter border controls between North Korea and China, and higher penalties for people smugglers, are the main factors for the decline.
Pyongyang has not responded publicly.
The vast majority of North Korea's survivors are eventually offered the South Korean nationality.
According to sources in Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of the flights through China, which have the longest external border with North Korea and where you can make it easier to cross than in the heavily secured demilitarized zone (DMZ; Demilitarized Zone) between the two Koreas.
China considers the survivors to be more illegal migrants than refugees and often resorts to violence.
Relations between North and South, which are formally still in war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries had a meeting in Pyongyang, mainly talking about the stagnant negotiations on denuclearisation.
This meeting took place after the historic meeting between the President of the USA, Donald Trump, and Kim Jong-un, in Singapore in June, where they agreed in large lines to work towards nuclear dismantling of the Korean peninsula
On Saturday, however, the North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the US of lack of progress in lifting US sanctions since then.
'Without faith in the actions of the US, confidence in our national security is also lacking, and under these circumstances there is no first step of unilateral disarmament', said Mr Ri during a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical', and finds him incapable of serving in the Supreme Court
President of the House of Deputies, Nancy Pelosi, appointed candidate judge for the U.S. Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical', finds him incapable of serving in the Supreme Court
Pelosi made the comments in an interview, Saturday at the 'Texas Tribune Festival' in Austin, Texas.
'I couldn't help thinking that if a woman behaved like this, they would call her hysterical', Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Committee on Justice on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied the accusations that he would have sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech Kavanaugh was very emotional; he sometimes cried and was especially upset when he told about his family and his high school time.
He also strongly condemned the democrats in the committee, calling the accusations against him 'great and coordinated character murder', organised by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi explained that she found Kavanaughs to prove that he was not fit to serve the Supreme Court because he was full of prejudices against the Democrats.
\"I think he's disqualified himself with his statements and by the way he talks about the Clintons and the Democrats,\" Pelosi says.
Pelosi protested when she was asked if she would try to initiate an impeachment procedure against Kavanaugh if he were appointed, and the Democrats would get the majority in the House of Deputies.
'I can say this about it; if he doesn't tell the truth in Congress, or against the FBI, then he's not only unfit for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where he serves now,' Pelosi explained.
Kavanaugh is currently judge at the Court of Justice of the District of Columbia (usually abbreviated D.C.) District Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a democrat, she was concerned that Kavanaugh would go against the 'Affordable Care Act or Roe v Wade' (law for affordable health care) because Kavanaugh is known as a conservative judge.
Kavanaugh raised questions about the revision of certain decisions of the Supreme Court during the confirmation hearings.
'Don't expect us to be standing in jurisprudence if a hysterical, prejudiced person is now appointed to the Supreme Court,' says Pelosi.
Women should just admit to this.
It is a just tirade of months and years of abject anger that overflows, and she can only cry to get it out.
\"We're going to cry when we get angry,\" said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later to me.
\"I don't think that's weird, do you?\"
She continued: 'I was greatly helped by a woman who was in charge of something and who told me that she too would cry when she got angry. She developed a method by which she would cry whenever she got angry. To the one she talked to, she said, 'You may think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry.\"
And then she just cried.
I just thought that was brilliant.'
Tears are partly permitted as expressions of anger, because crying is essentially unintelligible.
One of my best remaining memories from an earlier job, in a men-dominated office, is when I had to cry terrible because I was very angry. An older woman, a cold company leader who was a little scared of everyone, caught me in my neck and dragged me into a stairs house.
\"Don't let them know you're crying,\" she said to me.
\"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they're glad they got you in the closet.
Patricia Schroeder, a member of the Congress in Colorado for the Democrats, had worked for Gary Hart on his presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was engaged in an extramarital affair on board a boat called 'Monkey Business' (informally means 'cat-quake' or 'apes') and withdrew from the race, the deeply disappointed Mrs. Schroeder felt that there was no reason why she would not apply.
\"It wasn't a well-thought-out decision,\" she told me laughing 30 years later.
\"There were seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone was talking about \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarves.\"
Because the campaign was already advanced, she was left with fund recruitment, so she vowed not to participate if she couldn't raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who would give men $1,000, wanted to give her only $250.
\"Do they think I get a discount?\" she asked herself.
When she gave her speech in which she announced that she would not start a formal campaign, she became so overwhelmed by feelings of gratitude for the people who supported her, of frustration because the system made it so difficult to collect money, and to reach voters instead of delegates, and of anger over sexism, that she got into it.
'Men will have thought that I had a nerve break,' Mrs. Schroeder recalled how the media responded to her.
\"They'll have thought Kleenex was my company sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will they put on my gravestone?
“She cried?”
How the U.S. and China can take advantage of the trade war for Beijing
The openings of the trade war between the USA and China were overspending, and although the struggle has not been fought for a long time, a gap between the two countries would, according to experts, be beneficial for Beijing.
Donald Trump, U.S. President, gave the first warning earlier this year by raising taxes on important Chinese export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation this week became known when new effective, increased tax rates were revealed for 200 billion dollars (EUR150 billion) of goods; half of all goods coming from China to the US.
Beijing has taken reprisals each time in natura, most recently by increasing rates from 5 to 10% for 60 billion dollars of American goods.
China has pledged to equalize the US every time, and the world on a near-largest economy will probably not snap quickly with its eyes.
In order to make Washington bow, requests must be accepted, but publicly bowing to the US is far too painful for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts claim that if Beijing plays the smart, the trade war with the US could positively support China in the longer term, by decreasing the mutual dependence on the two economies.
'The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would allow one of the two countries to enter an economic free trap is actually much more dangerous than spectators have previously recognized', says Abigail Grace, a research assistant of the Center for a New American Security, a think tank specialized in national security issues focusing on Asia.
Syria 'clear' to make refugees return, said Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country that has been devastated by a war that has lasted more than seven years.
During his speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem stated that the conditions in his country were improving.
'Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism' he says.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas that have been ravaged by terrorists and to normalize the situation on the ground.
All the circumstances are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they have had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that threatened their daily lives and lives.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled their country since the war began in 2011.
It is estimated that about six million people still live in the country, who need humanitarian aid.
Al-Mualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome aid in restoring the devastated land.
However, he stressed that Syria would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that had subsidised the rebellion.
Europe wins the 'Ryder Cup' in Paris
The European team won the '2018 Ryder Cup' by defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 on the golf course 'Le Golf National' southwest of Paris in France.
The US has lost six consecutive times on European soil, and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the title when the Danish commander Thomas Bjorn's team won the necessary number of 14.5 points to defeat the US.
The American team's star, Phil Mickelson, was struggling almost the entire tournament, allowed his long blow from the tea to end in the water at par 3, hole 16, and admitted his loss of Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer, Molinari, excelled in all his laps and became one of the four players who ever scored 3-0-0 since the tournament in its current form began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was thrown out by playing the lowest score of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, with 5 holes down and 4 holes.
The highest-class player on the world ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 holes down and 1 hole to play Ian Poulter from Great Britain, who may have played his last match in the Ryder Cup.
The Spaniard Segrio Garcia, veteran with eight Ryder Cups, became the best European player of all tournaments once with 25.5 points in his career.
\"I don't cry so soon, but today I can't do anything about it.
It's been a rough year.
I am so grateful to Thomas that he selected me and believed in me.
I'm so glad we got the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad to be able to help,\" said an emotionalist Garcia after European victory.
He passes the torch on to his landlord, John Ram, who beat the American legend Tiger Woods with 2 holes down and 1 hole in the game for singles on Sunday.
\"The enormous pride I feel because I beat Tiger Woods. I followed that guy every time I grew up,\" says the 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic of one of the biggest players ever; winner of 14 major championships, second only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American team fought the weekend to find the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played at high level throughout the tournament.
The U.S. commander, Jim Furyk, said after the disappointing performance of his team, \"I'm proud of these guys, they've fought.
In a short time this morning, we have made Europe a little more difficult.
We faced opposition.
All respect for Thomas.
He's a great commander.
All 12 players in his team played very well.
We're going to regroup. I'm going to work with the American PGA (Professional Golfers' Association) and our Ryder Cup Committee and we're looking ahead.
I love these 12 boys, and I'm proud to be their commander.
You need to take off your hat for the opponent.
We're overplayed.\"
Red glow update: Concentrations decrease in the provinces of Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota

According to the committee, fragmentary growth of the Red glow in the provinces of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier is reported, which could indicate a decrease in concentrations.
The Red glow extends over an average of 200 km of coastline, from northern Pinellas to southern Lee counties.
There are about 16 km off the coast of Hillsborough County spots, but in less places than last week.
Red glow has also been seen in Pasco County.
Medium concentrations have been reported off the coast of Pinellas County last week, low to high concentrations off the coast of Hillsborough County, background to high concentrations in Manatee County, background to high concentrations at or off the coast of Sarasota County, background to high concentrations in Charlotte County, background to high concentrations at or off the coast of Lee County, and low concentrations in Collier County.
It is reported on the irritation of the airways in the provinces of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier.
