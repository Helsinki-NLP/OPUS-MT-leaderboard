Obama receives Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not just friendly.
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and about Tehran's destabilizing measures in the Middle East.
However, the meeting should also address the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two-state solution.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense for years.
Washington criticizes the ongoing settlement construction of Israel and proposes Netanyahu's lack of will in the peace process.
Due to Obama's proposed deal about the Iranian nuclear program, the relationship between the two continued to deteriorate.
In March, at the invitation of the Republicans to the U.S. Congress, Netanyahu had given a controversial speech, which was partially rated as an affront to Obama.
The speech was not agreed with Obama, who had rejected a meeting with reference to the election ahead in Israel at the time.
In an emergency call, Professor says to have shot his girlfriend
In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb told the police with a bit of a voice that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house.
Lamb was important to emphasize that his \"sweet dog\" was still alive and probably excited, and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone.
Inside the house, the officials found Amy Prentiss' body and a handwritten note that had been criticized for a white block: “I’m so sorry, I wanted to make it go back, I loved Amy and she’s the only woman who ever loved me - this was according to the authorities in the letter, and he was signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught in two online courses at Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds, where, according to police, he shot and killed a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office.
Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford said that university employees heard shooting at 10:18.
He said that Lamb made the penitent emergency call sometime after that.
By the end of the day there was another death: Lamb took his life when the police tied him in.
A day after shooting at the university, which forced students and lecturers to hide behind closed doors, the authorities still try to get a picture of what motivated Lamb.
The details published by the investigators at both ends of the state, as well as what students and employees who knew him, helped draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher.
Students said they were looking forward to his teaching.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or a criminal history.
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him, in which he mentioned the “wonderful people ” with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, whose teaching body comprises 17 members, and many students attended courses of both.
At the same time, there were some tendencies to problematic behavior.
A student, Brandon Beavers, who praised the Lamb, said that he also seemed a little excited and nervous, as if something was wrong with him.
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University to leave for health reasons, saying that he had any health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
The latest changes in the university's employment policy meant that the promotion, for which Lamb had worked so hard, would not guarantee him an automatic way to an appointment as an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said that he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but “of course there was something in Mr Lamb’s presentation.”
These are questions that Lamb can no longer answer.
After the flight from campus, the police later found Lambs Spur when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38 caliber gun in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parents' house on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson said.
His car was still in the entrance.
It wasn't immediately clear why lamb went to this house, but Johnson said she believed he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb began his work at the University in 2009, which has 3,500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedagogy.
He promoted in early spring in pedagogy.
One of her longtime friends, Lambs, described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and lamb was 20, when they met with friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her the guitar game for several years.
He was the woman's swarm at the time.
All the girls melted there when he was there - said Hairston, now 40 and living in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously together for some time.
In the emergency call Lamb said, \"I killed my wife, but there was no certificate of marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in the brick house adjacent to a Bayou in Gautier.
The police said the dog was okay.
The ex-husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said they were divorced 15 years ago, but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old.
“She was totally destroyed on the ground,” said O’Steen about his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both appeared on a summer-year market three years ago.
Later they played one or another gig together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked online for various companies.
Mike Shaffer, a barkeeper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a poorly lit bar near Gautier, said that he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night last night September 5th, after Lamb had finished his guitar and mouth harmonica game before a sparse audience.
There was no sign that anything was wrong.
“Just a happy couple, ” he said.
We were cleaning up and tearing together.
I mean, they both had a good sense of scissors.
Schmidt, the dead professor, led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American native and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three little children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his brotherhood and student committee.
On Tuesday evening at Delta State Campus in Cleveland, about 900 people, including lecturers, staff, students and members of the community, attended a candlelight memorial celebration.
Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the Mahnwache, during which the University Choir \"Bright Morning Star\" and \"Amazing Grace\" sang.
The lesson will be resumed on Wednesday.
“We’re trying to move our students to return,” LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press Authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story was corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt, and that lamb in his emergency call described Prentiss as his wife, but there is no indication that the two have ever married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for Christmas
Toys R Us says that it will not set as many Christmas season employees as last year, but the toys and baby products dealer says that he will give the employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company said that it plans to employ 40,000 people in shops and sales centers throughout the country. 45,000 workers were hired during the Christmas season 2014.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said that this month it will start application talks and the number of employees will rise from October to December.
While the holidays themselves are still months away, the Christmas business is getting closer, and companies are preparing to set up time workers to provide stores with employees who sell, ship, and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his \"Date\" with Princess Diana
The premiere of \"Back to the Future\" was a great moment for Michael J. Fox.
She was also remarkable for personal reasons.
“We were sitting in the theater waiting for the Royals, and I noticed that the seat next to me is empty, and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me - he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary “Back in Time”
The film starts, and it comes to my mind that I am a simulated gahn and an arm length away from being with the Princess of Wales at a date.
“Back in Time - a documentary about “Back to the Future” presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
\"Back for the Future\" had its premiere 30 years ago.
“It’s really for me,” said Spielberg, “undisputed to be the biggest time travel movie ever filmed.
“Back in Time” will be shown on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
UN Chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon says that his response to Russia's increased military support for Syria is: \"There is no military solution - the conflict that lasts for almost five years, and more weapons will only worsen violence and misery for millions of people.
The UN leader once again calls on all parties, including the shared UN Security Council, to unite and support integrative negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said to a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA, Russia, China, Great Britain and France - at the edge of the General Assembly’s ministerial meeting in order to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and regional powers make this situation unsolvable.
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity they had demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran when dealing with the crisis in Syria.
8 Survey values showing that Donald Trump is serious to take.
Some have tried to brand him as a flop.
Others took him off as a joke.
And some are waiting for a collapse.
But no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump from the upper ranks when polling down, it didn't (yet) work.
Ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Trump leading in the two-digit field, and some are beginning to seriously wonder what it means for the chances of nominating the real estate mogul.
Of course, it is too early in the election period.
No one claims that Trump will probably win the Republican nomination.
Experts stressed that in 2011 Rick Perry's leadership was given to the rising Herman Cain, none of whom won only one state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election.
But outsider groups such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognize Trump's perseverance and start to let their dollar flow to overthrow him.
Here are some current survey values that indicate that the real estate mogul is not just a temporary phase:
Trump's popularity has turned 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidate in mid-June, a survey by the Monmouth University showed that only two out of ten Republicans saw the real estate mogul positively.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August it was 52 percent.
Now six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
And these numbers hold in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as candidates.
In a survey conducted by CNN/ORC last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either \"satisfied\" or \"satisfied\" if Trump was nominated.
Only two out of 10 say they would be \"earned\" if he were the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates about the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say that they would be \"invigorated\" vs. 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
The next thing in enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say that they would be \"unsatisfied\" or \"resentful\" if Jeb Bush, the favourite of the establishment, would be the candidate.
A majority of Republicans do not see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and insulting statements, 52 percent of Irish voters who are inclined to the Republicans believe that the real estate mogul has the right temperament for a president, according to ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
The same number applies in the nation's first pre-election state, Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think that he has the personality for a Supreme Commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Yet 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively carry out his office, and almost six out of 10 independents say that his temperament does not fit into the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When they set up their scholars' guardians, Republican voters consider Trump to be real.
If they are asked who wins the GOP nomination the most, say after a survey by CNN/ORC from the past week four out of ten that Trump is the best bet.
This is a change since the time four out of ten put their money on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Complete disclosure: GOP voters did not have the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At this point in the last cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry would win the nomination against only 28% for the final candidate Mitt Romney.
Nevertheless, a variety of GOP voters view Trump's campaign as plausible.
Even if the Republicans gathered around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the split field probably contributes to Trump's leadership, while anti-trump support is diffused to more than a dozen other candidates.
But a survey by the Monmouth University in early September shows that in a hypothetical head-on race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump reaps majority support.
He has 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina, before Marco Rubio 14 points, before Walker 15 points, before Jeb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points.
It's a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to beat him?
Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race.
A scarce majority of Donald-Trump fans say they have formed their opinion.
A new CBS/NYT survey on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters who support Trump say they have given their votes firmly.
Of course, a lot can happen to change this, and no one can really say never to change the opinion.
46 percent said they left the door open to switch to other candidates.
However, Trump's strongest competition is at the moment of the other outsiders, the neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they have formed their opinion are twice as common for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump in his campaign speech two months ago, immigrants from Mexico called rapist, the immigration was a turning point in the public discourse of 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's bombastic expression will keep hispano-Americans away from the Republican Party and will damage the reorientation efforts.
But after the new ABC/Post Survey of Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump seems to be doing it.
Frustration over government climbs to new highs.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now have about half of the support for Republican voters, especially their exterior status.
Six out of 10 Republicans say in ABC/Post's new Monday survey, they want to be a political outsider rather than someone with government experience.
And they're also angry at Washington.
A survey by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans were frustrated by the Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent \"unsatisfied\" and 21 percent \"hellically angry\"
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
Here in the Hobookenweg is the most expensive residential complex - overlooking the North Seawatt.
On the road, a square meter of a Reetdachhaus costs 73,300 euros on average.
\"On Sylt, the offer of objects is naturally limited, according to the study - therefore, the high price.
A new study shows in which special locations cost a square meter the most.
Of course, 18.70 Euros per square metre for a student building in Munich are not really few.
However, unlike Germany's top housing places, one of the prizes is like Peanuts.
The real estate service provider Engel & Völkers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meter prices in dwindling altitudes.
There are several tens of thousands of euros - per square meter, well-marked.
But well, who can afford it...
By the way: Munich is not at the top here.
Champions League: Bayern Dream Start Thanks to Müller and Götze
Twofold gate protector in Piraeus: Bayern-Star Thomas Müller simply has a run.
A happy hit by Thomas Müller paved the way for FC Bayern to win a 3:0 at Olympiakos Piraeus - then it ran.
A sovereign start of the Champions League season.
The World Champions Thomas Müller and Mario Götze have given the FC Bayern a dream start to the “Mission Milan” in Piraeus in the witch boiler.
The team of coach Pep Guardiola won their first match in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympiakos in hot atmosphere thanks to Müller's double pack (52./90.+2) and Götz's hit (89.) earned at 3:0 (0:0).
The 12th success in series will be the first step towards finale on 28 May 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola finally wants to get the Henkelpott to Munich in the third run.
At his 28th meeting in the Champions League, Müller received generous assistance from Olympiakos-Torwart Roberto, who had a shot of the World Champion as a flank.
“We won’t underestimate it,” said Bayern captain Philipp Lahm before the game at the Karaiskakis Stadium before 31,688 hot-blooded fans - and the Munichers held word.
They showed a focused and committed performance without gleaming.
Piraeus had won his most recent six home games in the royal class, including against famous clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid or Juventus Turin.
==References====External links==*Official website
But the Bavaria, in seven Europe Cup duels with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They bravely ran to work in their offensive efforts, but often to no avail.
The attacks were often launched by the move to the left of Douglas Costa, who rarely came through against the former Braunschweiger Omar Elabdellaoui.
Müller was more lucky from the right than his flank from the right half field in the upper left torque.
In the 67th minute the World Champion gave the possible 2:0.
The best occasions in half one had Robert Lewandowski.
First, when Olympics stormed Ideye Brown, Poland's headball hit the line (26).
Then by direct acceptance, the goalwart Roberto paired with the knee (35.).
Although the Bayerns used to raise their dominant game, Pireus was able to put down needles.
But to the gatekeeper Manuel Neuer was abandoned.
For example, when he was turning a shot of Ideye over the Latte (56).
Before Newer Guardiola had a four chain with David Alaba in the center next to Jerome Boateng defending it.
Mario Götze, after muscular problems back in the frame, first sat outside.
The World Cup hero only gave green light after graduation training, said sports chief Matthias Sammer at “Sky”: “He who wants to make something else out of it, that’s bad already,
When he first moved, Guardiola decided against him when he brought Kingsley Coman for the attacked Lewandowski (59).
Götze came late for Arturo Vidal (76.) and made it clear 13 minutes later, by an elf-meter, Müller put another one on it.
Before the game it had come to Krawallen in the stadium.
After a small group of partially mummified Bayern fans in their spectator block had apparently provoked the followers of host Pireus with words and gestures, the security forces intervened and attacked the Munich followers with batons.
At least a Bayern fan was transported out of the stadium.
Who smokes has a higher risk of losing teeth
Anyone smoking does not only damage the lungs, but also the teeth - this suggests a Potsdam long-term study.
The good news: If you leave, the risk decreases quickly.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is reflected in the long-term study of an international team of researchers, including several members of the German Institute for Nutrition Research (DifE) in Potsdam.
In comparison to nonsmokers, smoking was the risk of premature loss of their teeth in order to increase the 2.5 to 3.6 factor.
The scientists had observed more than 23,300 participants.
The main causes of tooth failure are caries and inflammations of the gum, emphasised the DIfE.
For this parodontitis smoking is a risk factor, the authors stress.
The relationship between smoking and tooth loss is therefore related to more frequent inflammation of gums in smokers.
It is not clear how smoking increases the risk of caries.
However, people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk within a short period of time, writes researchers in the Journal of Dental Research.
However, it could take more than ten years for the danger to fall back to the level of non-smokers, said first author Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham.
One had to convince people to become non-smoking, said study director Heiner Boeing of the DIfE: \"Smoking reduces the life span\"
Not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and, according to our findings, also leads to good dental health to old age.
In Germany, more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 are affected by toothlessness, said the DIfE.
Previous studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth failure.
The new long-term study supports the findings.
Archaeologists came across the remains of Cologne's Rhineufer from later times
For a number of times, archaeological finds have been made at the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne.
Near the construction site for the new Rhine Boulevard, archaeologists from the Roman-Germanic Museum have excavated skeletons and remains of historical buildings, said Museum Manager Marcus Trier on Tuesday.
Since the beginning of construction work on the Rhine, historians have been looking for so-called ground monuments.
The museum is always added to all construction projects in the district of Cologne as a specialist in archaeological monument care.
In the third section of the Rhine Boulevard, the archaeologists were now found.
From text documents it was already known that in the 4th century, a fortress and in the 8th century, a church, had been established, explained Trier.
In addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with about 350 tombs was discovered, probably belonging to the church.
Young woman covered by freight train
After a young woman at the train station in Geilenkirchen-Lindern has failed, the federal police ask the population for assistance.
On the early Wednesday morning at 1.40 p.m., the woman crossed the track from the station building coming at the end of the railway station and was captured by a freight train that came from towards Mönchengladbach.
According to the Federal Police, by recording the train, she suffered the most serious injuries.
She was treated on-site for emergency treatment and taken to a hospital by rescue personnel.
There is no evidence to be found on the reason for the young woman's nocturnal crossing of the track.
The incident may have been observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic perceptions.
Inquiries come residents or passersby of Linderner Bahn, Ziegelbäckerweg, Thomashofstraße and Leiffarther Straße (L364).
Information given about the cause of the accident can be given under 24 hours and free hotline of the federal police under telephone 0800/688000 or any other police station.
EU Commission proposes in dispute over TTIP new court
The EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system in order to speed up the dispute over the proposed Transatlantic Free Trade Agreement TTIP.
Therefore, the controversial private dispute resolution institutions for disputes between corporations and states are to be replaced by a more transparent system, which in its operation corresponds to significantly more traditional courts.
“We want to set up a system that the citizens trust,” said EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström in her opinion.
Sweden has proposed to bring the proposal into free trade negotiations with the US as a European negotiating position.
The German government announced support.
TTIP aims to create the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people.
The plans for reforming the current arbitration procedures specifically provide that the EU States and the USA jointly elect independent judges for a new investment court.
They are to come from the EU, the United States and third countries in the same way.
This is also a second instance for the first time.
It would allow them to object to judgments.
Until now, the parties had agreed among themselves on arbitrators and there was no opposition to their judgments.
In the discussion over the past few months, it became clear that citizens did not trust the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice, Malmström commented.
In the long term, it intends to work on an International Investment Court according to its own information.
There, for example, disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could also be resolved.
The investor state dispute proceedings (ISDS) mainly required by large corporations are considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP.
The traditional arbitration courts are criticized by opponents as a kind of parallel justice, over which companies can charge damages to taxpayers, impose national laws, or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards.
In the first opinions, anti-TTIP organisations such as Campact described the proposals of the EU Commission as inadequate.
It was criticized, in particular, that they should not apply to the already negotiated Free Trade Agreement with Canada (Ceta).
However, the German Secretary of State Matthias Machnig (SPD) described the plans as a major advance.
The Commission took into account essential elements of the reform that Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel had developed in spring with other EU trade ministers.
The old system of private arbitrators was off the table.
The French government also welcomed Malmström's plans.
The European BusinessEurope Association warned against restricting the appeal possibilities of the economy through too many new rules.
Especially small and medium-sized enterprises could be affected by this, it was said.
When the talks about the TTIP Free Trade Agreement (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) can be concluded, it remained unclear on Wednesday.
The negotiations have been under way since mid-2013.
However, the subject of investor protection has not been discussed with the USA so far.
A framework for the agreement should initially be at the end of this year.
This date is no longer valid.
Delicate folk of Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
Eleven years ago, Sufjan Stevens sits on stage at the Cologne Prime Club (now Luxor).
Next to him is a flipchart, on which the shy folk singer recorded the picturesque U.S. state of Michigan with felt pen.
The whole audience, about 40 people, is almost caught by Steven's lecture.
He tells about his minor and delicately arranged songs, which he records on the map again and again.
Where they came from and what it looks like there, in his home country.
Stevens has since proved to be a wonderful creative mistake.
With the 2003 album \"Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State\", cleverly composed songs appear, which are harmoniously close to American folks of the late 1960s, but can drift into the great opulent at any time.
The rumor arises that \"Michigan\" would be the first part of a moving series: each of the 50 states of the United States should be sung as a result.
However, as early as 2004 and near Rhine, Seven Swans has already appeared and has positively broken certain expectations.
==References====External links==
Live enough for him guitar and banjo.
One year later, the musician living in New York returned to the series.
With \"Illinois\"-Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinoise-, a comprehensively celebrated masterpiece will appear in 2005.
Overboard on ideas and stylistic finesse.
The album is part of the American billboard charts and does not lack an annual list of influential music media.
After very productive experiments, Stevens then uses \"The Age of Adz\" (2010) very extensive electronic offsets.
This sixth regular studio album is still widely orchestrated, but carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and hall.
As long as the smaller clubs escaped, the stage shows here will become a colorful spectacle of neon styrene bands and large fluorescent stagedeco.
Sufjan Stevens is currently tourring through Germany as part of a five-member band.
In the dark of Hamburg More!
He mainly presents the \"Carrie & Lowell\" available since March.
Although almost 2000 guests are now banned in their chairs, the significantly more mature Stevens returns to intimacy and to the folk.
Without addressing the audience, the group of excellent musicians plays through the wide-ranging album.
From the audience you can hear: The lecture is \"opulent\" and you can thus throw away the \"plate in the ground\"
First, after a contribution, Stevens thanks himself modestly, plays acoustically few older songs, and finally, he declines under a tossing applause.
Jeremy Corbyn's debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time
Since his election Mr. Corbyns Debüt has been eagerly expected at the question hour of the Prime Minister
The new Labour chairman, Jeremy Corbyn, is to make his debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time and start with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will raise himself to ask the first of his six stated questions shortly after noon, with his performance being likely checked by the media and the Labour representatives from close proximity.
He called for \"less theatre and more facts\" at this weekly event.
He also said that he could skip several meetings to leave them to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Corbyn's leadership, because after his appointment she will be a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TUC annual meeting on Tuesday.
In the meantime, on Tuesday during the singing of the national anthem, the Labour chairman's decision to hold the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence has provoked criticism of a number of Tory-MPs and is at the centre of several title-side stories in the newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem drew attention to himself
A spokesperson of Mr Corbyn said that he had \"standed in a respectful silence\" and he recognized the \"Heldness of the Royal Air Force in the air battle for England\".
But a member of Mr. Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two Newsnight program that he advised the Labour chairman to sing the national anthem, “independently,” on his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyn's top team, calling for differences in economic, defence and foreign policy, while less than a sixth of the Parliamentary Party originally supported him as a leader.
The policy correspondent of BBC Robin Brant says that political differences are also within Labour stacks, according to Mr Corbyn's statements on the position on the European Union and the limitation on profits.
Mr. Corbyn told the TUC conference that Labour was making changes to remove the whole idea of a limitation in total.
Hours later Mr Smith said that the shadow labor and pension minister that the party was \"very clear\" that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limitation of £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour chairman, David Cameron, since he has been Tory Chief, facing the Dispatch Box in Parliament in the last decade.
The Labour Chairman, who has promised another policy approach, says that he has ‘crowd-sourced’ ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and that he has received more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP has said that the Prime Minister's Question Time is too confrontational, and that he will, in turn, refrain from both \"slaughteriness\" and the fight against rehacking and instead has set about focusing on serious problems such as poverty, inequality and the challenges for young people.
Mr. Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the shadow Minister for Economic Affairs, will represent him if he does not participate - for example, when Mr. Cameron is traveling abroad.
He also discussed the idea that other colleagues would occasionally take the floor, and that he had addressed John Bercow, the spokesperson of the lower house, to discuss the problem.
When he became a leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron said that he wanted to get rid of the politics in the style of a “Kasperle theatre” that is often associated with the Prime Minister's Question Time, but a few years later he admitted that he failed in it.
Since it was first broadcast on television in 1990, the question hour was considered with the Prime Minister as the most important barometer of the ruling of a leader and his leadership in the lower house and his position among his fellow Members, although critics have argued that they have become a cartoon and need far more extensive reforms.
'Footed in Joburg': Homeless Youths Trained to Photographers
The city centre of Johannesburg is a hearty place if you are homeless.
But a group of former street children has found a way to learn a skill and thus earn a living.
“I was shot in Joburg” (I was shot in Joburg) is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless young people how to take photos of their surroundings and get a profit from them.
BBC News has met one of the first graduates of the project.

Pound increases through accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
The pound rose sharply according to data showing an increase in UK wage growth. In parallel, FTSE 100 was increased by the SABMiller bid target.
Between May and July the result in the United Kingdom rose by 2.9% without bonuses compared to the same period of the previous year.
This percentage has been the fastest since 2009 and provided estimates of the date of an increase in interest rates.
The pound rose by more than 1% from the dollar to $1,5505 and was up to 0.84% against the euro to € 1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index increased by 1.49% to 6.229.21.
SABMiller was the outstanding share on the market and made a 20% jump after taking over the AB InBev rival.
A transaction would combine the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were higher after encouraging news from the Competition Group for Luxury Goods Richemont 0.9%.
Richemont's latest sales figures hit all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Burberry - indicated growth again.
Glencore's shares rose by 5%, after the mining giant said he took $2.5 billion through a stock sale as part of his debt reduction strategy.
The shares of the packaging and paper company Mondi were the largest losers on the index, with a decrease of 4.3%, after Goldman Sachs put his assessment on “selling” for the company.
JD Sports rose by 3.1% after the sport clothing company reported a pre-tax result of 46.6 million for the semester.
The head of JD Sports says that higher wages endanger expansion.
The Managing Director of JD Sports Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum wage for UK employees could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers.
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will offset the higher labour costs of his company, he says.
The cost could be the expansion plans of JD Sports, he added, and this could mean that there are fewer additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital city: On Bieber Expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
Lappy 21 years young, a hanger with upper haircut.
The type with the platinum-blowing hair is 100 million euros heavy.
Even more.
It is currently Monsieur Bieber in Berlin.
And the U17 generation is turning.
Like Wiktoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name \"Ritz Carlton\".
Not bad.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
This includes Ewa and Victoria from Poland.
Since 7 a.m., however, the Polin has been sitting on the cold stone plates in the form of Berlin's luxury hotel at Potsdamer Platz.
The Bieber Building: Here you live Idol, whose poster hangs in Stettin, since Monday evening.
The suite, where the Canadian singer lives, costs just as much on the day her mama Ewa earns in half a year.
If at all.
She says: \"In fact, my Wiktoria would have to sit in the tenth grade in high school,
“I’m fulfilling a dream for her,
School obligation?
Who is it?
The fans don't.
Neither does beeber itself.
He's taken care of anyway.
For advertising in the advertising break of the Superbowl he cashed three million, a two-year deal with an anti-pickle company washed many, many dollars into the beekeeping account.
And with every doll that looks like he's going through the shop table, Bieber also cashs.
If Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, you'll be amazed at the window pane.
More than 100 million are supposed to have been exploited.
Some say the hype went too far.
Others point out that Bieber is finally in the United States and the UK with his new single, What do you mean, in place of 1.
Bieber himself, whose fourth album will follow in November, does not interest the many zeros for the first time.
At least he does.
Pegida-Plakat brings Lebanese to Potato Döner-Idee
Potatoes or doughs?
It goes both - in potato döner, developed by Oldenburger Imbis owner Hani Alhay.
Inspired by the saying of potato instead of dough, on a poster of the Pegida movement, Alhay put potato and meat together on a spoon.
The idea was to bring him a poster at a Pegida demonstration with the inscription \"Kartoffeln instead of Doner\" which he had accidentally seen on television.
Since then, a grilled pie has been turned into meat and potatoes in his shop.
“This is multiculti for the stomach,” Alhay says.
The idea has now been registered by Lebanese at the Patent Office in Munich.
According to the Authority, it has recently been protected as a model of use.
So how much meat and how much potatoes the spice contains, Alhay doesn't want to betray.
Just so much: “It tastes even better together - it finds.
The culinary international understanding is also well received from his customers.
Metcash launches ground resistance campaign to combat Aldi incident
Metcash tries to protect the IGA branches from an Aldi march in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a ground resistance campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a $700 million Aldi invasion.
While Aldi prepares the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia in the beginning of next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and build the IGA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing through social media, as well as through events such as Adelaide show.
IGA dealers and suppliers jump on board, with brands like Ice Manufacturer Simmo from Dunsborough, who distributes samples in IGA shops and shop owners who sell cheap tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers.
Metcash is expected to publish further details of its defence strategy on 29 September when the wholesaler of food, alcohol and equipment carries out its annual investor strategy day.
It is much on the game, as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Metcash's IGA charging operations and generate higher profit margins than Metcash's IGA network in the Eastern States.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriety provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in the Eastern States.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that after 12 months of opening their first markets, Aldi will cut off around five percent of the food market in these two countries and remove sales of all existing players, but mainly self-employed retailers.
According to a report published this week, the analyst Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley estimated that IGA retailers could lose 360 $ million of revenues per year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that in the next year, Aldi will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA and generate sales of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss in food and food business and in the amounts on Metcash's high fixed cost base could cost Metcash about $13 million before interest and taxes, said Mr. Kierath.
At the same time, Metcash loses market shares in the Eastern States, mainly in Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley assumes that Metcash's sales in food and food business will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will reduce the market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week the leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of the Magellan Financial Group, told at a business dinner in Melbourne that Metcash is likely to disappear within a decade. Metcash will disappear.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to Mr Douglass' comments.
But it is assumed that a member of Metcash's board of directors has contacted Mr Douglas's last week.
Since 2010, IGA's market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent, and revenues from Metcash's food and food trade, which provides about 1,200 IGA retailers, have fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting operating debt reduction at simultaneous pressure on sales and margins.
The wholesaler, however, resists and invests more than $150 million to offset sales prices with Coles and Woolworths in hundreds of products each week and to improve IGA retailers in improving their stores by rapidly increasing fresh foods and providing a better choice of private label food.
Metcash's lead manager, Ian Morrice, says that price adjustments and charging remediation programs will be made to Elan and hopes that the wholesaler will return to profit growth for the first time in 2017 in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the president of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves praise rather than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the “collateral damage” in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and, according to the president of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy, deserves praise rather than criticism for his own behavior.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo, which is repeatedly referred to as \"Special Ks\", came into the spotlight at the Montreal Masters by the infamous confrontation of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka.
In a fiery game of qualification in Cincinnati soon thereafter, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the arbitrator, where Harrison exclaimed: “Waurina had to beat Kyrgios, and I should beat the child,
While he was last seen defeating a tennis striker, after a clash of Richard Gasquet's potential U.S. open victory, Kokkinakis was steadfastly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, in competition with Sam Groth for second place in the single behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup Hall Finals against Great Britain.
“One thing I’m quite engrossed in is the fact that, in my opinion, Thanasi was getting a little involved in the dispute,” said Healy.
He broke a blower when he lost to the U.S. open because of a cramp, but he's not the first player to break a blower of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he's not proud of it.
But, really, he has behaved extremely well in the US-Open, even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves much recognition.
He has a great team around him, he has a great family around him, and I think he was treated a little too strictly.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits into the team and so on, he's never had a problem with the other players, he's respected in the changeover area, he's trained hard, he's good in shape, he's a very stable and mature young guy, and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision not to take Kyrgios into account in the important preliminary decision that begins on Friday, and he described the \"common decision\" as the right one for everyone, but he assured the man from Canberra to return to the team as a long-term fixed part,
“First, we want the team to be fully focused on competition and not all the controversies around [Kyrgios],” said Healy.
And I think Nick has made the climb very quickly, which people like Federer and Murray have pointed out. He rises in the eyes of the public, and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we try to support him, we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions. Some time outside the spotlight in which he can only think about it, I think it is appropriate, and it is best for the team and it is the best for him.
Europe's refugee crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes the border, keeps refugees back
Hungary declared the emergency and closed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all who tried to get into the country illegally. All with the aim of stopping the influx of migrants.
Chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in a no-one country and Serbian officials responded with outrage.
For an unknown time, the people who escaped violence were stuck in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there.
But frustrations increase.
When a police helicopter hovered over them, the migrants “opened the border” and shouted insults against the Hungarian preparedness police.
Some have returned from protesting food and water.
Serbia's Foreign Minister said it was \"acceptable\" that migrants would be sent back from Hungary, while more and more arrived from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not a colateral damage.
Talking with Brussels and other countries will have to take place in the next few days, said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The turbulence at the Hungarian-Serbian border could not agree on a common immigration policy a day after the 28-nation block at a controversial meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed, however, to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in overcrowded Italy and Greece. They expressed their hope that, in the final analysis, next month or by the end of the year, an agreement would be reached that the EU countries would receive another 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
On Tuesday, Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a European Union special summit to discuss the continent's immigration crisis.
However, Hungary did not put its hopes on a speedy action by Brussels or its neighbours.
The emergency in two southern regions proclaimed on Tuesday gave authorities more power to deal with the crisis so that they could block roads and speed up asylum procedures.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that his country also planned the construction of a barbed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influx of migrants through the country - after it had finished a fence at the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison inmates were deployed in the race to create the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a significant bottleneck for many refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and a starting point to the European Union.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban insisted that most of the incoming economic refugees who are looking for a better life, and not war refugees who are entitled to protection, are strongly opposed to other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, make crossing the border or damaging the 4-metre (13 feet) high fence, which the government had built along the southern border to Serbia, a crime. These laws also lay down higher prison sentences for convicted human traffickers.
\"Due to the situation created by mass migration, the Hungarian government is declaring the state of emergency, said government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We say it very clearly: Illegal border crossing is a crime.
Parliament still has to agree with the use of the military, which is expected for next week, but Associated Press reporters have seen heavy armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs at the border for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Country Security Consultant for Orban, said that authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border, 15 others were already entering the country deeper.
They come over by damaging the fence, they are now in police custody and are accused of committing crimes in accordance with the new laws.
Authorities are about to repair the fence quickly.
On Tuesday morning, Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia, after a train wagon with a beam wire to close the borders had arrived.
Chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Rosske, Hungary, when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and pushed a crowd to push into it.
About 20 managed to get in, but thousands stayed outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the most important motorway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
Wahl-2016: Hillary Clinton's lead before Bernie Sanders in national survey halved
Former U.S. Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton continues to hold a two-digit lead in the democratic race for nomination at national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins her on the ground.
Clinton now has the support of 47 per cent of democratic voters in the pre-elections (58 per cent earlier), while Sanders is second in position, with 27 per cent (ascent by 17 per cent).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is running for the presidential office, receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the elections.
More than five months before the elections began, most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion determines which candidates will support them.
But Clinton's supporters are more stable in their choice than those of the other candidates.
Since the CBS news survey, Clinton has lost some profits in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders has won some.
Clinton has a great advance in women and moderates, but these advances have decreased.
Their support for the men has fallen significantly, and Sanders is back here with only 5 points.
Clinton's advantage in democratic voters under 50 years has fled, and they and Sanders are now at the same height.
Clinton, however, still has a great advantage with the older voters.
Last month Clinton was ahead of Sanders with two-digit lead at the Liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point lead at this group.
About half of the democratic voters of the elections nationwide say they would support Clinton with enthusiasm if nominated by the party.
One quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15% would support her only because she is the candidate.
Six percent would not support them.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Clinton's current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about her.
The views are more mixed with those that currently do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would support them enthusiastically.
While 48 percent of democratic voters say they support Clinton with enthusiasm, fewer Republican voters say this about their top candidate Donald Trump (35 percent).
If Clinton's supporters are asked in an open question why they want her to be the candidate, the most frequent answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it is time for a woman to become president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Their connection with Bill Clinton (9 percent) is also mentioned by Clinton's supporters.
Consent to dealing with the problems and the selectivity are also cited.
Since the Vice-President throws a potential for the Presidential Office into the Waagschale, 57 percent of democratic voters of the elections want to see him in the race - although a third believe he should not.
If democratic voters are asked who would be their second choice for the party, Biden is at the top.
Of Clinton's supporters, more than half say that Biden was their second choice far ahead of Sanders.
Biden decides not to apply for the nomination of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton's advance in front of Sanders, from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty-five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election; however, this figure of 78 percent has fallen last month.
Biden is by far a second in this measurement, but the percentage that he sees as the \"selectible\" has increased.
Nevertheless, in the question of what is more important for a candidate, Democratic voters call questions about the electivity.
Just like last month, no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for this electorate's election appears to be unacceptable.
The Democratic candidates or potential candidates bring good results with some important characteristics in the electorate of their party.
Majorities regard Clinton, Sanders, and Biden as honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities.
Biden is best off with the three candidates for honesty, while Clinton's strength is the leadership.
Thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe Clinton to be honest and trustworthy, twice as many say about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent do not believe in him.
Democratic voters of the elections generally also see Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically in accordance with their views.
In all these measurements, about a quarter of democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal e-mail address and a server continue to be asked as foreign ministers during the term of office, most Democratic voters of the elections are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions overall.
But it's a different story in the American public as a whole.
Half of the Americans are now dissatisfied with their explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
The public opinion on this was divided in March shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said that the email controversy had no effect on Clinton's general opinions, although 36 percent said that their opinion of her was still worse.
It is mainly Republicans, more than six out of 10, who say that Clinton's views have become worse.
Although Clinton is considered honest and trustworthy by the voters of his party, this remains a problem for them among registered voters as a whole: only 32 percent see them as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May.
62 percent of voters do not consider them to be an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55 percent of voters across the country also regard Trump as not honest and untrustworthy.
Clinton and Trump, however, receive good grades in leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush best cut off with honesty.
A majority consider Sanders rather than honest, but as with Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 democratic voters in the pre-elections is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson heads for Donald Trump in a national survey
Ben Carson is located close behind Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times survey
The two candidates now account for half the support of voters in the new survey, and others lose dramatically
Republican voters continue to support Trump in large numbers across the country, with 23% of support in the last CBS survey conducted before Fox News debate last month, 27% in the Tuesday survey.
But Carson scored from 6% to 23% in the same period.
The survey also revealed that Carson is good at demographic groups and that Trump is a high school graduate among Republican voters.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, has been defeated with Wisconsin's Governor Scott Walker, who has fallen the deepest, from 10% support last month to 2% now.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabe and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are in third place at 6%.
The margin of error in the sample of 376 people of Republican voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6% and was carried out in September.
The latest CNN/ORC survey, published last week, shows that Carson is rising in surveys - he is landing at 19% support for Republicans, behind Trump with 32% support.
The recent ABC News/Washington Post survey also showed Trump clearly before Carson.
With a look at a carson rising last week, Trump found some side highlights for the former neurosurgeon, even after Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
“We need energy,” Trump said last Saturday during a campaign appearance in Iowa.
Pleasant bathing temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm.
Even though peak values are only measured remotely, a trip to the Mediterranean is already enough for bathers to find warm water.
A bath in the North or Baltic Sea is expected to be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees.
Some are no longer going into the sea: Maximum 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic sea this week, the German Weather Service (DWD) reports.
On the other hand, bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean: in the east it even comes to up to 29 degrees.
In the Adriatic there are 25 degrees in the top, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees.
Five members of the Brotherhood burdened with the death of a Baruch College nephew
Almost two years after a student dies during a shiconous ritual of a student connection in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, morklage is filed against five people.
Members of the New York Baruch College Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood brutally attacked Chun-Michael-Deng during an introductory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital, which contributed to his death, the police told him.
Officials said he had been burdened with a 30-pound bag full of sand with attached eyes, and was repeatedly attacked while trying to reach a goal over a frozen field.
Mr. Deng finally complained about headaches, then he fell unconscious.
The members of the Pi-Delta-Psi Brotherhood did not call the 911 emergency number after Deng became powerless and were allegedly waiting an hour before they took him to a hospital, police say.
However, they had time to change Deng's clothes, google his symptoms, and contact Andy Meng, the national president of the brotherhood to seek advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference.
\"At this point, members began hiding utensils and basically presented the welfare of the brotherhood about Michael Deng's police chief Wagner.
He could not be revived, and he died the next morning of his injuries.
According to an autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly attached to head, hull and thigh injuries with the force of force.
“To many families were destroyed by the Shikans of the Brotherhood. At least one student has died every year of the Shikans since 1970,” said Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng’s family, in a statement.
Brotherhoods and their members must be accounted for, and this step by authorities is very important.
A County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended a lawsuit for murder of third grade for the first five members.
Thirty-two members of the brotherhood, including Mr Meng, are also accused of scathing attacks and the formation of a criminal association.
“We don’t just want to blame the people involved, but if there is an organization that has, officially or unofficially, sanctioned this, we will also draw them to account,” Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
The Baruch College has banned the brotherhood, and the national brotherhood has rescinded its membership to the local group.
This will happen when the Fed increases interest rates
A rise in interest rates comes, and the houses will sink, returns for bonds will rise, and the economy will slip into recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long it will take and how long it will last.
In particular, history provides little guidance for the economy.
A recession occurred within just 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often, though not always, a factor in how the economy and financial institutions react.
Therefore, representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on increasing interest rates when it starts, rather on the period required for normalisation.
In fact, several variables play a role.
In the end, however, market participants may find that the whole excitement may have been exaggerated due to an increase in interest rates.
“The first increase in the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of “paid money”, said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a communication to customers.
In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to normal altitudes, but still at too low a level to lead to the seismic shock that many seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that there will be no effects.
Here is a historical trend-based look at how some areas of the economy might react:
As the market has seen last month, the advance of interest rates can make things volatile for a while.
As soon as the increase occurs, the influence is not so dramatic.
“There seems to be a tendency for assets to be depleted 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may reflect the delay in monetary policy,” said German bank analysts in a recent study of what happens after interest rates rise in the Fed.
More specifically, the market has mostly been on the way to the increase in interest rates in the past 35 years (average profit of 2.6 percent), then back to the normal state after 500 days, with an average return in the past six previous cycles of 14.4 percent according to a current analysis published by Bob Doll, Chief Investment Strategy at Nuveen Asset Management, at Barron's.
The Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to occur later in the increase cycle and the return begins to decrease.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but interest rates often encourage them.
In the current case, the Fed is confronted with some conditions that did not exist before and that could accelerate a recession.
It is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point at an interest rate increase in the Fed.
According to Deutsche Bank, the 118 interest rates since 1950 only twice the nominal GDP was below 4.5 percent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, only a few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the Atlanta Fed.
Interest rates in such a fragile economic scene could be risky and raise the question, \"if it's different this time, the Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants took an interest rate increase of the Fed all year round, and all eyes were focused on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week ending on Thursday.
While many strategies and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this session, the Futures trade indicates only a 25 percent probability.
“In our study, all the increase cycles from 1950 to today took place in a super-cycle with an increasing trend in GDP and placed pre-recession levels in the shade very quickly after the start of recovery,” the report says.
In contrast, this is a distinctly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase.
The current cycle is by far the longest that the Fed has been waiting since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and this has been 74 months.
The fixed income was also volatile as the market advances an interest rate increase, and the pattern is quite similar to that in the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than on shares if they change their strategic price.
When borrowing, the returns appear to change direction as soon as the first increase/decrease takes place in the cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, the bond yields fall immediately, said Deutsche Bank.
Charles Schwab's strategies believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to a closer combination of returns between longer and shorter bonds and to a flattening of the curve.
High-interest bonds often bring better yields in such a climate, although “we are still careful to expect higher yields,” said Kathy Jones, fixed-income analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones believes that markets have already adapted to Fed strategy expectations.
“In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decrease in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of more stringent monetary policies,” she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have increased, the yield curve is flat, credit spans have expanded and volatility has increased - all features of the market when the Fed strengthens its strategy.
In large and medium-sized enterprises that carry out the larger part of their business in the United States will benefit if interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with high debt will suffer worse because an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also the financing of their debts.
“The story shows that “quality - shares tend to respond very positively three months after an initial interest rate increase,” said Goldman Sachs analysts in a customer report.
Firms with a strong balance sheet have averaged 5 percentage points after each of the increases in interest rates in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital returns and low volatility in their shares also exceeded their low-quality pensions by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).
Debt will be a big problem.
Companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
Outside of pure stock games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savers could see profits from higher yields, even if experts disagree on how fast this will take place.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM, says Member of Parliament Andrew Bingham
The Conservative Member of Parliament criticized the broadcaster for his \"dumbing\"
He argues that he is increasingly indifferent to commercial rivalries.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said that they only imitated The British
Parliament colleague Damien Collins attacked the broadcast The Voice and said that this was not very original.
BBC Radio 3 is turning to Classic FM, claims a leading Member of Parliament and increases new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he is doing something that the private broadcasters are not doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC bosses that the public-law radio station was \"damaged\" and was increasingly no longer to be distinguished from its commercial competitors.
“Radio 3 seems - I use the word “dumbing - not like - but it seems to turn into Classic FM - he said.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards, which started last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, seem to be just under a different name.
So, if you're trying to do something else -- these are two spontaneously mentioned examples, in which you actually just imitate what's already on the market -- said Mr. Bingham.
BBC Director General rejected the allegations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of his commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public education.
What I learn from Radio 3, I'm not going to learn about classical music anywhere else.
And there is a commitment to live music and music that is really unsurpassed.
“And finding new music and commissioning new works from Radio 3, I also really consider it important,” he said.
At the beginning of this year, BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey argued that it would have to work harder to engage the public than it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music.
Radio 3 was not, however, the only element of BBC production, which, during the hearing in the Committee on the Selection of Culture, Media and Sport, set fire to the commercial rivalries.
Tory deputy Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC musical talent show, which was purchased by Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated cost of £22 million.
Do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly distinctive?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as judge - was produced on special BBC-wise.
He added that he wanted the company to find \"a hit from our own stable\" next time it started a entertainment series.
However, he refused to exclude the ordering of other series of The Voice in the future or to spend money from payers for other entertainment formats.
Internet sales increased in August the slowest and Black Friday can be responsible for this
In the first three months of 2015, there was seven percent increase in online sales.
Last month there was the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000
Online sales increased three years ago through the use of mobile phones for shopping
Experts believe that the Black Friday has slowed the spending in November
For over a decade, virtual shopping has boomed, and many of the major shopping streets in the UK have turned into ghost cities.
However, experts say that there are signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures show only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
The total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the recordings in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
“If you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000, this has always developed over time,” said Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index to the Guardian.
He explained that the online sales increased three years ago when buyers began to make purchases with their mobile phones.
It meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments, e.g. at home on the sofa.
But now it's commuting, and we may experience that growth decreases.
The Black-Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the delaying sales.
Experts believe that buyers keep their purchases before this event, which will take place last Friday in November.
Last year five times, the average number of buyers around their computer to make their snaps, and some dealer websites crashed.
Experts believe that Black Friday, where buyers fought for snuffs, could stop buyers from making purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that a little more than £1 online spending of £5 was spent.
In some products such as TVs and washing machines, more than a third of the purchases are now carried out via web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains in the inner cities.
Muslims buried in Mecca during the Kran accident Killed - Bin Laden's family will be sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims at the first funerals in Mecca by the streets
Saudi Arabia partially burdens the collapse of the huge Saudi Bin-Laden Group
The Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were injured after the crane crashed
Hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those killed when a crane crashed at Mecca's great mosque.
Mourning ones filled, largely dressed in white, the route to pay their respect when the first of the dead reached their last journey to the Al Moaissem Peace Court.
The mourning procession moved forward at the Holy Place, where only days earlier a building crane crashed through the ceiling of the mosque and then on the prayers.
The bodies were released for funeral, when the Saudi king was sanctioned by the Bin Laden family building company because of the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 bears who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Mosque of Mecca were carried through the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Manchester, father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed.
Mr. Akram was in the Great Mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual Haddsch.
Saudi officials have already confirmed that the Haddsch will continue to Mecca with thousands who will continue to come to the city.
Today, King Salman said that the Bin-Laden group should not have let the crane's arm stand when it was not used.
An Arabic version of the decree published by the State Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin-Laden Group was responsible for the collapse.
The English-speaking service of the news agency did not report this detail, but said that the management of the company abroad was prohibited.
At the beginning of this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the crash of the crane, which crashed into an inner courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered before the Hadsch, which will take place later this month.
The Bin-Laden Group has not issued any statements on the collapse of the cranes, and its representatives were not available for an opinion.
The Royal Decree also appealed to the group for non-current security measures and because they did not cooperate with meteorologists.
Thousands of cranes surround Mecca's big mosque as part of the massive construction project, which is managed by the Bin-Laden Group.
For decades, the Bin Laden family has been associated with Saudi Arabia's ruling family and is taking over larger construction projects.
The late leader of Al Qaida, Osama bin Laden, was an abducted son, who was abducted by the family in the 1990s.
The crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain, just a few days before the arrival of millions in the Kingdom for the pilgrimage required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim.
Officials said 158 people are staying in the hospital.
Government representatives ruled that 1 million ryal (£174,000) should be paid to the members of the killings and the same sum of permanent casualties.
Other injured persons receive half of this amount.
B&Q Boss says that the time of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
Britain is increasingly employing craftsmen, says Veronique Laury
The number of qualified artisans from Eastern Europe has increased
This leads to the opening of 200 additional Screwfix layers aimed at craftsmen
At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B&Q sales outlets nationwide
By Rupert Steiner, City Chief correspondent of the Daily Mail
It is claimed that British will lay down their hammers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified Eastern European artisans who carry out the work at home.
If you are skillful with a hammer or brush to strike walls, you are apparently a minority today.
Because Britain is increasingly employing artisans to perform homework jobs in their homes, says the head of the company behind B&Q.
Véronique Laury, new CEO of Kingfisher, who owns the construction markets chain, said that a large increase in the number of qualified artisans from Eastern Europe, which offer services at low prices has now been overtaken.
Therefore, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix shops aimed at craftsmen and close 60 sales points of B&Q.
Mrs Laury said she wanted to employ more women in B & Q shops, because eight out of ten purchase decisions in the store are made by women.
At the moment, the employees are overwhelming the men.
She said it would be necessary to address the growing demographic trends, which are more female single households, which are making more renovations than in the past.
Mrs. Laureny said: “There is still a majority of men working in our branches.
We need to shift this closer to a balance.
In principle, half of our customers are women with 80 percent of the decisions on buying articles by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs Laury, who is one of only five women at the top of a British company listed in the FTSE100 Index, has also turned her top team around to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women, including its management and financial board.
Mrs. Laureny said: “This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board.
Kingfisher indicated a decline in half-yearly profit and turnover after the group shouldered the cost of closing the shops.
Because of the trend, Kingfisher, who owns Screwfix and B&Q, will open 200 new branches.
Aich/Dob's officials for infidelity in court
On Wednesday the Landesgericht Klagenfurt had to answer two officials of the Austrian Volleyball Vice-Chairman Aich/Dob for unfaithfulness and deductibility.
The defendants did not know how guilty they were.
One of them had also been charged with official abuses.
He was convicted of this allegation in May.
The current process has been delayed.
According to Supreme Attorney Robert Riffel, it had been crystallized in the preliminary investigation that the defendants used funds from association accounts for private purposes in 2006 to 2011.
The damage is caused by around 400,000 euros.
The sports officials are also accused of financial offences.
This fact was dismissed by the chairman of the Schöffensenat, Judge Michaela Sanin.
It is to be negotiated at a later date.
In the event of the unfaithfulness, the defense was that an asset was not created at any time by the association.
The sports officials had only calculated the expenses and the sports club, for which they worked from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money, were out of debt - the liabilities in 2001 amounted to about 600,000 shillings (about 44,000 euros).
“At that time, we faced the situation: Let’s continue or block the club,” said one of the defendants, in the gross business examiner of the financial office.
With his colleagues and fellow complainers, he then decided to take on this task.
With all the risks.
“We have raised money, placed our life insurance as security at the bank,” he said at the agreement.
The association agreed: You can manage the money freely, you can only not make any debts.
In addition, the payment of the compensation for the expenses had been decided retroactively by 1991, with a corresponding financial success.
For this reason, part of the effort compensation was paid only years later, namely from 2003 when a plus was on the account.
The former Obmann explained the processes.
The accounts and savings books managed the two defendants together, said the second defendant.
The judge asked why the payments had not been made to the club in detail.
The association was not interested in the details of the financial statement, but only the freedom of debt was important, according to the answer.
In 2011, when an official began investigations for abuse of office, an amount of 120,000 euros was transferred to the association account.
That was a setback, the defendants explained.
This securities account ran on the name of the second defendant and, according to his statement, was unknown to the association.
“Why,” the judge wanted to know.
The interviewer knew no answer for a long time.
Then he finally said he believed that this was the best thing for the club.
If something had happened to him, no one would have known anything about that money, the prosecutor would have put it in the room.
The deputies had been informed, the officer justified himself.
This transfer has been formulated as 'damage re-appropriation'.
Why damage compensation?, the judge and the prosecutor wanted to know.
On that basis, the first defendant declared that he was not in agreement with this formulation because the club had never suffered any harm.
But what should I do if the lawyer says, \"With that you're all out of the tailor\"
“I am a legal representative,” he asked.
Furthermore, the official said that he never earned a cent salary, he calculated only mileage and diets.
On diets he charged the association with 1,000 euros per month, but the actual effort was much higher, he added.
The defendants were unable to present precise documents for the early years.
These were no longer retained after an operating examination, in which everything had been judged as correct, they explained.

He explained in his statement that all the resolutions were in cash and that he had to travel from his hometown of Volksmarkt to the bank in Bleiburg.
The main proceedings will continue on 23 September with the survey of witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard spends another 30,000 jobs
In addition to the three-year-old downturn in personnel, the computer giant will reduce further jobs when the company is split.
The job strikes at the U.S. Computer giant Hewlett-Packard (HP) will not end.
As part of its restructuring, the U.S. Technology Group plans to cut from 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer department.
In order to save costs of 2.7 billion dollars (2.4 billion euros), the company announced on Tuesday.
The step will result in a special tax of about $2.7 billion, which will be applied from the fourth quarter.
The downgrading of 55,000 jobs for three years has not yet been completed.
HP still employed some 302,000 employees at the end of the 2013/14 financial year.
Hewlett-Packard's share was 2.3 percent.
The large-scale group from Palo Alto, California, with printers, is currently splitting: the computer and printer business is to be bundled together in a new company - separate from the more forward-looking areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services.
Both parts of the business are to be listed on the stock exchange.
A once again disappointing PC set-up as well as a weaker demand from corporate customers for its services last to the world's second largest PC manufacturer in Lenovo.
In the third business quarter to the end of July, PC and printers sales decreased by 11.5 percent.
Sales fell by 8 percent to almost $25.4 billion.
As a result, the proceeds declined in 15 out of 16 quarters.
HP responds with a split and massive job strikes to change in the industry.
The 76-year-old company under Meg Whitman's leadership has only recently responded that customers can buy smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and do more and more business online.
Whitman's restructuring plans total the reduction of about 55,000 jobs.
Conflicts: majority support the anti-IS training mission
However, a direct involvement of German soldiers in combat actions in Iraq would be largely opposed: 54% opposed, 35 percent agreed.
The fact that other states are flying air raids against IS in Iraq and Syria is 61% positive.
24 percent are opposed to taking part in the conflict.
A cooperation with the Syrian ruler Baschar al-Assad rejects 51 percent of the respondents, which would be 20 percent for that purpose.
29 percent could not decide.
Car: Second day of press on the 66th IAA
The trade fair focuses on connected, self-driving cars and electric mobility until 27 September.
After two days of press, Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Motor Show under the motto \"Mobility Connected\" on Thursday.
The general public can visit the IAA from Saturday.
The organisers of the VDA car association expect about 900 000 visitors as they did two years ago.
Röszke: Violent outbreak at Serbian-Hungarian border
The Hungarian police have deployed several hundred refugees on the Serbian border at Röszke Träengas and water-throwers.
Euronews correspondent Dániel Bozsik has experienced the outbreak of violence at the border control point.
He reported on the phone:
A group of refugees crossed the border.
The police had formed a police line and behind the police there was a waterlight.
From 40 to 50 refugees began throwing stones, sticks and plastic bottles after the officials.
The officials first used uninterrupted pepper spray.
Then the police used tear gas.
A lot of tear gas was sprayed towards the refugees.
The group was dissolved.
The refugees have now suddenly withdrew somewhat.
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone.
Children who breathed the tear gas screamed.
Other refugees collapsed and suffered from respiratory distress.
The press spokesmen of Serbian police suffered injuries through the use of tear gas and pepper spray.
Time of decision on interest rates for the U.S. bank
The world observes when the US notes bank meets on two days, on Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision whether or not to raise interest for the first time for almost a decade.
A survey of 80 economists surveyed by Reuters found that a little more than half that was the last week's view that the Fed would do this, now thinking that the Fed will stay a little longer and keep interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.25 percent.
It's a historic event because it's been seven years since the Fed set interest rates on NULL.
“For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normalising interest rates,” said Angel Ubide, senior staff member at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy is at a relatively good performance level, trillion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy outlook on global conditions.
It has warned the markets to adjust to an increase, but the signs suggest that the chances against such a step are good.
The decision will be announced on Thursday at 8 p.m.
Death guards at Delta State University left apologizing
After shooting and killing his friend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleagues later on the day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that he was \"leading\" at the first murder and wanted \"he could do it without harm\" - authorities announced on Tuesday.
The police in Gautier, Mississippi, said that Lamb, lecturer for geography and social science education at Delta State University, called the emergency call number at 10:00 a.m. on Monday morning
And he said he shot someone and killed someone.
Lamb told the staff of the emergency call centre that the police had to send policemen to his home.
He said, \"I shot my wife last night, and he also mentioned that a \"sweet dog\" is in the house, but that \"no one will interfere\" will probably be excited.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he didn't give it.
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots.
When police entered the scene, they found Amy Prentiss' body, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, which said: “I’m so sorry, I wanted to make it go away.
I loved Amy, and she is the only woman who ever loved me,
After writing the note, Lamb went 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before finally taking his own life on Monday evening when police surrounded him.
University President William LaForge said that he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but “of course there was something in Mr Lamb’s presentation.”
Despite reports on Monday, which Lamb allegedly believed that Prentiss also had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities said on Tuesday, there was no information, no evidence - for a three-way relationship -
Prentiss was described by Shawn O'Steen, who said that they were married for about seven years, as a “good man”.
The two were divorced 15 years ago, but they remained friends.
O'Steen said that he and Prentiss had a daughter who is 19 and she was “crushed to the ground”
He said that Prentiss was her daughter \"absolutely best friends.\"
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, who was identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who owned a dog named Lightning, had met with lamb for about three years.
“She always wanted to help other people,” said Knowles.
The police said that Lamb called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them that he was not going to prison.
When police picked him up on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb drove his car aside, fled on foot, walked into the forest, and killed himself with a shot.
In the spring of 2015, Lamb received a doctoral degree from Delta State University, as indicated by his life volume on the University's website.
Stars Who Lost Their Happiness Bringer
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001 he fought against leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his long-standing partner, Farrah Fawcett, because of cancer.
The actor has also allegedly been fighting drugs, and in 2008 he was sentenced to drug possession.
All that surely calls for his tribute.
Eurowings: Lufthansa is building the Group
The Lufthansa plans a major group reconstruction.
Half a billion euros a year, the Lufthansa Group wants to save itself with a better organization.
150 of the world's 1000 executives will cost the group conversion to the workplace.
There are new negotiations with the pilot trade union.
The Lufthansa builds its corporate structure and evaluates Eurowings's cheap subsidiary.
The aim of the realignment was to contribute around 500 million euros per year from cost and revenue synergy, the airline announced on Wednesday.
Among other things, in the future, Lufthansa will no longer have a board for the passenger business.
Eurowings should be developed as independently as possible.
In future, Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings in the management team with Chief Carsten Spohr.
With the new creation, Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings, with which the Group intends to take action against Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
To date, the organization of the 120,000 employees of the strong company has been complex.
The airlines operated under the roof of the Passage Airline Group, which sets three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros.
New negotiations with pilots
In the conflict of tariffs with the Pilots Association Cockpit (VC), negotiations will be resumed after the court-stopped strike this Thursday.
The union told me.
The topic of the talks is intended to be the retirement scheme for pilots.
Cockpit wants to achieve sustainable results as soon as possible in a year with a forecast record result.
The conflict between trade union and airline has led to various strikes in recent months.
In addition to the temporary supply of the pilots, the \"Wings\" savings concept is the background
It appears that in the fight against competition routes, Lufthansa is dismantling Eurowings to the Group's own Eurowings.

Luke Shaw of Manchester United cannot play for months because of double fracturing
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg during the Champions League defeat of Manchester with PSV Eindhoven.
While this brought the left outside defender to wine and will exclude him from playing for at least six months, Louis van Gaal does not give up hope that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury was caused by a ruthless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV area.
He was treated on the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: \"He has a double leg fracture and is in the hospital\"
He's gonna be moved tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18, has it very hard and then plays fantastically, and then it happens.
He had an oxygen mask in the changing cabin.
He cried.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it will take six months, and he won't play in the group phase.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the hanging of an elfmeter.
Nicola Rizzoli, the arbitrator, did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian arbitrator had erred.
You can judge for yourself if I say that an elfmeter and a red card were due.
It was a very bad attack with both legs.
A tweet on Shaw's account said: “I thank you all for your messages. Words cannot describe how broken I am, my path to recovery starts now, I come back stronger “
In terms of this: Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Shaw in defeat at PSV
With the European Championship in France, the British defender has an additional incentive to recover by next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV trainer, said, \"It's a very serious injury.
If a player leaves the place with this kind of injury, all are very sad about it.
It's never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent.
Moreno suffered a leg fracture when Mexico played against Van Gaals Holland team at the 2014 World Cup.
“He’s doing very hard because it wasn’t his intention to hurt the opponent, and if you hear that it’s a very serious injury, that’s not good,” said Cocu.
It was not possible for me to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was heading in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] touched him, but I couldn't see the attack on Luke.
In conversation with SBS6, Moreno said: “I know how it feels, I know how hard such a thing can be.
I feel very bad about it, I'm so sorry.
The PSV player Andrés Guardado was also hospitalized - after a foul game by Chris Smalling.
Surely David Cameron knows The Lorax better?
It is one thing that all parents learn soon: If your child loves a book, it will not take long until you know it almost externally.
Unless you're David Cameron.
When he was asked by a provider of childcare systems to name his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister for The Lorax, the environmental fork published in 1971 by Dr. Seuss, decided.
It was a difficult choice, wrote Cameron in a message on the SuperCamps website, and continues: “loose, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it’s a book I like to read to my children, because there seems to be always a picture or a message that we’ve missed so far.”
Everything beautiful and good, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron allegedly describes the action of the book, instead displays a content statement of the 2012 film version, added the new characters and details to extend the rather short original text.
“In the midst of the walled town of Thned-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree, reading. A love interest was Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss hostage and who died in 1991, but was totally unknown.
As if that weren't suspicious enough: The text presented by Cameron reads in part like the summary of the Lorax film presented on the Internet Movie Database website and begins: “In the walled town of Thned-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams,
Although he admits to being a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the book's action. Here an unnamed boy hears how the local environment is being devastated by the money-gearing, trees-falling, threshing ounce-ler despite the protests of the naming Lorax, a horrendous, snorkeling creature, who speaks in the name of the trees.
It is most likely that such a relatively low PR task was delegated to a helper who did not read The Lorax to a child 20 times after each other.
A Downing Street spokesperson said that the text probably came from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron's employees, but did not give any further immediate comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England's team, but it is still difficult
Falling into Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but if you see the frame that England has chosen for the tour, a repeat of the 3.0 test series defeat is not on my map.
I wouldn't exclude an outward victory.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than the three years ago, but there are good spin players in the batching setting, and the community spirit is strong; they will not wear scars of 2012, just a youthful-positive setting.
With the ball, Moeen Ali develops as a spin-bowler and Adil Rashid, even if he represents an unknown size at test level, is an option for the attack.
Related message: Adam Lyth separates from the England test framework and is replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to release Adam Lyth is, of course, difficult for me as his head coach in Yorkshire.
In his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that Kricket players are focused on results.
There were no question marks with Joe Root, for example, and this led to the nomination, since - and I said this before - players are their own best voters.
A long time ago, Lyth's life had been extended, but he had control of his own fate.
When he hopefully beats out more runs for Yorkshire, another chance comes.
The England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even if he did not perform so well, and that did not surprise me; he is above all a team man.
The question of how much time a test-slaughter gets to put his sign is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play home and out.
The only reproach that can be raised was that England first deployed Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - when Lyth was in highest form - but this lost chance is now in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he's a hit man I value highly.
He is an X-factor cricket player, what we saw at Yorkshire early this season when he reached 236 against us on a Trent Bridge square, which hit us very much.
He must be given at least the same opportunities as those before him, but this of course depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of having Moeen beat next to Cook, which would bring an extra spin bowler and get four quicks, appeared, and I have nothing against it.
I don't see why a hitman can't beat there, and this left-handed man has already shown that he's a devil-skerl of cricket players.
Moeen may not have done his job for his County Worcestershire, but he's a number 3 for them, and there's no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at the first drop before acting as an opener in 2001.
He made three hundred runs right away and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the frame as a back-up spinner, and in my limited dealings with him he has impressed me very much as a young man.
People may look at his statistics - on average 31 with the hitter and 35 with the ball - and think it is a point, but there are no large number of backup spinners that raise their hands and the coaches have decided for youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Apart from the team, England has made some clever additions to the coach staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup.
He is one of the nicest guys in the game that will bring a wealth of experience, as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use into the setup.
I always felt that he was created for the international cricket competition, as a player or a coach, and like Mahela he has insights that we can benefit from.
Sometimes new voices in the changing cabin can bring fresh winds, even if the messages are in line with the previously said ones.
Colly's teammate at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not used at the One-Dayers, Root received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part.
Some won't agree, but coaches and team makers don't set the schedule.
And you have to remember that as with the players, their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not taken lightly.
The Brexit store (Brexit = UK exit from the EU) could gain in turn if the economy went into a flood by 2017
David Cameron's unprecedented renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is becoming increasingly difficult every day, even without the choice of brilliant Jeremy, Is it Yes or No, Corbyn as the leader of Labour or the TUC, who is fiercely disputing on Tuesdays because of Europe.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat friend recently said that some Member States, so deeply entangled in various crises, as the EU is now, and not always out of its own fault, the UK's self-created agenda is filled with split concessions and disruptive treaty changes, which they usually do not want.
In Brighton, the TUC decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if it endangers social protection.
We could also call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
Prime Minister and finance ministers climb to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then come home and say they win allies for reforms.
It's always about me.
My European friend, who wishes to see a UK looking outside the EU tent - \"Don't let us alone with France - says Berlin - and lets us see that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials have come to the point where they don't care if we stay or go.
Germany's cautiously appointed chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her, as it has happened during the exaggerated long endurances like Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France's François Hollande looks forward to his reelection or replacement in 2017.
He's also a fading force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right government, Spain a left.
It is difficult to imagine that they will tear out a leg to help the selfie British, whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland's withdrawal from the UK - something they also do not want because most of them have similar separatist tendencies.
Therefore, some such ministers may even intentionally plan non-helpful remarks, quite in the SNP style, during the UK's 2017 referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my friend guesses.
“The renegotiation was a pleasure - and - Great Britain won nothing of value from the renegotiation -
Europeans know how predatory Fleet Street can be at its expense and which EU sceptics are the oligarchy of the press barons, as they were during the 1975 conference inspired by Tony Benn, which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2:1.
They can easily recall Boris Johnson, the Orz-Euro opportunists, who made a name for themselves as a “EU-Gerade Banana” Brussels correspondent in the early 90s.
In all his madness, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
This included the Medley of tax-fearing villains, telephone-hacking foreigners and the pseudo non-residents who own most of our big newspapers.
Actually Tony Blair thought similar about her, but found that if you sit in a cage with a hot gorilla, you better distribute bananas to distract it rather than become his lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blair than Blair himself when he resisted Cameron's referendum vertebrate, because Blair had put the principle of the EU's unapproved constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which opened a back door to him.
The press never forgave him.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly clapping on my back on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he no longer needed time for me to waste - seems in danger to repeat Neil Kinnock's boycott Murdoch's strategy of the 80s, a mistake back then and today.
It may take, but he has to develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe - I would like to express it kindly - is in development.
He says we should stay in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside Ukips traditional blue dye trend and the wilder filths of Tory's little-Englandism can probably say yes to anyone.
It is what Hilary, a Benn, but no Bennite, said on radio and television this week, when the Pathfinder fought in him, not to admit that Corbyn's appointment of the provocation John McDonnell as a shadow chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70s when his old father tried on television to be illoyal to his Labour cabinet colleague without going too far and losing his cabinet Job.
Hilary's struggle was even more attractive.
But fighting to remain \"under all circumstances\" - Benn's expression - was not what McDonnell said, nor what JC told his fellow fighters and delegates after all the reports they had received on Monday evening.
Whatever you want to convey Corbyn's touchy bottom-up image - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the strudel of social media, a breeding ground of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right not to give Cameron a free card for Europe that allows him to keep Labour's support in the referendum campaign for a self-evidentity, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's fundamental multifacetedness to EU membership - in line with their Bennite siege economy, its anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a question of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents, for whom narcissism of the small difference is a central principle of dogmatic disputes.
As with his multifaceted ideas on Nato - Tom Watson is firmly convinced that JC does not start a campaign to leave - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find a sense in everything for their superiors at home.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspicious voters - in order to make concessions to the British if this can be all pointless?
The US is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cut in the Tory government in power, which I was reminded of at the start of Monday of something called the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticize Public Health England report on e-cigarettes
Claims made by a state-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting of 12 people, partly linked to the tobacco industry, said researchers.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet by criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the basic report last month and described it as a comprehensive review of the evidence.
However, some researchers have questioned the taxability of the data and have pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
A editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the “extremely windy basis” on which PHE based its most important conclusion.
Two other researchers write in BMJ and have asked if the assertions are building on stone or sand.
Martin McKee, professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: \"A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the evidence of effectiveness,
They said that the public expects that the assertion of PHE that “the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking is based on a detailed review of the evidence and modelling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single session of 12 persons called upon to develop a model for multi-criteria decision-making analysis (Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis - MCDA) to lead their opinions on the damage to various nicotine-containing products to synthesis; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO should have previously received funds from British American Tobacco (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed BAT's references to public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants at the meeting said to receive funds from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but they did not add the funding he would have received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, according to reports.
The reasons for selecting the members of the board are not delivered, but include several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of which also indicate industry funding in the paper.
Some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know-how in tobacco control.
The PHE tobacco leadership also participated in the meeting.
The group's research work, which is characterized by the fact that there is a lack of \"hard evidence of the damage of most products in most criteria\", wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these connections or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that PHE’s claims that “there is no evidence to date that e-cigarettes serve as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers” were premature.
Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, said that BMJ's claims had already been responded to before.
He said: \"E-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking\"
Every second life-long smoker dies from his addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are small compared to that, but that we continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has the clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence proves and what is not, especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die every year from smoking, and smoking costs the National Health System £2 billion a year.
By presenting up-to-date evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking, we fulfil our national competence.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says former head of Channel 4
The former president of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said the BBC should stop sending programs like EastEnders and The Voice. He said that commercial rivals would give their right arm for hit shows like the Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the type of programmes not sent by other UK broadcasters.
He criticized the BBC for placing public-law programs, which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience, in hard-hitting time windows against the most popular shows of their rivals and by broadcasters such as BBC4.
After BBC Director General Tony Hall said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that for six years in his time at Channel 4 he had tried unsuccessfully to get in touch with BBC.
“I have problems with the idea that BBC is in charge or sending programs that would also clearly show non-subsidised rivalries,” said Johnson to the Oberhaus Communication Committee as part of his investigation into the future of BBC.
If you want to keep the broadcasting fee, which I do not consider to be a good idea in the medium or long term, you should at least give its production on programmes that others do not make or commission.
They send The Voice in a first-class time window because they want to achieve as broad a support as possible for their future.
The idea that nobody else would show this is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's, of course, nonsense.
Johnson said: “I don’t see why a regressive tax program could be financed without subsidies.
The Voice is such a program, EastEnders is another, admittedly both of its own productions.
Frankly, other channels would give their right arm for it.
I am trying to see how this should be public-law television.
I don't think this would reduce BBC at all.
Johnson, an entrepreneur for series, who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that BBC is guilty of hunting for reviews, because of the ambitions of the people working there, and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long-term support,
His comments on the most popular broadcasts of the BBC reflect what the former head of Sky, Tony Ball, suggested in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC should sell shows like EastEnders.
Johnson said that the more public-law niche programs should go to BBC4, where you can't quite measure the audience, but they do perform their tasks, and they can argue if they go on their seemingly sacred missions to justify £4 billion of broadcasting fees, \"Well, of course, we've created all these obscure programmes that nobody has seen,
They put them in a time window where no one ever wanted to see them.
For the broadcasting fee, Johnson said to the Committee: “I urge you to find a more regressive system in terms of terms and conditions for those who can get the best out of it.
Of course you all think, we all think that you get a great value for £150 a year here, but for people who are a lot of money for the £150, ask me if this is true, because they don't consume much from BBC.
The former Sky and Channel 5 chief David Elstein, who also announced before the Committee on Tuesday, asked the BBC to review their Reithian mission to \"inform, form and maintain\"
He said that little of BBC production would now officially be classified as education - he said that it was 1% of its TV production and 0.1% in radio - and it should take an example at public-law television stations in Australia and Canada to \"inform, clarify and entertain this\"
On the question of partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas like those of the proms, of which he said that only a handful will be shown on television, and enter alliances with commercial broadcasters to make everything available online.
'Songenetics' can control brain cells by sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change direction at the moment they are irradiated with sound impulses.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by bursts of sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change direction at the moment when they are irradiated with sound impulses that have too high frequencies for human hearing to be heard.
The impulses work by switching on Motoneuron cells, which are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves.
More on this topic: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said the worms showed the power of a new procedure called sonogenetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, researchers at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that one day the procedure could replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Fading worms do not usually react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did when surrounded by a fluid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found out, amplify the ultrasound waves that then penetrate the worms.
The enhanced ultrasound waves affect structures called TRP-4 ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worm cells.
The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned, according to a report Nature Communications.
In order to create ultrasound-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically changed the worms so that some of her motoneurons carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When it applies ultrasound to the modified creatures, the sound waves are reinforced by the microbrushes and transferred to the worms where they activate the modified motoneurons.
The procedure has some similarities to optogenetics, a pioneering tool that enables scientists to turn on and off neurons with impulses of light.
But Chalasani said that sonogenetics could have some advantages over this technique.
In contrast to light that must be sent down to the desired site in the brain at an optical fiber, low-frequency ultrasonic waves can pass tissues unhindered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull.
“We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the human neurons targeted susceptible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments,” said Chalasani.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture equipment - right in front of your doorstep!
The ads shamed Britain's arms trade
Amnesty International Anti-Weapons watch fair video.
Terrible killer drones!
Foot joint dissipating leg fetters!
Straw bombs!
And electric shock rods that cause painful pain, but don't leave a trace!
The cheerful voice and cartoon images leave no doubt that this ad for the world's largest arms fair is a combative parody produced by Amnesty International to bring the British government's willingness to ramp up weapons to repressive regimes via the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign also leads to many posters, which can be seen at bus stops and in subway trains and which require a second look.
\"Important announcement: From 15 to 18 September, drive with DLR (Docklands Light Railway) is read in the London Underground font types and the trademark of the DLR line, which changes to the image of a tank.
In September, a swarm of arms dealers will drive DLR ... customers will be asked to help stop the weapons fair.
The 300 posters are from artists who have exhibited their work at the Museum of Cruel Designs in Banksys Dismaland.
A collective named Special Patrol Group helped with the distribution in London and used “Ad Space Hack Packs - a £6 pack of bus keys, of which it is claimed that “access to about a third of the bus stop advertising areas on the planet”
Transport for London does not find this posterist- \"vandalism\" funny.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists become more critical and try to bring political work to the public outside of galleries.
Many artists work with activists within protest movements and notice that they have to move outside into the real world so that their art has an influence on society.
Another of the anti-weapon trading sites greets the commuters on the subway.
The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP, who works incompetently with the graphic and voiceover artist, who also works for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was amazed at the silence that existed around advertising for the weapons fair - through an exCeL calendar empty space - and thought: \"We give them the campaign that they are trying to avoid,
They played with the invention of a more realistic, divisive company advertising, but “it remains more liable by bloating with bright colors and animation.”
“They have done a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair,” says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we need now is an intervention by the British government and the guarantee that torture equipment will not be dealt with illegally in front of our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art around the arms fair comes from the area within ExCeL, where exhibitors scramble fantastic euphemistic products.

Eight golden rules for living in student homes
Eleven years ago, as a self-forget 19-year-old, I moved to a student's home, still in the belief of Berets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the tense smiles of those whom I have upset - and the numerous, lengthy complaints about others.
Most of what I learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
The entrance to student homes ranges from slightly nervous to absolutely frightening.
It is tempting to blackmail: tell people where you come from, whether and where you took the Sabbath year, where you stand in relation to Corbyn, and why you really don't love Marmite or hate her, because seriously, boys, it's just a yeast extract HAHAHA, I'm in my room,
Breathe through.
And help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest.
It directs the conversation and helps you find out the people you like in contrast to those you wouldn't talk to, even if your eyelashes were on fire and those fire extinguishers.
Leave people.
The rooms of people often turn into drinks receptions, film-night venues and municipal meeting places, but they are also the places where people dress and clean up their underwear.
Related to this: Do not think about starting a relationship at the university
Introverts receive rough treatment at the university.
Your room should be a refuge, but many student homes form a space-to-room boom culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.
That could be hell for someone trying to recover.
Nothing in culture allows you to say: “I like you, and I want our friendship to continue, but you have to leave so that I can get back the energy I used for interacting with you,
Try to feel when a comilitone is exhausted from socializing - and send it a text instead of knocking on it.
Call the call: Do it.
A guy in my student home had the idea that an unclosed door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Close friendship by baking.
Since you start the university at the height of the back mania, knocking at the doors of people to introduce yourself with a plate full of brownies is less strange than welcoming the 1950s's \"welcome in the neighborhood, I've baked something for you. So, and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions,
Offering homemade delicacies is a good way to make friends.
Your fellow residents feel obliged to entertain themselves and may eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
Badly mixed lumps of flour, sugar and fat cause people to fall asleep when you knock on.
Stealing food is a common crime in student homes.
Of course, clawing chicken is a theft, but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too?
Check with the milk owner.
The chances are that they say to use themselves, even when cooking inside.
If someone steals your stuff, that's annoying, and you have my compassion - but try to handle it more balancedly than my fellow resident who added a dish to her milk to punish thieves.
She's in jail now.
You shouldn't make a noise that keeps people from sleeping or working.
It is not just about being a decent human being, but that in the truest sense of the proverb you belong to the people sitting in the glass house.
A girl on my hallway asked her neighbors if it would make them a little bit quieter than it would be three o'clock in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
They responded with even louder music.
When they finally stopped at 5 o'clock, she kindly let her neighbors sleep for two hours before she had their own music patched, locked her door, and turned to her three-hour examination.
Would it not be romantic if your future spouse accidentally moved into the same student home?
Conversely, wouldn't it be embarrassing if you were to hold a roommate for your future spouse, run to her, split up again and then see her every day and perhaps live with her as she pulls all of her friends over to herself?
Of course, the heart goes its own ways - but if a hot fellow is definitely not your future spouse, at least try to give your underage a little reason.
In the exciting moment when you notice that someone has left his keys in his unclosed room, the boundary between an ulk and mobbing is finer than it seems.
A good string is funny, but it only takes moments until it becomes a boomerang.
Give a valuable and amusing lesson about safety by hiding - but never savour someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their door, and place their keys in a glass of water, which you put into the freezer - but do not cover their belongings on the ceiling more than twice.
Rowhouses for refugees, single parent, low earners
The real estate contractor Markus Gildner builds rowing houses in the mediterranean corner halls for people who don't have much money.
For example, for refugees - but also as a signal: “Not only refugees need living space, but also the single parent and the low-income person”
“I’m showing how to build cheaply and well even today,” says the 44-year-old in the interview.
Thousands of refugees will be forced into the housing market.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes in knowing how to quickly create favourable housing: he builds series houses for refugees in a project.
Mr. Gildner, many refugees will be pushing the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: Massive accommodation in containers or gyms has no sustainability.
Because people stay here to a large extent.
Given the flow of refugees, we also need sufficient housing over the next decades.
A completely banales, three-storey rowing house is the solution.
Gildner: A rowing house needs the least space.
It facilitates integration.
That's different if you put people in living quarters.
Each of the six houses built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each.
Each apartment has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room.
It may be that many refugees will say, it's peace again, I'm going back.
Then the houses can be converted easily according to the respective needs.
How high are the costs?
Gildner: The price for 160 square meters of living space per house is 184 000 euros, without land.
That's manageable.
It took six months to build.
That's appropriate.
Have the construction regulations complicated their plans?
Gildner: I've done my project correctly.
Especially complicated it always makes the threatening Damocles sword special construction and the parking regulation.
Clumsy.
It is still subject to at least three pitches, who creates three apartments in a rowing house.
Only in the cities there is no space for this.
And refugees and asylum seekers have no cars.
How did the residents react to their rowing house project?
Gildner: There were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
What's definitely wrong.
But don't you compound the competition for affordable apartments?
Gildner: True: We had a building boom in Germany over the last five years, but luxury apartments have been built that can hardly afford one more.
My project has the message, even normal people need living space.
Not only refugees, but also the single parent or low-earners.
I'll show you how to build cheaply and well today.
That's what it's about.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystem technology in Regensburg and initially engaged in environmental analysis.
iOS 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
The new operating system can be requested by going to the settings app, typing \"General\" and then selecting \"Software Update\".
When ready, the phone gives you the option to download and then install.
Some have encountered problems after installation as they receive an error message that says that the \"software update failed\".
To deal with the problem, users are advised to either wait until the response goes back or try to update via iTunes.
The phone itself will guide you through the rest of the process.
This may mean deleting apps to create space - but Apple has made this more unlikely by slowing down the update. It will also be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then reinstall them once the process is complete.
It is worth ensuring that your mobile phone is charged during the upgrade or is located near a charger so that the battery is loaded.
If the load is too low, Apple does not allow the update to continue, as the phone may turn off half way and this could lead to a discontinuation of the update.

Rosberg's only currency: Full Attack
Nico Rosberg knows only one choice in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team colleague Lewis Hamilton: “Full Attack”
Before the start of the World Cup, the World Cup's second emphasised the crucial seven overseas races, \"that I have nothing to lose\"
53 points separate the vice-world champion before the night race in Singapore on this Sunday from title defender and two-time champion Hamilton.
The British won seven of the previous twelve season races and also attacked the floodlight Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite.
In 2009 and last year, the 30-year-old Brite won the race.
Whether the current smog in the city state will influence the Great Price of Singapore is still unclear.
For days a dark bell hangs over the city, triggered by fires on the neighboring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger Chess Club has a prominent member
Founded three months ago, the chess club, Schachfreunde Bad Kissingen, has added another member to its ranks, thus increasing its membership to 19 players.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess player and tennis player who has been in Bad Kissingen for more than 40 times.
Gauselmann is the carrier of the German Cross of Merit 1. Class and honorary citizens of the cities of Espelkamp and Lübbecke.
The chess club in Bad Kissingen supported Gauselmann with a donation that President Alfred Klein received.
It is therefore possible to include chess players who cannot make the membership contribution.
Youth and talent search should also be driven forward.
Gauselmann wishes to see the membership of the chess club and friendly contact with the tennis club \"Rot-Weiss\" as an expression of his association with the spa town.
Quarterly office is looking for direct contact
Saludis and the Antonififitz Old Center have met under the coat of Social Foundation and a new starting point has been opened at the Graf Stauffenberg Square.
In addition to discussions you can participate in courses there.
The Social Foundation pulls it down from the mountain into the city center.
More specifically, the Graf-Stauffenberg Square.
A new district office was recently opened there.
From now on, right next to the shopping market, seniors and consultants will receive information on issues such as health insurance or health insurance services.
For years, with our outpatient care service, we have found that often nursing families are left alone.
There are infinitely many questions.
“Even many cash benefits are not rarely used, because the complexity of the insurance companies is hardly yet understood, explained the new landlord, Jutta Weigand, who is also responsible for Antonififit and the civil hospital as well as for the outpatient service, Amadeus.
In addition to the consultations, the new district office also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
For this purpose, the Saludis was taken into the boat.
Therefore, you can use additional offers such as stroke prevention, memory training or physiotherapeutic treatment.
The offers from the Senior Centre and Saludis complement each other in an ideal way.
Saludis stands for prevention, prevention and reha.
“The Senior Centre for Care and Care - Heike Riedel, Managing Director of Saludis.
The reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre is particularly evident in demographic change.
For this makes a good decentralized infrastructure in the individual parts of Bamberg indispensable in the future.
In addition, as Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) stressed at the inauguration celebrations, the district office also devoted itself to the association at the age: “There are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular social gathering,
The Social Foundation is thus making a major contribution to enabling seniors to live independently and well in their familiar environment.
The district office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9am to 14pm, Tuesday and Thursday from 16am to 6pm and Saturday from 10pm to 12pm.
Bamberg's campaign against Würzburger Kickers on October 6th
Now it is official: After the date for the game FC Eintracht Bamberg against the Third Ligist Würzburger Kickers had not yet been set for the renovation work at the Fuchsparkstadion, the 6th of October has now been set as an appointment.
The meeting of the FC Eintracht Bamberg in the eighth finale of the Bavarian football totopokal against the third-ligists FC Würzburger Kicker has now been finalized.
It will be played on Tuesday, 6 October, at 7 p.m. at the Bamberg Fuchsparkstadion.
“We’re happy that we now know when the game is over the stage, we now have planning security - according to the FC team manager Karlheinz Hümmer, who also points to the now started card pre-sale.
It is something special for our team to play against a third-party party.
We therefore hope for numerous viewers, and this is not without reason, because floodlight games have a special appeal.
In 2010 the FC Eintracht Bamberg won the 1st FC Oberhaid (3:1) in the final round of the 16 teams and took home against the 1st FC Schweinfurt 05 (3:2).
The winner of the competition receives 5000 euros and is qualified for the first round of the DFB Association Cup 2016/2017.
The title defender is the third league downhill SpVgg Unterhaching.
Vienna architect Karl Mang 92-year-old deceased
Karl Mang, one of the Doyens of Vienna's architecture, is dead.
He died on 5 September at the age of 92, as the artist's house announced on Tuesday.
With Mang, the Künstlerhaus lost an honorary member and, at the same time, one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna, as it was called in the broadcast.
Born in Vienna in 1922, Mang studied architecture at the Vienna Technical University with Friedrich Lehmann during and after World War II.
Since 1952 he has worked as a freelance architect, but he has also worked as a teacher, writer and head of the institute.
From 1972 to 1983 he was president of the Austrian Institute of Formation.
In the 1980s he was assigned to the Austrian Theatre Museum with the establishment of the treasure chamber in the Vienna Hofburg and the reconstruction of the Lobkowitz Palace.
Park penalty: Tim Wiese commissions police officer with money
Ex-footballer Tim Wiese is unwell in Bremen.
The footballer was once involved, now Tim Wiese, ex-national gatekeeper in Germany and at Bremen and Hoffenheim, Wrestler.
According to his own statement, he wants 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the past two years.
He has not, however, been intellectual.
In the centre of Bremen, Wiese had his hair cut just when he saw a parking guard outside exhibiting a penitentiary for his white Chevrolet Camaro.
After that, Wiese stormed out of business, insulted the officer, and threw her the usual fine at her feet, as reported by the “Image“ newspaper.
The city of Bremen confirms the accusations, but is not yet clear about the consequences for the unusual incident.
“The matter is still under trial,” says the city of Bremen.
Only after that will it be decided whether to show the display or not.
Panama authorities destroy 4500 marijuana plants
The fertile soil and the rain forest-type climate of the Isla del Rey are ideal for growing marijuana plants.
For three days the authorities of Panama have been ripping out the 4500 plants and burning them.
Men are beating 17-year-old Afghans.
Witnesses are looking for a police incident in Bad Soden-Salmünster: On Friday evening, at 23.45 p.m., three young men were walking from Bad Soden towards Salmünster.
One of the group, a 17-year-old Afghane, reportedly followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him.
At that time the group was at the level of the bft branch.
Three people were also present on the petrol station site.
One of these men now screamed at the young people and hit them face with the fist.
The victim suffered a nose bone fracture and was bleeding heavily from the nose.
When his two friends came to the blower, he let off his victim.
His friends now brought the injured young man home.
The perpetrator chased the group with a car up to their apartment and passed by demonstrably several times.
When the vehicle was no longer visible, the injured person went in front of the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was again attacked by the murderer and another male person.
With the help of a batting stick, the victim's face and thighs were beaten.
The injured person had to be hospitalized for medical care.
So far, there is only a vague description of the perpetrator.
One of the men was about 1.80 meters tall.
The second blower was to be about 1.65 meters tall and was clothed with a jeans and a brown-white shirt.
The police ask witnesses and announcers to report under phone number 06181/100-123.
Dr. Frank Müller takes over Felstehausen practice and invests 310000 euros
Silvia Müller-Gongoll and Frank Müller (from the left) take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen.
Samtgemeindermeister Bernd Bormann, Wirtschaftsförderin Uta Seim-Schwartz and Asendorfs Bürgermeister Heinfried Kabbert are pleased.
In many places in the country, doctors are missing - Asendorf, on the other hand, is lucky: Dr. Frank Müller will take over Felstehausen practice on 1 October.
While Ursel Felstehausen is retired, her husband Karl-Heinrich stands by his successor in half a place in the next few months.
After a restructuring phase, Müller reopens the practice on 12 October until that time he invests 310000 euros in the premises on St. Marcellus Street 6.
It was sympathy at first sight when the Felstehausens years ago met Frank Müller and his wife, Dr Silvia Müller-Gongoll, who is currently attending their specialist training at the Verden hospital and is also planning to enter practice next year.
“We always had in the back of our head that the Müllers would fit well into this practice,” says Dr. Ursel Felstehausen and laughs.
“When it was time, I just called her “
The couple Müller liked the idea of practicing their own practice in Asendorf in the future.
“The proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us,” says the 39-year-old Müller.
“We want to get to know and accompany families over the years,
As an advantage, he also sees himself soon to be his own boss.
And so one agreed, the Müllers bought the house with practice.
However, they will continue to live in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
There, the two-time family father Frank Müller was also raised, and his medical studies in Hanover followed in several medical practices, as well as in the hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He is currently a senior physician in Sulingen, and was appointed senior notary in Diepholz County in 2009 and is a volunteer in the DRK-Bereitschaft Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
From 19 September, the practice will be prepared for the new boss.
While surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen works as a home physician, his wife Ursel (internist) specializes in gastroenterology.
The Müllers, both interns, want to settle down as domestic doctors.
“The endoscopy is therefore out - says the 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongoll.
After the renovation, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long-term and stress ECGs and need a more speech room.
In addition, the EDP will be completely renewed.
The Müllers receive a total grant of 50000 Euros in the framework of a support programme from the County (25000 Euros) as well as from the Samtgemeinde (12500 Euros) and the municipality (12500 Euros).
“This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is being carried on - emphasizes the mayor of Samtgemeinde Bernd Bormann.
About 2000 patients, according to Silvia Müller-Gongoll, each quarter come into the practice of Felstehausen, in which North German average practice is about 500.
In Asendorf there is another home practice.
A positive side effect of the practice takeover by Frank Müller: According to Ursel Felstehausen, the pharmacy remains in Asendorf.
If no successor had found her, she would have gone too.
Those who visit Müller's speech hours also continue to look in familiar faces, especially: take over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power of the Felstehausen.
With their farewell end in Asendorf an era, after all, physicians have practiced there for 30 years.
“In the beginning we had only two rooms,” Ursel Felstehausen recalls smilingly.
She feels a little pain after a long time.
“But we still live in Hohenmoor and will see many patients a lot more,” says the internist.
Her husband adds laughing: “We have a 6000-square-meter base“
“I always pressed myself for gardening, this could be different now“
In addition, the couple has two grandchildren and likes to travel.
Croatia: \"We let refugees through \"
“Now border controls are also being brought up at our southern border,” said Minister of the Interior Johanna Mikl-Leitner.
The controls at the Hungarian border remain in parallel.
It is still clear that anyone who wants to make an asylum application could do so, of course.
People's supply and safety are at the forefront.
It is clear, however, that \"there is a need for clear signals,\" said the Minister.
People need to know that we do not accept boundless migration flows, nor do we over the Austrian-Slovenian border.
It needs a controlled approach.
Croatia considers \"Korridor\" - Slovenia refuses
The Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would also want to continue to travel towards Austria and Germany and, in some cases, set up corridors for refugees.
However, this interior minister Vesna Györkös Znidar did not see it in Laibach.
The idea of corridors would be \"absolutely unacceptable - Slovenia would rather intensify border surveillance, especially in Hungary.
The border with Croatia, on the other hand, has already been heavily controlled as an external border of the Schengen area.
As the Minister pointed out, Slovenin does not want to derail his borders for refugees.
\"Every EU member must fulfil his obligations, otherwise the system cannot function, said Györkös Znidar.
As the Croatian government announced, the first refugees had already tried to travel past the Tovarnik/Sid border crossing in the night hours to Tuesday in East Croatia to avoid registration.
The Croatian police were able to attack her in the nearby cornfields.
According to local media, since then, police vehicles with new refugees have been arriving in Croatian Tovarnik.
It was mainly about Syrians and Afghans, including numerous women and children.
Rescue services and the Red Cross are also already in use.
In the coming days, his country expects some 4,000 refugees, said Minister of the Interior Ranko Ostojic.
In addition, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had so far brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would redirect to Croatia, reporting Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday.
The government in Belgrade, however, argued that it was the people's intention to take certain routes: \"We can, we can still want to do this, it is called.
In any case, according to the media reports, a first bus with about 50 refugees had arrived in the Serbian border town of Sid, and further buses would be expected during the day.
About Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The inmates had been on the road all night from the Macedonian border about 500 kilometres away through Serbia.
“We heard that Hungary was closing, so the police told us to drive here,” said one of the refugees.
They wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria.
This could actually lead to the shift already predicted by observers of the previous Balkan route Turkey-Greece-Macedonia-Serbia-Hungary to a slightly further west.
Croatia: \"Comprehensive opportunities for border control\"
Croatia's Minister of Interior Ostojic had previously stressed that in the event of a strong influx of refugees, his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations.
He did not mention details, but he pointed out that Croatia, as a non-Schengen member, has comprehensive possibilities for border control.
There are strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area.
Slovenia has been a member of the EU since 2007, and EU partners have been giving a good witness to the country since then regarding the standard of border controls.
On the Serbian side, about 300 refugees are still stuck behind the Hungarian border fence.
According to Belgrade's media reports, they spent the last night at the Horgos border crossing leading to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings of Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely blocked.
Whether or not the refugees who remained wanted to continue to the Croatian border is still unclear.
Serbian Minister of the Interior Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm the debate on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed.
It would not be about very high refugee numbers at the moment.
It is not yet possible to say whether they would continue their journey across Hungary, Croatia or any other country.
Helpers rate migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun distributing maps to refugees, on which alternative routes through Croatia are marked.
However, the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not inconceivable: in parts of the border area there are also unscathed minefields 20 years after the end of the Croatia War.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police announced that a team of mine rooms in the border region had been sent.
Stock hackers: Ukrainians pay $30 million
Supranonok is said to have belonged to a ring of cyber criminals who are accused of having repeatedly provided insight into still unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire since 2010.
The information obtained is intended to make insider business in the financial markets.
In this way, the investigators were estimated to be worth more than $100 million.
\"Today's comparison shows that even those outside our country's borders are eventually caught, says the SEC Communication.
The trial against 32 other defendants in the case took place.
Most of the accused came from Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators should have acted both in the US and Eastern Europe.
Ecumenical hospice relief Mannheim has existed for 20 years
Around the Mannheimer Paradeplatz there is heavy operation.
People do their concerns, sometimes fast steps, sometimes comfortably bumping.
They control the two stations of the Mannheim Autosalon at the Paradeplatz.
Hold the city paths.
In the middle of the four large tables each with the title “Before I die, I want to...
The ecumenical hospice aid made this action aware of its 20-year existence and is clearly faced with mixed reactions.
“It’s about life, so we’ve gone to the city and among people with the action,” says Josefine Lammer.
The director of the Ecumenical Hospizhilfe is also available to passers-by for questions and talks as well as to volunteer employees.
While some of the passers-by spontaneously grasp the creed and can read the phrase for my life, which can be read by the camper through the USA, “stop the war, or not suffer for a long time, others remain brief, read, say sentences like “so far I am not yet” and then continue.
Again and again, small discussions about the action are developing on its own, about life, dealing with death.
Peter Hübinger is also on site.
\"Only if I make it clear to myself that at some point the end will come to this world, I can live responsibly,\" says the director of the Diaconian works Mannheim, who together with the Caritasverband is a carrier of ecumenical hospice aid.
Therefore, this public action was good for the 20-year-old.
That not everyone on the tables wants to share publicly, however, is understandable, and finally it is a very personal matter.
The subject of death and death has continued to be associated with Tabus, according to Josefine Lammer's experience, although the hospice movement in recent years has contributed much to people opening up.
An estimate that Angelika shares Godefroid.
The death and mourning companion is one of the employees of the first hour.
Through personal experience with the subject, she read a lot of literature and decided to join in the death aid.
When the Ecumenical Hospizhilfe sought honorary assistance by call, she immediately reported and was present at the establishment in 1995.
Godefroid is part of a team of 45 honorary - 43 women and two men - accompanied by individuals and family members in private households, hospitals, nursing homes and in the Hospiz Sankt Vincent.
They are all carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid can deal well with her task and the experiences and experiences she has experienced.
“I see the life of another wait, think it’s precious and appreciate the moment,” she says.
The Ambulant Ecumenical Hospic Service offers free of charge and confession-independent.
The financial support of health insurance companies and donations from family members and associations enables training as well as trainings and supervisions of the death and grief companions.
Training for new employees is offered every two years.
The tables described on Saturday are now displayed in the House of the Evangelical Church (M1, 1a) and in the House of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
Other personal wishes can also be noted on postcards.
FedEx result mixed, financial outlook lowered for 2016
FedEx reports disappointing results for the last quarter, and the supplier giant reduced its profit outlook for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transport service.
The company also said that it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
The stock fell over 2.5 percent in premarket trade 45 minutes before opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said to earn a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 in the financial year ending next May, 20 cents less than in the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84, according to a survey of FactSet.
The lower outlook comes despite the price increases, which average 4.9 percent and become effective on 4 January and despite higher increases in land transport costs of heavy and large packages raised from November onwards.
The company said that it still expected that the result would increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction, higher revenue and growth in the online trade.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company will achieve “solid yields if one considers the weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade,
Plans for holiday employment were announced one day later than those of the Rival UPS, which plans to employ 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, about the same number as last year.
In the quarter ending August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than in the previous year.
The earnings per share amounted to $2.42 per share, just behind the $2.44 per share predicted by twelve analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.
Sales rose by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $112.23 billion.
FedEx has experienced a decline in international priority shipping in recent years, which has led to the stagnating of sales in its Express Shipping unit.
But the boom in online shopping has increased the results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, land transport sales increased by 29 percent, but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
The Express Unit recorded higher revenue due to higher prices, while the result was reduced due to higher labour costs in the freight business.
In the premarket trade, about one hour before opening, FedEx shares dropped by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
On Tuesday they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent under a record high on June 11.
At their most expected meeting in the year, Federal Reserve Strategies spend two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduras Mahagoni table to decide if it is time to raise the central interest rate for the first time for almost a decade.
Threatened about them at one end of the decorated, two-storey sitting room is a wall picture of the United States.
The map is a reminder that Fed chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the nation's economic interests ahead of all other things.
The Central Bank has a twofold mandate from Congress: maximizing U.S. employment and prices here keep stable.
But since the big recession, the Fed leaders have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict. It is announced on Thursday that the U.S. economy is ready to be depleted from the unparalleled incentive by the short-term interest rate close to zero since the end of 2008.
Although most of the data from the economy show that it is growing solidly, recent turbulence in the global financial markets may make the already cautious Fed representatives anxious to strengthen this volatility by raising the interest rate on federal bonds - and be it only by a quarter of a point.
“The labour market and inflation will obviously be the most important thing they observe,” said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at the broker company Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
“But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to increase the interest rate, the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue to wait,” she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself is insecure to the financial market.
About half of the economists recently surveyed by Bloomberg predicted an increase in interest rates this week.
However, the financial markets expect Fed to be expected, with a key indicator showing only a 30% chance of an increase.
This indicates a decline in the stock market if the Fed increases the rate unless the strategies mitigate the impact by promising that a further increase is far removed.
On Tuesday the Dow Jones Industrial average jumped by 228.89 points or by 1.4% to 16.599.85.
The action was triggered by expectations that Fed policies would maintain the set this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed would raise the sentences at that time - he said.
If it does, “it must go very far in its declaration to calm the financial markets so that they do not panic,
Other experts argued that an interest rate increase would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
Even a month ago, the Fed seemed on a good path to increase the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the United States.
Yellen had said in spring and early summer that this year, despite the complaints of liberals that more economic progress would be needed, she expected an increase in the rate.
Although job creation slowed down in August, the improvement in the labour market was solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest for more than seven years and near the level that Fed sees as full employment.
Increases in wages have shown signs of recovery.
And although inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2% of the Central Bank, Fed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said that the economy can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the labour market stress.
But the financial markets around the world were collapsing at the end of last month, after China had devalued its currency.
In May the Dow Jones Industrial average fell below its peak by more than 16%, when investors feared that slowing down the Chinese economy would slow global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, with the Dow now almost 10% below the high of May.
For Fed representatives, the market turbulence affects the complex calculation when to increase interest rates.
“If the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks, they would have attracted the reins at this meeting,” said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former UCLA staff member.
Now he predicts that they will wait at least one month to get better grips on the effects.
“There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the U.S. economy, and there is almost no reliable data describing developments in China,” Oliner said.
The health of the world economy is not the main concern of the Fed, so it should not be technically involved in its decision-making.
But in the end, Fed has become the world's currency authority.
The central bank's influence has been enormous in recent years.
The mere indication of Ben S. Bernanke’s then head in 2013 that the Fed could “encourage their monetary expansion” triggered confusion around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed representatives can be expected not only to monitor developments elsewhere but also to consult with other central banks and experts in order to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
Their decision-making is, more art than science, said Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy for asset management of Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA., noted this month that “the Fed has a history of over-reactions on financial market movements that are not apparently linked to the economic fundamental data,
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, who is committed to raising interest rates, cited decisions in 1998/1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to reduce its central interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three meetings, “with a very limited evident impact on US growth,” said Lacker.
A year later, the Fed representatives withdrew these cuts.
The Fed was to put aspects of financial stability first only during a serious crisis such as the 2008 market collapse, said Adam S. Posen, former member of the Committee on the Bank of England's interest rate fixing.
The latest turbulences are not near this level, he said.
\"She certainly does not want to get into the situation where she is afraid of an increase in interest rates because the markets are getting up,\" said Posen, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that is changed, I do not think it should advance time.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/stock was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C is often referred to as Thai Costco and is a Thai wholesale market that also sells to the general public.
Yes, he is located in Chinatown and not in Thai Town.
The warehouse is a central starting point and offers a confusing number of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and dishes, furniture, religious jewelry and Christmas decorations.
There is even a car department if you need engine oil.
The store is huge, and it takes over an hour to sling through the corridors.
If the whole shop makes you hungry, there is a meal for you in the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The Garküche (good and cheap) in this store is located near the cashiers and has various take-off options.
What is it here: Do you need something - anything - Thai?
LAX-C probably has it.
Products are cheap and a number of them are sold in large quantities.
Fresh products include Asian specialties and regional Thai herbs, fruit and much more.
The meat store is extensive, as well as the fish store - the personnel behind the store will clean and fill the fish and even roast it on request for you.
A good part of the shop belongs to the massive freezing department. Here you will find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and gallant, whole ducks, fish, beef blood and gall, pig-natural intestine, fish balls, regional sausage, commercially prepared food and more.
Who buys here: restaurant owners and cooks, also individual families and individuals.
The wide courses are suitable for shopping carts and forklifts.
You will find here: fresh Monthong Durian next to the checkout.
Where it is located: The shop is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the outskirts of Chinatown and downtown - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot, along with other shops and restaurants.
Even if the store is well visited, it is not difficult to find a parking lot.
Hoyerswerda: Small aid to refugees
More and more refugees arrive in Germany these days.
To give you a warm welcome, do not go without the commitment of countless volunteer helpers.
There are also a number of people in Hoyerswerda who support non-profit asylum seekers in the city.
They include Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher with body and soul.
She still likes to teach with her 74 lenses.
Every Thursday she does it in the asylum seekers' home on Dillinger Straße.
There she helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan learn the German language.
Of course, this is quite different from teaching at a proper school.
Brazil's paediatric society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast-feeding
The Brazilian paediatric organization SPRS is trying to shock women about how important good nutrition is during breast-feeding. It is doing this with the presentation of pictures of babies sucking to breasts painted with images of unhealthy foods.
Mother's milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build up a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories a day.
However, new research findings suggest that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment mothers should make.
A current study conducted by Robert Waterland, Professor at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can negatively affect the immune system.
Exceptions to the new Bernried Sports Hall
The Municipal Council of Bernried approved the application for construction of the 2.3 million Euros sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof can be flattened for solar system.
The plans for long-awaited gymnasium construction at the Bernried Sports Grounds are progressing step by step: in the recent municipal council meeting, the elaborate construction request was unanimously blessed without major discussions.
Before that, the Board had also decided, among other things, on an application for a construction plan to be approved by the valid construction plan.
The \"exception\" was about permission for a special form with regard to roof construction.
Therefore, a \"satellach with a non-middle first and roof top\" is to be erected.
Background to the planning is the intended use of the roof area for solar systems: “We get a wonderfully large south roof together,” said Mayor Josef Steigenberger at the meeting.
In turn, the \"liberation\" was about the tilt of the roof, which is to be less than ten degrees, for energetic reasons, other than in the construction plan.
This significantly reduces the volume of the hall.
A \"freedom\" was therefore necessary because the building plan does not allow \"outsides\" in relation to the roof inclination, whereas the Bernried Municipal Council is usually more restrictive in the case of requests for exemption.
The Turnhallenbau, however, is not a recurring project: “We do not create a precedent, as Steigenberger said.
Turnhallenbau am Sportzentrum is a joint project of the municipality and SV Bernried.
Some 2.3 million euros have been calculated at a cost.
Grants are expected from school and wide sports promotion.
In the next process step, the application for construction for the 18 x 36 meter hall is now submitted to the Landratamt for examination.
Klinik Peißenberg moves to Schongau
The Peißenberg Hospital is scheduled to be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) will be new medical director at Schongau Hospital.
The station and the majority of employees move from Peißenberg to Schongau.
This is what the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the County seem to be, which Country Councillor Andrea Jochner-Weiß confirmed.
However, a decision is made by the Supervisory Board, and it will take place on Wednesday, 23 September.
If the plans were implemented, all of the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in Peißenberg would continue to work.
The vast majority were to move to Schongau with fishermen and the existing Inner Station.
The rooms were available.
In Weilheim, Jochner-Weiß, is to be offered a job for employees who can't go to Schongau.
The employees were informed of the plans.
The change triggered the termination of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has only been the medical director of the Schangauer Klinik since the beginning of the year and is now switching to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital.
According to Jochner-Weiß, the name \"Fischer\" came into play when he said he was ready to take the lead and switch to Schongau with his team from 1 October.
For the house in Schongau, this means in any case a \"upgradation\" and a widening of the offer in the field of internal medicine, according to Jochner-Weiß.
Fischer is a specialist in heart pacemakers and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) is specialized in gastroenterological diseases at the Inner Station.
Transitionally for the next two years, Fischer and his team, if agreed by the Supervisory Board, will lead both houses until next year the former Knappschaft hospital, which still has 35 beds, will be finally closed in Peißenberg after almost 140 years.
To date, the county had planned this for 2018 when the ongoing renovation at the Hospital Weilheim is completed.
Landraurin Jochner-Weiß, who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board, opposed rumors that the house owned by the federal button should in future be used as accommodation for asylum weavers.
“I exclude this,” Jochner-Weiß said, “as the property continues, there are several considerations.
Currently there is a short-term care of the Caritas and a daily psychiatric home.
“What better could not happen to us than that, such an opportunity does not come again, as Fischer said about the quasi move to the Lech, which has been taken by the employees “positively and very understandingly”.
A real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as a chief physician for over 30 years has not existed.
He had been asked by Schangauer colleagues to take over the position of medical director.
The Peißenberg Hospital (first 100 beds) has been repeatedly threatened with closure over the past decades, and departments have been closed, for example surgery and birth aid.
The handballs of the Rhein-Neckar Lions are required at Bergische HC tonight (20.15 p.m.).
Although the table leader of the Bundesliga is the clear favorite in Wuppertal, there is no reason to overemphasize.
Last season, the Badeners at the BHC experienced a painful defeat and have something to do with it.
Hunting accident with two casualties at Pratau
Two tractor drivers have been seriously injured by shots during their corn harvest on Tuesday afternoon.
During the aberntens on a cornfield at Pratau ( Wittenberg County) several hunters were in action, as the police told them.
After a shooting, a 63- and 22-year-old man suffered serious injuries and were taken to hospitals.
How exactly the accident could have happened was initially unclear.
The criminal police are investigating.
Missing 16-year-olds from Rhineland-Palatinate Victims of Violence
A suspect has led the police to the body of the 16-year-olds missing from Rhineland-Palatinate since Saturday.
In interrogation, the 20-year-old admitted to killing the young and throwing their body into a canal in Rockenhausen.
A 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate since Saturday fell victim to a violent crime.
The young woman's body was found in Rockenhausen near Kaiserslautern on Tuesday evening, as the prosecutor and police told him on Wednesday.
A 20-year-old, also arrested on Tuesday evening, who found the deed and led the investigators to find the body.
The 16-year-old had been reported missing on Sunday morning, after she had not come home as agreed on a visit to Rockenhausen on the eve of a autumn festival.
When searching for the young woman, the investigators first came across personal objects of the victim.
In the case of interviews in the group of friends and acquaintances of the missing persons, a suspicion of the 20-year-old finally emerged.
The alleged perpetrator then led the police to a canal in Rockenhausen, where the body was found.
According to the arrest, the authorities admitted in the police interrogation that killed 16-year-olds and put the body in the canal.
The 20-year-old was to be presented to the arrester on Wednesday, and the investigators put him to death.
Disclosure on the closer circumstances of the act is intended to bring further investigations.
Refugees need accommodation: Study warns against housing gaps
The situation on the German housing market is tense.
More and more refugees are looking for an affordable residence.
Pressure on the housing market is growing.
Social housing faces a challenge.
The distribution struggles on the German housing market have long begun.
With the arrival of refugees and job seekers from the EU, more and more people are pushing for a market that is already overloaded in many major cities.
They compete with low income citizens for the last affordable housing.
In order to meet the demand for affordable housing, 400,000 new units would have to be built each year by 2020.
This results in a study on behalf of the association “Social housing”
For comparison, 260,000 units will be finished in Germany this year.
This is where 140,000 apartments are missing.
Refugees are no longer required to live as asylum seekers after the first three months of their stay.
Many then enter the housing market and enter the long queues before the rental apartments.
According to the Federal Statistical Office, however, less than half of all applicants for asylum stayed for rent last year.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the increasing numbers of refugees.
The study also makes significant mistakes in housing policy in recent years.
Germany is experiencing a lack of housing, which is increasing from year to year.
Currently there were already some 770,000 housing units missing in the conurbations, complains Matthias Günther, author of the study.
Many professionals therefore resided in major cities in WG-rooms.
Young adults remained involuntarily longer because of the flute on the housing market in the “Hotel Mama”
In the major cities, the number of square meters per capita has fallen for the first time in recent years.
In order to solve the problem, the Alliance for Social Housing proposes a restart.
The aim is to re-encourage new incentives to social housing.
In this way, the basic employment tax could be waived and the basic tax imposed on supported housing temporarily.
In addition, according to the alliance, attractive tax amortization options would be necessary.
The funding programme for refugee accommodation of the Staatsbank KfW is already well received by cities and municipalities.
A good week after the start, on Monday evening, 184 million euros had already been received more than half of the EUR 300 million available.
Now the project could even be picked up.
Refugees have free guidance: Croatia and Slovenia set up corridors
After Hungary, virtually no more passage through, more and more refugees choose the way across Croatia.
Zagreb announces to grant the passage across Slovenia to the north without obstacles.
However, the route is dangerous.
Croatia wants to agree with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
“I spoke to the Slovenian Minister of the Interior, and if necessary, we will organize a corridor,” said Croatian Minister of the Interior Ranko Ostojic.
Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria and already belongs to the Schengen zone.
The EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
After the abolition of the Serbian-Hungarian border, hundreds of refugees broke up to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe.
500 people had come across the border at Tovarnik, reports Croatian television channel RTL.
Hungary had closed its border on the eve of refugees.
New laws, which came into force on the same day, also make proper asylum procedures virtually superfluous in Hungary.
Croatia wants refugees to pass.
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said: \"You can travel through, and we are preparing for this opportunity \"
These people are there, there are women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
However, there were people who did not want to live in Croatia.
The Croatian police had attacked the first refugees on the border of Serbia to the EU neighbouring country of Croatia in the morning.
Most media reports were from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They came both by bus and with taxes to the Serbian border town of Sid.
Immediately after their arrival, they would have tried to cross the green border to Croatia on foot.
At the Croatian-Serbian border, the refugees did not come to border fences.
For this, the border strip carries other dangers: there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav Civil War in the 90s.
Miner-rooms should now quickly create a safe passage.
However, after the end of the border, there are hardly more refugees.
On Tuesday, the police numbered 366 people.
Just before the closing of the gate on Monday it had been 9380.
The new Hungarian laws include the overcoming and damaging of the fence as a criminal offence.
In the southern Hungarian border town of Szeged 35 criminal proceedings were therefore initiated.
The convicted shall be threatened with imprisonment for up to five years and the deportation from the country.
According to the immigration authority, 94 applications for asylum were received on Tuesday at the newly established Transitzons, almost all of them - 93 - at the most important transition Röszke.
Among the applicants were 13 families with small children and two older people.
On Wednesday morning 40 more refugees would have stopped there.
In practice, however, no one has a chance to get asylum granted in Hungary.
In Hungarian terms, Serbia is a \"safe third country\"
The rejected asylum seekers are to be deported there.
In front of the transit zone in Röszke, only a few hundred refugees were gathered.
In Röszke, workers began cleaning up.
They collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people had left on the roadside in the past few weeks.
Locks were mined and one of the warehouses in the border area was rebuilt.
For the purpose of this reconstruction, nobody wanted to express himself.
After the end of the border between Serbia and Hungary, Austria will reach only a few refugees.
The country has also strengthened its border controls.
However, about 20,000 migrants remained in the country after government records.
In Salzburg, about 1400 people were waiting for the journey to Germany.
The train from there to Germany was stopped the morning at the direction of German authorities.
In Freilassing, smaller groups of refugees regularly met on foot.
Mayor drove \"Stranded\" across the border
“After the bridge festival on Sunday we were busy cleaning up, when suddenly ten people with suitcases were standing at the entrance to the tent,” says Wernstein’s mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted to train to Passau.
However, because Germany had surprisingly discontinued rail traffic with Austria on Sunday, it was for her in Wernstein that Stadler, who immediately offered his help and the stranded people along with two other helpers and their cars drove across the border to the Near Passau.
Before we sold the unsolicited guests once, with Jause and drinks.
We told you we'd take her by car to Passau.
“This was of course for us, as Stadler said in the OÖN speech.
They were very grateful.
A man could not take over a generous donation - 100 Euros for the firefighter.
“We were very pleased with that,” Stadler said.
The stranded train passengers had moved from an ICE to a regional train towards Passau on Sunday evening in Wels in order to attempt to cross the border after the short-term announcement that rail traffic to Germany had been discontinued.
The regional train, however, was abandoned before the border in Wernstein am Inn.
In Wernstein, the cross-border is generally high in the course.
The bridge festival associated with the Bavarian neighbours on Sundays, previously a two-bridge run sportily - organized by the Union Wernstein and Bayern from Neukirchen.
The fact that Viktor Orbán is now sending thousands of others to us is a logical result of a hypocritical policy:
Instead of helping Röszke in the Röszke camp immediately in the establishment of structures that guarantee humanity, our Federal Chancellor has highly official and publicly promoted the attitude of the Hungarian government in the dark circle of National Socialism.
The suffering of this policy is not only those Austrians who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the border areas.
The refugees will also need to find out that the land they have invited and welcomed is nothing more than another refugee camp.
It will be a great challenge to create decent conditions for those seeking protection in view of the ongoing refugee flows and the approaching winter.
And it will be an even greater one - to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad looking for 35,000 winter-resistant neighborhoods
Konrad has all hands to do with the refugee shelter.
Christian Konrad is accustomed to his word having weight.
The government has used the former powerful Raiffeisen banker to set up quarters for the thousands of refugees.
Konrad has already been given control of the chaos in the first reception center of Traiskirchen.
“We no longer have homeless people in Traiskirchen,” he reported about his first success.
The accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday was also done without a big swirling, Konrad said and praised the organizational \"master performance\"
The Ministry of the Interior, on the other hand, spoke of a \"crisis situation\"
Konrad expects a total of 85,000 quarters in this year.
In order to meet the number, 35,000 accommodation remains to be found in the next weeks - 20,000 will supply the countries, 15,000 of the federal government.
If there are more refugees, we can do it.
“But it’s not a barrel without ground,” Konrad said.
He has already had talks with the state chiefs.
These would have assured him to create quarters for the coming refugees as well.
“It’s good in Upper Austria,” Ferry Maier said.
The former VP mandater supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn to explain how the Church will help.
The asylum coordinator also puts great expectations in the ORF action - Helping like us -
On the platform, private individuals can offer uncomplicated accommodation.
In addition, hotels are hoped to be empty in winter.
Konrad and Maier criticized the standards for accommodation as \"very high\" yesterday.
In emergency times it could not be that quarter-bearers must maintain a certain height of the towel holders or size of the upper lights.
For a fixed period of time, \"not-standards\" would have to apply.
In contrast to the Ministry of the Interior, Konrad explains that he is more successful at housing.
I am an older man, to whom one does not say the untruth without further in the face.
Conviction is his most important weapon.
Konrad and Maier do not cause the Republic any costs, as they themselves explained.
Their number of employees wants to raise them to three to four.
The search for their own quarters has not been successful yet.
Konrad wanted to set up a container at Stephansplatz as an office.
But there seems to be problems with approval.
Linz demands a better division
No opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips-Arena and Design Center for the accommodation of refugees is planned by Linz.
This would not be necessary at the moment, since the persons concerned could currently be placed without these measures, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
However, further sites will be considered for the emergency.
The chief of the town is critical of the division of refugees within the federal state.
Other districts also have to make their contribution here.
Seehofer: \"Rares are not locked down\"
In a long phone call with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), Landesmaufmann Josef Pöhringer (VP) agreed on Monday the further action in the refugee question.
Seehofer assured me that the German borders will not be shut down.
The continued journey of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible.
However, there are now the appropriate border controls.
Special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer exist at all.
However, those seeking protection would be brought to Germany with regular trains.
From the other EU Member States, Pühringer once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee question.
The fact that Austria is now re-entering controls at its borders is a logical consequence for Pühringer from the action of the Germans.
The next Runtastic is a question of time
The general renovation of the \"new yard\" in the Linz industrial line is officially completed.
In four of the six floors of the office and production building, the listed IT Group S&T has moved in, the rest (2700 square meters) is to be rented to young, innovative companies from the technology sector.
“In IT, smart heads are our raw materials - and we have to try to make them work for us - says S&T chief Hannes Niederhauser.
He could imagine investing in startup firms of the New shipyard and later acquire them.
From the beginning, S&T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - of which Niederhauser promises a lot: “The next runtastic is just a matter of time,
EUR 1.7 million was invested by S&T in the location, EUR 3.3 million from the Techcenter, which is one-third of the city of Linz, the country of Upper Austria and the Federal Government (FFG).
The building is leased by Linz AG for 60 years to S&T and Techcenter.
30 percent of the 2700 square meters of remaining space in the building are already rented, for another 40 percent there are inquiries.
Lia-Peroni owner opened second store in the arcade
Furla handbags are at the heart of the new shop.
In fact, Jutta Breit wanted to raise a dog.
This project had to shorten the 49-year-old holder of Lia Peroni in the dove market arcade: Finally, she has now gained growth in the form of another business location.
In the Furla shop opposite the store in which they sell bags, suitcases, shoes and gowns of various manufacturers, they are now turning everything around to have women's handbags of the Furla brand, wallets are from 75 Euros.
Larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
Since yesterday the new shop has been in operation.
Previously, several weeks had been rebuilt.
“But I’ve spent a long time thinking about whether to open another store,” says Breit.
The decisive factor in the decision was, among other things, that the Furla producers, who are at home in Bologna, were also affected by the idea of their own location, where only their handbags are sold.
“We are the only ones in the vast Linz area who sell this brand,” says the mother of two daughters who have Italian roots.
Her fashion interest has been brought to the cradle by Breit from her mother.
I do the most good when something develops and I can show new trends at casual prices.
Why do some women use such a handbag when they see a beautiful handbag in aggravating, nor can the skilled woman answer with the latter's safety?
Maybe it's because a nice bag of every outfit is upgrading.
The Brülljesmacher from Kallstadt
The Palatine ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place whose inhabitants are called Angeber.
This feature also connects some to the billionaire who wants to become President of the United States.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for excitement.
Whether it is an enemy of the outside world, a journalist, or a knowledge gap in international crisis politics, the applicant for the U.S. President's Office is strongly rebelling against the election campaign.
And cut it off well.
This is also registered in the Palatine town of Kall, where the grandparents of the real estate billionaire came from.
The New Yorker with the Föhnfrisur is a term for many in the wine village on the wine road.
Some in the 1200-inhabitant site are over -ty corners related to it.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Pfalz: Donald Trump, here in electoral mode.
The Kallstadter Simone Wendel filmed a film about Trump.
And what do the villagers think about his goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world?
“I think this is kind of exciting, but it’s not so deeply impressed in its Kallstadt style,” says Simone Wendel.
The native Kallstadtrin has filmed an amusing documentary about the place and its famous sproutlings, including the Ketchup family Heinz, next to Trump.
Trump, who is not known for modesty, also comes to speak in Kings of Kallstadt (2014) with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he lived in Kallstadt.
To the king of hearts he did not bring it there.
While respecting the performance of the family, we also tend to believe that Trump is “a bit of a grandmother,” says Wendel.
By chance the top name that Kallstadt has in the circle, \"Die Brulljesmacher\" - to Hochdeutsch: the suppliers, she says.
Trump thus comes from the village of the suppliers.
Trump's success story began in 1885 when the later grandfather emigrated and opened a site for gold graves in the United States.
The foundation of the real estate group was the first land purchases in New York.
But the lives of the grandparents were not free of tragedy: their desire to return to their homeland in the long run failed in the Bavarian state, to which the Pfalz belonged at that time.
He did not record Trump because he had been dismissed once without permission, the director of the Institute of Pfalzische Geschichte und Volkskunde, Roland Paul, had declared film launch.
Trump was the grandson of an \"illegal immigrant\"
This is in contrast to the sometimes marked statements of the offspring.
He had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the United States and demanded the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.
“As the polter does, this is not so sympathetic,” says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative of Trump’s “The grandma was a born trump, the grandpa was born Heinz,”
The winegrower in retirement sees the American rather distant, \"he's always so blushing\"
Does he think Trump's coming?
“I can’t imagine that,” says the 72-year-old.
\"He never cared about Kallstadt,
The pensioner Veronika Schramm mentions as some Kallstadter, that a descendant of the Heinz family donated something for the church nail during a visit, which was generally well received.
“I can’t imagine that from Donald,” says the 68-year-old.
They find it better if he does not win the election because \"he has such radical views, I don't know if this is good\"
If those who had spoken in the United States at the time of his grandfather would have been the same as him, \"he would never have arrived there\"
“There are more interesting topics than him,” says Winzerdachter Sarah Bühler.
And as president?
\"It is not my President,\" she says.
And: \"The grapes will also mature without the President Trump\"
Wendels Film, for which Trump has been interviewed for a long time, has seen 12,000 cinematographers, even in the United States, awakening interest.
The oberbayerische Gemeinde Ramsau near Berchtesgaden is Germany's first \"Bergsteierdorf\"
From the hands of the Vice-President at the Deutsche Alpenverein, Ludwig Wucherpennig, the 1800-inhabitant village in the Berchtesgaden National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday.
There are already 20 mountaineering villages in Austria.
In the neighbouring country, the Alpenverein is responsible for awarding the award.
A \"Bergsteierdorf\" may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants.
At least one fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the reviews, despite the attempts of Nine to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson rush to Canberra to report the loss of the leadership of the liberals, but it has not made any major shifts in the reviews for today.
The breakfast show by Nine was broadcast by the federal capital when Malcolm Turnbull made the fall of Tony Abbott.
The Rivale Sunrise, with the moderators David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was part of a one-week series of international television broadcasts, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This disadvantage of distance did not seem to matter to Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise averaged 397,000 spectators among the five capitals, compared to 339,000 today.
Today achieved a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its number remained behind the last Thursday (343,000).
Today has closed the gap to Sunrise in recent months.
Today reached an average of 318,000 in August compared to the 330,000 of Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise has an average of 349,000 spectators at 314,000 at Today.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change affect these mornings more than Parliament does.
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for the review!
Written by TODAY on Monday, September 14th, 2015
The great novelty for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series star of Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father, who decides to settle with his two children on the coast of New Zealand, reached a very impressive number of 1,219 million spectators.
Critics had wondered if Thomson could wear a hit show solo without the Rafters Star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night answered this with a clear \"Yes\"
The Seven's X-factor remained strong with 1.136 million viewers and easily hit The Block (838,000) and TBL families (726,000).
Seven had mixed results on evening two of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17:00 to 17:30) of the new quiz show, moderated by Andrew O'Keefe, averaged 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (17:30 a.m. to 18:00) jumped to 623,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuires Hot-Seat (613,000).
On Monday evening, the first half hour of The Chase Australia reached 520,000 spectators and in the second half hour, 720,000 sat.
Hot-seat average 620,000.
The decline in the quotas of the second evening of The Chase Australia will be certain Nine will finally continue at 17:30.
The Chase Australia is a replacement for a million dollar minute that didn't manage to overwhelm the McGuires show.

The last three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
Secret revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unwittingly revealed who wins The Bachelor.
The woman, at which Sam Wood ends up in The Bachelor, was buried in the greatest secret.
And none of the three remaining girls will certainly not be able to tell if she is the one who received the last rose.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons fellows on the day before from three to two, you may have accidentally given a clue as to who the winner will be.
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed firmly until the finale on Thursday
All three women have been told in a lyrical way why Wood is the perfect man, calling his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner.
However, if the question is asked \"If you don't, who should get Wood's last rose\", their answers to the game destroyer could be who won the heart of the bachelor.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski both quickly - besides themselves - called Mackay as the best partner for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day.
“From the moment I went to the house and noticed (Sarahs) and Sam’s energies, I felt that they were quite compatible, and I thought about this throughout the show,” said Jeavons-Fellows.
“Sarah stands with both feet on the ground, it’s so fun to be with her - added Markoski.
I saw them together, and they have the right chemistry.
They feel comfortable and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple.
From her point of view, Mackay said that the visit last week made it clear to her that Wood could be “the One”.
“As soon as I saw him with my friends and the family, it became clear to me that this is not just a game - I’m set on him without reservation now,” she said.
And when she was asked who Wood should choose, if not she, she was mysterious.
“I don’t know if I can say that,” she said.
I love the remaining girls equally - it's a discord between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast on Wednesday, 7:30 p.m., on Ten.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest in his move to the United States - and there were many other teams who sent inquiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a smart decision.
Some coaches would have banned Hayne for the rest of the game on the bank when he lost a belt as the Aussie-Rugby-Liga-Convertit did in its first point return on Tuesday at the 20-3 victory against Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and gave Hayne the next opportunity to a point return and also to the running game after an injury by Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the changing cabin after the game.
Instead of grinding his rookies in front of the rest of the team through the mill, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly strengthened Hayne in his press conference after the game.
The 49er sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by specialist team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who told him to forget his past catch and take care of the next game.
Jarryd Hayne pecked at a point restored in the first game district by the Minnesota Vikings
It was certainly not the start Hayne and his massive Australian succession had hoped for his NFL debut.
After the Fumble, Hayne quickly left the field and later told Australian Radio Duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not imagine a worse start to his NFL career,
“That was a thing that happens now, you just care about the next game, and that’s it,” said Hayne.
Hayne compared Schnitzer to his original debut in 2007, when a pass in his own in-goal area led to a try for Queensland.
Overall, it was still a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posted for a photo with fans, holding an Australian flag after the game and posting it on his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss the rights of gays
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man, was arrested on a Siberian rollerfield with gun force.

Free voters demand the recruitment of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria due to the high numbers of refugees.
At the beginning of the FW autumn clausor in Großwallstadt warned of a serious crisis at Bayern's schools when there are no corresponding new teachers for the many new students: “We need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep the schools from collapsing,” said Aiwanger.
\"At any rate, we will receive rejections in the Bavarian education system,
The Landtag Group of the Free Electors met until Friday in the Lower Franconian Commune.
In fact, very different main topics were planned.
But the record number of refugees now dominates the Free Elector Meeting.
“Of course, the subject of asylum will overlay the clause,” Aiwanger said.
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria, just as they had during the Yugoslavian wars in the 1990s.
“This is not the case, we have to talk about the causes,” said the Free Elector Chief.
Free voters want to drop asylum applicants as soon as possible.
Therefore, Aiwanger also required more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum complaints: “We also need at least 50 new asylum judges,” Aiwanger said.
The FW chief criticised that several federal states were not consistent: “We need uniform standards from the federal states across the country,
‘Bayern departs, others do not
“We need to become more actionable,
But national policy in Großwallstadt should not fall under the table.
A long-term burner remains on the agenda: education policy.
For the new school year, Minister of Culture Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) launched the pilot trial at 47 Gymnasiums, where an extension of the high school level from three to four years is tested - in the result it will take another nine years to graduate.
But this is not enough for Aiwanger.
“The theme of G9 needs to be accelerated,” said the FW chief.
We demand freedom of choice for all high school students who want it.
Free ride at G9 wherever it is desired.

4 people killed after police shoot rubber shots on demonstrators in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police shot rubber shots into a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution, said an official on Wednesday.
The violence broke out on Tuesday evening in Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, senior district officer, said that more than 1,000 demonstrators had gathered outside a police station, with some of you throwing stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhakal said the police used tear gas and then shot into the air before they took off on rubber shots.
20 policemen and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber shots used, of which it is known that they can kill, but which are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently produced such a high death rate.
The debate was the last weeks of violent protests in Nepal's southern levels, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say that new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence.
There were also protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of the Tharus who wanted their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been involved in violent conflicts since the 10th century.
In August, when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centrally ruled for centuries.
Working on a new constitution has been on the move since 2008, but legislators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
The legislators voted this week on certain clauses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu, and officials said that the new Constitution could enter into force on Sunday.
Construction area planned in the city
The property at the Emder Youth Centre Old Post is to be rebuilt.

The preparations for this are currently under way.
It is planned to use the site for a mixture of commerce, commerce and housing.
One waits for the corresponding offers, it says by the city.
Which investor is being questioned is not yet clear.
In line with that, no contracts have yet been concluded.
The city of Emden had purchased part of the property located on the Ringstraße/Ecke Große Straße a few months ago and had the building on it demolished.
Project Hieve: Details are on the table
The plans for the holiday home settlement at the Small Sea near Emden take shape.
The investor presented public plans for the project for the first time.
A number of investors are further troubled - they fear the sale of their leisure refugium
For months, it was negotiated, grappled, debated and drawn behind closed doors.
Now the plans for a new holiday home on the Little Sea near Emden are on the table.
The interested party, the medium-sized Emder company, System-Bau, presented its plans for the first time in public on Monday evening in the City Development Committee of the Emder Raad.
This was originally on the non-public part of the agenda.
Under the pressure of the project critics and the FDP Group, who appeared to the investors and the administration of secrecy, Ralf Behrends went from the system-building management to the offensive: “We don’t have an answer to all questions yet,” he told the council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it is good to be able to meet all the rumors now.
The approximately 10 to 12 million Euros project has been under discussion for months.
The pictures and new details about the desired hotel construction were very responsive to the sea-budget owners who had come to the meeting.
Roberto Schulz, meerbudenowner and board member in the interest representation of the investors, Pro Hieve, complains: “This will be a giant clod, which surpasses all other buildings,
In addition, he fears, like many other project critics, that traffic would increase greatly by the intended size of the facility: “There must be whole bus loads to make sure that this is calculated, as Schulz says.
However, what is happening exactly on the well one hectare area of the former restaurant is still open.
There's no operator yet.
“First, we must have a key concept,” Ralf Behrends said.
Because this was still missing, the construction plans were still variable.
Twins with Gorillas in the Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo is pleased with young people at its gorillas.
The 26-year-old Dian brought twins to the world yesterday.
Twin births are rare in Gorillas.
The last one in a German zoo is almost 50 years back and had also been in Frankfurt in 1967, it says of the zoo.
The sex of newborn gorilla twins is not yet firmly established, as Mother Dian holds them close to the body so far.
At first, the \"image\" had been reported.
NHC predicts 60 percent chance for Zyklon south of Cape Verde Islands
On Tuesday, the US National Hurricane Center predicted a wide low pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands, which has a 60-percent chance of developing into a tropical whirlstorm in the next 48 hours.
Another clearly defined low pressure system, for example in the middle between the Cape Verde Islands and the Little Antilles, also has a 60 percent potential to form a tropical whirlwind in the next two days, adding the weather experts stationed in Miami.
Google launches double donation campaign to collect $111 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced a doubling donation campaign to raise $111 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have overrun the European nations as they flee from the war torn and impoverished countries.
Google has an unusually personal approach when announcing the donation call on its blog.
Instead of letting a manager make the announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who had fled Kabul with her family when she was seven years old, wrote about her personal experiences.
“For our journey there were many dark train and bus rides, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear,” she wrote.
I was lucky.
But since the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe, many people like my family are desperately looking for help.
The donations go to four non-profit organizations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants: doctors without frontiers, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that the first globally collected donations are doubled to a value of 5.5 million on google.com/refugerelieve to $111 million.
Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many also fled Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya from the war.

For slightly overweight diabetics, weight loss surgery can be helpful.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years after a new study.
It is too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatments.
“The mortality data takes a long time to show something,” said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on weight loss surgery, who wrote a guide article on the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss operations or adipose surgery, use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body's own ability to absorb food.
Over the years, adipose operations for the treatment of type 2 diabetes have proven to be efficient, but most studies have been conducted in people who are ill-fed with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a certain measure of weight in terms of size, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital used data they have collected since 2007 in a study comparing two types of adipose chirurgy - stomach bypass and stomach hose formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI among those undergoing this operation decreased from 31 to 24,5 to the end of the fifth year in this study.
Meanwhile, BMI remained with those who received non-surgical diabetes treatments approximately equal to 29.
Among those undergoing surgery, 36% of those who suffered from diabetes were completely and 28%.
In the medical-treated group, only one percent of diabetes and only about two percent of diabetes were completely dissolved.
In addition, the authors found out the results of blood pressure, triglycerides and “bad - LDL cholesterol” controls, generally better in the ‘surgical’ group.
The researchers also monitored the patient blood level of haemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar over time.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.
After surgery, the average haemoglobin A1c level decreased from around 9 percent to around 6 percent.
However, in the medical treatment group it remained stable at about 8 percent.
But this better ‘glycaemic control’ - as reflected in the improved haemoglobin A1c level - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to leading researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the Bypass chirurgy group had lost more weight than the gas-atomy group (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), increased reductions in BMI (7.4 vs 5.1) and haemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%) and showed a complete reduction in diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
While the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone from the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study it was less likely to die over the course of 15 years in obese people who underwent adipose operation, compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study showed no benefit for survival in surgery patients, Blackstone said that it is reassuring for people with BMI below 35 who are interested in the procedure.
“This is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group, without increased risk of death or kidney disease,” she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously as soon as the patient lies with his BMI between 27 and 30.
“I think we’re waiting too long until we get people to take this seriously,” she said.
I think that as soon as they have accumulated these genetic changes that have firmly linked their bodies to obesity and diabetes, a reversal is really difficult,
Love story plays in the Hunsrück
It is a topic that currently finds greater attention in Belletristik: a young woman, unloved at school times and unwillingly, after years, meets the swarm of her youth again, and she falls in love with her.
So also in the recently published novel \"We aren't actually like this\" by Luisa Binder.
Beyond the love story, the novel should be particularly interesting for Hunsrück readers, because it plays in boredom and the surrounding localities.
The main professional author grew up in Langweiler and is pleased that she was able to set a literary monument to her hometown.
“It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe — Dalai Lama — RT-News
Europe could not capture all refugees, said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the refugees' home countries.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten-day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is devoted to ethics studies.
He called for the interests of humanity to be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents under the circumstances.
He also stressed that although the reaction of the Western European countries to the refugee crisis was a marvel, the situation was not appropriate.
“It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe,” he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria's efforts to cope with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
“To care for several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you have to think about long-term solutions, how a real peace and real development, mainly through education, can be created for these Muslim countries,” he stressed.
Finally, we need to consider how the killing is reduced in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of violence.
“The use of violence has never solved these problems,” he added.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush's action after the September 11 terrorist attack and revealed that the U.S. violent response drew a chain of uncontrollable events.
After September 11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to solve this problem lies in nonviolence.
“I know his motives were good, but he used violence, and this caused unexpected consequences,” said the Dalai Lama.
Fourfold increase in the intake of hand disinfectants by children over the last 4 years
Toxic control centers in the US report an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of twelve who swallow heavily alcoholic hand disinfectants, according to Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, the incidence of hand disinfectants in children under 12 years of age reporting poison control centers increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
“Children are getting more and more on these products, and unfortunately a percentage of them are going to be in the emergency - said Lopez CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectants deliberately, while some do it to impress their friends or because of a temptation in social media.
Videos on YouTube show how adolescents drink disinfectants only because of a cheap experience.
Teenagers have allegedly mixed disinfectants with alcohol-containing mouth water to get a tougher drink.
Younger children can be attracted by attractive fragrances of disinfectants.
“A child doesn’t think this is bad for it,” Lopez said.
Many of the more attractive (hand disinfectants) are those that are perfumed.
There are disinfectants with strawberry, grape and orange fragrance that are very appealing for children.
Hand disinfectants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
In the case of small children, few syringes can lead to alcohol poisoning.
“It is highly concentrated alcohol,” said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the poison emergency centre in the University of Kansas hospital, the Fox 4 transmitter in Kansa City.
So, you wouldn't let a swallow whisky stand around, but people let these hand disinfectants reach children, and when children get there, it's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently taken four syringes of perfumed hand disinfectant in school, was taken to an emergency care.
Her blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice higher than the threshold considered drunk in an adult, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency doctor who treated her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside of Atlanta.
Nhaijah heard her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room.
Doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children's hospital for signs of brain trauma, as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and hit her head, said Ritchey.
“That was very scary, ” said Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah’s mother, CNN.
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol-free products or disinfectants and to store hand disinfectants outside the reach of the child.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants were associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing hand disinfectants, which contained a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Health authorities' employees suspect that the product contained methanol, a deadly solution, rather than ethyl alcohol, which was noted as an active substance.
In January, three fourth grade students in New York State planned to poison their \"common\" teacher by putting out antibacterial products around the classroom, so a police report reports.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand disinfectants and banned them from her room.
The police considered the grounded plan to be ‘smooth’ and referred disciplinary measures to the school authority.
Villingen-Schweningen: Three vehicles damaged
A 33-year-old driver has been easily injured in an on-the-spot accident on the cross-spange between Nordring and On Herdenenen.
A 60-year-old truck driver drove on the cross-beam towards the roundabout industrial area and, too late, realized that two previous vehicles had stopped at the roundabout.
As a result, he grabbed his truck into the back of an Audi and pushed this vehicle onto a Ford Fiesta standing in front of it.
The accident-related vehicles were subject to damage of approximately 10 000 euros, the police informed.
The audience of the 33-year-old was no longer ready for travel and had to be dragged off.

The lack of title competition in Scottish football bores Dutchmen - de Boer
The former Rangers midfielder and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic, there is no title rivalry with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently an ambassador to Ajax, said: \"In Holland they no longer show any highlights of Celtic games and why \"
It's because the Rangers aren't here.
People here are not just talking about the return of the Rangers.
They're talking about the Old Firm.
They talk about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There is a lot of tension in the old firm games, and it's not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games.
I'm gonna turn things around, Deila swears.

I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what's happening.
We feel the same way - but we have to move on.
We really need the support of Celtic because that makes the players better.
Getting together is so important.
Warburton careful on January-transfers
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago, which indicated that he recommended some January transfers, Rangers-Boss Mark Warburton is cautious in signing new entrants and insists that he does not want to disrupt the Ibrox-Kaders unit.
The ex-Chief of Brentford said: \"The January transfer window is very different from the summer window\"
The players that come in summer have this preseason time to integrate what you saw with our own group this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.

Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged as it increases overall in the United Kingdom.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged in the period May to July at 164,000, while the number of people unemployed for the United Kingdom as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million in the same period.
Scotland's unemployment rate was 5.9 percent higher than the UK's 5,5 percent, as shown by the National Statistics Office (ONS).
In the meantime employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 over the three months, with the number of employees now at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 percent over the quarter - a number above the UK average of 73.5 percent.
The Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell commented on the latest figures and said: “The long-term plan of government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy,

Why I'll be a witness to an execution in Oklahoma
Something later, except for a late legal intervention, I will watch as a man is put to death.
When it happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I will sit in a spectator gallery in the Death Chamber in Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by the poison syringe.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation took place for the first time in January about his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day drew closer, I started to fear.
So why should I do it?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists may see executions in the United States, and as often more applications are available than places, a macabre lottery takes place to decide who is elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five.
Who is chosen, he will observe it emotionlessly.
I can't do that.
I will sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friend, with whom I developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hours visit.
I like that guy.
We often laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say that I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me of giving up my impartiality on Twitter.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner, how he wants it, and you get access.
I'm complaining to her.
She admitted that she could have formulated it better, but she still thinks it's wrong what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip had trouble with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it, even if he did.
I told him he could remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be present to write there.
When he dies, he thinks that the public work of the movement will help against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a Huffington Post reporter, will sit next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I have made.
I don't want to go back to all the details.
I can't say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after Barry Van Treese's murder would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the deed.
But I think there is a strong likelihood that he is not guilty of murder.
I believe there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from this perspective, I'll see him die.
I cannot claim to be really objective.
There will be other reporters to whom you can turn.
What you'll get from me is what it means to see a man die unnecessary.
Man, after damp police chase, persuades him to get out of the Canning River
The Canning Vale policeman remained dry when he persuaded the man from the Canning River.
An attempt by a man from Perth to hang the police was unsuccessful when he was in shallow and swampy water, just a few meters away from a police officer who was trying to “slowly persuade him to return to the shore”
The Canning Vale police were called on Tuesday for a house break incident in Beckenham.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to escape them towards the Canning River.
But he didn't get too far.
“He stood in the water and said, ‘I don’t come out, come and get me,’ said Senior Sergeant Shandl Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too excited about making his uniform wet, so he turned to a more reliable tactic - \"A good policeman negotiates -
“Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape,” said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Mastery football player Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car into the graves to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but inspired locals to the humorous planning of a Ben Cousin Biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that Stewards tried to spy him out and threatens to finish racing
Peter Moody claims that stewards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his stables last year and threatened to end the race immediately.
He aimed at the stewards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed to have carried out a personal campaign against him with the Late Scratching of Lady Tatai because of a racing day treatment, the last straw hall on Wednesday.
Moody said Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cobalt-tupfer sample at Lidaris that he cannot explain.
He had stayed for 18 months because of the espionage allegations and did not want it to be “like too high-hanging grapes”
“I didn’t want to say anything about it, and I’ve been sitting on it for a long time, but sometimes you’re so frustrated that everything comes out at once - said Moody.
You know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'll go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to handle raised heads, and I want my owners to think I'm trying my best for them.
If they start thinking I'm not doing that, then I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
I have to think about what I'm doing with my license.
Previously, Moody had raised the bomb in an interview with racing.com that the Integrity Department had tried to spy out his stall.
“Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown, and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man I will name when I am asked to do so, and offered him a job in my stables to deliver information about what I'm doing within my chairs, ” Moody said on Racing.com.
You seem to think I'm a cheater.
If that is the case, they should certainly touch their noses because they failed in trying to touch me.
Robert Roulston, former Chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, President of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of it at the time and are still today.
Should that make me think it's going to be personal?
Did the RVL behave cowardly and perhaps blame people outside of trainers for what is going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I so bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think it's me.
Maybe they have to accept my license and violate me, and I have no doubt that what I say now makes them think about it.
But I have now arrived at the point where I don't care, and that makes me sad.
That really saddens me.
I will put pressure on them and push them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The Frustration Level of the Trainer has built up with the long-lasting cobalt examination at Lidari, and the Late Scratching led him to say that he could \" throw his license over the table\"
Moody, best known for his preparation of the unbeatable Master Black Caviar, described the racing day treatment rule as ridiculous after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse legs, which violated the rules.
“It’s against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for this, he said.
“One of my employees wrongly applied mud to the leg.
It could have been like that last night.
It could have been like that all day yesterday, whatever it was.
But it had it on the race day.
Moody could be confronted with a three-month disqualification for treatment with the pack on race day. An investigation of this matter was opened.
It's a joke.
People who set up these rules don't know anything about the horse.
“We all see that we need rules, but here we’ve gone too far,” Moody said.
Man arrested after driver flight
The police arrested a man on weekends after a collision with a cyclist and then driver flight in Cobram.
The cyclist was delivered with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on the Murray-Valley motorway on Saturday morning.
The police said the driver went on without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday a 50-year-old man from Nathalia took up the police station in Shepparton.
It is expected to be accused of driver flight and missing assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram remains in the hospital. He is in a stable condition.
Melbourne storm coach Craig Bellamy beats against rivals for allegations of ring fighting
Melbourne-Storm coach Craig Bellamy has described criticism of the tackling of his players as \"Agenda-Setting\" by two Premier League favorites of the NRL.
Sydney Roosters Trainer Trent Robinson said that the referees allowed storm players to “ringfight” with his team during the high storm victory at the qualifying finale in Sydney on Friday evening.
Brisbane Broncos Trainer Wayne Bennett made a hardly veiled remark to the Storm team after his team won the final victory against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday evening. He called the game a \"pattern\" of the Rugby League and said that the two from Queensland were not \"too good\" in the rings.
Bellamy defended his team's tacking team and said that they were only focused on their \"contact\" during the tacking.
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading coaches on his team was confident, as it meant that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team.
“This is happening again and again - I didn’t hear Trent was talking to Robinson about ring fights, when they beat us 24:2,” Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed anything to our defensive system or techniques all year round, but in the last six weeks we've made our contact with Tackles a real focus, and this has brought the trend turn for us.
Trent has been there for three years now, and he obviously has a great team to train, so he is probably not used to losing it, so it was a bit of a shock for him.
It's funny how this appears again and again at this time of the year.
Bellamy has attacked Bennett's idea of \"spanning football\" and reminds his mentor that Bennetts St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with \"long-term\" football.
Wayne is talking about exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday evening with our one on Friday evening and how exciting her game was - said Bellamy.
I remember St George being criticized as a boring team in 2010, and Wayne said he would take care of it.
But now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting, especially his young players at their speed.
That's the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of player.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants all his kind of football to play - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play like these.
I build more confidence because they say these things because they are a bit concerned about having to play against us.
Six weeks ago they probably didn't think about us when it was about the Big Games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game storm against Roosters achieved a higher result than the game Broncos against Cowboys.
The game of the Broncos was probably a good game, I haven't considered it yet, but what was the result? 16: 12 ?
Our game was 20:18, there were two more trials in our game, but is this an exciting game?
Or are pauses taking and no points spanning?
For me, it's the game plans.
If they mention us, it means that we will still meet them in a phase.
The Storm team will be free on this weekend as they have won the right to receive either North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks at the AAMI Park on the next Saturday evening. Ticket sales will begin from next Tuesday morning.
Serbian with $200,000 deposit after drug addiction
A man who may be threatening a life-long punishment for his attempt to get into the possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled to Queensland was released against a $200,000 deposit.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of drugs on the yacht Solay, which came from South America via Vanuatu and settled in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was observed meeting his fellow accusers at the marina during the morning and later at the café Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a potentially lifelong penalty for attempting to own a commercial quantity of cocaine, Maksimovic's lawyer argued that there was no evidence that he was trying to own the whole quantity and that at the café could have been for a harmless reason.
The judge at the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the danger of escape at Maksimovic.
He has clear relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia - he declared the court on Wednesday.
On the criminal case, he lied to the police about his place of residence.
Maksimovic's mother and stepfather had offered a security deposit of $200,000 together to achieve his release.
“After reading the two parties’ statements, it is clear that the cost of security of $200,000 is a real financial burden,” said Judge Flanagan.
But that alone will not be enough to stop him from appearing, he warned.
Maksimovic was released against bail, under conditions that he gave up his Australian and his Serbian passport, signed up with the police daily, and stopped at a base block of 18:00-06:00.
Accident on A5 at Karlsruhe: Guide house tears apart
A truck driver has been seriously injured on Tuesday evening in the case of a three-car on the 5th motorway near Karlsruhe.
Two of the three trucks involved had been brakeed in front of a permanent construction site towards Basel.
The third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to deviate to the left at the last moment, as the police told him.
The driver's house of the accident causer is completely disintegrated.
The driver was seriously injured in a hospital.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe-Nord was completely blocked over six hours to 2 o'clock.
There was a damage of EUR 122,000.
Stevan Hogg's phone used by girls to lure pedophiles to send pictures
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to request pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone when this fell asleep, logged into an online messaging service, from which he received a series of inappropriate pictures of children that had been sent to him by another user.
The girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Hogg.
She saw it through, found the confusing news, and immediately alarmed her mother.
The police took care of this and saw the five pictures, then analyzed computers found under the address and discovered, relating to, web searches that used terms to search for inappropriate images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the officials that he did it, as it would lead to \"pedophiles on the Internet\" and then \"he pretended to be a police officer to scare them\"
State lawyer Eilidh Robertson said to the Dundee Sheriff Court: “He said it would be a search, - that he was addicted to frighten people.
He admitted that the searches on the computer were done by him, but said it had happened because he wanted to be a police officer to scare Pedophile.
He was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and who asked him to send more photos.
He said he did it to lure her.
He said he was sick in his head when he drank, and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added: “When the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was at the sitting and crying.
She then also saw the incessant pictures on the phone and confronted the accused with them.
The girl was interviewed and said that the accused used computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, declared guilty in the sense of the indictment of having taken inappropriate images of children on 14 June last year, on 25 January this year against the terms and not appearing before a court hearing on 24 March this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not appear in the register of sexual offenders, as it could be argued that \"no significant sexual element\" could be found in his offence.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the verdict until October to receive background reports on social work.
In this case, Hogg was granted security but was kept in custody for hearings on other outstanding cases.
It was included in the list of sexual offenders before the date of the judgment.
Closers weigh on small border crossings to Germany from
More and more refugees are being attacked apart from the major control points at the German-Austrian border.
Many lockers, out of fear of discovery and arrest, caused people to increase in smaller crossings
On the Austrian side, a spokesman from the Federal Police said.
Along the border river Inn, more than 1000 refugees have been captured in the districts of Passau and Rottal-Inn since Tuesday.
They had reached the German side on foot over bridges and barges.
There they are received by federal police officers and forwarded to the registration.
In comparison to the start of the week on Wednesday, there were significantly more refugees at Munich Central Station.
By 8 p.m. alone, about 700 people had arrived in the state capital, said a speaker in the morning.
On Tuesday, 1759, refugees reached the city after the relaunch of controls on the German-Austrian border.
Stuttgart: Tropensturm-Henry-expected in the southwest
Meteorologists warn of storms in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon.
Due to a low pressure area across Western Europe, warm sea air is currently flowing into the country, the Deutsche Wetterdienst (DWD) in Stuttgart.
The strong depth was the trigger of the tropical storm, Henry, which had been pulled from the Bermuda Islands across the Atlantic in the past few days.
Strong storms and thunderstorms are expected especially in Baden.
According to DWD, until Thursday early in the Black Forest, in the Schwäbische Alb and in the Bodenseekreis with trees from 60 to 90 kilometres can be expected.
The sun can therefore be seen longer on Friday.
The mass does it: Every two years, the automakers on the IAA show their novelties.
2015 is primarily movement in the compact cars, which are currently selling particularly well.
Cars from the compact class are currently particularly in demand: approximately 28.1 percent of new registrations were issued in August alone on this segment, according to the Federal Motor Transportation Office (KBA).
This is also reflected on the IAA (public days 17 to 27 September).
Many new compact models will be presented between all the futuristic concept vehicles and new high-class and luxury cars this year.
One of the biggest premieres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra, which will be with the dealers in autumn.
“The Astra is an extremely important model for us,” said Opel-Chief Karl-Thomas Neumann at the fair.
It belongs to the core of the brand.
In order to ensure that the volume model is also sold well, the new Astra should not be much more expensive for this.
Opel offers an entry below the largest competitor VW Golf, which starts at 17 650 euros.
The current Astra costs from 16 990 euros.
The Astra has a new 1.4 liter engine with 74 kW/100 hp.
Furthermore, the Hessens offer additional diesel and petrol engines from 70 kW/95 PS to 147 kW//200 hp, which for the first time also include three-cylinder petrol.
Unlike the main competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus, Opel Astra is initially only a five-doorer.
The second version will follow the combination in spring, which can already be seen on the IAA.
And what's going to happen next to the Astra on the IAA to new compact cars?
Renault Mégane: Renault sends the fourth generation of his Astra competitor Mégane to the race.
At the trade fair, the Mégane can only be seen as a five-doorer in a conventional and an emphasized sporting GT version.
It comes into trade at the beginning of next year, then also as a combination.
Infiniti: The Infiniti Q30 is completely new in the segment.
With the new model, the Nissan branch wants to find its position in the strong growing segment.
The compact Infiniti with its curved lines fully fits the design line of the brand.
The base model will get a petrol engine with a power of at least 90 kW/122 hp.
The offer is also a diesel with 80 kW/109 hp or 125 kW/170 hp.
Suzuki Baleno: The new segment is also the Suzuki Baleno, which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt.
The model will be offered with petrol engines, including a newly developed 1.0 litre turbo motor and a power of 82 kW/111 hp.
The maximum torque is 170 Newtonmeters (Nm) according to manufacturer's specifications.
Baleno sales start in Europe is in spring 2016.
DS 4: Not completely new, but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4, which can be seen on the IAA.
Outside, the designers of the noble Citroën-Ableger put their hands on the front part: the cooling grill was re-drawn here and the changed headlights were equipped with LED technology.
In the interior, the infotainment system has been upgraded, the number of buttons reduced by a touchscreen, and Apple's CarPlay has been integrated for the first time.
In addition, a number of revisions and new variants such as the updated Mercedes A class or the Peugeot 308 GTI are available on the IAA in the compact class.
JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five square meters of cell are inhumane
The Bundesverfassungsgericht has given an ex-haftling of the Tegel judicial executive body, which was housed for months in a too small cell.
Because of the violation of their human dignity, prisoners are in principle entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in too small cells.
This was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday.
According to the judge, the persons concerned can even hope for money if they have been locked in the too narrow rooms for a few days (Az.: 1 BvR 1127/14).
In this way, an ex-haftling with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe was successful: he was housed in a single cell with a floor area of about five square meters between June and November 2009 in the Berlin-Tegel Judicial Center; the toilet was not separated from space.
After that, the man, who is now on a free footing, had been transferred to a larger cell, according to his lawyer.
His trial against the Land Berlin failed because of the unworthy terms of detention.
However, the constitutional judges upheld the judgment of the Chamber Court of Berlin and recalled the case for re-examination there.
You see the man's human dignity hurt.
Chamber Court now decides on the amount of compensation
Even if for legal reasons the period in question was only a few days of imprisonment for compensation, there was a claim for compensation, it was said.
Otherwise, it would be a matter of concern to \"declaration of the legal protection of the personality\"
The Chamber Court must now clarify the amount of the compensation.
The Constitutional Justices have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of punishment in the past.
So they only addressed a prisoner's compensation in April, because he was locked in a cell naked.
According to a 2011 decision, people are also unworthy of the multiple occupation of a cell without a separate toilet.
In addition, on Wednesday, Karlsruhe confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court, which had certified a person-in-law accommodation in a parallel case in November 2009.
The defendant was housed between 15 and 21 hours a day in a similar cell as in the Karlsruhe case for over three months.
The Berlin prisons have also come to the headlines in recent weeks because of lack of personnel.
Prisoners are therefore included again and again 23 hours, the aggressiveness increases, even to beatings it should have already come because of the tense situation.
According to the judicial press office, 21 posts in Tegel are not occupied due to young people's shortages, 19 are scheduled to expire in 2016.
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy: \"We are creating this \"
The immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the Federal Chancellor is determined to accept it.
What's going on in Germany?
About 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany according to forecasts from the Federal Ministry of the Interior this year, according to Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is even able to host a million refugees.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge: “I say again and again: we can do this, and we can create this “
As far as Germany is concerned, the following overview is provided.
According to different forecasts, between 350000 (estimation by the Federal Ministry of Construction) and 400000 (estimation by the Pestel Institute) apartments are used annually - for the next five years.
This is almost twice as much as is previously built (250000 apartments).
Dramatically, however, the lack of living space is especially true of affordable rentals: 60000 to 80000 social housings are out of the rent price commitment every year, and refugees will apply for these particularly favourable housings.
Federal Minister for Construction Barbara Hendricks (SPD) therefore wants to double the funding, from currently 518 million to one billion euros.
Much too little is that from the Pestel Institute's point of view: 80,000 social housing would have to be created every year and the federal government would have to invest funding of 6.4 billion a year.
In addition, scientists and Federal Minister of Construction agree that there must be more tax advantages to housing investment.
According to estimates from the Institute for Labour Market and Professional Research, 55 percent of refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term.
However, the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications to help them get started, criticised Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education at the Bertelsmann Foundation.
However, for the integration of refugees it is crucial whether they find work in Germany.
Work is the key to social contacts, to appreciation in the host society, but also to the self-esteem of immigrants, says migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt.
In Germany, according to Dränhardt, there has been a political turn: from the ban on work for refugees to recognition of work.
While there used to be a ban on asylum seekers up to five years old, it was reduced in November 2014 to three months, as well as the obligation of residence, to restrict asylum seekers to a place of residence.
In the company, due to the lack of skilled staff, the view has generally been that refugees should be able to access the labour market more quickly.
A major obstacle to access to the labour market is the lack of German knowledge.
There has not yet been sufficient provision of general and vocational language courses.
Studies also show that jobs are most often mediated by personal contacts.
The construction of networks is therefore considered by Thränhardt to be the Königsweg zur Arbeitintegration.
The Berlin School Administration has found that only a few fledgling parents give their children to the kitas, an estimated 10 to 15 percent: \"It is very important for the disinherited parents to keep the family together first - says Ilja Koschembar, spokesperson for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration.
In order to convince the family of Kita's advantages, the administration distributes handcuffs in different languages.
Should the need for educators rise greatly due to the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - for example by allowing more specialist schools.
In the countries, students are being prepared for classes without German knowledge in welcome classes.
But they are not always taught by fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language.
There is no lack of them, says Beate Stoffers of the Berlin School Administration.
The German Student Work estimates that about 20 percent of refugees in Germany want to study.
In principle, no Federal State prohibits applying for asylum or patience - the only exception was until now Berlin, interior senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has abandoned his attitude.
Student refugees could be facilitated to access higher education.
Refugees with a residence allowance or due diligence will no longer receive benefits under the Asylum Application Service Act if they begin a study.
In principle, the latter do not get bafög, as they do not fall under the guise of the bafög people.
Patienced refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years so that Bafög was entitled, from 1 January 2016, this span will be reduced to 15 months.
However, this financial gap also needs to be closed, Steffen Krach, Berlin's State Secretary for Science, and the German Student Work are demanding.
Students should get bafög immediately.
Islam will play an important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many, religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should successively grant Islam the same rights as they have the churches, and further develop existing State Church law to a new state religion relationship.
It would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare association that is professionally concerned with newcomers.
The rights also include obligations.
For example, the representatives of Islam must agree on a clear contact point and be willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and give it certain control options.
This includes the willingness to take a hard stand against religious fundamentalism.
On Thursday, the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed concern that religious conflicts could also be brought to Germany.
Those who wanted to endure such conflicts in Germany \"have their right to live here, in Germany, immediately - he said in the Bavarian radio.
He suggested translating the Basic Law into Arabic.
In the future, integration will be much more than today a topic for the whole of society.
This will also require a change in majority society, and the reduction of discrimination and racism will become more urgent.
Germany has, as a result of European decisions, an anti-discrimination body and a general equality law for a little over a decade.
But it learns very slowly, as the NSU murder series showed, in which police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for all: What migrants organisations and interest groups of non-white Germans have long demanded and what international agreements like the anti-racism convention Germany commit must become reality in the coming years if the country remains peaceful and its new citizens are to use their opportunities - for the benefit of all.
In general, Germany is in a position to provide medical care to the expected refugees, says doctor president Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
“In terms of man-power and capacity, we’ll do that,” he said to the day’s mirror.
However, additional money would have to flow into the system.
In order to avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery demands that all arrivals be given health cards at the same time as the registration.
This could be done later with the federal states.
In the long term, it would be highly questionable to have so many people with the limited performance catalogue provided by the Asylum Marketing Act.
Otherwise, doctors will create the language barriers in particular.
So far, Berlin's health scientist Thea Borde has demonstrated, migrants are becoming worse informed about their diseases than other patients.
Not only in clinics, but also in medical practice, it requires interpreting costs.
However, many refugees would already be helped with more general medical contact points in the emergency ambulances.
And with another diagnostic look.
For example, among refugee children there are significantly more untreated disabilities, and young people are concerned with HIV education.
German doctors, however, came clear from their training with some of the other diseases, says Montgomery.
“Parasite seizures or tuberculosis are not so difficult to detect, and the lack of doctors may even be in sight of the refugees.
The Syrians had a highly developed education system, and some refugees were even doctors.
However, in order to be able to practice, they would have to prove their qualifications and, possibly, carry out further tests.
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill according to estimates from the Federal Psychotherapist Chamber (BPtK): Most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
Especially vulnerable are refugee children, says Dietrich Munz, President of the BPtK.
A recently published study by TU München shows that every fifth Syrian refugee child arrives traumatized in Germany.
Those who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder suffer, among other things, from so-called flashbacks with breath distress, dizziness, heart rate and death fears.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disturbances, strong scarcity and emotional deafness.
To prevent symptoms from becoming chronic, early treatment was necessary, Munz explained.
However, so far, only four percent of mentally ill refugees receive psychotherapy.
While mentally ill asylum seekers may apply for psychotherapy in the social offices, the treatment usually takes several months.
In addition, in the social offices, most experts or doctors who are not trained for mental illness would decide whether or not therapy is necessary.
This often leads to misunderstandings, says Munz.
Some invite to dream
The Circus sample is based on the traditions of circus art with the new production \"Leidschaft\".
The goal is to attract every age group into the realm of fascinating acrobatics, animal dresses and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus sample invites you into the mange on the brick to dream.
\"Our passion is the circus,
“I can’t imagine living without my circus family,” says Stephanie Probe, an animal teacher and junior chief.
“Leadiness” - under this motto is the current manic production.
For more than 33 years, the circus has been in the hands of the family sample.
So the gift of enthusiasm is in the blood of the family.
“It is important for us to get people away from their daily routine and take them into a completely different world for two hours,” said the 27-year-old junior chief.
“Managen cocktail with world city flair - so Director Reinhard Probe calls his concept.
50 cities on the almost 3,000-kilometer tour can now experience this flair.
The program of the circus convinces with talented artists from all over the world.
Excellent at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family attracts the audience with wit and charm.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their craft.
With the heroes of the silent movies, it wants to take the Cuban duo looser.
Lightness and mobility - with these words they identify themselves.
Her humorous art at the mast is supposed to conquer women's hearts in the storm.
In addition to numerous salmon ointments, the acrobatics of the Circus sample also fascinates with fingertip feeling and jointiness.
Balance the unicycle on a ball?
No problem for He Yuan.
Snakes are fascinated and scared at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics as few others and fascinates with their mobility.
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect.
\"The animals belong to our family - emphasizes Stephanie's mother, Brigitte's sample.
Mistakes in the attitude of circuses are only too frequent issues in various animal welfare organizations.
Stephanie Probe also comments: “If our animals are not good, we are not good, too.
Around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each stripping unit.
The “four-legged artists” as they are lovingly called, are read from the eyes whenever possible.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal doesn't feel comfortable, it doesn't want to be in the mange either.
So the supreme commandment: take good care of the animals.
Especially on her Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of a ShetlandPonyhence and a Zebrashute, the family sample is proud.
The two animals lived together for eight years in a walk and nothing happened.
“But then, suddenly, our little Jumbo was there,” Brigitte says.
Although the Zebroid is not yet ready for the many, it is the unique mascot of the Circus sample.
So for every visitor there should be something.
“One thing is certain,” Stephanie Probe says, “Whether five or 1,200 spectators, we always give our best and are with all our heart,
The Circus sample invites you every day from 17 to 20 September at 17 and 20 o'clock.
The programme starts on Sunday at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m.
Thursday is family day, for the performance at 5 p.m. the prices are reduced.
The animal show is also open every day from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe holds false speech in Parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell down the stairs at the beginning of the year from a podium.
He remained unresolved, but the video of the case quickly spread across the social media.
The opening of Parliament was also deceived by statements by members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and that they were warned to accompany Mr Mugabe's speech with buhruffs.
Last month they had built him up and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The spokesperson of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) movement Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their cell phones that warned them to disturb Mr. Mugabe's speech.
“The message comes from a number that is not displayed, but it has the title ‘Tod’ - he said journalists after Mugabe’s speech.
She warns the Members concerned that immunity in Parliament ends and that once they leave Parliament, their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective.
The chief spokesperson said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was \"careful\" about the dangers to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will reduce up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in the restructuring and saving efforts of the company's services.
HP will later split into two listed companies this year and separate the computer and printer business from its faster growing company hardware and its services business.
The expected job loss leads to a tax of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
“These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett-Packard enterprise,” said Meg Whitman, HP Chairman and Chief Executive, who will lead the unit after the separation.
“Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP today, and we have a wide and deepened portfolio of businesses that support companies in transition to a new business style,” Whitman said.
As an independent company, we are better positioned than ever before to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion of annual revenue and will be focused on providing previously unattainable, integrated technology solutions for companies, such a statement by the company.
It divides a company founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stanford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to manufacture electrical systems and whose Palo Alto Garage has been called the birthplace of Silicon Valley.
HP has gone through a massive restructuring to cope with the decline from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
HP, the world's second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies, is the latest in this field, which is based on the conviction that closely focused companies provide better performance.
FC Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says that teammates must stand in front of the game against Dynamo Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wilshere
Wenger stressed to Wilshere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation is planned, there is no reason why he cannot play again even before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will surely miss at least the next four games for England and, given its history, its participation in the European Championship in the next summer is certainly still uncertain.
The big shame with this current problem is that Wilshere had strongly ended the last season after a separate bone injury and then returned to his old swing during the previous season.
“This type of injury does not threaten the career,” Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal well.
That's not a big deal.
This was just an accident.
It was not associated with his ankles or with the injuries he had before.
This may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger also acknowledged, there is the associated danger of further injuries, whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It also develops an unpleasant pattern.
The study by Premier Injuries Ltd recorded 23 different diseases of Wilshere since his debut six years ago.
He also played in only 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games in the last five games.
The wider picture for Arsenal is that they were one of the two Premier League Clubs in six of eight games since 2007/08, which have the most days of injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will continue during the last season.
“Sometimes, when you come back from an injury, you have a susceptible period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain fighting power,” Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to overcome that.
I hope his body stabilizes, I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Dinamo Zagreb before the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on next Wednesday, and Wenger enters a rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta should start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
“I’m trying to keep the balance and give a small break to the players who need it,” Wenger said.
Although Arsenal are clear favorites to continue through Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds with the greatest deterrence effect in Europe.
Dynamo is also unbeatable after 41 games, after the “unbeatable” campaign was launched in the last season.
The stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening, measuring 3.2 on the Richter scale.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has pulled the lesson from the past season with the Champions League capitulation against Monaco and remains driven by the remote hope of leading the club to its first Europe-pocal triumph with his management.
“This drive is immense,” Wenger said.
It's never worked at Arsenal.
We were very close to it in 2006, but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the comedy show that gives us serious lessons about men's friendships
The lack of similar portrayals in shows is obvious, especially with regard to how the need for men to open up has become even more desperate now than ever before, as suicide rates among young men prove on a 15-year-old high.
In 2013, it was the main cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and it remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to address the problem, Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced 2015 as the year of the man, with the aim of questioning culture that prevents men from seeking help if they need it.
Friendship is the heartpiece in the struggle to master this challenge.
A current study in more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms found that if the sufferer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with “healthy mood” his chances of recovery doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the risks of mental problems.
But of course you first have to have friends so a friendship can work.
In the age of social media-led communication, with its focus on style over substance, the immediacy of the answer is often more important than meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, lively and successful, even though in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, everything at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship, which affects our mental health much more deeply.
And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently explained, money can really not buy happiness.
The nice thing about friends was that this focus was put on the head.
Each character was defined not by his work, but by his personality, which shined through the interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, moments of football watching in cozy armchairs and the longing of Ross for Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can relate to it at any time, even if they often hold back from fully exploring their feelings.
As one of the employees of the telephone cell care explained to me,... \"my listening role for people who feel depressed and are in danger of suicide has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference\"
The men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends.
The old use of speech - I come to terms with it - has a huge effect on how the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when talking openly about problems -
Friends is one of the shows that comes to my mind when I try to offer longer-term management mechanisms.
It clearly presents the small moments of men's friendships.
As much as my objective outsider status via the phone may also help people in moments of despair, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so, if you visit Comedy Central FriendsFest this weekend with the scenes designed to celebrate the day completely new, why not take your friends to a drink in Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone sitting around in Starbucks alone, give him a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship might make.
Friends are sent to Comedy Central from beginning to end - the entire 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria meets to help PSG to crush Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after meeting Malmö.
Di Maria meets at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG to pass Malmö.
Here are the game report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani held a course when Paris Saint-Germain started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmö in the Prince's Park Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of her Champions League debut as a PSG player, who got the French master on the way, but after that they missed a number of opportunities before they finally increased their lead when Cavani reached a headball gate in the 61st minute.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donezk also in Group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish master, as they aim not only to qualify for the K.O. rounds, but to improve on the way to the quarter finals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it wasn't a class game of Laurent Blanc's team with Zlatan Ibrahimovic's missed chances before the goal. He was later replaced in the game against his hometown team and against the club with which he started his illustrious career in 1999.
“It’s not easy to win home or out into the Champions League. Therefore, it’s a good start to win 2:0, cause our opponents problems and look back relaxed, even if there are certain things we still have to perfect during the season,” Blanc said.
“This is a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we have not reached one or two more goals,
After his injury, Ibrahimovic returned to the Paris team in one of three changes, which on weekend could hold a 2:2 unit at its own place against Bordeaux in the First League, but he was expelled by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine wing stormer was described as the man who can take PSG to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United in the last month, and he pointed out why, when he was in Marco Verrattis Pass behind Malmö defense, he was walking past Johan Wiland nicely into the long corner of the network.
However, if someone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory, it was disappointing.
Malmö, who beat Celtic in a play-off to reach this stage, joined Anpiff with nine national players in the field and was with a five-man defense and two deep in the middle field raised a heavy opponent.
But except for a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, who passed far by Kevin Trapps Pfosten in the 34th minute, they offered little in the attack.
Instead, PSG itself sometimes gave up, with some faults and bad closures, not least from Ibrahimovic, who was left alone in the first half in no less than five trials and then abandoned after Cavani used it after the restart.
Nevertheless, he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into play, and it was a pass of Ibrahimovic, who turned Di Maria into a shooting shot, which was linked by Wiland in the 52nd minute at the stake ...
The second goal finally fell shortly after the hourly mark thanks to Cavani. The Uruguayan achieved its sixth season gate, after Ibrahimovic had fished a left flank of Maxwell.
This ended all the thoughts that Malmö could return to the game, and only an excellent intervention from Wiland from the shortest distance to stop David Luiz could keep the final result low before Ezequiel Lavezzi was awarded a goal at the end.
The coach of Malmö, Age Hareide, later admitted that PSG played a class over his team, and Norwegian said: “Our last Champions League game was in December last year.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish League, which does not have the same level.
Qualifications are not sufficient
Get off Paris!
It was a great game of them!
Glencore collects $2.5 billion through stock sales
The Glencore mining giant, which is affected by one-storage raw material prices in Switzerland, collected $2.5 billion on Wednesday through a stock sale as part of its huge debt relief plan.
The London-registered company Glencore stated in a statement that it sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to pay off its own debts.
The company, which lost 57 percent of its market value this year, struggles with falling commodity prices, as China's economic downturn pushes demand and has a devastating impact on markets.
The issue of referential rights brought Glencore's share price to a rapid increase in the top of London's stock exchange on early Wednesday morning.
The stock jumped by 2.77 percent to 131.60 Pence on the FTSE 100 Index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore announced the $2.5 billion share sale last week as part of the more comprehensive plans to eliminate about a third of his $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new shares at 125 pence per share, which meant a 2.4-percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday.
There were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 percent of the group.
Concerns about long-term booming growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half, coal, copper and other raw material prices have decreased by 20 to 40 percent.

The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, confirmed the White House in a statement on Tuesday.
The visit, Xi's first official in Washington, will take place on September 25 and will return President Barack Obama's trip to Beijing last November, said the statement.
The US President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan at a state dinner this evening, after the two leaders have held bilateral talks.
\"President Xi's visit will provide the opportunity to expand American-Chinese cooperation on a number of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, but at the same time also give President Obama and President Xi the opportunity to deal constructively with issues of disagreement, the statement adds.
XI, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to meet several US technology leaders in Seattle on his way to Washington before continuing to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to address a number of controversial issues, including Washington's concerns regarding China's alleged cyberspionage and its increasing self-awareness in the controversial waters of the South China Sea.

Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented change to FC Bayern 2008
World and European Champion Xavi has been playing for the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
The FC Bayern obviously stood just a few years before the commitment of Spain's Superstar Xavi, who played for the FC Barcelona at that time.
Eight times Spanish champions, three times Pokal winner, four times Champions League winner, two times Club World champion, two times European champion, one time World champion - the title list of Xavi is stunning.
In the summer the 35-year-old left Barcelona after 24 years and moved to Qatar to the al-Sadd Sport Club.
But in an interview with Marca, Xavi now tells us that he was already before the 2008 EM before the graduation from Barcelona.
\"I was told that Barça wanted to sell me \"
“Madrid won everything back then, we didn’t say anything.
And that also registered FC Bayern.
Xavi: \"There was an offer from Bavaria,
‘Rummingge wanted me to have,
To remember: In the summer of 2008, Jürgen Klinsmann took over FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason Xavi did not change
But the change did not come about.
And the decisive man for this today works for the German record champion: Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: \"Barça has taken Guardiola under contract and I have played a great EM,
\"Pep told me that I wouldn't change that he couldn't imagine the team without me,
“That’s why he got me,” he said.
Who knows how Bayern's season 2008/2009 ran with Xavi.
Xavi stood for Barca in the quarter final of the Champions League against the Bavaria over the entire distance on the lawn, turned off the reds (4:0, 1:1) and at the end celebrated the king-class triumph.
Matt Damon plays down diversity in filmmaking
Matt Damon confronted African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion of diversity and said they will not be needed behind the scenes.
During a episode of Sunday Night by HBO's Project Greenlight, the experienced actor Brown broke down when he stressed the need for alternative perspectives in relation to a black protagonist in the chosen screenplay of the project.
“If we’re talking about diversity, you’ll do it when you’re occupying the film and not when you’re occupying the show, ” said Damon.
Brown responded shockedly, with insulted disbelief and cried, \"Hoo! Wow. Okay\" when the actor of The Martian's comments solidified.
Damon and Brown joined producer colleagues Ben Affleck and Farrelly brothers to discuss the show finals.
“I would like to invite people to think about it - whoever will be the director - how they treat the figure of the Harmony,” Brown said first.
The only black person, and she is a nut that is beaten by her white lover.
The producer of Dear White People was working for the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the right to the film; Damon replied that their direction could give us something we don't want at the end,
After the discussion was broadcast, the social media exploded before disapproval of Damon's comments.
Twitter user Mr. Pooni expressed his anger over the clip by writing \"Matt Damon talks about the only black person in the room, so he can explain her diversity - that's SO WEISS that it hurts,
The tweet earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since its release.
Damon's comments come at a time when exact racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion.
After the teenage Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white police officer, the Black Lives Matter movement achieved nationwide effect and pushed legislators and authorities to discriminatory practices against color retention.
In February, the singer Prince made a play on the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
“Albums still mater - (Albums still have their meaning) he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still have their meaning.
In recent times, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement have published a statement in response to the question of Fox News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck whether the group should be considered a hate group.
“The Black Lives Matter network is a love group,” the leaders said.
Recently, it was announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers and media mogules who were invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he has accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is unclear.
'American Ninja Warrior' crowns first Champion
Professional sports climber and operating assistant Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening and took home the big price of $1 million.
The competition show, which just ended its 7th season, had never experienced a competitive participant who could complete all the stages of his obstacle course.
During the season final two men, Caldiero and Cameramann Geoff Britten, managed to reach the final.
The last task included climbing on a 75 foot climbing rope in 30 seconds.
British finished the task within the time with which he was the first athlete to complete the challenging phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero finished this challenge three seconds faster, which made him the winner.
Caldiero spoke to E!News after the hard fought victory, still under shock over winning the $1 million prize.
“I mean, it’s amazing to think about it, I’ve never earned more than $10,000 or had to live,” said Isaac E! about his pile of money.
As suddenly as I can't even imagine how that is... the future is unknown.
The leading producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and why British, even though he was the first to finish the course, did not receive any prize money.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
“If there is more than one finalist, it gets the one with the fastest time,” said Weed.
How much money is a wonderful price and changes life, it gets the great gratification.
I don't think he's got any groll over it.
He's just so happy to have done what he did.
He received many awards from fans.
He's such a great guy and a family father.
He's a hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me: “If I should be beaten by someone, I’m glad it’s Isaac”
And I think Isaac would have felt the same if they had changed roles.
America Ninja Warrior was extended for an eighth season, the shooting will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers sneak past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS- The second half of the season was not particularly fun for the Detroit Tigers.
In the past they were once one of the best teams in baseball, today the Tigers are in the last place in the American League Central.
The tigers are reduced to their role as spoilers, but on Tuesday they played perfectly against the Minnesota Twins with 5-4 in the Target Field.
The Twins wasted a chance to climb within a game half of the Houston Astros for the second American League Wildcard place.
For Detroit, though only for one evening, it was a return of the three letter F-word, which was so difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season.
“All victories are fun, no matter how it happens,” said Tigers Manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit pointed three times in the first two innings, then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) struck 6 times in the 1/3 Innings and enabled three runs.
It was only his third successful start in his last nine games.
“I want to end this year strongly,” Simon said.
It's hard to throw every game in the bullpen, and that's why I want to get into the game very concentrated.
The designated Tiger-Hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three hit game since he had four hits against the Seattle Marines on July 6.
“He’s made a good swing at the bat,” said Ausmus.
He looked good at (slag training), looked much better in the bullpen, and he brought it directly into play.
With three runs in the aftergame at the end of the seventh inning, the Twins had their best chance to return to the game.
Center Fielder Byron Buxton ended the inning with a double on the left field line.
Right Fielder Aaron Hicks reached a bunt, and Simon took his second baseman Brian Dozier to strikeout before being replaced by the left hand Blaine Hardy.
Hardy survived the wall, the only man with whom he was confronted, in front of the designated Rookie-Schlagmann Miguel Sano, who detrissed a Two-Run by the right-hand Drew Verhagen.
With a pair of runners and the closing round at the second, Verhagen brought the third Baseman Trevor Plouffe to a double play.
It was the 27th season in the Major League that Plouffe hit a double play
After Detroit added an insurance run at the end of the ninth inning, the wall created an RBI double against the tigers' locker Bruce Rondon and reached the level of 5-4.
However, the right-hander left Sano with three pitches for his fifth save.
Detroit benefited from an unmovable Phil Hughes to start the game.
The Tigers scored three runs in the first two innings against the right-hand veteran, who had been removed from the injured list before the game after he had failed for more than a month because of a relapse.
“Of course not the beginning that I wanted to get, ” Hughes said, “but I felt better when I got rid of it and felt that I would create some pretty good pitches in the third inning,
After receiving the leadoff batter in the first place, Hushes gave a single to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler.
A Two-Out Walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into the game, who created a single-up the middle on the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez created his 0-21 success series with the runners in the scoring position.
The third Baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right, created another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game when he tried to reach the third, which ended the threat.
The Tigers joined in the second, achieved a one-out double by Catcher James McCann and a two-out single by Center-Fielder Anthony Gose to 3-0.
“This was a big blow,” said Twins manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't hit very well, but he got the right spot.
Hughes was in a pitch count, not reaching points in the third inning before being replaced by the Reliever Right-Hand A.J.Achter.
In Hughes there were three runs at six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
COMMENTS: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez eliminated due to an injury in the litter shoulder.
He was examined by Dr. James Andrews, who operated the Sanchez shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, since mid-August on the list of injuries due to a shoulder distortion, is to be activated for the start on Wednesday.
With Sanchez from the game, LHP Daniel Morris is deleted from the injury list to start against the Twins.
Norris with 1-1 at four starts with the Tigers since he was purchased in exchange with LHP David Price on 30 July
He has failed since August 20 because of a disintegration in the right hip joint.
The Tigers and the Twins will finish their series of three games in Target Field on Wednesday
Norris (2-2,4.43 ERA) will play against Minnesota's RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73)
Hundreds of refugees are to be accommodated in Wiesbaden
A train with hundreds of refugees is on their way to Hesse.
His arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday.
The people there are supposed to be accommodated in emergency accommodations in Wiesbaden, as the city of Wiesbaden announced on Tuesday evening.
It was calculated with 450 to 750 incoming refugees.
Several sports halls of the Hessian capital had been prepared for this case in the past few days.
Up to 1000 refugees can be temporarily accommodated there.
They are then to be distributed to other municipalities.
In the last ten days alone, according to the Government Bureau responsible for the first admission, 7500 people had arrived in Hesse.
Frankfurt and Hanau have also established emergency accommodation in Sporthallen due to the large number of refugees.
Ischinger: German military measures in Syria an option
The head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, considers military measures with German participation in Syria a possibility.
“I believe that the decisive reflection on military action options must not take place without Germany,” he said.
He presented the European states with a 'collective outlook'.
Four years ago one was glad that the cup of military involvement in Germany had passed.
“Now the conflict is falling in front of our doorstep,” he said in Germany’s radio.
The former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid on site for refugees.
Austria controlled on southern and eastern borders
After Germany, Austria also introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders.
Austrian Minister of Interior Johanna Mikl-Leitner declared on Tuesday evening in the Austrian television station ORF, no one is sent back to Hungary.
Germany also did not return refugees to Austria.
“No, that’s what she agreed to,” she explained.
On the question of an agreement for Germany to include a certain number of refugees from Austria per day, Mikl-Leitner said that there have already been discussions on this subject between the Director-General for Public Security and Representatives of Germany.
She did not mention specific numbers and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin.
In recent days, tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so-called Balkan route from Hungary.
Their goal is mostly Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann, together with several other Heads of State and Government, requested a special summit for next week.
Germany had started temporary border checks on Sunday.
The EU countries have not yet been able to agree on a common approach to the crisis.
The EU Minister for the Interior wants to take a new approach to the binding distribution of another 120,000 refugees at a special meeting on Tuesday (September 22nd).
In view of the strong influx of refugees in Germany, the Federal Government wants to support countries more strongly in the first-take-up and distribution of people.
The federal government will manage this together with the countries, announced Merkel on the late Tuesday evening after almost four hours of discussions with the Prime Minister at the Chancellor's Office in Berlin.
Merkel stressed that those who needed protection also got it.
However, those who do not have a permanent perspective cannot remain in Germany either.
This view has been strongly shared in the round.
The chancellor stressed that the state as a whole would now have to cope with a \"great effort to force.
Thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route.
Hungary had closed its 175-kilometre border with Serbia on the night of Tuesday.
A few hours later, the government in Budapest announced that the border with Romania would also be closed with a fence.
This neighbouring country belongs to the EU unlike Serbia.
Hungary's foreign minister Peter Szijjarto said that it was about the planned new border fence.
The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan.
There were first arrests of people who had crossed the fence.
Thousands of other migrants were on their way to the Greek border in Turkey.
Space Sun Cassini finds ocean on Saturn Moon Enceladus
Under the ice-panzer of Saturn's Enceladus moon, a global ocean escapes.
This is what researchers conclude from observations of the space probe “Cassini”
So the moon easily swirls around the ring planets on its path.
Although this movement is only small but nevertheless too large for a continuous solid celestial body, it is said in a message from Cornell University in Ithaca (US State of New York) of Tuesday.
The researchers present their analyses in the \"Icarus\" journal.
It has been known for a long time that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of Enceladus.
In 2006, “Cassini” had already discovered ice volcanoes on Saturn’s southern pole, spewing the water vapor and ice particles, thus feeding Saturn’s so-called e-ring.
At least on the south pole there had to be an underground sea, the astronomers closed at the time.
However, the expansion of the hidden ocean was not cleared.
Rama is missing 1860 Munich for several weeks
The 1860 Munich must refrain from offensive actor Valdet Rama for about a month.
An investigation revealed an adductor injury in the 27-year-old, the association reported.
Rama had already complained about pain in the early part of the week.
According to Münchner Löwen, the diagnosis \"presumably four weeks of forced pause\" means
\"It's hard for us, Rama is a heavy loss,
“Of course, we have to think now,” said sports director Necat Aygün of the “image” newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of an unscrupulous professional.
However, as a training guest, the Sechziger initially presented a defensive man.
The 30-year-old Hrvoje Cale was last active in Belgium and was previously under contract with the VfL Wolfsburg.
The Croat currently has \"the opportunity to demonstrate its ability\"
Torjager Rubin Okotie can return to team training after his brain shaking.
As early as Thursday, the Austrian national player is expected to get into running training.
Okotie had been injured at the party at Fortuna Düsseldorf (0:3) during a violent clash at the head.
On the other hand, he remained without a serious injury.
No diet fruit - mangos contain a lot of sugar
Mangos are exotic and juicy.
But whoever wants to pay attention to his slender line is often more discouraged by them.
Because mangos contain relatively much sugar - especially sucrose.
The exotic fruits are healthy anyway: In them B-Vitamin and the vitamins E and C. Above all, however, mangos contain a lot of vitamin A and its pre-stage beta-carotin.
Those who eat the fruits thus support vision, immune system and metabolic processes in the body.
When buying, mangos should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasant.
The skin color alone doesn't say anything about how ripe the fruit is - so green mangos can also taste very delicious.
They should be stored at room temperature and eaten within a few days.
Then, of course, they taste pure or sweet.
However, a mango also gives hearty dishes a special note.
It softens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chicoree and Radiccio.
And a mango chutney fits well with fish, poultry, lamb and wild.
The US package service UPS provides up to 95000 aid for Christmas business in the United States.
The company has already started recruiting seasonal workers, and has announced UPS on Tuesday.
Drivers in particular are sought.
Last year UPS had already increased its workforce for the holiday season by 95000 reliefs.
In view of the booming online business, UPS and its competitor FedEx have taken precautions since last year to be ready for the Christmas business.
In 2013, late deliveries had brought harsh criticism to the parcel services.
First firestorm, then distinctive cold front
On the next night, in the valleys of the Alpine north side of the Föhn, Meteoshweiz broke through, as told on Tuesday.
On Wednesday and at night to Thursday, the fencing will blow partly with storm strength through the fence valleys.
At the end of Thursday morning, a distinctive cold front crosses us, bringing strong rainfall, windstorms and a decrease in temperature.
As MeteoNews writes in a communication, Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low pressure area across the British Isles in a strong south-west current.
On the Alpine side, during the night to Wednesday, the fencing breaks through the valleys.
As a result, the Föhn blows up to Thursday morning in the foin valleys with floors from 60 to 100 km/h, isolated and especially in Urnerland partly with over 100 km/h.
The faucet can penetrate into the adjacent Mediterranean, and even hurricanes of over 120 km/h are possible on the mountains.
While in the north on Wednesday stormy figurines provide summery temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees, moisture on the alpine südhang begins to stagger.
This is where rain is set, which lasts until Thursday evening.
In sum, south of the Alps must be counted in the next 48 hours with over 100 litres of rain per square metre, after large amounts of rain have fallen in the last few days.
On Thursday morning the Föhn will go out the air, and as a result a cold front will roll over Switzerland from west to east with strong, partly windy rains.
Together with the cold front, the wind is strong to stormy, and temperatures are clearly decreasing.
The following days will be presented in the north with 15 to 20 degrees, while in the south it will be more sunny and warmer on weekends with up to 25 degrees.
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
Nearly 500 years after the Reformation, there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome.
In the presence of City President Ignazio Marino, on Wednesday a nameless place in the park on the Oppio hill was baptised on behalf of the German reformer.
At the \"Piazza Martin Lutero\" he is now recognized as the \"German theologian of the Reformation\".
The park is located in the middle of ancient Rome right next to the Colosseum.
The naming had been requested by the working community of the evangelical churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Community in Rome, reminded us on Wednesday that the Protestants in the city of the popes over centuries as a minority could often only live their faith in secret.
The place became symbolically visible that their tradition of Christian faith was welcome in Rome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) held for several months in Rome as a young Augustine monk around the turn of the year 1510/11.
He received the city at the time as a future scapegoat of sin.
His negative impressions should have strengthened him, according to historians, in his later struggle against Rome.
Luther had then, with his theses against the dismissal trade, initiated the division of the Evening Church.
Hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (golden) thorn crown is one of the main works that Otmar has painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts.
In the beginning was the word?
No, not at the Otmar Old Bible, which has now appeared with magnificent images.
At the beginning was the image for Otmar Alt, who in 150 motifs formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas.
Its \"language\" with colorful colors and imaginative shapes has been given to the 75-year-old - which, however, is by no means equivalent to \"like\" pictures.
On the contrary, adapted to the respective issues, this can seem quite dark.
About three years Otmar Alt has worked on his Bible project, for which he has made a subjective and artistic selection from the many topics of the book of all books.
These are cycles that dedicate themselves to such topics as cross-roads, plagues, commandments or fatherhood.
In this way, he has spontaneously fascinated several partners: this applies to the Luther publisher with his theological orientation as well as to the Kettler publisher with his focus on art books.
And there is, above all, the author Klaus Altepost, who has dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of the painting.
He interpreted the Bible passages selected by Otmar Alt, and thus \"translated\" into current contexts today.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of Alt's painting.
They are embedded between the original Bible quote by Martin Luther and each set by the artist, who here formulates his very personal thoughts on the respective situation.
The jewelry tape has gold letters.
Thus, the 75-year-old equally double allows a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high degree of intimacy.
In the end, emotions were actually triggers for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born in Wernigerode in 1940 and raised in Berlin, comes from a family belonging to the strict Protestant Lordhood Order.
“Then the education took place with the pipe-stock - Otmar Alt remembers.
“I have tried to work this out to perhaps also renegotiate myself with the Lord’s Father,
His second concern is to restore the value of art in a fast-paced manner: “The perception of visual worlds today is characterized by advertising, and it is loud.
Symbolism is pushed there.
Artists have a different desire and desire to show things.
Pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative.
\"In this respect, I am a dinosaur,
Otmar Alt wants viewers to be able to \"involve\" the images, let them act on themselves, discover and sense the power they have: \"The image is looking for its counterpart.\"
Klaus Altepost stood on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar-Alt Bible in the Otmar-Alt Foundation, \"should always have been a lover of Otmar Alt's art: \"I like how he understands life with his pictures,
Old people did not take care to grasp the Bible completely, but they chose important, mysterious topics for him.
“This was not collaboration at eye level,” says Altepost: “This is about the pictures, the text merely explains, “there was a picture Bible.
For Hans Möhler of Luther-Verlag, this work is an invitation \"to deepen his life and find freedom\"
Otmar Alt's pictures speak for Möhler both the (biblical) language of love and that of responsibility.
Part of the original - paper and canvas images - is presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on November 15 at the Otmar-Alt-Stiftung.
Start of construction for BMX railway close
Plans made, place found, company commissioned, earth hill modelled for a round course: A year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BMX railway, it was already closed again.
Failures in politics and administration caused confusion, especially among residents who did not want to tolerate the train.
So hills moved off, new place sought - now with formal planning and application for construction approval.
In October, the first municipal councillor Sabine Mosebach-Bock was able to inform the Children's and Youth's Committee.
“I hope that this year’s visibility is still happening,” she said.
The work at the former indoor swimming pool should then be started without a \"further memorial break\".
DFB intensifies commitment to refugees
The DFB extends its commitment to refugees until 2019, and the Bundesliga sets a clear sign on the weekend.
The football is responding to the prevailing situation in Germany and the policy ensures its assistance in dealing with the problems in question.
\"I think this has been the biggest challenge of our country since reunification.\"
“No one can say, in principle, I don’t care, I don’t have anything to do with it,”
“This needs to be of interest to everyone, to get this topic under control,” said DFB chief Wolfgang Niersbach.
At the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin, he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany.
\"I will be in the Chancellor's Office next Wednesday and meet Ms. Özoğuz and the Chancellor there,
“The theme will certainly play a central role in this,” he announced.
The footballer could and would like to help.
But the crucial course must be to set the policy.
The German Football Bond has therefore expanded its refugee initiative \"1:0 for a welcome\" by four years.
\"About the Egidius Braun Foundation, we have ensured that this programme continues until 2019, explained Niersbach at the edge of the UEFA Conference in St. Julian's/Malta.
Also some federal members support this programme.
Already this weekend the 36 professional clubs set a clear mark when they will wear the impression “We help - #refugeeswelcome” on the left tricot sleeve instead of the otherwise usual sponsor logo (Hermes).
“We also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can only - said Leverkusen’s sports chief Rudi Völler of the “Image “Zeitung (Dienstag)” and described the project as “of course”
“The refugee drama is approachable to anyone, no one can see away “
“We football leagues can, no, we need to use our radiance, our influence and our ability to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly already,” said Hertha manager Michael Preetz.
Hoffenheim’s managing director Peter Rettig spoke of a “prominent sign of the League”
The women's national team invites 100 refugees to Halle/Saale for the EM qualification game against Hungary this Friday.
Niersbach referred to the support of refugees as \"a large joint work of German football\"
That all 36 licensees in their locations had started their own projects was great.
It is just as great that small and smallest clubs are active there.

“This is of enormous importance,” he said.

“The clubs have already called the whole sum for 2015,” Niersbach reported.
Reports: SAP Chief of Directors loses an eye in the event of an accident
The CEO of Europe's largest software group, Bill McDermott, has reportedly lost the left eye due to a crash in early July.
In the accident on the staircase in his brother's house in the United States, after midnight, he fell on a glass of water, which he carried in his left hand, reported the \"Economy Week\" on Wednesday.
“He almost faded, was powerless, then dragged himself out onto the street - he told us so last week - quoted by the “WiWo” SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner.
But McDermott was able to do his job.
“At the beginning of October, we met in Walldorf before the Supervisory Board meeting,” Plattner said.
The 54-year-old manager is present at the meeting and is able to work in full capacity.
McDermott announced in an interview with the “Süddeutsche Zeitung” (Thunderstag issue) that he would come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software group.
“I’m fully there for SAP, fully in my job “
\"Of course, I have been in regular contact with the Supervisory Board all the time and its chairman, Hasso Plattner, said McDermott of the \"SZ\"
McDermott has been commuting between Germany and the USA, but since summer he has not been at the German SAP headquarters in Walldorf.
It is important to him to go to the public with such a personal story, said the manager of the “SZ”: “Each such thing can happen.”
“It’s important to get back up when you’ve fallen down, ”

Magnussen tweeted a corresponding photo and explained that he suffered the injury when he fell off the wheel.
He is therefore not as a reserve driver during the night race in Singapore on weekends for the two regular pilots Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button, as one week later at Japan's Grand Prize.
Football: BVB without a giant against Krasnodar: Weidenfeller im Tor
At Borussia Dortmund all hopes for a comeback by Marco Reus in the first group game of the Europa League have finally collapsed.
The national player will also be missing the table leader of the Bundesliga in the duel with the FK Krasnodar on Thursday (19.00 p.m./Sky).
“We can’t take back on him,” Thomas Tuchel said on Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be back on Sunday in the Bundesliga-Topspiel against Leverkusen, the BVB-Coach stated: \"We expect him to return to training on Friday,
In view of the high burden of his pros, Tuchel will not only change his trunk at the Giant position.
So he announced a change in the gatekeeper position.
Roman Weidenfeller therefore takes the place of Stammkeeper Roman Bürki.
“At an absolute top level, he praised the world champion.
Whether or not weed fields will be used in all Europe-League games in the future, however, Tuchel left open.
With high probability, he will also contest the second party.
Co-player Reus’ research statement that the final entry for the BVB in the Europe League must be the goal, midfielder Julian Weigl considers it possible to understand: “So Marco is not so wrong.”
“I think we have a good chance to access the title “
Robot cars: Government wants advance role for Germany
Germany is to be a technological pioneer in changing the car.
On Wednesday, the Federal Cabinet adopted a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which includes investments in the development of digital infrastructure.
On Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the IAA car fair Dobrindt spoke of a \"new mobility age\"
Automated and networked driving will increase road safety and reduce congestion, said Dobrindt.
He also wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G7 countries, who also meet with representatives of industry at the IAA.
The Ministry of Transport strategy paper emphasizes, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid transition to digital radio.
In order to test new technology, a test track is currently being developed on the 9th motorway in Bavaria.
In order to ensure that the driver does not have additional liability risks, the Federal Government intends to review the legal framework and, where necessary, to adapt to the new developments,
For example, Germany intends to use internationally to raise the maximum permissible speed for self-driving cars from 10 to 130 km.
The Federal Government also intends to implement an amendment to the Vienna Convention, which so far provides only for people as drivers.
In automated driving, the car increasingly takes the lead, the driver becomes more and more the passenger.
The technology is primarily based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds fast.
According to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, highly automated driving on motorways will be technically possible by 2020.
Nevertheless, driverless vehicles on public roads are expected to be \"first far after 2020\"
The value added in the field of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions at the location of Germany are estimated by the authors of the 2025 study to be around EUR 8.4 billion.
“The digital networking of the car can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road transport,” said SPD traffic politician Sören Bartol.
However, the issue of liability in the event of accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clarified.
However, the Germans still see self-driving cars skeptically - much more than French or American.
A survey by the Forsa Institute on behalf of the Dekra, presented at the AA on Wednesday, will result in only eight per cent of Germans believing that autonomous driving cars will continue in the next ten years, 32 per cent will only expect in 20 years, 31 per cent will not believe in it at all.
In France 21 percent of respondents expect autonomous driving cars, in the United States 33 percent by 2025.
Without it, drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely entirely on a self-driving vehicle.
After a survey of the Digital Association Bitkom, only seven percent would agree to give up control throughout the journey on all roads.
On the highway, at least 15 per cent of the traffic flow could be imagined, at the level of 45 per cent.
Well every quarter would leave the car under no circumstances.
Boll says team and double start at table tennis EM
The Düsseldorfer wants to hit in detail only after the current booth during the title battles from 25 September to 4 October.
The final decision is to fall by 22 September at the latest.
\"This is a huge loss for our team\"
“The boys learned it in the morning,”
“But we’re strong enough to get the title without Timo,” said Bundestrainer Jörg Roßkopf during the EM course in Düsseldorf.
At that time Boll was on the flight for a long-term period of sponsorship in China.
The 34-year-old German master is expected back on Friday.
“Without Timo is the disadvantage, we’re no longer such a clear favorite,” said single European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov.
The Hamelner, who runs the set list in Jekaterinburg, also remembered the EM 2013 in Schwechat.
\"At that time, Timo also failed, and we became European champions,
“This is where we should orient ourselves,” explained the world rankings five.
The English football national player Luke Shaw of Manchester United has contracted a serious injury on the right leg.
During the Champions League game at PSV Eindhoven, the defender was hit by Héctor Moreno and replaced after long treatment.
The first diagnosis indicated that the 20-year-old co-player of Bastian piglifter had broken a rail leg.
Gaultier feels too old for an enfant terrible
It is a mixture of very large fashion show and a wax figures gruse cabinet: The designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition on his work in Munich on Wednesday.
The highlights: window dolls that look frighteningly human thanks to video projections.
They are wearing the spectacular creations of the French designer, who, among other things, became the big star of the fashion scene with Madonna's stage outfits - and by putting men in skirts.
“I can’t say today that I’m the enfant terrible of the Haute Couture because I have white hair “
“In the past it was bleached, it’s real in the meantime,” Gaultier said.
For visitors to the exhibition “From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk” (From the Bürgersteig on the Laufsteg), which can be seen from 18 September in the Kunsthalle der Hypo-Kulturstiftung, it is a luck that the fashion creator has changed his initially rejecting attitude to a show about his person.
Actually, he was against it, for, \"For me, an exhibition sounded a bit after death\" he said.
When you die, you come to the museum.
The impressive collection had already been made in the Canadian Montreal and Paris Station.
“It’s so much more than just beautiful clothes,” said Roger Diederen, director of the Kunsthalle.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight into the man’s work that is hardly yet to be overlooked, who has written fashion history without ever having completed an education.
Chronologically, the show is not built, but it is an excellent choreographed work of art for which a lot of effort has been made: To freeze the dolls, for example, a stylist was engaged.
According to the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot, 14 tons of material has been transported by the makers to Munich.
Shortly before the start of the October festival, there was a special shawl: a leather pants outfit with corset.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He has always been interested in strong women, women are smarter than men, and for people who are a little different, Gaultier said.
Gaultier's old Teddy can also be seen in the exhibition.
He stands for the designer's first, eye-catching fashionable walking tests.
As a child (he wasn't a good student and bad in football) he put on his Teddy BHs and clothes, Gaultier said.
To play with a doll, his parents wouldn't have allowed him.
Later he taught himself how to design fashion.
He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaultier told in Munich.
Later, however, I bought them naturally.
He has not been able to pay the models for his first fashion show.
They didn't get anything, but they were allowed to keep the clothes.
Jewelry instead of Gardine - Plauener Spitze as a fashion niche
It used to go into the long embroidery machines and to make plumes about making meters.
The embroidered fabrics and laces were produced in a large amount for customers, who, for example, processed them into blankets and curtains.
This alone no longer works today, explains Andreas Reinhardt, managing director of the Plauen fashion tip.
Instead, fashion is important again.
In the early days of the Plauener Spitze, fashion played a larger role, was then pushed down by the home textile industry - and is now rediscovered as niche.
Reinhardt mentions some examples: lace in jewelry, accessories such as bags and regional suits.
At all, the so-called vintage fashion, which lends itself to past stylopoes, forms an increasing potential for order.
Those who do not use niches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market.
With us, they already make up half of all orders.
Fashion Spitze Plauen is a member of the industry association Plauener Spitze und Stickreien together with nine other companies.
Only they can wear the protected label.
In the last 15 years, about 80 percent of turnover has been lost.
Private trades and wholesale trade are almost gone.
Our products hardly reach the customer in this way.
Today, mass goods are made much cheaper in Asian space and are almost exclusively distributed through chains.
In addition, exports, currently to Russia and the United States are weakening.
So sufficient reasons for new ways.
The industry association also tries to score by environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer from Stickperle in Falkenstein explains: “Since this year we have been leading a quality seal, which shows that we are producing ecologically and socially tolerable,
Reinhardt adds: \"This also refers to the materials used,
Diploma designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberger Außenstelle der Westsächsische Hochschule Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Art - and is specialized in embroideries and laces.
In order to counter competition from the Asian area, you need to find high-quality and innovative products.
It takes time and courage.
There is a tension between the latest ideas of the designers and the companies that have to think economically in the first place, says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design is often only slightly varied to keep a customer strain.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuters relived the historic snowball tip.
The machine will stick small balls in some places.
The Plauen goldsmith Bianca Hallebach-Kroße was inspired by this: “I couldn’t start with traditional Plauener Spitze before,
Now she uses the snowball tip for her jewelry.
In an elaborate process, it marks the pattern in silver.
“Many people in the region identify themselves with the theme of Plauener Spitze - young and old - says Reuters.
It also delivers to the United States, to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in plows and surroundings and who want a memory item.
So I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador to the Plauener Spitze.
Disney plans new \"Mary Poppins\" film
Legends should not be touched, but Disney still dares to see a new movie of his classic “Mary Poppins”
According to \"Entertainment Weekly\", however, it is not a novel but a kind of continuation that continues 20 years after the first film with the magical child girl.
It is about the experience of Nanny with the Banks family in times of the world economic crisis in England.
Who plays Poppins more than 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear.
But the director already states: Rob Marshall, last with \"Into the Woods\" in the cinema.
Xi urges to open up the economy to the world
On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping said that the economy needs to open up more freely to promote growth.
“China should be committed to attracting foreign investment and know-how and to improving the strategies for business start-ups,” he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Executive Group for the deepening of a comprehensive reform.
Promoting new start-ups and advancing reforms will lead to new momentum and vitality and will provide new space for economic growth, said Xi.
The management group has adopted a number of directives including a negative list of market access rules, relaxation of border control policies, promotion of state enterprises (SOE), private capital capture, and resumption of the resident mining system.
According to the statement, a negative list is drawn up identifying sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment.
The system is gradually tested and improved by test programs.
The initiative is important as it gives the market a greater role in the allocation of resources, ensures a legal environment and makes the market more open, says the statement.
The government will also loosen controls on the powers conferred on the companies and ensure that companies decide how they conduct their business.
The statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
Other areas for private investment will be opened up as part of an offer to open up government-controlled sectors.
“The government will not change its foreign investment policy and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide better services for them,” said the statement.
In addition, it is made easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the Green Card by optimizing the requirements and facilitating the application process.
The right of lawyers to carry out their duties and to use professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at a meeting.
Premier Li Keqiang and important leaders like Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli also participated in the meeting, as reported in a statement published after the meeting.
EU wants to double mercury limit in predatory fish
The European Commission intends to double the limit values for mercury in large predatory fish, thus reducing consumers to a significantly higher dose of nerve poison.
The Foodwatch consumer organisation, which has a corresponding EU working paper, strongly criticized the plans: “The risks and side effects of missing industrial and environmental policies are passed on to pregnant women and young children with full weight,” said Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch.
According to Wolfschmidt, the limit values of the nerve poison for large fish at the end of the food chain, such as shark or sword fish, should be increased from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish.
Large predatory fish, however, are already so heavily burdened with mercury today that about 50 percent of catches cannot be sold on the basis of the existing limit values.
After doubling the limit values, only 14.5 percent would then be unavailable.
According to Foodwatch, the EU wants to increase the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.
Foodwatch, however, described this as a ‘trick’ because smaller Friedfish, such as carp is usually so low that they already meet the expected maximum values today.
Therefore, the reduction in small fish is \"a perfide distraction maneuver that helps the economy alone\", Wolfschmidt explained.
mercury is a heavy metal for humans, which is highly enriched through the food chain, especially in predatory fish.
Therefore, the Federal Government warns that “very small amounts can cause damage to the nervous system especially in the case of unborns.
The Federal Ministry of the Environment explains on its homepage, however, that a ‘health risk to the general population’ should not be expected.
Sicksilber is mainly caused by coal combustion into the environment.
According to a written information by the Federal Ministry of the Environment, German coal power plants to the Federal Federal Republic of Germany, Annalena Baerbock issued more than six tons of mercury a year, two thirds of the total quantity emitted in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fishes, for example in Elbe, Rhein and Danube, was “several and superficially exceeded, ” the ‘spiegel’ was quoted from the paper in March.
Last year Europe-wide warnings against mercury in fish were among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU warning system RASFF.
