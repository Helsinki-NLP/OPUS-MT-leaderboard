What should she do, the ČSSD? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague do not know Voldemort, nor the \"conditory\"
The new councillors of the capital from the ČSSD series will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to be able to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and in the city representation at all.
The newspaper Aktuálně.cz has members of the new Council from the ČSSD once a little \"depleted\" as they master the notoric snake, which has settled in recent years, in which today's coalition partners in Prague were on the row.
The coded vocabulary, introduced by the Prague political elite in the falsified era of Mayor Pavel Bém, has been borrowed from some of the most famous actors, situations and causae.
Surprisingly, the new councils have been shown to do something in the dark in relation to these new concepts.
At least they claim that.
“Who is Voldemort,”
‘No idea’
“I’m rather a newcomer in Prague’s politics,” replied Lukáš Kaucký, the new Councillor of Culture, on the test of the “pat-word treasure”
But the councillor Karel Březina - a political veteran - also responded in a similar way.
For example, on the term \"golfloch\"
“This is the only expression of those you present to me here that I am using over and over again,
\"Otherwise, I don't think much of slang,
From the vocabulary published by Aktuálně.cz in this year's June before the ODS election congress, the editorial board picked out six terms, especially those notorically associated with the Prague Magistrate.
The social democrats should define the terms \"Voldemort -\"the largest of Prague's gulfholes -\"to go into the conditory -\"snacks -\"to betray the capital -and \"verbliche\".
Three Prague councillors agreed to the test, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future head of Prague school - first promised his participation in the conversation, but then did not even take the listener off.
The fifth Councillor, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the outset.
\"I don't care about these things and how the bourgeois Democrats talk to each other, I don't judge them \"
“It’s important to me how we understand ourselves as part of our programmes,” he countered.
As already mentioned, in the headline mentioned above, Lukáš Kaucký would not have been aware that the talk is from the influential entrepreneur and friend of the former mayor Bém, Roman Janoušek.
Kaucky doesn't say anything at all, and the only term he got when testing correctly was \"the biggest Prague golf hole\"
“This is the tunnel Blanka,” Kaucký said, but added to the security: “But I know that from the newspaper rather,
And sharply: \"I'll probably have to take a language course\"
The \"golfhole\" is then deciphered not only by Matador Karel Březina, but also by the Councillor for Environmental Questions Lukáš Plachý as a tunnel Blanka.
Both Social Democrats, however, also know who the term Voldemort stands for and Lukáš Plachý even knows where this figure is to be found and what it means to go into the conditory.
“I think that is to go into some Prague gastronomy business,” Plachý is quite close to the puzzle solution, knowing that this is the seat of Janoušeks companies.
However, in agreement with Březina, he begs to have taken this knowledge out of the newspaper rather than be his own.
In fact, there seems to be no similar native slang among the social democrats to judge the test participants.
\"I also asked my colleagues, but obviously there is something like this with us really not.\"
“We call each other by name, we also use shorts or nicknames every now and then,” says the chairman of Prague’s ČSSD Petr Hulínský - called salopp-Hulda by his partymates.
“I was called Bříza (Birke) at school, but I don’t know if my colleagues call me that,” Karel Březina tells us his nickname.
Deník Aktuálně.cz newspaper has tried out the name and see there - he works.
Mr Weinert is friendly to the partymates of the “Opa” or less friendly of the “Old” representative Miroslav Poche, who, prior to the elections, drew attention to the party sponsoring, is called “Igráček” (known Czech Lego figure) by some colleagues.
Thus, nicknames are the only ones that allow the social democrats to use their own language.
Hulínský does not seem to like it if he is called \"Hulda\", but Deník Aktuálně.cz registered another nickname of the Prague president.
His nickname, \"Doctor of Rubber Knüppel-Rights\", is said to be related to Petr Hulínský's acquisition of his title Doctor Juris at the Bratislav Police Academy.
The government wants to prevent the torture of \"Hexen\" and issued a brochure
Women who are stamped in Burkina Faso into witches usually show some common social characteristics.
They belong rather to the older generation, they find no work - for example for health reasons, they are idle and have no children.
If one of these women becomes witches, she is strictly isolated so that she cannot become dangerous to the rest of the village.
\"Men are quite rarely affected by this fate,
“Young and healthy women are also spared because they help with the work and give birth to children,” says one religious sister, describing the situation that is taking care of more than a hundred women who have been expelled from their communities in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso in a special home.
The local government now decided to act against this abnormal social measure.
And, for this reason, issued a brochure to interrupt the \"Hexen Tracking\".
But the thing has a hook.
“More than 70 per cent of all adults in Burkina Faso are unable to read - the newspaper “the standard” pointed to the dilemma of written education.
But the witchcraft is also going and going on in other African countries.
In Ghana, the neighboring country of Burkina Faso, 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová was tortured by three women and two men to death - she poured them over with Petroleum and just lit them.
The BBC server also reported on this incident.
The perpetrators claimed, however, that the matter would only have been a concurrence of unfortunate circumstances.
According to your version, oil is inflamed, which is used for ritual anointings.
And indeed, after the group had tried to expel \"an evil spirit\" from the woman,
The isolation of \"hexes\" here supports people without regard for their education.
\"The standard - quoted to this end a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: \"Means of human souls are a danger as today - he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso is at least trying to defuse the witch hunt, the gambian president has thoroughly mixed the president himself in the past year.
\"President Yahya Jammeh had a monstrous witch hunt after his aunt's death, since these were supposed to have part in their death and would now try to kill the president himself by black magic,
“To this end, he called for the help of shamane from nearby Guinea, who, in the company of police officers, soldiers, and the bodyguard of the president’s electionlessly arrested women and men violently kidnapped from gambian villages and brought them to the president’s farm in Kanilai,” said Amnesty International in her report.
On the farm, the consecrated people were forced to drink an absud of plants with hallucinogenic effect, which also caused intestinal and renal problems.
Two of the people arrested did not survive the stay on the farm.
Only because of international pressure were the nearly a thousand prisoners released again.
A tenant of Bakala: Although it heats in the oven - yet it pays higher rent
An elderly underage man just leaves the client center of the company RPG Byty des-Kohlebaron-Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of rentals in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm a folder with three new rental contracts to three apartments: for the own and the dwellings of his daughters and his son, who has just committed a prison sentence.
All three were raised in the context of the so-called \"deregulation\" just the rent.
Instead of 3500 crowns of monthly rent, the son is to prepare a 2-room apartment with kitchen of the second category 4100 crowns next year.
“And there is not even running hot water in the apartment and heating is needed in a simple coal oven - he is angry with the finger on the new lease contract of the son, to whose signature he has a warrant.
“But what - I signed - he said half agreed and half resigned.
The BytyOKD.cz Civil Association, which referred to the new rental conditions as “incorrect and immoral,” advises tenants not to sign the new contracts and wait until 7 December in which it intends to publish a guide on how to proceed against such contracts.
But the man's only waving.
“One says this, the other does it, making a dark face.
The region of Ostrava thus becomes a major \"deregulation laboratory\"
After New Year, this deregulation is the most common housing in the Czech Republic, whose tenants have not yet paid market-oriented rents.
Aktuálně.cz therefore decided to visit this “Labor” personally.
The RPG waiting room in Havířov is one of four in the Ostrava region and has been in full for nine o'clock this Tuesday.
Right next to the door are the bodyguards of a security agency and a caller.
“Miete 2011 - this is how a special keyboard shines on the touch screen.
In short, the device is spitting out a number counter.
We barely deciphered the number \"157\" and already piped it on the large display on the ceiling of the waiting room.
Half a second later you're on the line.
A little later, an older couple enter the waiting room to ask for the rent, but the announcement in the waiting room does not seem to apply to the new rent at all.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair applications, insurance matters and similar.
From mid-November in the region of Ostrava, the Kuverts with the new rental contracts will flatten the most tenants of the total 44,000 apartments of the portfolio of the RPG into the letter boxes.
The RPG Byty proposes to them in the letter a rent increase of about 15 to 38 percent.
The special switch for new rentals in the client centre has been open since 18 November.
“The action is going on for a week, that is, it’s only the beginning - the ladies behind the switch respond to a moment when the “client” turns out to be a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakala's former miners' apartments are a brilliant theme.
Before the elections, the Parliamentary Vice-President Lubomír Zaorálek of the ČSSD had taken up this issue quite loudly, no wonder that today the newspapers are full of them.
\"Twenty years I want a new floor from them,
“Don’t even be smart. WC glasses could replace them - the man mentioned in the entrance air.
According to the staff, pensioners on the switch are now on to convince themselves whether they really receive the promised rental discount, which RPG promises to give them if they sign the special offer in time.
The other tenants, who sign the new lease until 15 December, are also to benefit from a reduced February rent.
Until now, however, \"deregulation switch\" in Havířov is anything but overloaded by demand.
“From yesterday’s 360 clients were only 40 to 50 of the rent in 2011 because of this, the switch officials appreciate it.
RPG offers both on its websites and wallboards individual rental agreements where necessary.
However, if the rental parties do not agree on the new rent, they will be determined by an independent court.
“This is not to be a threat, but is to be understood as information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal approach,” RPG explains on its websites.
“No one goes to court here,” says one of the employees of RPG Byty and a man on the street in front of the client center, giving her at least partially right.
“I have 13,000 rents, of which 5,000 are left for food, where should I take the money for a court dispute,” he says.
Then the employees will be insecure.
“Seeing Mal
“Mr Zaorálek tells them about the media, they should not sign and so people are still waiting for them to think about it.
The regulated rent ends most of the Czech Republic in New Year 2011 and according to RPG Byty, the rent increase is an economic necessity.
“The existing amount of rents does not even cover the maintenance of the housing fund,” Pavel Klimeš, the director of the housing portfolio of the company RPG Byty, argues, and - especially the neglect of the housing fund criticized by the tenants is, in the opinion of the landlord, the main reason for the rent increase.
While RPG was able to invest four billion dollars in the apartments between 2005 and 2010, in the four years from 2011 to 2014 it is expected to be 5.2 billion.
On the large-format LCD display on the ceiling opposite the upholstered armchairs in the waiting room of Havířov, a few red shining information appears.
\"The rental increases in 2011 amounted to 15% and less to 31 200 apartments, that is, more than 90% of RPG's apartments,
“This means a maximum of 7,50 CZK per square meter and month, can be read on the LCD monitor.
Only 400 apartments from the portfolio of RPG increase the rent by 38 percent.
\"In these cases, the increase is extremely low in rent prices of 19,66 CZK per square meter - argues RPG.
At 2600 apartments, the rent will remain at the same height next year.
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation does not cause rents to jump to heights, but is done gradually within four and eight years.
What more - the company imposes another obligation: All revenue from the rental increase (see diagram) the company wants to put back into the apartments, especially in heat savings - into new windows and into thermal insulation.
But, above all, they should benefit from those people who sign the rent increases agreements.
The architects saw one - the office also belongs to a kindergarten
The office building Avriopoint in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
But who would expect a mini-kindergarten here, with everything that includes: colourful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini-playing place on the outdoor terrace.
This kindergarten has been available to the employees of Arch.Design for the past year.
The project and architecture office Arch.Design, from whose studios a whole series of well-known Brno buildings, calculated from the first designs for the new building Avriopoint with the premises for its company mini-kindergarten.
In a clear perspective, because most of his 90 employees are in the Babyboom age and the company is on the move to return to their workplace as soon as possible.
Together with the possibility of working shorter, the kindergarten is another bonus that Arch.Design has to offer its employees in the concept of their social program.
The civil engineers have so much easier to bring their demanding profession and child care under a hat.
The Minikindergarten is an original idea of the employees of Arch.Design and with the support of the management they managed to win funding funds from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for their project.
The operational minikindergarten is financed by the Operation Programme Human Resources and Employment Policy from the European Social Fund and from the Czech Republic's State Budget.
Thanks to this financing (CZK 2, 8 million grants) the necessary facilities and equipment have been provided and for the duration of 2 years qualified personnel and for the operation.
After the exhaustion of funding (2 years), the company Arch.Design is obliged to continue to operate the minikindergarten 3 at its own expense for further years.
The preparation of this project took place for an entire year, with the company making an active contribution to the implementation of the application.
The children care for fully qualified staff - a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, the kindergarten can visit children without age restrictions, although most of them are over three years old.
And since this is about a mini-kindergarten, only 5 children may be present at the same time, but the day changes across multiple children.
The Kindergarten plant is flexibly tailored to the needs of the parents, the children of all employees have the same rights in terms of the use of the Kindergarten - without regard to the company hierarchy and their respective position.
Although it is an individual education and care, the program content in the mini-kindergarten is nevertheless comparable to the pre-school education framework programme.
The children not only play here, but above all they are offered excellent lessons - from basic insights to preschool lessons, they also learn English.
The classroom is not only equipped with toys and creative games, but also with a computer that is available to children.
What's more - the presence of small children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive corporate environment.
The parents can take a look at the children at any time and thus the stress of picking up the children from a distant kindergarten is avoided.
Parents therefore use their working time more productively.
It is no wonder that natural and loyal employer-worker relationships are also developing here.
Arch.Design has thus become part of the Czech companies, which offer significant benefits when acquiring new employees, who are family friendly and who strengthen their personal marketing through such programs.
A bone house fascinates even after 100 years. Look at the interiors of Gaudi
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric ech, the stairs like the spine of a dinosaur and the balconies are torn-up fish mowers.
This is Casa Batlló of Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
Of the local inhabitants, the house with its organic forms was nicknamed \"Knochenhaus\"
Organic shapes, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tile splits and mosaics, which resemble shuffling facades and omnipresent soft lines, all these are typical features for Antonio Gaudi's youth style.
The façade of the house plays with fantastic lines, tender colors and textures that remind us of nature and living beings.
It is only when we look more closely at it that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and thought-in order.
During the night, the entire facade still seems more plastic, dramatic and the special illumination enhances the shine of the colors.
The same swivel lines and curved shapes also dominate the interior of the house.
Wave-shaped wood copies the window frames, fences, ornamental elements of doors, even guckholes and lashes.
The house Batlló in the Eixample district on the lively shopping street Passeig de Grácia No. 43 was constructed by the conversion of a house from 1877, which was performed by the architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Joseph Batlló, originally insisted on the demolition of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but ultimately he agreed to the idea of Gaudí for an unusual and even cheaper conversion.
However, Casa Batlló's rental house did not design Antoni Gaudí alone.
He worked with the architect Joseph Maria Jujol.
The decorations for the representative home of the real estate owner and also the use of mosaics on the facade were his idea.
However, many other artists and artists also worked on the design of the façade.
The joint work on the drafts for Casa Batlló was the start of a fruitful cooperation between Jujola and Gaudí.
Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudí's Casa Milá house in the Park Güell, in which further works of Antoni Gaudí are also located.
Shortly after its completion, the house got from the local inhabitants of its organic forms due to the nickname \"Knochenhaus\"
Others, in turn, called it the special window opening mechanism because of the \"likening house\"
It is also said that at the top of the building is the sword of St. George, the patron of Catalonia.
But also other pictorial elements symbolize hidden religious motives.
Gaudí designed for the house a unique central heating system with ventilating channels and typical fireplaces for that time.
It's a bit bizarre that their 45-degree inclination is already on.
In his work, Gaudí consistently ignored all the building regulations at that time and could by no means interfere with them.
Before the construction began, he had obtained from the city the corresponding construction permit, but the information he made about the planned reconstruction was so vague that two years later, the city fathers were so displeased with the result that they requested relief.
The councillors also insisted, among other things, that the construction with its pillars even intervened in public citizenship.
However, no further changes were made, on the contrary - only fifteen days after the call to the city district in question, Joseph Batlló made an application to approve the renting of the two highest floors of the house - and she was promptly granted it.
The owner himself moved into the lower floors.
In the gallery on the 2nd floor was a company salon, on the third floor were the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment.
The ground floor was engaged in a jeweling business.
The entire six-storey building runs through a staircase up to the roof terrace.
Due to the basic elements of the conversion, all right angles and straight lines were removed and replaced by curved and curved walls.
Gaudí, however, also worked with a modern concept for connecting rooms.
The social part can be completely connected by opening the salon doors and thus a larger society could easily chat without having to give up some intimacy in more confidential conversations.
The house was also given a rather unusual roof and two more floors by Gaudí's conversion except for a new façade.
Amazing is Gaudí's game with the light as well as the blue and white glazed tiles with which the courtyard is dressed and the lighthouses.
The game of these two colors gives all the floors of the house a maximum amount of light.
In doing so, he simply made the principle of utility that white reflects the light better than dark colors that absorb sunlight on the contrary.
The Casa Batlló House, which was included in the Unesco World Heritage List in 2005, can visit anyone today.
On the first floor, the most spacious and magnificent apartment is made accessible to the public.
The owners of the house only decided in the year to this step and this on the occasion of the 150th birthday of the famous creator.
When it was found that this is a fairly attractive business, the visits were maintained, but it was extended to other common and the rooftop rooms, including the rooftop terrace.
However, the price of visiting the building monument is not a pop-up steel, it is 16.50 Euros, students, pensioners, groups and owners of tourist certificates get 20 percent discount.
This amount exceeds the entry prices for other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to get to know the real atmosphere of the house with its dragon towers, try to make friends with one of the householders and visit him at home.
The right mattress and the right bed rust? Women have different desires than men
Not the most beautiful bed frame, but the quality of the lying surface - so mattress and rust make up the good bed.
However, these must complement each other harmoniously in order to meet the wishes of the concrete user.
When selecting, many things play a role - the weight, the size, the state of health and, not least, the sex of the sleeper.
Likewise important is the interior in which mattresses and rust are submerged.
Typical example?
In a weekend house where there is no regular heating, latex mattresses are not well suited, as they take much longer to become \"warm\"
In addition, they are significantly heavier than usual polyurethane mattresses.
And - they should be used regularly.
If they do not have enough ventilating ducts in the core and are still on a solid plate, moisture is rising: It is therefore not excluded that they form under their mold.
Of course, choice also plays a role in what you are accustomed to.
Those who have been abroad for a long time, where very high mattresses with soft layer are common, will be hard to get used to a low mattress with hard surface.
“Because all ice hockey players who have returned from the NHL have complained to me that they can no longer sleep properly here,” he said.
\"For their skinned shoulders, heels and hips, they simply need a soft layer of Visco foam (Memory Foam - a form memory polymer). \"
“I recommend these people, among other things, who suffer from a nervous system disorder, so that they can get the ‘information’ from the joints and the skin badly, Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
That's why I got many ice hockey players years ago, but also other customers these mattresses with Visco foam (Memory Foam).
“Today this is no longer a problem, because such mattresses offer, among other things, the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico,
And you don't necessarily have to be a famous hockey player to appreciate the benefits of the Visco foam.
This “wonder” actually works quite simply.
The foam optimizes its hardness and shape according to the absorbed heat, in other words, it usually lubricates itself at the warm body.
No one pushes it, at night you don't waltz around like after a heavy fight.
You just sleep much better.
The viscoelastic foam also provides protection against decubitus (wound fire).
When selecting the mattress size, you should still add to the body size the length of the soles, i.e. about 21 to 34 cm.
Men like women, who are 180 cm tall, so need a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each of the sleepers should be available at least 90 cm in length, together with 180 cm.
For single beds, for example in singles, 120 to 140 cm are attached.
The comfort of half and also for any visitors.
Otherwise, the following rule applies to the ideal width of the bed: “If you’re on the back, you should still have enough space for the slightly angled arms,” advises Ing. Helena Prokopová, the headmaster of the upholstery and room equipment, who has been devoted for years to the problem of healthy sleep and ergonomics of furniture and also presents this subject to specialist schools.
With a double bed, each person needs his own roast and his own mattress, but be careful when shopping so that the mattresses are also equally high.
Otherwise, nothing else remains left than to mount the rust at different heights and this is not possible for every bed frame.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with spring skeleton 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters should fall on the mold layer and the fine padding.
“You can’t feel the feathers by hand or by putting them in place,” warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a special type of rust.
Completely padded beds with mattresses and underlays like grown Siamzwillingen have nothing to look for in the bedroom.
These mattresses can't be ventilated and you can't wash what's already going on and done.
And since you lose between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat in a single night, it is clear that the mattress will slowly become a giant (and clogged) after five to seven years.
This is also why professionals reject advertising slogans that promise a lifetime of up to 25 years in mattresses, even life-long warranty.
Every thing has her When and But.
And therefore a practical advice from traders: In mattresses of 120 or 140 cm width one should not shy away from the hygiene of washable, deductible covers, yet it is advisable to use a mattress cleaner that can be easily removed and washed.
Even today, even if mattresses are usually made with a round lock, so that you get two halves after opening (i.e. important for washing and washing machines size!), manipulation with larger mattresses, especially performed alone, often encourages like the unequal battle between David and Goliath.
Do they have a solid plate in bed instead of a rust?
Get out of here!
Or at most for a bed for unloved guests and for a single night.
In this way they should prefer to use the plate with ventilation holes (if none are in it) and mattresses with spring skeleton and 15 cm minimum height with so-called pocket spring core and fine padding.
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong to such a base.
Latex or sandwich mattresses (e.g. combination of latex and coconut) are suitable for non-adjustable latten roasts with 14 to 18 spring stalks (latex or sandwich mattresses), always pay rosts with a greater number of lats, i.e. from 28 and more spring stalks, with lordose support in the longitudinal vertebral area and the possibility of regulating the latten hardness.
On adjustable laminate rusts there are no mattresses with spring skeleton, as they do not react to ergonomic adjustment.
In addition to the adjustment of the stiffness of the spring bars, special flexible shoulder modules are also offered.
This involves a special fastening of the feathers, which allows to press the feathers or even angle them in such a way that they enable the point-of-sink of the shoulder of the sleeper.
Especially for men with broad shoulders an important thing.
There are even mattress manufacturers who have begun to use soft zones for the shoulder area in the case of 'herring mattresses'.
The ladies are also thought - they are given these soft zones in the hip area.
For the most demanding customers, point-plastic wing spring systems (lattoflex) or ruste with point-plastic contact pads with so-called multitorsion suspension are determined.
The pressure is distributed to several points, which reduces the voltage.
But - if you use a bad (too big and full) pillow for the right mattress and proper rust, most of the benefits will be lost again.
Here also a rule of thumb: the pillow should support the head, its tips should only reach up to the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
Ideally, therefore, a 50 x 60 cm pillow appears as it likes, for example, the Scandinavian.
In the side position, the head cushion (together with the shoulder load zone in the rust or soft zone in the mattress) should balance the shoulder height.
Our modern mattresses have something in common with the once (filled with hay) straw bags.
Modern manufacturers increasingly use more and more natural materials or at least their accessories.
Also in the case of mattresses, the new magic word “Bio” means “Bio”
Instead of petroleum raw materials, they are used to produce polyurethane foams more and more frequent natural oils - such as ricinus and soy oil.
Soya is probably used by all well-known manufacturers.
“Bio’s name is for mattresses, which are made up of materials of pure natural origin,” explains Petr Vašíček from Tropico Plus.
However, natural substances are also used in the manufacture of mattress coatings - one of the first was Aloe Vera.
But you can also enjoy microcapsules that spread fresh forest or lavender fragrance while sleeping.
Here, too, one makes a difference between man and woman.
While men use a “cooling” plant extract from birch leaves to absorb the heat and cool the body, women’s “heating” relationships are effective.
Extracts from red paprika shots cause blood circulation, so the weaker sex becomes warm when you sleep.
And today's favorites?
Mattresses made of cold foam (it has larger pores with destroyed cell structure and is therefore more breathable than conventional polyurethane and also much more flexible).
The combination of the different starches (hardness) of cold foams and visco foams creates multi-zone mattresses that know exactly where the head, hips and heels are located.
For a high-quality mattress, however, you have 7000 crowns and more to touch.
However, health mattresses are usually burdened with lower VAT, as they are considered medical aids.
The first Czech company, Gumotex, was granted this advantage.
You see, saving at the mattress and at the rust is not so easy.
Occasionally there are special offers from manufacturers and dealers that offer two mattresses at the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers the mattress duofreeze with the attached Visco foam memory for 11,990 CZK.
The second thing you get free of charge.
It was the material tempur that initiated the era of viscoelastic foams with open cell structure and high density at almost cosmic pace.
No wonder they were developed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overload at the start.
Tempur is soft at heat, in a cool environment it solidifies again.
Thus it adapts perfectly to the human body and distributes the body pressure in an optimal way.
It is therefore not only ideal for preventing pressure fire, but generally increases sleep comfort.
However, viscoelastic foams are not only used in mattresses, but also in other health products, such as in special pedestals designed to facilitate bones and vessels.
For example, local manufacturers use foams Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want human monitoring devices to have the kids under control
Fear of their own children grows and so more and more parents are considering monitoring them via GPS.
The system that was originally invented for the detection of cars can be just as good for people, which would be helpful in such cases, as would be the last time the nine-year-old Anička Janatková had disappeared.
The device is currently about the size of a cigarette box but soon it should not be bigger than a bracelet watch.
Many people have put fear and horror in the case of the disappeared Anička, so they keep looking for means and ways to better protect their children.
Also for the price of affecting their privacy.
“We’re trying to tell everyone that it’s not about spying, but about an effective means of reducing the likelihood of tragedy,” says Petr Pilin of the Macro Weil company, one of the suppliers of GPS location equipment on the Czech market.
“I admit that in individual cases it can come to abuse of such devices, for example, if someone puts it in the pocket without knowing about it, but we had no such case to mention so far,”
“Most customers really buy it for security reasons - adds Pilin.
In his opinion, however, the child should always know what purpose the \"shadow\" serves and how to use it in an emergency.
However, the child psychologist Dana Bočková points out that if a child does not like to wear such a thing, he simply takes it away.
“Even very small children show great creativity when it comes to losing certain things intentionally if they do not want to be controlled”
“At first the cell phones raised big expectations with the parents, but they can be switched off as easily as these new surveillance devices,” says Ms. Bočková.
In your opinion, it is also controversial whether such a facility actually helps in the event of an attack.
“In the case of planned abductions, the Kidnapper practically always checks whether the child has any electronics with which it could be sorted,
\"Today it's the cell phone\"
\"If such surveillance equipment were to be used more widely, they would also be looking for it, as their sale would certainly be accompanied by massive advertising,
“In these cases, police criminals are always one step ahead,” the psychologist says.
However, she admits that similar devices can be quite helpful in a sudden attack by a pedophile.
According to Roberta Čech of the company RC Monitoring, which offers location services both for automobiles and for persons, the existence of such a device can also help if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
‘The device can be set in such a way that it reports the respective position at certain intervals,
“Even if it was destroyed immediately, at least the last position of the data subject is available,
\"In the case of more expensive devices, even a tilting knife is integrated, that is, if you are falling down and are left motionless, the device immediately sends a warning stating the position - Mr Čech asserts.
In his opinion, similar services could also provide intelligent mobile phones with navigation, one only needs to use a special software.
The problem with current positioning devices is that it is either about equipment in string wood shaft sizes that resemble trailers or about smaller cell phones.
There is always the danger of losing them.
According to Mr Pilin von der Macro Weil, in the present we are testing devices that look like normal digital watches.
“This has the advantage that the possible attacker does not have to recognize at all that it is a surveillance or detection device.
“Or he notes that only after some time, what the police are giving a time advance, does he add.
No matter in which direction the development is going - towards bracelets or trailers, the same technology is always used as in vehicle location.
So for the combination of positioning function using the GPS system (just like the Navi in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many ignition cords that one could wrap all over the Czech Republic but keep only two years
The Czech army has bought 445 kilometres of ignition cord, with explosives fired.
In the previous year, the Ministry of Defense had already delivered 224 kilometres of Zündschnuur to the army camps.
It is comforting to know that the armed forces have taken care of for 225 years.
The problem is only the durability of the ignition cord - two, but not more than four years.
The army bought the ignition cord from STV Group, a.s. for Lappish 40 million crowns.
In his reasons for purchasing this huge amount of ignition cord, the MF DNES General Staff replied that the soldiers would consume the 60 km of ignition cord each year.
According to the research carried out by army pyrotechnics, MF DNES pointed out that every year the whole army would have to complete an extremely intensive pyrotechnic training - from all generals and officers of the army command, to the secretaries.
Minister of Defense Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek are not included.
Only in this way could the considerable annual consumption of sixty kilometres of ignition cords be partially justified.
By the way, this length corresponds to 25,000 detonations.
But this would also be true for more than ten years.
However, if the old rule of experts still applies that in order to train each new professional soldier to reach two metres of ignition, then the army has created a calming supply for the 225 years already mentioned, even under the view of the increased need for pioneer and special units.
At the moment, soldiers from the fast deployment brigade complained to the Minister of Defense Vondra that they had almost no more cartridges for handguns, so shooting exercises of the missing means are severely restricted.
Don't worry about the underwear shortage.
“We don’t even consider why they buy from us such quantities of ignition cords,
But this is ultimately their decision, they will already know what they need,
“For us, the army is a good customer, to whom we want to meet as a dealer - says the sales manager of STV Group Jan Děcký.
Jan Pejšek, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Defense, explains the purchase of hundreds of kilometers of Zündschnure by saying that the army would have covered itself with this \"munition\" for at least ten years.
Jan Děcký of the STV Group, however, only speaks of a four-year period of ignition and police and army pyrotechnicians for only two years.
\"In the case of perfect storage, the four mentioned years are possible, including one of them, who wants to remain unnamed, in order not to be accused of criticism of the army as a soldier.
After expiry of the period of use, any ammunition must be thoroughly tested, whether it is still reliable and not endangering the lives of the soldiers.
But these tests are not for nothing, but cost more money.
Another argument of the Ministry of Defense is the quantity discount for the 445 kilometres of ignition.
“They cost us sixty percent less than last year’s 244 kilometres supply - spokesperson Pejšek tells us the position of buyers of the Ministry of Defense.
Only for comparison: The annual consumption of ignition cords by pyrotechnics of the police, liquidating the ammunition from World War II or the Soviet Brother's Army, has for a number of years hardly exceeded 1,500 meters.
And the police always order only such quantities of this ammunition that they can consume even before the end of the period of use.
Due to the safety of pyrotechnicians, the possibility of flexible purchases of modern and thus reliable ignition cords is open.
The Ministry of Defense has already had huge problems in liquidating tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the times of the Warsaw Treaty, when the two hundred thousand Czechoslovak people's army prepared for their campaign to the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnics who addressed MF DNES, in a few years, the Czech forces are expecting the same problem in liquidating hundreds of kilometers of old ignition cords that they have bought so-called \"favorably\" today.
To this day, the contacts I have gained from the competition have come to me.
The successful placement in the competition, small businessmen of the year, helped Lukáš Pytloun sell the franchises of his hotel.
The winner of the last year of the competition “Small contractors of the year” was Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
The story of his success encourages like a film scene.
Lukáš Pytlon liked to travel.
It was only abroad that he was aware of the lack of good accommodation options at reasonable prices in Liberec.
From the savings of his holiday work abroad and with the help of a bank loan, he created a built-in house with five apartments.
Considering that he was a high school student in the sixth semester at that time, this was certainly a courageous undertaking.
“The price-quality ratio in those days irritated me and so I tried to do something against it,” says Lukáš Pytloun.
He rented the first reconstructed apartment to work abroad.
He immediately invested the whole profit back into the house, which he then converted step by step to the boarding house with 54 beds.
Since then, in just seven years of entrepreneurial activity in Liberec, he has managed to open four guest houses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four-star hotel, Pytloun Design Hotel,
This year another first-class hotel was added.
“We have already signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, to which we sold our franchise concept and other interested parties at the Pytloun Hotels franchise have already announced themselves,” says the entrepreneur number One of last year.
'Great share of this licence sale for the operation of hotels had just won in the competition 'Businesses of the Year', adding Mr Pytloun's recognition.
The victory has brought him greater fame, yes popularity in Liberec and surroundings.
“The people recognized me on the street, often they even congratulated me on my work, and I have to say that did quite well - he remembers.
I really recommend that everyone who wants to create something participate in this competition.
You don't have to win the same way either, every sighting is good.
He says that to this day he has benefited from the contacts and acquaintances that otherwise would not have come at all.
\"With some people whom I have met thanks to the competition, I am maintaining regular business relations to this day\"
The fame associated with success, in his opinion, also touches a little on each of his employees.
And that's where he's got seventy.
“I have greater loyalty to them and I am proud that they are part of something that will give general recognition,”
I really don't just see this as a personal success, no, that's the result of the good work of all of us,
“My name is only a little in the foreground, ” says Lukáš Pytloun modestly.
My successors wish me a quieter year than we had in Farmet
The victory euphoria was quickly eliminated from the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his determination, Farmet has the worst behind him.
The prize for the first rank of the Vodafone Competition Company of the year last year took place in Karel Ž torský, the farmer of Farmet.
At the time, the jury appreciated the efforts he made from the small tool building in Česká Skalice a company that makes hundreds of millions of sales.
“I can say that this appreciation not only encouraged me, but also all my employees and strengthened our self-awareness in the struggle with competition,” says the previous year’s winner.
At the beginning of Farmet's company history was the effort to do something useful.
And when the state offered its father Karel Žƿárský as compensation for the property seized by the Communists a small workshop for the lease, he did not long hesitate to have his career in the company in which he had been employed so far and founded his own company for the production of plastic walls with a few comrades of his father.
A short time later, they began to focus on plant oil presses.
Within 18 years, they have risen to become the largest manufacturer of automatic presses throughout Central Europe.
But only by the success of the competition mentioned and its medialization did it also become aware of the non-publicity.
“Not only that our customers now perceive the Farmet brand much more intensely, our foreign partners, too, began the process of working with a company that has achieved the greatest success in their country, in increasing their value,” says Karel Žƿárský.
Last year, however, Farmet was not only in the sign of the victory euphoria.
The assessment was based on the economic results of the company in 2008 and part of 2009.
And just 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of tool construction products.
The crisis, which hit the citizens even less, but especially businesses, reached its peak - many companies were forced to discontinue their investment projects and restrict the purchase of new facilities and technologies.
\"Of course, we could not escape this situation, too,
“The sales decreased by 40 percent, we had to restrict production and even seize dismissals,” explains Karel Ž
A viable company may also have to take such unpopular measures.
But it was possible to get the situation under control and keep the company in black numbers, even if with lower profits than before the crisis.
In the case of one, the company was not willing to make cuts - in investment in research and development.
“From the grant we built a research and training centre, we encouraged our presentation at international trade fairs and acquired major awards at domestic exhibitions,” says Žƿárský.
Everything proves that we have overcome the crisis.
The sales are growing again and with them the number of new employees.
“I wish the new winner a lot of joy at the victory - but in a quiet atmosphere - is letting Karel Ž in the right direction.
A poll of opinion which deals with insanity rules
The poll for the \"Absurdity of the Year\" is part of the Entrepreneur's competition for the fourth time.
Some senseless rules have already succeeded in creating out of the world.
To the doubtful winner of the next year’s poll of opinion “Absurdity of the Year,” the obligation to create documents on authorities that are available online was extended.
Thus, more than a third of non-four thousand voting entrepreneurs decided.
So the Social Security Administration requested a paper extract from the trade register, even if the official could have retrieved it by two mouse clicks.
This is now changing thanks to the poll.
\"The Czech Social Security Administration will not require any more extracts from the trade register in future in the case of checks by social security payers, the spokesperson of ČSSZ Jana Buraňová stated.
The purpose and purpose of the poll, 'Absurdity of the Year', is to take all the rules and regulations under the guise that entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to comply with and to remove the nonsense.
This is part of an entrepreneurial competition for the fourth time this year, which is organised by the Czech Economic Journal (HN) and which delights in the public's growing popularity.
If last year the three thousand people participated in the vote, it was already four thousand this year.
No wonder, for there are still a lot of legal obligations that only serve to hinder business activity.
“For example, as far as the number of income tax forms is concerned, we are taking a lead in the world,” says Karel Havlíček from the association of small and medium-sized companies and business drivers of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of entrepreneurial activity has been the declared goal of all governments in recent years.
In comparison to the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic has hardly improved.
According to World Bank data, the Czech Republic is taking 74th place in terms of company conditions, compared to the previous year an 8th place worse.
The Absurdity competition of the year was launched for the first time in the year and played each year after the same scene.
Anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April to the conclusion of the competition.
The web address www.firmaroku.cz. is then used by the competition organiser for seven candidates for the \"anti-price\" and allows the public to vote on the websites www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz via the Internet.
It wins the absurdity that gets the most votes.
This year's opinion poll has already been reported for more than a hundred, more precisely 105 pointless regulations and regulations.
The tips come not only from entrepreneurs, but also from professional associations and journalists.
Among the nominated \"finalists\" of the competition are also provisions that maintenance vehicles for highways and highways have to pay toll, or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets have to provide toll every two years.
The list of seven of these years is published on the competition pages.
The opening of the competition at the Prague Wenceslas Square at the beginning of November is part of a hopping which regularly also takes part in the personalities of political and public life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, the director of the association of small or medium-sized companies and commercial drivers of the Czech Republic and Petr Kužel, the president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, were at the height of the competition with the party.
\"Where the State throws the entrepreneurship gap between its legs, there can be no real economic upturn, so my goal is to raise at least thirty paragraphs every year, which still make it unnecessary for entrepreneurs to take part in their business today. Martin Kocourek, Minister for Industry and Trade, told us.
The efforts to create nonsense arrangements from the world show effect.
In 2007, the majority of the people imposed on the entrepreneurs were obliged to inform the commercial office of their permanent establishment three days in advance of the intention to want to go to an exhibition or Kirmes with an exhibition stand.
This obligation was repealed by a novelty of the Commercial Act.
The obligation to receive the second-largest number of votes in 2007 - the obligation to report to the Employment Office travel of employees up to 30 days - was abolished by the law on them, “Green Card”.
And - all good things are three:
On the absurdity of 2009, the regulation imposed on physiotherapists to have a mirror, a refrigerator and two scales in the speech room.
This regulation was reduced by the Ministry of Health this year - the requirement for a refrigerator was removed.
A new category is worthy of socially responsible companies
Assessment criteria are humanitarian, environmental, educational or sports projects
A novelty in this year's fifth anniversary of the competition of the economic newspaper (HN) is the category of the responsible company of 2010
The basic idea of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair enterprises.
“We want to support such companies, who are aware of the consequences of their entrepreneurial activity on the environment and support socially responsible initiatives,” says Patrik Bartholdy, regional manager of the mobile phone company Vodafon, the caller and guarantor of this competition, as well as the competition, the rebel of the year.
For this year's first year of this special sub-category of the main competition Vodafon Company of the year reported on companies for which success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each one of them is extremely inspirational and biting enough fabric for an independent article.
Although they differ diametrically in terms of the subject matter of their activity, their efforts still have a common denominator - support and consideration.
Here, for example, people with disabilities are concerned with personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Czech Republic, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera appeared, which promotes the development of non-formal sports teams among its employees, who then participate in numerous tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible firm from the Pardubice region is the Isolit-Bravo company, which has been the main sponsor of a Foundation Fund for Disabled Children for seventeen years.
A paper factory from Poděbrady is also an exemplary caretaker of its health-inhibited employees, who make up 70 percent of their workforce, for which it has been awarded the title “Responsible Company of the Central Bohemian Region”; in the Vodafone Company competition of the year, it was placed third in the framework of this region.
In the region of Olomouc, the accounting firm MiRyz Soft, which introduced, among other things, a fluid and also reduced working time to an average of 35 hours per week, and this without a proportionate wage reduction.
The jury also honored the fact that the company is mainly buying from Czech manufacturers, supporting citizens' initiatives in their environment and working according to environmentally friendly principles.
“We strive to recycle as much as possible to minimise the consequences of our entrepreneurial activity and administration for the environment,” explains her managing director Miluše Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the region of Ustí nad Labem, in turn, is located at the health of its employees and, therefore, it has acquired them to all notebooks ergonomic armchairs and keyboards, in addition to promoting homework in their employees and in corporate actions, it uses mapping services offered by a domestic protected workshop.
“In addition, we support the “people in need” foundation, which gives concrete help to the local Roma community, says Ondřej Suchý, the company’s representative.
Last but not least, the activity of the cleaning company Praní a čištění from the Karlsbad region is worth mentioning, which contributes to their pension insurance to their employees in the form of extra bonuses.
“We are providing our employees with contributions to the food, the working path, to increase their qualifications and for their holidays,” says Josef Strapáč of the construction company Czasch from Bruntál, the winner in the Moravian-Silesian region.
To the category responsible firm of the year, all District Finalists of the Vodafon Competition were automatically notified of the year, which answered the questions of the application and sent it to the organiser by 15 August at the latest.
False or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were excluded from the evaluation by the organiser.
“If the representatives of the competing companies left the questions unanswered, they were excluded from the competition “responsible firm of the year”, but in the main competition Vodafone company of the year they were not disqualified,
“A separate application for this competition is not possible, as it is merely a sub-category of the main competition company of the year,” explains Karel Goldman of the organizing agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Bodenfonds - Arrests of Police in a Public Procurement
In the building of the Ground Fund in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police took arrests in the last few days.
The local media entrepreneur and real estate dealer Luboš G. was led off by the detectives in handcuffs.
It had allegedly attempted to manipulate a public competition that was currently taking place to settle restitution claims in such a way that the property offered in the competition was granted to a specific party.
This is to have paid Luboš G. half a million for it.
“At this point, I can only confirm that the police are pursuing a person in public competition because of the offence of fraudulent machinations,” said Antonie Zelená, the head of the Pilsan prosecutorship of the newspaper Právo, unable to provide further details regarding the ongoing investigations.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old entrepreneur was released by the police again.
The way in which he could manipulate public competition can only be speculated about in view of the sparse official information.
The spokesperson of the Lubomír Černá Ground Fund raised Právo's question that the police actually took arrests in the Pilsner branch of the Ground Fund and did so during public competition.
“It was about a client and not about one of our employees,” she concretely stated.
According to the public competition, Ms. Černá had the correct designation \"Requirement to offer claims for the transfer of land under the ground law\" and would take place in cases where several applicants show interest in the property offered.
‘These persons shall offer, in the context of the invitation, a higher value of their restitution claims to be met by the transfer than the declared property value,
\"According to the claims offered, the order of potential purchasers is determined, and the Ground Fund then transfers the property to the person with the highest offer, the spokesperson of the Fund.
Luboš G. was obviously available with information about who had signed up for the call and since he was a self-authorized person since he had bought a number of restitution claims, he offered a property interest that he withdrew from the competition.
Obviously against a bold invention.
That would also be an adequate explanation of why he had such a large sum of money in his arrest.
Luboš G. had too good contacts with the Pilsner Ground Fund in the past.
He also played a role in the causa of the former head of the Václav Sankota Ground Fund, which was prosecuted by the fact that he issued land in replacement restitutions, which had already taken place on construction projects.
At that time, for example, Luboš G. also acquired land intended for the construction of public roads, more specifically, where the construction of the access magistrate to the business area Borské pole was planned.
Later he exchanged these very cheaply with the Magistrate against a house directly in the historical center of the city, which far exceeded the value of the property.
At the time, the town hall had to give a heavy heart to the small area so as not to jeopardise the construction project by blocking the property.
The housing costs of households rise by a few hundred monthly
From January onwards, households will not only have to expect higher costs for all types of energy, but also higher water and wastewater charges and for district heating and some places will also grow rents.
Families will have to pull several hundred crowns out of the wallet every month as of January.
Electricity is going to be up to 4.6 percent more expensive, gas by 2 percent and more, in some cities you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supplies, and sometimes the distance heat supplies will also be expensive.
The electricity consumption alone costs the households several hundred more crowns a year.
The strong electricity prices have been reduced by all main suppliers, so debt is the clear promotion of electricity generation from renewable sources, particularly from photovoltaic plants.
Although gas is only slightly more expensive, this is exactly when people have to heat the most and have the highest consumption.
So here too there are several hundred crowns more per year to be expected.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive throughout the Czech Republic, the prices for district heating vary from city to city.
Especially larger places are planning price increases.
For example, households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové have to pay up to 50 crowns a month from January onwards, more than 1000 crowns pay more per year to families in Liberec.
The inhabitants of Prague, in turn, threaten 9 percent higher water and wastewater charges and this in case the city increases infrastructure rents.
If the rent does not change, it is only 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague is still among the lowest in the Czech Republic.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and wastewater charges are expected to rise by 7.4%.
Enormous price increases are expected, for example, in 140,000 rentals where the so-called rental regulation expires from January onwards.
For example, the housing company CPI Byty, which owns 2500 apartments in Âstí nad Labem, plans to increase rents by a hundred percent from January onwards.
Those who do not agree with this increase in rent will be the company's legal interests.
The regulated rents, which are still paid in approximately 300,000 apartments today, are expected to rise by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech children drink with Fernet and rum beer is out - it just seems too slow
Fernet, Rum and Vodka, except for a good whiskey that you stole from the father from the house bar.
These are the drinks, after which drunk Czech teenagers among fifteen have to be treated most frequently.
No exception are children who need to sleep out their cat repeatedly in the hospital.
This is reflected in the experience of doctors confronted with similar cases in the admission of children's departments of clinics.
“Beers or wine are completely out of fashion, because it just takes too long for you to get drunk,
“Today’s trend is clearly hard alcohol,” said Právo Luděk Pelikán, the head of the Children’s Department in the Hořovice Central Bohemian Clinic.
“Whisky, if he succeeds in disposing of the father of a bottle from the housebar, and if not, then at least Fernet or Vodka.
“Wodka has the advantage of being able to mix him with Juice, and then he doesn’t smell so strong - explains the chief doctor.
The spokesperson of the faculty hospital Motol Eva Jurinová gives him a right.
\"The most common concern is Fernet or Rum\"
“This is today’s alcohol trend, especially at primary schools,
\"It was also unique about Slibowitz, who was taken from home, who led Ms. Jurinová.
According to Pelikán, thirteen- or fourteen-year-old Trinkers in hospital admission are long no exception.
In front of the hospital in Hořovice, where he has been working since this year, he has been working in the Paediatric Department of the Motol Hospital for ten years, where the rescue cars delivered drinking students from near and far.
\"A girl had to be hospitalized four times,
\"She started her career at the age of 12, when she was delivered with 3.5 samples of alcohol for the first time in blood and in combination with \"extase\" she described a particularly difficult case.
“She was at the exhibition site in Holešovice at any dance party,” she said.
“The interesting thing was that it didn’t seem strange to her mother that her daughter didn’t come home for 48 hours,” the chief doctor wonders.
The lack of interest of parents or their incredible tolerance in starting with their own speakers is considered one of the main causes of the growing alcoholism of children.
According to experts, there is no real dependence in the true sense of the word in children.
“A long-term chronic dependence on alcohol and all related phenomena is to be understood under alcoholism, and this is not the case with these children,
For those who repeatedly enjoy alcohol, most of the time a negative family-social background is characteristic - explains chiefist Pelikán.
According to the spokesperson of the Motol Hospital, Ms. Jurinová, approximately forty drunk children were admitted to the local department of child and adolescent medicine until mid-November.
However, only cases with severe alcohol poisoning that required hospital stay are included in the statistics.
Intoxicated children brought home after outpatient treatment by their parents or, where appropriate, by the police shall not be registered.
In addition to the cases where children drink only a bottle of schnapps in the school bench, Mr Pelikán believes that there are three annual amplitudes to which a hundred percent leave is: Walpurgisnacht, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
‘The latter for two reasons - either for grief because of the bad witness or for joy in the holiday,
\"At Walpurgisnacht I also experienced seven drunk children at one time in the recording - Dr. Pelikán emphasizes.
A drunk child who spends the night under medical supervision is paradoxically better off than a child who has only to fight with an unpleasant cat the next day.
The postmortem headaches, which are related to dehydration and glucose deficiency, can be driven in the hospital with a fluid-dependent infusion of glucose and nutrients that the organism lacks.
“They’re definitely better than that, because after the “glory ” experience in the evening, they wake up with good mood, without hurting anywhere,
“They’re just a little confused about where they are,” says Dr Pelikán, adding that he sometimes loses the patient’s good mood by listing them the cost of treatment.
Because the transport with the rescue car and the night in an acute bed comes well and likes a few tens of thousands of crowns.
“Here and again I used this as a means of education when I immediately predicted to the children during the visit what their drunkenness cost and that it could happen that they had to work all the vacations over to earn the money for a single such fee,” Dr. Pelikán added.
In his opinion, however, the health insurance companies do not rely on regress procedures to demand the parents' necessary costs to cure the drinking children.
Two L-159 training aircraft for the first time in a foreign hand - in Spain
Two light fighter aircraft L-159 out of a total of five, which the Czech Ministry of Defense has exchanged against the Casa C-295M transport aircraft, flew to the Spanish city of Seville on Tuesday, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS settles.
It is the first time that machines of this type are owned by a foreign army.
They have only been seen abroad at maneuvers or flight shows.
It is about the air-capable two-seater version L-159T1, which was operated by the Czech army.
The remaining three aircraft are single-seater L-159.
These are still preserved in Aero Vodochody, the intermediary of this business - the company Omnipol - has taken over them last week.
When it physically expedites the aircraft from Vodochody, Jan Pejšek, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Defense, is not yet known.
The one-seater fighter aircraft L-159, in turn, were excluded from long-term aircraft and this was done without further deposits and investments from the Ministry's resort.
“The double-seat L-159T1 was exchanged in the current state and appearance,” said Pejšek in Právo newspaper.
He added that the army will not have to come out without two-seater fighter aircraft, as the Ministry of Defense signed a 200-million contract with Aero Vodochody in May 2009 on the conversion of four superfluous L-159 to the two-seater version.
A new plane took over the army in July, the second one she wants to take over by the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, EADS has committed itself to enforce the combat aircraft in the equipment of one of the NATO countries.
\"The Treaty clearly states that EADS is the acceptor of aircraft L-159 and that it is intended to train pilots of NATO countries.
“It’s therefore the buyer’s business, in which way he realizes the matter,” stated Pejšek.
The economic newspaper (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish government has no interest in L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 against a Casa transport aircraft and the purchase of further aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns was approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Department of Defense did not have written out tender procedures for the purchase at that time, but addressed EADS directly.
The Defence Office argued that this exchange would support the future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought Aero 72 machines, of which it only uses 24, the rest wanted to sell them.
By the way, the purchase of the Casa aircraft is likely to have a judicial effect.
In fact, the European Commission sued the Czech Ministry of Defence at the European Court of Justice for the reason that it would have to choose the aircraft on the basis of an entire European invitation to tender and by not addressing a single manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three Casa aircraft, the last to land at Kbely Airport within fourteen days.
A longer index finger than a ring finger means a lower risk of cancer
Men whose index finger is longer than the ring finger are obviously at a lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study published by the British Journal of Cancer on Wednesday.
This should be related to the mirror of the male hormone testosterone.
“Our results show that the relative length of fingers can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer, and this is especially for men up to sixty - explained the co-author of the study, Ros Eeles, professor at the Cancer Research Institute at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help determine which men should necessarily undergo a prostate cancer test, especially if there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family health risks, added Ms. Eeles.
During the period 1994-2009 she and her colleagues in Britain followed more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer, but also 3000 healthy men.
In more than half of the study participants, the right hand index finger was shorter than the ring finger.
For these men, the same probability of prostate cancer as for 19 percent of those men whose ring and index fingers were equally long.
However, in men whose index finger was longer than the ring finger, this risk decreased by 33 percent, in men up to sixty by 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers mentioned, already in prenatal age, obviously reflects the different levels of sex hormones that the child was exposed to in the womb.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer index finger.
Previous research has shown that the testosterone just accelerates the growth of prostate cancer.
Václav Pačes, the leading Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, said that ČTK was known to him this study was volatile, yet he did not consider the relationship between the finger length and the risk of cancer so far to be \"full\"
Czech Republic in snow - D1 and D5 are locked
Like most of Europe, the Czech Republic is also under a snow cover on Thursday morning.
On the streets and highways there is mostly trapped snow, the winter workers were often all night on the axis.
The D5 motorway between km 89 and 90 towards Rozvadov is due to some accidents of trucks and cars and also to the D1 at Brno in the direction of Prague.
This said Novinky.CZ of the Dispatcher of the Central Auto-Moto Club (UAMK).
At kilometre 91, a truck crashed, at kilometre 93 two trucks collapsed, and there were casualties in this accident.
Also a few cars are in the street pits.
There are also problems at kilometre 185 of the D1 motorway towards Prague.
Two trucks have collapsed here too.
The riders should leave right behind Brno at km 190 or drive over Brno and drive at km 182 at the place Kývalka.
There are kilometres of dams.
Also on the D11 an accident happened and that happened right on the way to Prague.
In Prague itself there is a several centimeter thick snow ceiling and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
For example, car columns form in the district of Prosek, also the road Štěrboholská is completely clogged.
The safest means of transport is in any case the metro.
The trams drive with delays, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and Friedenplatz.
At eight o'clock in the morning, the Prague Crisis Staff meets.
There are also problems on the railway and on the airfield.
The Czech state railway had to cancel seven rapid train connections due to snow-worships.
For example, there are problems on the route Prague - Kralupy or Prague - Beroun.
Travelers should be absolutely informed of the current situation.
Ruzyně Airport is closed from Wednesday 11 a.m. to 5 a.m.
Most of the roads in South Moravia are only accessible with increased caution.
To Vyškov three side roads are completely unpaved, in the vicinity of Brno there are occasional snow-worships and in the vicinity of Blansko one is forced to use snow milling on some higher roads.
One of the most affected areas is Výškov.
There are three roads still completely blocked: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
Here, too, you will have to use snow milling.
When they get back to life, they can't be estimated until now.
In the Hodonín region there is caution in the area of white carpathians.
On the roads, which can be scattered only with inert scattering agents for nature conservation reasons, is a snow blanket of up to five centimeters thick, said ČTK.
In the Czech Republic, from two to ten centimeters of new snow fell, most in northern Bohemia - up to 18 centimeters instead.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, up to 15 centimeters of snow fell.
In the Czech Republic, however, it slowly ceases to snow.
American soldiers have a new “intelligent weapon”
The American troops have for the first time used a new “intelligent” weapon in Afghanistan, known only as XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon will affect the conflict with the Taliban there and will shift the relationship of forces in their favor.
The new weapon is something like a super expensive cannon.
Their projectiles are connected to the target by laser with a meeting safety of only a few meters.
The special shots of caliber 25 mm, designed for this rifle and containing high explosive explosives, work practically like small grenades.
The shots can be programmed in such a way that they can explode not only at the impact on the target, but at any point in their ballistic flight.
That is, you can use them against an enemy who hides behind an obstacle - a wall or in the gunman's pit.
From above, it is usually not protected, so the murderous steel splitting rain from above can easily put it out of battle.
According to Richard Audet, who was involved in the development of the XM-25, the new combat rifle is the first infantry weapon to make “intelligent” technologies a necessity.
“The soldier basically takes forward this way: he sees the target and sends out a laser beam that determines the distance, so he wins an exact point of vision, after which he corrects the angle of increase, then he only needs to press down.
\"Let's say, you measured 543 m,
“When you’re depressed, the gun loads up and shoots the shot at the distance 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters.
400 jobs are being moved
The Fujitsu Group moves its branch to Frankfurt in Bad Homburg.
In July next year 400 employees will be transferred to Astro Park from the previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg.
The Japanese group Fujitsu moves its branch to Frankfurt in Bad Homburg.
In July next year 400 women and men will be transferred to the Astro Park from the previous office building at the Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg, which is a large office complex on Lyoner Straße in the Frankfurt district of Niederrad.
A spokesperson from Fujitsu explained that in the medium term there should be another 100 jobs from the Group, which had so far been distributed in the region.
The rental offer had been extremely attractive, and the large space offices in the Astro Park could also be better opposed to the work of the employees.
In Bad Homburg, Fujitsu had only been tenants.
The responsible managing director Bernd Wagner said, \"with Frankfurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure,
The excellent connection to the airport is of great importance to a global company such as Fujitsu.
The new move of an important company within the region brought joy to the winners and disappointment to the losers yesterday.
Frankfurter Wirtschaftsdezernent Markus Frank (CDU) said that once again a global player had been won.
This is a \"great location commitment\"
Fujitsu passes to the city, the settlement being an important impulse for Niederrad.
The Bad Homburger Mayor Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regretted Fujitsu's decision.
The city was informed early by the management of the intention.
“Of course, we offered the company our help,” Korwisi said.
However, friendly contacts could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property at Marienbader Platz.
Ultimately, economic reasons had given rise.
Now it is about preventing a long void in such a prominent place.
“I hope the owner and landlord of the building will show up cooperatively,
The house used by Fujitsu to date at the Town Hall Square and the neighbouring small vertical buildings at Marienbader Platz were one of the most controversial construction projects in the city of Kurstadt ten years ago.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer, a new urban entrance was created between the railway station and town hall, which was critical both because of the massive construction of the previously partially used areas as a parking lot and because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment consulting and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, started Amadeus, as well as the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, who was still associated with Siemens at that time.
The building used by Fujitsu was acquired in 2006 by the Frankfurt German Property Chance Group together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and sold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid a year later.
The Fujitsu-Konuzern, a native of Tokyo, is the third largest IT provider in the world.
For example, it provides companies with computers and servers and also provides the necessary service.
The branch office in the Rhein-Main area is one of the largest in Germany, but far more employees count Fujitsu in Munich.
From Bad Homburg the subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions enters Frankfurt-Niederrad, the other subsidiaries at this location are to be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this purpose, 7000 square meters were rented in the office building Astro Park.
In the twenty-year-old complex - the name plays on its star-shaped base - the Central Association of Electrical Engineering and Electronics has its seat, among other things.
Amazon Locks Server - Threats Against Assange
Wikileaks is increasingly in distress.
The Internet service provider Amazon has banned the disclosure platform of its servers.
Perhaps there is political pressure behind it after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomats-depices.
Wikileaks founder Assange is allegedly staying in England.
The Wikileaks revelation platform is increasingly under attack in the United States.
The Internet activists lost access to their former American server and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
The prominent American senator Joe Lieberman called in the other countries and companies for the boycott of Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol's find lists, is to stop after a newspaper report in the UK.
\"Wikileaks from Amazon Server Depressed\"
“Free speech in the country of the Free - the disclosure activists communicated via short news service Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the Internet company Amazon had banned the Wikileaks documents from its servers.
The Internet activists had taken back from the Amazon Web Service (AWS) in the publication of the secret diplomatic depies in order to cope with the high access numbers to the documents.
By Twitter, Wikileaks went on to say: \"Prima - our dollars are now spent to employ people in Europe\"
If Amazon has such a problem with freedom of speech, “they should stop selling books“
Amazon stopped using its server through Wikileaks after staff of Senator Joe Lieberman had commissioned research, reported the TV station CNN calling on the office Liebermans.
The president of the Senate Committee on Home Affairs had threatened Amazon with a boycott, reported the British Guardian
“I would have liked Amazon to take this measure earlier in view of the previous publications of classified information by Wikileaks,” said the Senator.
Lieberman therefore called on the platform to prevent the use of servers in other countries as well.
\"Wikileaks' illegal, unscrupulous and ruthless action puts our national security at stake and endangers the globe's life\" is stated in a communication by the partyless senator.
‘No responsible enterprise - whether American or foreign - should help Wikileaks in his efforts to distribute stolen material,
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is searched for rape suspicions by the authorities in Sweden, is on Interpol's list.
According to a report from the London newspaper The Independent, the 39-year-old Australian is in Britain, the exact place is known as Scotland Yard.
The Internet activist has always described the investigations in Sweden as the intrigue of its opponents.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hraffnsson said in London there were threats.
“There were even calls for a murder of Julian Assange,
So Assange was afraid of his safety, Hraffnsson said.
The Wikileaks founder will therefore continue to keep itself hidden.
Hraffsson obviously responded to statements from North America.
In America, former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabe, had demanded that the person responsible for the Wikileaks revelations be accused and executed for treason.
In Canada, a director of government Stephen Harper - obviously ironic - said on television that Assange should be \"killed\" and Obama could use \"a drone\"
Between the White House and Assange there was a quick exchange.
The spokesperson of American President Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it, ridiculously and absurdly, that Assange had demanded the resignation of Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton if she was responsible for recently announced espionage requests to diplomats.
“I’m not sure why we’re concerned about the opinion of a guy with a website,” Gibbs says.
\"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more significant than its one website\"
The U.S. government is now fully monitoring the protection of its databases.
The White House was appointed Vice-Director of the Center for Anti-Terror Measures, Russell Travers.
Travers was responsible for developing \"necessary structural reforms\" that became necessary after the release of the message reports by Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to keep track of the ways in which the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The U.S. government also announced a desire to ensure the safety of dissidents and activists, should they be put at risk by the Wikileaks release.
“We’ve done everything we can to get in touch with them,” said Foreign Office spokesman Philip Crowley.
“We are ready to protect them if necessary,
The Ice University
At the \"Gelato University\" at Bologna, ice conditors are prepared for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future gelatiari has the largest access and visitors from all over the world.
Where does the whole ice actually come from?
From Gelatier and Gelataio.
The gelatier, in German somewhat old-fashioned ice conditioner, produces the cream according to all the rules of Italian ice making.
The gelataio picks up the ice cream from the refrigerator with a spoon, pulls it into the waffle and then sells it.
To know this, you don't have to drive to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about ice cream does not pass the \"Gelato University\" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The Eis-Universität has set up the manufacturer of ice machines in 2003 to ensure that the ice cream from its machines meets the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future gelatiy has the largest access and visitors from all over the world.
However, there are also several-day special courses around chocolate ice cream and interns in the in-house ice cream.
Some dream in the Midlife Crisis of a new career, others simply venture into the smooth ice of their vague longings.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, art teacher from California, loves the Slow Food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of the industrial Ice Cream.
Anke from Berlin is a corporate consultant and, after years in a nervous job, wants to reimburse something of her own.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice part in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil would like to improve the quality of the ice cream in her bars - and Canadian housewife Julia comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-gelatier Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal characteristics of the perfect ice cream.
Decisive is not only good taste, but also the silky smoothness and the good consistency.
During his training, Luciano also does not forget the sheathing of national and even southern superstructures: \"Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then there is still a lot of romance with it\"
The first step to manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano chops the basic ingredients of milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixing machine, which heats everything to 85 degrees with an electronic program and immediately cools to four degrees.
Then he turns a cock on the machine, and out comes a pasteurized white base cream, basis for all types of milk ice.
In the meantime, the lecturer will be impressed with questions: Can ice cream be produced only with natural substances without stabilizer?
How can you let your own experimentation interest run free?
Luciano warns against being led astray by the spirit of the time.
Those who talk about ice cream only of natural ingredients, however, may have used stabilizers - usually a natural product, such as guar kernel flour from the guar bean.
Of course you can also make ice without stabilizer, only then it must be sold within one day, otherwise it will accumulate in itself, and the customer bites on loud ice grains.
Certain variations on the base mass are allowed.
It'll be more tense with the aromas.
For the taste in the ice, Maestro Luciano differentiates between the ingredients you buy in the fruit section or in the sweets of the supermarket.
There are also powders and pastes.
“The suppliers will all try to turn you into dozens of flavoured additives,
\"But you should just experiment--
Either in fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or just at the ice cream from the white base mass, which becomes yellow cream with eggs and with cocoa powder for all possible chocolate seductions.
Now the course participants are allowed to use the ice cream machines.
Luciano allows it to produce four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mocca and hazelnut ice - with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less vanilla flavour or other natural additives.
The same experiment will also undergo the varieties of fruit ice.
More flavourings, more fruit purée - tasteful is not necessarily better.
Hazelnuts ice does not taste much more nutritious if it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular Kiwi ice is produced by the working group, which uses more fruits, less water and a little less stabilizer.
First, a balanced mixture reflects the taste of a gelato correctly, Luciano says.
Ice production is a calculation task: If peach purée is used with a lot of sugar, the sugar content must be reduced in the basic recipe.
An extra portion of sugar is necessary for lemon ice.
Luciano draws out a device with which he determines the sugar content of the fruit varieties (wincers measure the oaks in the grape must).
Fortunately, tables facilitate computerization.
Making ice no longer requires as much physical use as it used to be.
Not only does the device help to automatically manufacture the base mass.
There is also a device in which the finished ice mixture is beaten creamy at the same time and cooled to minus temperatures.
All automation to spite, small panels don't stay out.
The Brazilian Gustavo dresses himself and his course colleagues from the top to the bottom with fruit purée, when the super-dimensional bar mixer is out of control.
“In every course, Maestro Luciano says, “it’s just a matter of time until something like this happens”
Control in the twine
The European Food Authority, Efsa, was subject to the experimenting industry.
This allegation is now formulated by the expert group Testbiotech, which is an independent institute for the impact assessment of biotechnology.
“It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have well documented it,” said Testbiotech chief Christoph Then on Wednesday in Munich.
The head of the Efsa expert group for genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa expert have also been under contract with the lobbyist association Ilsi for years.
It is paid by companies like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has contributed significantly to the Efsa testing rules for genetic plants and is thus in a clear conflict of interest, criticized Then.
The Efsa regulations were abstinently consistent with Ilsi's position papers, thus threatening the handwriting of the industry, which is actually to be controlled by the authority in the Italian Parma.
It was already the second time that test biotech had a collision of interests.
A high-ranking Efsa manager would be Syngenta without any conditions or transitional period to the Swiss agricultural group, and thus changed sides.
The Central German Radio (MDR) had also recently revealed personal links between controlling EU authorities and industrial lobbying, which made the Federal Environment Agency as well as EU parliamentarians bright.
However, the Efsa cannot recognize any conflict of interest.
One can recall all the serious data, including those of industry, as long as they are of high professional quality, is stated in an opinion.
Of the experts working for Efsa, one does not demand that they have no contacts with industry.
But you'd have to reveal it.
Kuiper takes up his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
This refers to itself as a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics - including for risk assessment for biotechnology without lobbying.
In the matter, independent experts such as Then criticise the fact that genetically modified plants are currently approved without any feeding test in animals and the reaction of genetic plants to environmental influences is not tested.
“We want to know what makes genetically modified maize on the field, for example,” says Then.
Currently it is practice to test only isolated proteins, but not the whole plant, which does not have reliable results.
“If you’re not looking for the risks, how should you find them then,” asks Then indictingly.
That's what Angelika Hilbeck sees.
The scientist has been researching genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Zurich Technische Hochschule.
In this field, as in the US, industry is now increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in Europe.
There are therefore hardly any researchers that are not intertwined with corporations.
For companies critical studies would not usually be published.
\"Industry controls safety research - claims Hilbeck.
The Track of the Stones
Uli Gsell has also taken care of some 400 kilos.
On Monday evening he was in the shape of Stuttgarter Bahnhof, the tuba on the back.
It was demo.
It snowed.
The story is known: In September the excavators were pulled up and started to break down a large piece of the northern wing.
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: tens of thousands of demonstrated against S21, the miliard-severe downgrading of the railway station.
When it came to the construction stop, a large part of the wing lay in debris.
Break down into 6000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelk, a soft coarse stone, built between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in East Fildern, 43 years old.
He secured some of the chunks.
\"These stones are relics\"
\"They must not disappear\"
He swears: “A cheaper and poor stone, simple and earthy,
When he saw one, he smelled like cigarette qualm.
He doesn't know what he'll do with the chunks yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The trail of the Stuttgarter Steine leads to a forest near Tübingen on a former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen has built his stone kingdom.
The 44-year-old is dealing with old stones.
He bought all who joined the abriss in Stuttgart.
“It would be a shame that they would be grounded to shock or disappear in the landfill,” he says in his office, a wooden bud that once was a watchhouse.
When he was in the newspapers in September, he was told that he had bought the remains of the northern wing from the canceler.
But he talked to the S-21 opponents for days.
And he told them that he could not do anything for the demolition.
And if it ever happened, it would be the most reasonable if the stones were to continue to be used.
About 200 S-21 opponents then took one of the 80 kilos quader on average, unit price 6,50 to 14 euros.
As a reminder, some but also in the hope of being able to return it during a reconstruction.
500 tons had bought rounds, 25 large truck loads.
About half is still stored in the forest, the rest is long sold.
Garden owners, landscape gardeners, farm builders.
They came from everywhere and dragged away what the trunk and trailer could carry.
The Stuttgart stones of the attack have long turned into “mäuerle” or into restrictions of herbal bites.
“This stone is nothing special,” Rongen says.
\"If not the political component,
He climbs into his landcar, makes a tour through his 20 hectares of wealth.
Jura studied and discontinued, later biology, then he became interested in computers and eventually became a stone dealer.
And stone lovers.
It stores 40,000 tons of stones.
From all over Germany, he carts his treasures together.
He says he's the biggest old stone dealer in the Republic.
He's braking.
In the snow there are artificially carved sandstones.
“They belonged once to the Dresdner Marienbrücke,” he says.
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, he's swarming.
\"My favorite stone,
It's going up the road through the forest.
It shows up on a pile: red sandstone, formerly part of Karlsruhe station.
And continue.
‘Beautiful Travertin
At one time the quaders belonged to the tribune of the Stuttgarter Neckarstadions.
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories, Cannstatter Travertin from the Stuttgart Police Bureau, red granite from the Cathedral of Sankt Blasien, Tuff from the Heilbronner Hospital.
Which work, which effort, which sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how the stones used to be hoisted by hand and moved with simple bottles and oxcarts, he becomes very jealous.
“It would be a scandal if you were to scrape something like this, ” he said.
He didn't become rich, he didn't stone at all.
But 14 people are busy today with the stone dealer, as well as the top of the forest of stone, a sculptor, a smith, a glass blower and a gardener.
“We are working hard, but it’s satisfying,” says the resuscitator.
He will soon have to go to Cologne.
There are also stones to save.
Talent struggle for high-potentials
There's a lot of pressure at the buffet.
16 students push for salmon bread, tomato soup, and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the Autobauer Volkswagen invited the mechanical and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of competition of ideas, they should meet with VW developers about the car of the future - and next door to Volkswagen.
In competition for the smartest heads, many companies now go into the near-fighting and, like VW, put on cooperation with the universities.
Their mission: To recruit the most talented graduates in the hearing rooms as early as possible before they come to the labour market and are embraced by others.
And because the universities do not publish any essays on the performance of their students, the exceptional talent in practical projects is to try to reach and bind to them.
On the second day of the workshop at the TU Braunschweig, the car group is working on the talents.
A young lady from the staff department distributes ballpoint pens, rubber bars and folders with VW logo.
She tells the hopeful young talent of internship programs and student jobs and shows them ways in the group.
Nico Celle from TU Braunschweig takes care of the project with VW.
He sees the benefits for both sides: \"Students come into contact with industry and gain experience\"
\"VW can meet students at the same time, look at interesting candidates and think about who will be in question as an employee\"
Such cooperations, according to Celle, are not unusual.
It's new that the students are being bullied so offensively.
\"Otherwise, the focus was rather on the technical project, says Celle.
The fight for the fresh graduates will probably get even harder.
In many sectors, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large range of applicants.
In particular, they must be priced, particularly for highly skilled workers.
In particular, graduates from engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Association of German Engineers VDI, more than 40,000 engineering posts remained unoccupied in October.
And the so-called engineering gap will be even bigger according to VDI forecasts.
Roman Dykta goes on talent hunting for the KMMG audit and consulting company.
He organizes elaborate recruiting events such as the KPMG-Race, a kind of modern Schnitzel hunt in which participants have to find their way through GPS coordinates.
Eight promising students want to send the company across the United States next year.
In addition, participants can look at KPMG branches and get to know the company.
Who may decide in advance in two rounds of selection.
Only the cream de la cream of the many applicants flies to the USA.
In the hooding and stitching around the high potentials at universities, the guns, according to Dykta, are getting bigger and bigger.
\"We want to take the race out of the crowd,
“Only a simple sailing session was too little for us,
For Talent hunter Dykta, the bill seems to be coming up.
“We’ve been in contact with all participants of a similar action in the last year so far,
“Some are just ahead of their graduation and want to apply to us soon,” he says.
In addition to the direct buzzing on campus, small and medium-sized companies also perform quite classically at professional trade fairs on the Pirsch.
\"We are trying to reach graduates at trade fairs,
“It’s about the Intersolar,” reports Sitha Stübe, Head of Staff at Solar Technology Manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonn company employs around 1500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows about the young problem.
There are currently 35 posts on the company website.
\"It is very difficult to occupy vacant positions just now,
“This costs a lot of time and money,” she says.
Another way is to contact the university professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
\"Professors give indications that we can do internships or write our diplomas\"
Tour promotions are not indicated by the solar specialist.
For this purpose, the company tries to promote itself with other advantages: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and easy communication.
“A large group often cannot offer this,” says Stübe, head of staff.
Money no longer plays the main role in job search.
Flexible working hours, child care, or good climbing opportunities are other crucial factors.
In a study by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld held 55th place among the 100 best employers in Germany.
The Institute creates an annual best list of German employers.
It asks employees how satisfied they are with their work and job environment and looks at the conditions for the employees.
Staff manager Stübe expects the placement to be also plus points for the job seekers.
“I think applicants look especially at external assessments about a potential employer,” she says.
Wolf Reiner Krieger of the German Employee Branding Academy advises companies who want to build a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
He advises his customers about more authenticity.
And that means, according to warriors, above all internal measures.
“The best way to make yourself attractive as an employer is through one’s own employees,” he says.
In the industry jargon, the internal employer is branding, i.e. employers branding within their own workforce.
“Satisfying employees are the best ambassadors,”
If you were to deal well with his people and identify them with the company, they would be cast entirely by friends and acquaintances for their employer.
“This is like a game with gangs,” says Krieger.
Obama stops new oil drilling
On the coast of the U.S. state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico, there will be no new oil drilling in the coming years.
A similar ban has been imposed by the Washington Government - and thus their previous plans have been definitively revoked.
Even off the Atlantic coast, new drilling is under way.
This was shared by Minister of the Interior Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
The trigger for the strict ban to apply at least for the next five years is the explosion of the \"Deepwater Horizon\" drilling platform in April.
Before the accident that cost eleven workers and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama had signaled his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico at the pressure of the opposition and industry.
The advocates therefore want to reduce the dependence of the US on oil deliveries from abroad.
Those who bear responsibility for the devastating oil spill in the Gulf have not yet been finally clarified.
The British Energy Group BP is at the centre of criticism, which is faced with billions of demands.
An investigation commission on Obama's behalf will present its results during December.
In October, Minister of Interior Ken Salazar lifted the drill stop after the explosion.
Following this, various oil companies immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With sharper controls and stricter safety regulations, Obama and Salazar want to avoid a new disaster.
At present, the competent control authority, which has been called into question after numerous allegations of corruption, is fundamentally reformed.
In parallel, Obama announced to close lucrative tax holes for the oil and gas companies.
The industry now publicly warns that the volume of funding in the Gulf would be significantly lower by stricter regulation than before.
\"The government's plans are the biggest brake to the growth of the oil and gas industry - the result of a recent industry survey by the BDO consultant firm - even before the ban on drilling on Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance also complains of the insecurity in the industry: “No one knows what will change with regulation exactly,
Investments in new funding projects would continue to increase until further growth is achieved.
Ogoniland is burned
The water in the rivers is oil-brown, it smells like at the gas station: billions of litres of runaway crude oil have destroyed nature in Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live from theft, corruption and illegal oil cooking.
Celestine Akpobari means well.
“Don’t worry, the eco-activist calms the journalists: “You’ll still get enough oil sludge in front of the lens today,”
The 37-year-old Nigerian has tried to light a young boy wading up to the chest in the water with the locks surrounding him: in the rainbow-colored water glow, the scene looks almost pretty.
It is not visible that under the surface brown oil swaths float.
In the past, they collected shrimp very much here, telling Esther Badom on the shore of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the water that flows is completely dead.
Five years ago, from a brushed pipeline, crude oil was abundant in the vast wetlands.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo now have to row for six hours to get into fishy waters: the Ogoniland, located in the heart of the Niger Delta, is considered one of the world's worst ruined regions.
On the journey through the mangrove swamps perched by river runs, the whole scale of destruction becomes obvious.
Instead of bright water, the motorboat picks up brown brawls, who dives his hand into the water, pulls oily fingers out.
The roots of the mangrove trees, such as black lacrice stems, have their weed hanging from the ground, saddened by some palm trees.
Bird swarms, as they are common in wet areas, are looking for in vain: as soon as the outer border is silent, the former paradise, smelling like a gas station, spreads out spensy.
“What is happening here is ecological warfare,” says Celestine Akpobari window: “We live in constant danger to health.”
The comparison of war is appropriate.
The Ogoni settlement area is a battleground that has been fought for decades: more than 60 years ago, the first explorers from Europe were here, in the 80s, with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, who had to stop production in 1993, because it became too dangerous for his oil worker.
Even today, the company has refused to return to Ogoniland: while the entire delta region is pumped from the triple size of Switzerland with over 5000 wells and 7,000 kilometres of pipelines per day more than two million barrels of black gold, the oil fields in the Ogoniland are broken, too unstable to the Group's situation.
Every few hundred meters of steel structure, such as bizarre sculptures from the water, is said to be “Christian trees,” and the heads of the drill holes are much too tenderly called.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them corroded to the mark.
Again and again, such a drillhead breaks apart, says Akpobari, then a constant current of crude oil runs into the water.
More than two billion litres have been flown into the delta's ecosystem over 50 years: year after year the amount of oil, as it was forced into the sea in front of Alaska 21 years ago at the Havarie of the supertanker, Exxon Valdez, one of the biggest environmental disasters in the history of mankind.
Anyone who is responsible for the ongoing eco-GAU will be arguing about it.
While Shell Group Sabotage and organized oil theft account for more than 90 percent of pollution, environmentalists see bartering drilling heads and leaking pipelines as the main causers.
Shell claimed substantially lower safety standards in Nigeria than usual in the world, U.S. scientist Richard Steiner told the Group in 2008: the rate of defects on the lines alone is \"a multiple higher than elsewhere\"
In a remote place, which looks like a deserted, oily workshop under the open sky, the mangroves appear: they are split and oil-damaged to the neck.
Among one of the many barrels, which are partly connected with tubes, partially randomly scattered out on the ground, a fire flares: an illegal small refinery.
In the barrel, the crude oil is heated over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the head of the group.
First, petrol penetrates through the pipes into the base, then later drops at the end of the line kerosene and finally diesel out.
Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of diesel 300 litres a day: “This brings us 34,000 Nira - about $222.
The delta inhabitants use the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil state of Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The lowest diesel price, with almost 40 Euro cents per litre, can still be subject to illegal cooks: for their raw material they get for nothing.
It comes from “Bunkerern” which tap the pipeline network through Ogoniland: in this way, according to experts throughout Niger Delta, at least 16 million litres of crude oil are lost every day.
However, only a disappearing small portion of the provisionally intermediate raw material is illegally destroyed: the lion’s share of organised criminal networks, including politicians and high-ranking military, fill it in tankers and scramble it on the world market.
The debate as to whether the environmental disaster is more due to the conversion of the population or the lax mode of production, the activist Akpobari considers it purely academic.
“If oil companies were not seen as intruders and if they had not thoroughly destroyed the livelihood of fishermen, there would be no sabotage, theft and illegal refineries,
In the meantime, however, the ratio of Ogoni to Shell was so much destroyed that only a fraction of the Group could be questioned: “Perhaps other nationalities like the Chinese might turn out to be better,
Michael's getting nervous.
\"Highest time you're disappearing, says the muscular oil man.
\"Every minute the soldiers can come.\"
If the illegal oil defenders are caught by the Special Unit of Armed Forces, they are not under threat of arrest, but rather a painful lubrication.
The soldiers, like all Nigerians, who are mainly from the order of the country, also want to benefit from the raw material.
“This damn stuff has brought our country to the dog in every respect,” says Akpobari.
Investigators detect dangerous construction errors in A380 engines
The A380 seems to have a major security problem.
In the investigation of an emergency landing machine, investigators discovered a possible construction fault, which could lead to a \"disaster engine failure\".
The Qantas airline now wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the Qantas Airbus not landed at the beginning of November were apparently much more fortunate than previously known: The Australian Air Safety Authority identified a major safety problem in the engines of some A380 machines in its investigations - and now warns of a possible failure to build.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: an oil hose connection could cause fatigue and leaks, it was mentioned in an opinion published by the Authority ATSB this Thursday.
This could have led to \"a catastrophic engine failure\".
The A380 series was affected by Rolls-Royce engines in 20 A380 aircraft.
The Qantas Airbus is located below, which had to land in Singapore on November 4th.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
It submitted a reasoned statement to an Australian Federal Court in Sydney that would allow him further legal action against the company.
Qantas chief Alan Joyce said his airline would demand compensation for the incident in early November.
During the engine fire, parts had dissolved and the loads had been damaged.
Rolls-Royce made an oil fire the cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines have to be replaced worldwide.
The Australian investigators announced that they would carry out further safety tests on the superjumbos equipped with the engines concerned.
The safety recommendation was the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The safety problem was considered sufficiently important to inform all concerned.
After landing the Qantas machine, the airline had kept its A380 fleet on the ground for weeks.
Singapore Airlines temporarily left about three of its eleven A380 on the ground.
The Lufthansa replaced the engine with an A380 as a precautionary measure.
The double-storey aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
Landwide snowfall triggers traffic chaos
Germany all the way to White: Over the night, snow has fallen almost throughout the country.
On many roads chaos, trains and flights are out.
At least three people were killed in car accidents.
The winter freezes Germany: At icy temperatures, almost the whole Republic is snowed on Thursday at night - which often leads to traffic chaos.
In the north and the east there are some 15 centimeters of thick snow blankets.
Transport is severely restricted on several highways and many roads.
At the A7 near Flensburg, the winter service was in permanent use, but the snow that was constantly rising was not finished.
In addition, fierce trees swept across the Baltic coast.
On the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein, the Federal Office of Maritime Shipping and Hydrography (BSH) awaits storm floods of 1.2 metres above the normal level from the morning.
In Saxony, snow spills on the highways and federal roads led to significant problems.
According to the Meteomedia, the alarm level was violet in Saxon Switzerland - the highest level at all.
Partly there fell 30 centimeters of new snow, fresh and strong winds caused confusion.
There were several trucks and cars stuck at night.
Even in Saxony-Anhalt the police reported major disturbances on the streets.
On the A2, snow and wind led to increasing traffic and congestion.
In Thuringia, the A4 and A9 were affected by the snowfall.
According to Deutsche Bahn, there are significant disturbances in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
Snow on the tracks, fallen trees on the rails or destroyed top lines and softness are the main problems.
In Saxony, long-distance traffic from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be discontinued.
In the Thuringian Saalfeld, an ICE had to stop its journey to Munich.
The 165 passengers were provided by firemen and rescuers with wool blankets, food and drinks on the train.
Snow winds flew over the streets.
At large German airports, the snow winds lead to numerous escapes.
Some cancellations have already been reported in Munich, according to a spokesperson for the flight information centre.
In Frankfurt am Main, 40 flights were already cancelled according to a Fraport spokesperson.
Winter service was in continuous use.
Although only a few stranded passengers are available at the airport, there are still almost 400 field beds available for them.
On many roads, accidents occurred on Wednesday evening.
In the evening, a truck driver was killed by a train on a railway crossing in Ostholstein.
The pilot was easily injured.
In the vicinity of Nuremberg there was a similar accident due to snowcapped roads: also here a truck was recorded on a railway crossing because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver was killed.
In the train four passengers were injured - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore blocked until the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after crossing her car at Aschaffenburg on smooth road.
But the meteorologists have a good message: Although the snow will still be loose and powdery, it will roll up even in light trees.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea is struck by fast and storming winds.
However, it remains very cold - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for their twin towers
The Deutsche Bank wants to separate from its trademark: According to a newspaper report, the Geldhaus is looking for buyers for the two office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
The property could bring up to 500 million euros.
The Deutsche Bank has just made its headquarters beautiful: the twin towers in the Frankfurt banking district have been upgraded; in the meantime, the bankers were allowed to return to their old workplace.
But now the financial group apparently wants to recover the costs for the renovation - and looks for a buyer for the two high houses, as the \"Financial Times Germany\" writes on a spokesperson.
The speaker did not call reasons for the planned sale.
“We’re always testing whether it’s more sensible to own or sell real estate and then rent it back,” he said.
This gives Germany's largest credit institution its registered office again after a short time.
The Bank had only taken over the double towers in mid-2007 for 272 million euros from the investors of a home fund and then thoroughly renovated.
Energetic conversions were slowing down the data to around 200 million euros.
A sale would probably bring the bank a lot of money.
According to industry experts, the value of the newspaper’s recently renamed towers in Green Towers is estimated to be around 500 million euros.
Whether the buildings are sold back to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor is still open, the speaker said.
Thousands mourn for dead mate
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand have thought of the spilled miners who were declared dead after several explosions in a mine.
The bodies still could not be secured because the security situation in the accident shaft is further precarious.
Almost two weeks ago, the Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth had come to a violent explosion.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were spilled under daytime.
A probe had been dropped in the disaster shaft, but had not discovered a trace of survivors.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and further subsequent explosions, no rescue forces were able to descend for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and experts assumed that there was no more chance of survival for the team.
The bodies could not yet be secured.
Now relatives and friends remembered the dead with a memorial celebration.
Ten thousand people had gathered in Greymouth on the New Zealand South Island during a radiant sunshine.
For two minutes, they swear.
29 tables were set in honor of the beaten miners, on which helmets, lamps and the names of the people were seen.
Also pictures and personal items, including clothes and surf boards, found their place here.
In front of the government buildings of the country, the flags waved on half masts.
New Zealand hoped that the miners, from the depths of the earth, would come back to the surface, said New Zealand Prime Minister John Key to the participants in the commemorative celebration.
“But they never came home,
He could not finish with the death of his son, as long as he had not seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, his son Zen was spilled into the pit.
In addition to the Prime Minister and members of the victims, several foreign diplomats attended the Memorial celebration.
During the first explosion on November 19th, miners of British and South African origin had also been shaken.
Rescue workers began to extinguish a fire inside the coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases were depleted, it would start to cool down the glowing temperatures inside the mine, police president Gary Knowles said to journalists.
Hell, warrior!
Does Splatter fit into the art cinema?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn is revitalizing old genre borders with his fighter-epos \"Walhalla Rising\".
What audience might the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought about when he turned \"Walhalla Rising\"?
A captive Viking warrior with only one eye (Mad's Mikkelsen) frees himself from his tormentors and retaliats his opponents with almost superhuman powers - sounds ideal for young male spectators looking for bloody action, just because our hero likes to use rabbinic killing methods and his enemies already tearing the intestines out of the living body when he has bad mood.
On the other hand, Einauge, as he is actually called, does not tell the whole film about any word, and even the other figures can only be drawn to one or two sentences or a few quaint death cries.
Otherwise, it is swiveled and swallowed in the gracefully beautiful hilly countryside of Scotland, which the Viking world offers from about a thousand years ago.
Ideal for adult Cineasts with an interest in existentialism and very quiet camera rides.
Well, if a movie has several target groups, it only hurts if they exclude each other.
Director Winding Refn has been regarded as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino since his wild and stylized drug dealer trilogy, but he refuses to make his works accessible to Arthouse with a little more humor or a little less brutality.
Most art cinema friends are expected to be deterred from the surrounding mass of the brain and the intestines.
The action fans will die of boredom at the latest, if, for freely interpretable reasons, single-eyes break up with a force of violent Christian missionaries via ship to Jerusalem and establish an eternity in floods and fog before the team appears to arrive in America and remain silent there.
So no wonder that \"Walhalla Rising\" has not found a cinema rental in Germany and has now only appeared on DVD.
This is especially a pity because of the magnificent images, but also because behind the pretentious to blood-triggering façade a sometimes exciting piece of cinema is hidden that deserves some attention.
In this film it is not about dialogues or a stringing action, it is all atmosphere, a film-worn fieber room.
And from that there are no entrants for the viewer.
Refn hardly gives him a moment of relaxation, and with his icy pictures and the dark trance-like soundtrack he slowly closes the throat, but especially with the incomprehensible hatred that strikes him from the hearts of the figures.
Only a little blond boy who is loyal to one eye keeps such a thing as innocence, everyone else is driven by anger.
Mostly the one-eyed hero, whose motives are never explained, but who eventually becomes the warrior from hell for enemies and temporary allies, possibly to the ambassador of the devil himself.
He means destruction, but perhaps only for those who are already corrupt.
\"Walhalla Rising\" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, to be angry, upset and staunch.
An experience.
Puzzleful Earthworks
The IAEA Nuclear Energy Authority has new references to a secret nuclear program in Syria.
The country, however, refuses to take a stand on this - it still allows checks.
By midnight of 5th to 6th September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter aircraft are attacking a mysterious, cube-shaped building in Syria.
It is on the banks of the Euphrates; the nearest larger city, 30 kilometers away, is Dair as-Saur.
Its name appears in documents from the International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) when it comes to the reactor, which Syria has allegedly built with help from North Korea in the quader, hidden in a valley that goes off the current.
According to a letter from the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Office CIA at the end of April 2008, it would also have been well suited under the name of the nearby village of el-Kibar to produce plutonium - from which nuclear weapons could be built.
For other purposes, however, technology from the fifties has little to do with technology.
The CIA led a video presentation with unsharpened satellite images.
By computer animation, it blended in where the reactor's components were to have been before the destruction, which was a reduced copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon Atomic Center.
In addition, she presented photos showing the building nearby or even the interior.
The reactor was standing just before commissioning, it was called, but not yet equipped with fire rods.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, is little more known than then, yes, the puzzles became bigger over time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that although the CIA was quite certain of the attack, Syria built a reactor in el-Kibar, but hardly saw evidence that there was “an active nuclear weapons program” in the country.
Some secretaries in Europe prefer to be even more cautious and only talk about a \"representative reactor\" even if they consider the CIA presentation to be \"plausible\".
They lack hard evidence, as do IAEA.
Asked how sure he was to have a reactor in front of him, a high UN diplomat in the summer answered only lapidar, which IAEA had \"genuine material to ask questions\"
The Syrians quickly managed the bulk of the alleged “unused military building” and planned the site thoroughly.
Nevertheless, in June 2008 an IAEA team under former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of uranium produced by humans in el-Kibar.
In addition, IAEA received satellite images of commercial suppliers from a Member State directly after the attack, which should be more meaningful than those presented by the CIA.
However, these recordings are not available on the market because the unknown customer - perhaps Israel - bought them exclusively.
The IAEA cannot, therefore, independently verify its authenticity.
Syria has always claimed never to have run a secret nuclear program or built a reactor.
Uranium came from the Israeli weapons, declared Damascus.
However, after analysis of the particles, the IAEA rejected this as unlikely.
Since then Damascus has refused to discuss it - as well as satellite images.
In addition, the controllers refuse a second inspection into el-Kibar and access to the debris of the bombed building.
But also Israel is silent about iron.
“We will never comment on this,” recently the Premier Ehud Olmert, acting at the time of the attack, confirmed the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case has been unsuccessful since June 2008 and “has increasingly developed into a serious problem of credibility for the Authority, as a high Western diplomat at the headquarters of IAEA in Vienna is at the end of a serious breach of the nuclear-weapons contract in the space that the IAEA is waiting for.
The IAEA appears to be a key to progressing in the education process to include three other institutions that are supposed to be \"in a functional connection\" with the suspected reactor and, unlike that, still exist.
To date, the inspectors have not revealed what plants are or what function they have or what makes them appear suspicious.
According to information from the Süddeutsche Zeitung, the IAEA is known internally as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, in turn derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) has identified these sites and has found out on satellite images a building complex at Masyaf, which is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
It may be located in or directly next to a military base - precisely with this reasoning, Syria of the IAEA is refusing access to the three places.
In Vienna it is said that the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA would be sent by the United States to extend military facilities.
Because the nuclear detectives had become aware of the facilities through a tip of the U.S. secret services.
The IAEA has indications, including satellite photographs, that between the three locations and the quader on the Euphrates material has been transported.
A high Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the plants could stand in connection with fuel production.
However, there is no evidence of sensitive activities, i.e. uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is operated with uranium, which is not enriched.
But where the uranium would have come from and where the plutonium would later be separated for the bomb, there are at least plausible assumptions on these central questions.
It is also unclear whether debris, which could store valuable traces, was stored in three places.
As if the hundreds of trucks loads had disappeared from the ground, no one wants to have information about where the gun was left.
The salt mine al-Tibni, located just a few kilometres from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, which Syria examined in 1998 for its suitability as a warehouse for radioactive waste, is considered unlikely to be in the IAEA.
The former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley had recently associated her with the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the renowned magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
However, shots from orbit show that Syria took over earthworks at the three suspicious locations and removed large containers after the IAEA had requested access.
This can be a coincidence, but it has hardly helped to eliminate the suspicion.
In addition, in diplomatic circles, the IAEA has used several months to develop a plan for inspections there that should allow Syria to preserve any military secrets - the effort alone shows how great the interest of inspectors is.
However, Damascus also rejected this proposal.
If Western diplomats in Vienna complained a year ago that the reactor had been destroyed, the matter had no need of urgency, for example, US ambassador Glyn Davies has been in the game of so-called special inspections for a few months, one of the sharpest means the Vienna Atomic Authority has had to carry out controls.
Although IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has already spoken of \"an option for which I am open in the future\", he is still reluctant.
There is a high risk in this direction: on the one hand, there is a need for a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors, and a number of the 35 countries represented there are all other than an escalation.
On the other hand, as a diplomat says: “What if they don’t find anything in the end?”
Love in Times of War
Since Angelina Jolie started working on her nameless director's debut in summer, there's trouble.
The script she wrote herself, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
Much more is not known about it - but it is enough for unrest.
The rumour of the rumour, the woman, a Muslim, is in love with her Serbian rapist during the Yugoslavian war.
Bosnian women's associations immediately protested, after which some dates planned in Sarajevo were moved to Hungary in the short term.
Meanwhile, the film is filmed in Hungary and in post-production, but it is still protesting in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the organization of female war victims wrote about the UN refugee aid work UNHCR to Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, a Bosnian newspaper has now reported - Jolie is herself ambassador to the UN refugee aid work.
She is not a diplomat - she has once offered the women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, but she has refused to do so.
The meeting had to take place in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
Love stories in rape camps did not exist, and Jolies' attitude towards the victims told her enough about the script.
According to the UN Refugee Aid Office, her organization has recommended that Jolie be dismissed as an ambassador, reports the Guardian.
But what exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which got her script to read, has given a screen for Sarajevo after some time - it is not clear why Jolie did not come anyway.
The young author herself was offended that she did not pursue any political intentions with her film, had worked with much effort in the Yugoslavia conflict, wanted to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all sides involved.
However, the content remains vague.
This is how a second synopsis is used to film on the web, which then sounds quite different: the lovers already knew about war and meet again when they, a Bosnian Muslim, are dragged into a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
What sounds very different from the variant of rape victims is in torture knecht,
That Jolies film actually starts before the war - so much is certain.
The pressure on her, says Jolie, is “unfair and based on misinformation”
Now she can only provide peace with the hackers of Hollywood: By putting the script, as so many have before, illegally into the web.
Nothing like this.

How it feels to build something else, Seán O'Donovan knows for half a year.
Because there was nothing to do for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues on construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen they just move up a fashion house.
In January we continue to Hanover or Berlin, to the next project.
His home country now only rarely sees O'Donovan, because he makes extra layers to pay off the credit for his house at home.
“The situation is a bit crazy,” he says, as he steps over the threshold of his house for the first time.
“I’m making money in Germany for a house in Ireland, where I’m as good as I’m never before”
He laughs at something and goes through cooled rooms.
The small house stands in a fine residential area with well maintained curtains, in the entrances parking large, expensive cars.
Together with a sister, O'Donovan bought the house for 380,000 euros four years ago - 100 percent credit funded.

The Democratic Routine
The democratic movement in Latin America is becoming stronger, as is the support of private companies.
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, the influence of Brazil is greater than that of the United States.
The Latinobarómetro survey, which was conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist, reached these results.
This survey has been conducted regularly since 1995 and thus shows the change of opinion in this region.
Two facts are particularly relevant in this year's September and October survey.
First, the good mood in Latin America
and secondly the growing interest in democracy and its main institutions.
In many countries along the South American Pacific coast, the democratic movement has increased greatly (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has grown by around 6% annually since 2002, the number of democratic advocates rose from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
Even in Mexico, where the economy recovers since the strong collapse last year, such a trend is evident.
But only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries in the region, are convinced Democrats, which reduces the regional average (see diagram 2).
About 44% of respondents said they were satisfied with the democratic practice of their country, which is as much as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (diagram 3).
Around 34% trust the Congress of their country and 45% of their government. Both values match those of last year, but show a significant increase over 2003 (17% and 24%).
A decade ago, Latin America's economic crises undermined efforts for more democracy.
This continued even during the global economic crisis, possibly because Latin America's countries experienced only a short recession phase and recovered quickly.
In addition, the poor were caught up by a stronger social network.
(According to reports by the UN Economic Commission for Latin America this week, the poverty rate in Latin America increased slightly in 2009 and fell by 32% this year.)
But there are strong differences in mood from country to country (see diagram 4).
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of the separable President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva are reflected in a widespread thought of progress.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more noticeable and violent crimes have increased, this is less so.
Only for the second time since the start of the survey do many people in Latin America see a greater problem in crime in their country than in unemployment (see diagram 5).
About 31% say that either they themselves or a family member were victims of a crime last year. However, compared to 38% last year, the values have fallen and thus reached the lowest level since 1995.
The increase in economic performance is reflected in the increased support for the private and market economy: about 71% of respondents said that the private sector is indispensable for development, and in 2007 it was 56% (see diagram 6).
About 58% said that only the market economy can make progress in their country, compared with 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of those surveyed in Venezuela have maintained this view (and 80% are private), although their left-wing president, Hugo Chávez, has ruled many private companies.
According to 19% of respondents (18% last year) Brazil has the largest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% last year).
The respondents in Mexico and most Central America, on the other hand, see the most influential country in the United States, taking over this role in Venezuela's Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A choice slip
No one expected the elections to be perfect on November 28 in Haiti.
But the facts far outweighed the fears of the electorate, who rushed to help the spoiled country.
Overcrowded polls, multiple cast votes, ballots in the Rinstein, destroyed electoral venues and intimidations were only part of the problem.
Election venues opened with hourly delay.
Many Haitians, many of whom had become homeless by the earthquake in January, were searching for a choice.
Some finally gave up completely.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some supposed leaders, demanded the abolition of the electoral results because of an alleged fraud.
There were some violent protests throughout the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the Head of the UN Mission in Haiti, called the election “as quite good in many matters”
According to a careful statement by observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community, these irregularities, as serious as they may be, do not necessarily invalidate the process,
In other words, the show went on.
The electoral authority, which is allegedly obliged by the unpopular secluded President René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, will announce the provisional results on 7 December.
The expected cut-off is scheduled for January.
There is still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, Rap musician Michel Martelly and former First Lady Mirlande Manigat, withdrew their initial invalidity complaint.
If Jude Célestin, who finds little or no agreement with the voters, declares the election attorney to be the winner of the election, this could lead to problems.
Due to the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of the earthquake victims still live in tents, a low level of electoral participation was feared.
On the election day, many Haitians were prevented by a lack of organization at the vote.
Shortly before the election, about 250,000 IDs needed for the election were not yet distributed.
It's a lot on the game.
The donor countries regard a legitimate, recognized government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
The Haitians themselves are the same opinion.
Secretly in the middle
In the weeks following the sudden death of your husband, Argentina's president, Cristina Fernández, experienced a wave of sympathy that pushed their popularity by 20 points to over 50%, which is the highest value since their election in 2007.
However, whether this will help you to re-election in the next year depends on whether the clearly grieving Cristina Fernández is more compromising than her late husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The signs for this are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who also led economic policy after his wife's election, often drew up budgets that did not take full account of tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the couple of presidents to issue the extra revenue according to their own guise.
On the paper, the Fernández government lost the majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on 27 October led to further convulsions.
Some regime critics from the ranks of the ruling peronists stood behind Cristina Fernández.
But after chaotic meetings (in which one parliamentarians faced another and accused others of bribery) Congress failed to adopt the 2011 budget.
'I will not discuss it,' said the President.
The 2010 budget is now also valid for the next year, which gives the President even more opportunity to spend money on his own good fortune.
The economy is running hot: probably it will grow by up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is 11.1%, but numerous private estimates - and wage demands of trade unions - are valued at almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took office in 2003, when Argentina was shaken by economic crises, declared growth and poverty reduction to its main objectives, not the reduction of inflation.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, harassed the private sector, and cleaned up the National Institute of Statistics and Census INDEC, which subsequently made official inflation statistics beautiful.
Can Fernández take a more moderate path now?
She called on the private sector and the trade union leaders to speak.
And according to official statements, wage increases will be limited to 18% next year.
The high world market prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given the economy a strong impetus.
But inflation undermined growth by a major devaluation in 2002.
For this reason, Cristina Fernández may want to join Argentina financially again to the rest of the world.
At the beginning of this year, the government reached an agreement with securities holders who had rejected the former debt of the country in 2001.
Now Fernández seems to be pushing for an agreement with the Paris Club's donors, to which she owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners had always rejected a review by the IMF, as is usual elsewhere.
But last month, the Minister for Economic Affairs, Amado Boudou, announced that the fund will provide \"technical support\" in the creation of a new national consumer price index. This seems to be the first step towards cleaning up the INDEC.
It is not known whether Fernández will be politically active even without her husband's support after her term of office ends.
If so, it needs the support of the middle layer, most of which has enough of Kirchnerism.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy that was brought to her will have been lifted.
If she wants to win another choice, she has to decide whether she will stop many political decisions of her husband.
Weaker applause for China
Taiwan's voters are slowly approaching a closer connection to the mainland.
What does Taiwan hold of his great brother beyond the seas?
On 27 November, more than 7.5 million voters, 70% of all voters, rose to elect mayors and city councils in the five urban districts, which is rated as a broad evaluation of President Ma Ying-you.
By establishing groundbreaking business relations, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma is itself a symbol of relations with the mainland. His policy has changed the relationship with the Chinese mother country for the first time since 1949.
Ma passed the test, but only barely.
Although his Kuomintang Party (KMT) represents three of the five mayors, it did not receive a majority vote.
Instead, the Democratic Progress Party (DPP), which advocated greater independence of Taiwan, received almost 50% of the votes, the SMEs received 45%.
In a presidential election, this would have meant problems for Ma.
Since his election two years ago, the voting share of his party has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even moved into the city councils together with the KMT.
During the election, there were typical events in Taiwan such as truck convoys with Krawallmakers, flag-swiping mass movements and only sparsely dressed dancers.
There was even the obligatory, mysterious murder attempt.
On the eve of the election, Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan and Chairman of the Board of Honors, gave a speech to a KMT candidate,
When a man shot into his face out of the crowd. Lien was wounded and a stranger killed.
Bizarr is not clear whether the shooter wanted to kill line or settle a dispute with the candidate.
Regardless, according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, the attack has affected the choice and the DPP has turned into a bad light, which has given the KMT more votes.
Perhaps China was the greatest winner of the campaign.
Notably, relations with the mainland have not been addressed.
Instead, the candidates discussed plans for social housing and job creation.
The Taiwanese love their factual independence and reject China's military threat.
For this reason, the SMEs do not like to put their relations with the Beijing Government in the foreground.
However, this time the DPP also avoids the anti-Chinese feelings too much.
It responded to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy could not survive without China.
On the other hand, I would like to confirm that the majority of Taiwanese support its China policy.
The Beijing Government will continue to pursue its strategy to withdraw Taiwan from the Community with economic incentives.
China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment security and medical cooperation.
It certainly also wants political integration, but the most important first.
It is better to wait until after the 2012 presidential elections.
The DPP has now been reinvented.
Two years ago she was severely weakened: former party leader Chen Shui-bian sat in prison for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he went vehemently for absolute independence.
But under Tais Regentschaft, a new generation of reduced politicians developed and the DPP fights for the votes of the professionals and the youth.
Tsai found great support as President of the DPP, such as Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Her party is now doing everything to show that she too is able to build close relations with Beijing.
Tsai is planning an idea forge as a point of contact between the DPP and China. However, this requires prejudice-free discussions.
Tsai publicly stated that her party offered a “trustworthy alternative” to Mas's advance approach to China.
Chen seems very upset about this change.
From his cell he explained that the candidates of the DPP would have done better to insist on Taiwan's independence.
He even called on the Pragmatician Su to give up the presidential candidacy.
Even without Chen's interference, the DPP is difficult to choose its potential candidates.
The SMEs will have to undergo their own self-analysis.
Mas values are bad, despite the rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to lead their election fight without him.
The main reasons for his ingratitude seem to be unemployment and the ever-increasing gap between the poor and the rich.
According to a KMT spokesperson, he will transform his cabinet as well as local facilities.
The strong appearance of the DPP suggests that Taiwan only supports re-appropriation.
At the same time, most Taiwanese view economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, “there's no way back already, ”
Grammy nominations: The jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was surprisingly awarded in the category Newcomer of the year
If you appear at the request of a president, people will notice it.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to perform at the ceremony at the 2009 Nobel Prize Awards. Now the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer was most often nominated for this year's Grammy in the Newcomer category of the year.
In view of the fact that Spalding has already been a celebrated star since her album Esperanza in 2008 in the jazz scene, the nomination appears a little unusual. However, it corresponds to the Grammy rules, according to which an artist may have released three albums before the release of the album with which he became known in the general public.
Her ambitious 2010 album, \"Chamber Music Society\", is certainly a step forward. And with her swinged voice and a good feeling for pop, funk and Latin music, you can quietly compare Spalding with Norah Jones 2003, whose great success comes next in 2003 as a jazz interpreter in this category of nomination Spaldings.
The Vijay Iyer Trio's album, Historicity, was also nominated in the category of instrumental albums, which led to a huge success for the critics.
Iyer's competitors include, among other things, \"Moody 4B\", the experienced saxophoneist James Moody and \"Positotly\" keyboardist John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a raw favorite from New Orleans and frequent guest in HBOs, has been awarded in the category Contemporary Jazz, in which otherwise albums can be found by Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The Secret Societ of the wild Steampunk musician Darcy James Argue received well-earned attention in the category of Large Group. He thus acts against the Billy Child Emsemble with his chamber jazz and the adventurous Dave Holland and his octet, whose life-ablum \"Pathways\" is a good example of a bassist as a democratic band leader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in the classic categories
The classical nominations for the 53rd Grammy Award contain a colorful mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The list of Michael Daugherty's Deux Ex Machina is presented for piano and orchestra with five voices, and Steve Mackeys' dreamhouse is an eclectic orchestra, with three voices.
Among the nominees with connections to Southern California is Estonian composer Arvo Pärt with his symphony No. 4 -Los Angeles - This piece was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonics and performed in 2009 at the Walt Disney Concert Hall.
The composer Avner Dorman, based in L.A., was also nominated for his mandolin concert.
Classical nominations are divided into 13 categories, from orchestra, opera, choir to solo recordings.
In the category of classic producers five artists were nominated this year - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the nominated classic albums are Bruckner's Symphony No. 3 and 4 from the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty's Deus Ex Machina and Metropolis Symphony, played by Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey's Dreamhouse, by Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati, presented by various artists; and Verdi's Requiem, by Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Choir.
In the opera category, Bergs -Lulu was nominated by the orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasses -Marc Antonio e Cleopatra - by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariahos -L'Amour de Loin - by the German Symphony Orchestra Berlin; Rodion Shchedrins -The Enchanted Wanderer - by the orchestra and choir of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivans - Ivanhoe - by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
As composers, Pärt was nominated for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for \"Deus Ex Machina\" Hans Werner Henze for \"Appassionatamente Plus\" - Magnus Lindberg for \"Graffiti\" and Shchedrin for \"The Enchanted Wanderer\" for a Grammy.
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 was first performed and recorded at Disney Hall on January 4 by the L.A. Philharmonics under the direction of Esa-Pekka Salons.
The 30-minute piece bears the title “Los Angeles” and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Chodorkowski, who is in prison in Russia.
Dorman's \"Mondolin Concert\" received a nomination in the category Instrumental solo with orchestra.
The composer from L.A. stated that he wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for the mandolin artist Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New York Metropolis Ensemble.
“I used sounds from the Middle East and numerous North African sounds and rhythms,” Dorman explained in a telephone interview.
The conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the orchestra presentation category for a recording of the works Strawinskis with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his direction.
As instrumental soloists, the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, the organist Paul Jacobs, the violinist Julia Fischer and the Harfinist Sarah Schuster Ericsson were nominated.
As vocal soloists, only women were nominated this year, including Anne Sofie von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Aktex and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the Classic Crossover category, Soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording \"Roots - My Life, My Song\".
Mosque in Temecula wins approval from the Planning Committee
After a five-hour, often hot public hearing, the construction of a mosque in Temecula found the unanimous commitment of the local planning committee.
Critics accused the project of promoting both terrorism and traffic congestion.
However, according to the Commission's statement of Wednesday evening, the new religious centre complies with local regulations and will become an aesthetic eye-catcher.
“The project is supported by many good people - Christians, Jews, Bahais, and many others - said Hadi Nael, Chairman of the Islamic Centre of Temecula Valley on Thursday morning.
\"As an American, I'm proud of this,
\"It shows that justice prevails,
“There are only a few opponents, ” he added.
“They’re only very loud.”
\"In this valley there are wonderful people,
The meeting began at 18:00 and the discussions for and against the construction of the centre lasted almost until midnight, with the votes distributed fairly evenly on both sides according to press enterprise.
The debate was continued on the newspaper website.
\"There is no more America\" was a comment.
\"It is another planet of monkeys, and the statue of freedom lies dead in the sand,
‘America is at the end,
Planned Islamic centers have also led to protests in other parts of the country, e.g. near Ground Zero, the scene of terrorist attacks on New York City on September 11, 2001.
Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has called for nonviolence in the Temecula Valley.
His community with about 135 families has lived peacefully in Riverside County for years, but they wanted a bigger and better place than the camp they rented together with a water filter plant manufacturer.
The new, about 2,300 m2 mosque in the Mediterranean style is supposed to have two minarettes and become about 13m high.
It is intended to be built on the approx. 17,500 m2 plot on Nicolas Road near Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still challenge the project with the City Council.
Arsen-resistant microbe could allow new life forms on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a foreign type of bacteria that can, among other things, live by Arsen opens up new possibilities for new forms of life on Earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on Earth, it is in their view a sign that life is possible even without the elements previously considered vital.
\"This organism has two possibilities:
“It requires either phosphorus or arsenic to grow,
“This makes it a very special thing, although it’s almost a kind of ‘foreign’ form of life,” explained Paul C.W. Davies of Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which appears on Thursday in the online issue of Science magazine.
Up to now, six main elements have been considered vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But as the scientists found out, the bacterium in the California Mono Lake continues to grow even if it replaces phosphorus with arsenic.
“There’s a question about what else is possible,” said the co-author of the Ariel D. Anbar report from Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in the search for extraterrestrial life, as scientists have to recognize life and its forms, according to Anbar.
The study deals with microbes found on Earth.
The announcement of a press conference, in which no details of the discovery were announced, gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could act from the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
This is not the case.
The discovery \"shows that in other planetary systems organisms can start biochemical processes with the help of other elements and that the 'standard elements', which in our opinion are absolutely essential in life, are not necessarily fixed - explained Charles Cockell, Professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute of the Open University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel was not part of the research team.
“This work is a novelty because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures one element can be replaced by another, added Cockell.
This discovery was not by chance.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon from NASA's Astrobiological Institute, which conducted the study, chose Mono Lake because of the high arsenic content.
Since arsenic and phosphorus are chemically identical, they assumed that microbes exposed to both may replace one element with the other.
“The toxicity of the arsenic is mainly due to the chemical nature of the arsenic,
“This makes it difficult for organisms to distinguish one element from another,
“But the difference is so great that Arsen works differently from phosphorus. It comes into our biochemical system, where it's lubricating almost everything, explains Anbar.
The researchers used the bacterium GFAJ-1 as an increasing arsenal concentration. It adapted and grew.
Although the microbe grows better in phosphorus, but can survive in arsenic, it shows that an arsenic-based form of life can occur naturally, either on Earth or on another planet or moon, on which arsenic occurs more frequently.
According to Jamie S. Foster, lecturer for microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic is not new. But there has not yet been a working example.
Arsen was more common in the early years of the earth, she says, so science assumed that early life forms used it.
\"This is a reason for the assumption that life may have evolved differently than in the early Earth's age, says Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Health authorities.
Other stolen exhibition dogs found in Compton
The remaining two of the four exhibition dogs stolen from a Bellflower motel were found on Thursday, according to Los Angeles County Sheriff's statement.
The four exhibition dogs - two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared on Tuesday, when unknowns stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express van, where the animals were housed in front of a Bellflower Motel 6 at night, the authorities said.
Two dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon, and the last two on Wednesday evening, Steve Whitmore, a spokesperson of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
“The good news is: the dogs are well up, so Whitmore.
“They are in good condition,
“They were returned to their legitimate owners,
Whitmore did not provide any detailed information about the location of dogs nor about the circumstances that led to their discovery.
‘The investigations are still under way,
“We don’t want to say anything about it anymore,” Whitmore explains.
\"We're tracking a few tracks,
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available for information on Thursday.
They received their two dogs at a district animal home in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
Representatives of the Sheriff found the delivery car and the two dogs in different locations in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old rat, and Didi, a 10 month-old bitch, were, according to the authorities, unsurpassed.
But the Corgis Bunny and Peter, who wanted to present Rickard and Peek on behalf of their Japanese owners on the competition this week, were missing until Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in town this weekend because of the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach because Trace was supposed to participate in the competition.
As Peek of the Times announced on Wednesday, the other dogs should participate in other competitions in the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show.
Southern California is a stop on the almost one month tour of the couple from dog show to dog show.
On Monday evening, Peek and Rickard checked in the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their delivery cars in front of their room window.
They took three more dogs - a boxer wolf, a Parson Russell Terrier and a Brittany - into their motel room.
The thick-eyed Akitas and Corgis stayed in the delivery car because it was cooler there.
They left the window open a gap wide, so the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car stolen on Tuesday at 6:00 p.m.
Peek promised everyone who could give a clue to the corgis, a finder wage. The animals were implanted into microchips for identification.
On Thursday it was not yet clear whether a finder's wage would be paid.
The lion roars again after judicial approval of the MGM restructuring
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got green light for a new beginning.
On Thursday, a New York bankruptcy judge blessed the \"preparatory\" Gluber Plan to relieve the debt of $5 billion and to pave the way for new films and television shows to the 86-year-old entertainment company.
According to the statements of Thursday, the plan meets the requirements of US bankruptcy law, so that the restart of MGM is no longer possible under the direction of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass Entertainment. Barber and Birnbaum will chair the studio as the leading manager of the studio.
The number of employees is reduced from over 400 to approx. 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 does not actually enter into force until JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned $500 million bond to finance the new MGM productions.
At the moment, a consortium of the investment bank, which is itself bringing in $75 million, is headed by the company. The financing is due to stand by mid-December.
The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 with the order to the investment bank Moelis & Co, the management who fought with interest payments of $300 million/year to help solve their financial problems.
In August, the managing director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and restructuring expert, who became known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis & Cooper's efforts to solve the MGM financial concerns and pay off the more than 140 slots of the studio took longer than expected.
After months of discussions, the parties decided at the end of 2009 to offer the company for purchase.
But the auction attracted only a few bidders and no one wanted to pay the $2 billion demanded by the creditors.
In the spring of this year, everything began from the beginning when the MGM team started the restructuring plan, which after months of debates and internal disputes was finally signed by the creditors at the end of October.
If MGM has officially passed the bankruptcy in the next few weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a multibillion dollar bonus for their work.
The Moelis & Co. share that has already received $1.2 million is $9.5 million.
Cooper, who was paid $375,000 per month for the company's management, received a $4 million profit bonus.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM. This year the studio released only one film and created an annual plan with seven or eight films to get to the cinemas at the beginning of 2012.
They also plan two films after \"The Little Hobbit\" in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio needs a separate loan of between $265 million and $275 million for its financial share of these two films to be created under the direction of Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who financed about 18% of the MGM loan, attempted a merger of the studio with Lion Gate Entertainment, the largest shareholder of which he is.
However, the final negotiations between the two companies did not lead to any outcome.
Tech Toys keeps your gift budget in balance
This year's favorite among the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both players can pull a considerable hole in their gift budget.
An iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for $99, while the price for a Kinect game is about 10 classic jump ropes or about 48 cans of play-doh.
But you can save your gift budget.
Recently, I was looking for three electronics toys among $80 three national toy dealers - a whale mart, a toys' R' Us and a BJ's Wholeesale Club.
I immediately realized that Moore's law had entered into force. This year the technology toys are more powerful and cost at the same time a little less than last year.
And although less new toys with their own website appear, in the most famous of these types, Webkinz and Club Penguin, there is a wider offer.
There are more and more button cell-operated toys on the market, and many contain rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(If not stated otherwise, all prices are from Toys-R-Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for children from 3 years of age) are plush figures, as large as sea pigs, who sing a note when pressed on their belly.
Once pressing corresponds to a note, you can play a song by pressing several times.
Several Sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony.
Attention: once you start pressing, you can no longer stop.
For a combination of singing and dancing, the Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price $60, for children from 2) is the best choice.
Based on the Elmo Live technology developed last year, the animatronic doll offers exchange games like 'Simon says', and thanks to the novel hinge feet with wheel blocking, it dominates the Moonwalk.
Children who tested the device use Mickey as a dance teacher. However, your parents complain about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you will certainly remember Alfie, one of the first computerized learning toys.
Now he's back there (Hasbro/Playschool, $40, for children from 3), with a whole bunch of question cards, with which a car ride can become an hour of teaching, with a better-wiser with autocorrection function as a teacher.
If you do not want to trust your child's smartphone, here are three independent alternatives.
MobiGo from VTech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most user-friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard. However, the games included on it are not as instructive as those on Leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12), which, according to Leapfrog's first major revision of the Leapster series, is equipped with a new, brighter screen.
None of the versions are compatible with older cassettes.
iXL from Fisher-Price ($90 for children from 3 to 7) uses a system similar to iTunes for the games and eBooks, and thanks to the SD card drive family photos can also be considered on it.
Last but not least, there is Scrabble Flash ($30 from Hasbro, for children from 8). The five blocks are no larger than a string wood box and have their own LED screen.
The game is about summarizing the blocks before the time runs out. It is great for an improvised bookmaking competition.
More and more toys have some kind of online connection.
If you go into the toy shops alone after the offer, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important.
To give your child an online animal in the Penguin Club, you can, for example, buy a Disney Club Penguin 2 - Mix 'N Match Figure Package ($5 for children from 6 to 12), which contains a coin with a secret code.
If you enter the code online, your child will receive enough credits for two more parts at Club Penguin Store.
These can be rollers or a puffle stuff.
The latest head cell-operated micro robot, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children from 5) is no larger than the head of your toothbrush.
The beetle moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs in any direction.
It's fun to send him through an errand of knots.
And he's holding out a lot.
Our fell from the kitchen table and even spent some time in the mouth of our dog.
Police operations in China become milder
Like a training officer, Tang Shenbin stepped over an urban square, reviewed his nervous subordinates and issued orders with military authority and a damp voice.
He wanted his female members of the Chengguan - China's robust guards of urban order, feared and despised for their arbitrary racism and their tendency to violence - to impress the spectators.
‘Erade stand,
“Click straight ahead,
\"Show them, he whispered to them, \"how beautiful girls are.\"
Four girls, barely grown up with teenage age, with white gloves and identical olive green jackets and pants stood tight.
Four pairs of black pumps were in straight line.
Four proper hats sat perfectly on the blue-white striped sleeved hair.
“For me, they look average - Mr Tang says little about it.
\"Models are pretty\"
Several governments have already tried to pool the image of China's city inspectors.
In one city all new applicants must have a university degree.
The province of Guangdong introduced a bright blue uniform instead of gray green.
Wuhan in Central China replaced violence with low-stars: according to 50 officials in 2009 a misplaced impassioned car and stared the operator until he packed in after half an hour and left the place.
Xindu, a city district in Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, wants to fundamentally change the image.
Since 2003, 13 women have been strengthening the urban police stripes. They have been selected specifically because of their appearance, their good figure and their youth.
They are supposed to give the grossly ill police a softer, feminine aspect.
But, unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson would hardly succeed in improving the bad image that the Chinese have of these city orders.
Right, so the critics.
Unlike the police, these officials may enforce the urban laws only by means of fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely show a different picture.
In January 2008, officials in Hubei Province beat a spectator to death, when she filmed her cell phone as they were slamming a protest against a garbage dump.
Last year a training manual of Beijing officials was stolen and published on the Internet. It describes how criminals can be beaten without bloodshed.
This year, a Shanghai watermelon dealer suffered brain injuries after a hand joint with five officials.
A violent video game that can be downloaded from the Internet shows trained officials in China in an attack on street dealers.
“Chengguan is making the government afraid,” the national newspaper China Daily lashed last year, following further controversy with regard to tactics.
The newspaper demanded a “actually thorough cleaning”
Skeptics find the current approach clearly inadequate.
When the district was looking for eight female recruits in October, an editorial in the Beijing Evening News asked whether women should have real tasks or only serve as optical distractions.
Probably both.
According to job advertisements, women aged 18 to 22 were sought with good character and “harmonic facial traits. ”
You should be above average size - over 1.5m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
The employment relationship ends with the 26th year of life.
According to the official, the activity for women over 25 is physically too strenuous.
“The most important is their image,” stated an unnamed district official at the almost government website Rednet.com.
“If the candidates get the job, they will first depend on their appearance, such as size, weight, facial features, etc.
Then, temperament and “inner qualities” come.
“Weedy Chengguan are like flower vases,” he said, adding, “but they also have other duties,
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Head of the District's City Administration, does not wish to include this description,
admitted, however, that in China, size specifications in job advertisements for both genders are not uncommon.
The same applies to uniform facial features.
Whether this is the same with good appearance is controversial in China.
But people with disabilities or physical loss need not apply.
“We can’t, unfortunately, use lambs or buckliges here,” says Mr. Zheng.
\"Your image wouldn't be good\"
Liu Yi, who patrols on the Baoguang square near a monastery, is 22, has apple bags and a well shaped mouth.
They did not feel as sexist that so great a value is placed on their appearance.
“Find me looking sexy in this uniform,” she asks with an ironic look.
Her colleague, Mr. Xu Yang, commented with the dioceses, 21-year-olds, \"We have the task of representing the city's image,
According to their information, they do not regret the short attitude as they would have more ambitious career plans than simply sending merchants through the streets to prevent them from doing business.
Every morning, the strip deals with about twelve street traders who try to sell as many breads and tofu dishes on foot or on bicycle before being chased away.
\"Mr Wang, please disappear here.\"
“We’ve told you this so often,” explains Ms. Xu to a dealer who had fled on foot, who had temporarily left his noodle kitchen attached to a bicycle cart.
According to the officials, the activity is more monotonous than strenuous.
“It’s almost the same every day,” says Huang Jing, 20, who is studying sales in leisure time.
‘All routine’
One reason for this is that female officials are not allowed to confiscate the goods of traders, like their male colleagues.
They can only threaten criminals to report them to their male superiors.
This is intended to protect them from public attacks that officials in China are often exposed to.
This year, hundreds of inhabitants of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, ransacked the rumor that Chengguan officials had killed a dealer.
More than a dozen policemen and Chenguan officials were injured during the night incident, 14 government vehicles were thrown or burned.
Xindu has been spared from such violence.
But unrest is not to be excluded.
Only two blocks away from the quiet Baonguang Square, where the female officials patrolled this morning, more than 50 people gathered at a street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle that was repaired against the rules on the sidewalk rather than in a workshop.
The owner yelled at Zeter and Mordio.
After 15 minutes of hesitation, the officials took their way to their vehicles with a grim face and continued with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator of the male strip, remained behind, turning his white name label around to remain anonymous.
Like their colleagues, the coordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supportive role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
“Sometimes we’re going verbally, ”
“Sometimes, but also physically,” said Mr. Li soberly.
“Most of the time, people are starting to argue,
Attorney will not sue Senator Ensign
The prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice have released Senator John Ensign from the allegations raised against him after his affair with a former electorate and his attempt to provide her husband with a lobbying activity, announced the senator's lawyers on Wednesday.
This decision ends the most severe lawsuit against Senator Ensign, the Republican from Nevada. Until the scandal, which caused headlines throughout the country and put a damper on his career, he was considered a possible presidential candidate for Republicans in 2012.
As Senator Ensigns announced, he was pleased with the ruling after the one-year investigation.
However, the ethics committee of the Senate could still impose a disciplinary penalty.
According to Ensign's lawyers, they were informed by the Ministry of Justice that the investigations against Senator Ensign had been filed and that there were no further charges in this matter.
The Ministry of Justice did not want to comment on the case.
The ruling was a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice. In your opinion, there was sufficient evidence that Ensign had disregarded the lobbying ban.
Interviews, emails, and other documents released in the New York Times for the first time in October 2009 led to the assumption that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his election assistants, helped to make lucrative orders to buy his silence about an affair with Hampton's wife, Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton was a treasurer during a campaign to campaign in the United States.
Ensign contacted some political friends to get Hampton to work. According to the documents and interrogations, he took over lobbying for them after Hampton's attitude.
Since Hampton was recently in Ensign's team, he was not allowed to take up lobbying for his former employer or the entire Senate for a year.
According to the statement of ethics experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, which had been closely friendly before the affair, violated the so-called prohibition of rote door lobbying.
According to the published indexes, “it seems to be an agreement and a violation of the door statuses,” said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients who are in the government’s visor.
While the Ministry of Justice officially refused to disclose the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said that the Ministry seemed very careful in taking political charges after a variety of defeats that were pursued by the media with great interest, including the decision last year to drop the charge against former Senator Ted Stevens for misconduct on the part of the prosecutor.
Lawyers “are obviously horrified,” said Melanie Sloan, chairman of the Association “Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington” (an organization whose objective is to combat corruption in the US’s parliament and government), a group of lawyers who brought various charges against Mr. Ensign.
“This basically means that senior government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them,” she added.
Paul Coggins, chief defendant of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a prosecutor on Monday and another the next day that he was told that the Ministry would not raise any complaints against his clients.
Mr. Ensigns defendants had cooperated with the prosecutors in order to convince them that the senator, as his office again repeated in a statement on Wednesday, had acted \"in accordance with the law.\"
Mr. Coggins refused to explain more precisely the legal arguments he had presented to the prosecutors.
“I’m not likely to go into the discussion details between the Ministry of Justice and me. Just so much is said: We believe we have made the right decision,” he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to discontinue the investigations for a separate lawsuit by the ethics group, after which a payment of $96.000 from Mr. Ensign's parents had violated the Hamptons against the Federal Election Act.
The Electoral Commission said there was not enough evidence that the money was something other than a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada that long supported the Senator, was one of the companies in which Mr. Hampton found Lobbyist work thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign.
An e-mail from December 2008 proves that, after Mr. Hampton was transferred as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensings Chief of Staff, John Lopez, had an interview with Mr. Hampton, in which he told him that he was at the Ministry of the Interior because of a matter, \"approaching\"
Mr. Ensign also met Mr. Hampton and another customer from Nevada, Allegiant Air, for lunch and asked the Minister for Transport to agree a meeting on behalf of the airline after this Mr. Hampton had set up lobby work.
Last year, when information about this affair first reached the public, Mr. Ensign apologized to his voters and gave up his position in the Senate, where he had been in fourth place in the rank of Republicans.
After many months of absence, Mr. Ensign told two weeks ago reporters that he was pursuing a third term of office in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr. Ensign is no longer the target of police research, his press spokesperson Jennifer Cooper, who is hoping Senator, that the ethics commission will follow the example of the Ministry of Justice very quickly and set up his investigations.
“Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his hard work on behalf of the people in Nevada,” she said.
Cheshire's call draws attention to Twitter
Half a dozen of them tipped away in the Krawallen courtroom.
In the minutes, they sent their reports on horrendous testimony via Twitter.
In the end, according to the defense, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the rape and bed chained children in a house that went up in flames.
On Thursday, Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of killing three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, will find an official end if the judge's claim about the death sentence that the jury has pronounced falls.
But Mr. Hayes attorneys have already filed applications to court, presenting the reasons for an appeal and employing the courts for years.
One of the most provocational reasons is that through intensive reporting of the process - also through the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters - it has become a “circumstance” and so widespread an in-depth penetration of relevant details, so that the jury has been unduly influenced by public disarmament.
This opposition could lead the courts of appeal to deal with the question of whether new technologies will make new rules necessary in the courtroom.
“As I have experienced it during this process, I believe that it is really a danger when the introduction of new technologies into the courtroom influences the right of each individual to a fair trial,” said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes Chief Defender.
The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue of the Supreme Chamber Court, dismissed the requests by decision for a week past, when he said that the New Media would be \"carefully controlled\" and that there was no evidence that the jury had been driven by passions.
But that was certainly not the last word in this matter.
For decades, court rulings have found that reporting on famous and notorious cases raises doubts about the fairness of a process.
In his 1966 historic decision, the Supreme Court of the United States lifted the verdict against Dr. Sam Sheppard, an osteopath from Cleveland, who was supposed to have killed his wife, and said in his decision that there had been a “carnival atmosphere in the courtroom” due to the new media.
Some people believe that the television series and the movie \"On the Fleet\" are based on this crime.
Some lawyers say court rulings that consider Mr. Hay's conviction half a century later could follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the lines of communication from the courtroom that were still unimaginable at the time of the Dr. Sheppard case.
“There is a good reason to be worried about the influence of the New Media in processes pursued by a broad public,” said John J. Donohue III, Professor at Stanford Law School, who has investigated the death penalty in Connecticut. According to his report, she is subject to arbitrary consequences.
Professor Donohue said that some courts of appeal might be fascinated by the idea that restricting direct communication from the courtroom could make the processes more fair.
The Twitter issue is only one of many who present Mr. Hayes' lawyers to discuss on years and thus delay a conviction.
The defendants also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes may have already been prejudicial when Judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them gross crime scene photos during the jurors selection.
Some of the jurors have said that photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and their breeders, Hayley, 17 years old, and Michaela, 11 years old, had filled them with disgust.
The defendants say that they would also question the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution, and argue that the judge mistakenly exchanged a jury who had been a critic of the prosecutor's office and that he had improperly pressured the verdict when he had made the unsolicited decision to release the jury over the weekend.
The jurors were not isolated.
But their arguments about the impact of detailed reporting on the process may attract the greatest interest.
In a verdict they filed last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed by the candidates during the election campaign for the office of governor and for the American Senate.
They argued that the New Media had continuously re-implemented the flames of emotions about the case.
“One such daily pressure from the media peppers, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom,” the lawyers wrote, “has not been experienced in New Haven before and perhaps even across the country,
Her focus on Twitter reporting is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the assertion that these direct messages are more ominous than reports that are more slowly being reimbursed is an enemy of technology, which impoverishes reporting on future processes.
But some lawyers said that courts of appeal would often confront the argument, social and technical changes required adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayer's lawyers reinforce this assertion.
In their opposition, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court decision in which the condemnation of Dr. Sheppard was lifted on the basis of the reporting and made it clear that the New Media requires new rules.
\"This case, they wrote, \"represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century\"
Can courtesy connect the separator?
After a campaign of chimpwords and negativity, this week little courtesy broke out in Washington.
Is it the omen of real two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion before you return quickly to fight the parties in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and the head of Congress brought no breakthrough into the big issues with which one had to deal during the so-called \"lame Duck session\" of the meeting at the end of a period of government in which no decisions are taken.
After all that you hear, it was not a polite discussion between two different sides nor a consideration of their shared responsibility to govern, but rather an empty episode of a party score collection.
The public meeting of the President's Deficit Commission on Wednesday was likewise civilised, despite the political differences that continue to exist between members.
It seems clear that close interaction over a period of months creates a mutual respect that conceals the ideological gap that continues to separate members.
That's hardly enough to claim it's a new era of cooperation.
Both sides are now in a test phase, in which one of the other signs of co-operation and compromise is called for, while one himself tries to weigh the boundaries of public opinion and the patience of the voters after a re-party warfare.
Therefore, the meeting on Tuesday itself and its assessment by the participants were limited to a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep as one could expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that has prevailed over the past two years.
Whether it is about taxes, donations, health or expectations, both sides are miles away from each other.
Last but not least, the Washington election voted mildly for a short time.
“No question, the soundfall has changed,” said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush Government, who is now working for the ‘Ethics and Public Policy Center’.
“This is inevitable after elections.
Elections stir up party passions that die again.
And that's a good thing.
In a number of questions, especially those on the agenda of the 'lame duck session', Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution,
Bush's tax cuts end at the end of the year, and nobody supports that.
Both sides want to find a way to get some or all, whether temporary or permanent.
Similarly, a compromise on the increased unemployment pay is to be expected, albeit only because the Republicans cannot afford to believe that the favored tax reductions for the rich, while they refuse to support unemployed workers.
After the meeting in the White House on Tuesday, optimism has risen that one can agree on these issues during the “lame deck session” and at the same time ratify the New START Treaty.
But William Glaston of the Brooking Insitution warns that successful cooperation on urgent issues of the lame Duck session must not necessarily lead to lasting cooperation between the parties if the new 112th Congress is convened in January.
Instead, he says, a phase of non-conformity is more likely, perhaps even inevitable.
“After the things that need to be done, this short-term psychology will turn into confrontation,” he said.
Wehner is also skeptical - and this skepticism is shared by many - leading the courtesy to true cooperation.
“I see a lot of what is happening from today until 2012, as a pre-fight, or shadow boxing, for the main event of 2012,” he said.
The reasons for this have much to do with the creation of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the tea party voters who were useful for their education.
How concerned the Republican leaders may also be that they are poking too high, they know that they must try to keep up with their promises of lowering government spending and putting health reform out of place.
These party lines are already becoming clear in the initial responses to the recommendations of the Deficit Commission, which include tax reform and the raising of some taxes, the raising of pension age and the lowering of public expenditure.
The deputy presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken over one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, have so much urged them to put the deficit question on the public agenda that they can no longer be ignored.
But within the Commission they need 14 of the 18 votes to make their plan an official recommendation and they fight very much to get close to that number.
The greatest resistance is found in the elected representatives of the board, since in financial matters, at least today, there is little room or little sympathy for compromises.
Galston predicts two phases in the struggle between the White House and the Republicans in Congress.
The first fight will take place next year in the form of party clashes, when Republicans challenge Obama regarding the state budget, taxes and the health system, then later followed by a phase of greater two-party cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
The public opinion.
It has been proven that, despite the partiality of the current election, the majority of Americans still wish the two parties to work together.
If confrontation leads to a deadlock as it happened in 1995, then both parties must pay careful attention to the public response.
Anyone who is always sentenced to lose will have to change the course and seek the compromise.
This may indeed be an optimistic view.
Partyhood and polarization are now greater than in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and the Congress Republicans than at the time between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 as a pure prelude to a far more extensive election in 2012.
As seen, the courtesy worn this week can be welcomed by many Americans.
But it will require much more effort on both sides to find a common denominator in the questions that are still separate from each other.
Transmitted US document portrays Moscow as the port of corruption
The control of the city lies in the hands of the \"cleptocracy\" and it gives a portion of the bribes and the protective money it collects to the Kremlin. Thus, in February, the American Embassy in Russia reported in a memo.
Both police and the State Security Service extort high protection funds so that they can keep their expensive standard of living in Moscow, it says.
They collect money not only from legitimized businesses, but also from organized criminal gangs.
Each layer of bureaucracy - which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has described as \"the vertical of authority - takes its part in the money that the leaders move up.
The memo sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrole was published on Tuesday by WikiLeaks on his homepage.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still Moscow's mayor, and it accuses him of corruption.
He was fired by President Dmitry Medvedev in October, but there is little evidence that it had been cleared in the meantime.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a well-known construction firm, have repeatedly rejected corruption claims over years, and he has won numerous slanderous charges against such charges.
In September, he told a Russian television station when he was asked for a documentary suggesting that he was corrupt: “It’s crazy, it’s dirty, it’s dirty, it’s dirty.
> An incredibly large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt.
But it is unusual for individuals to be mentioned, as in the ambassador's report, and it is unheard of that to happen through a diplomat from a foreign country.
“The direct connection of the Moscow government with crime has led some to call it “disturbed” and conclude that the government acts more like a cleft but as a government, so is the memo.
“Criminal elements enjoy a ‘kryshna’ (a term from the world of criminals / mafia, which literally means ‘dach’ or protection), which extends over the police, the state security (FSB), the service authority (MVD) and the office of the prosecutor as well as through the entire Moscow government bureaucracy.
Experts have discovered a three-layer structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
‘Luzhkov is at the top of the line,
“FSB, MVD and the militia are on the second level,
\"Lastly, the ordinal criminals and the criminal inspectors are following at the lowest level,
“This is an incompetent system in which criminal groups close a gap in some areas because the city does not offer any assistance “
The report goes on to say that the FSB collects money from the biggest companies and that the police arrest small businessmen.
One source, it is said, “explained that Moscow’s business owners understand that it is best to get protection from the MVD and FSB (and not from organized crime), as they not only have more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by the law“
\"For this reason, protection through criminal proceedings is no longer as required as before,
The memo notes that while collecting funds is comprehensive, protection itself is very modest none; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who do not pay find their business closed very quickly - due to some pretext or other.
Medvedev spoke several times about fighting corruption, but at the same time he noted that he had made little progress.
The message's memo contains descriptions of men going into the Kremlin with suitcases that were probably full of money.
“In his fight against corruption, Medvedev has to rely on bureaucrats,” said Georgy Satarov, director of Indem, a Moscow expert commission, recently in an interview.
\"But he is part of this bureaucracy,
\"It is not a part of the political class because a political class in Russia no longer exists \"
Without a politician, without an opposition, without a separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable.
Throughout the country, it is estimated that corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country ranks 154 in a recent investigation into the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries are listed by \"the least corrupt\" to \"the most corrupt).
The revelation of the Memos of the American Embassy, which happened late in the evening of Moscow, will certainly cause misunderstandings within the Russian government, although, since Luzhkov can be accused of the mistake of Moscow, it can also be a possibility for the Kremlin to claim that one solves the problems.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks documents could be a fake and responded angryly to the revelation that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
“The truth is that it is about our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic politics in this country,” he said.
\"But to be honest, we would not have expected this to happen with such arrogance, with such pressure and in such unethical manner, you know,
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to confront the past
In a poorly lit, concrete classroom with dirty and leafy walls, the director of the Anlong Veng High School reminds the man who built him of the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
“Everyone here loves Ta Mok“
“He was a good leader and he was concerned about his people, ” said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Because of his brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule known as the butcher, the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge-Hochburg in the northwest of Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges, developed infrastructure, and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the surrender of the Khmer Rouge to the government, many years of followers are challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed victims to face public confrontation with the people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a schoolbook telling the history of Khmer Rouge for the first time children of former soldiers.
And in July a joint tribunal of the UN and Cambodia first sentenced a former member of Khmer Rouge when it sentenced the former chief of the notorious Tuol Slang Torture Chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duke, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments growing fear among Khmer Rouge veterans Alnlong Vengs, their efforts to reconcile and reintegrate into Cambodian society became difficult.
“There is still rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything,” said Chhang Youk, head of the documentation center of Cambodia, an independent organization that explores the regime.
\"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil,
\"It divides families itself,
During Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of disease, reprocessing or hunger.
When the Vietnamese invaded and in 1979 the Pol Pot-Ied government crashed, the regime's remains and his military fled to Thailand at the border of Cambodia.
Here, until December 1998, when the last movement capitalized, they spread unrest.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Oneg Sary led the guerrilla war from their base in the west of the mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta Mok moved into Anlong Veng for the next generation.
But in the mid-1990s, when a peace agreement supported by the UN led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to transition to government, leading to the capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
In 1998, Pol Pot died of natural death, and Ta Mok, who had not surrendered, was arrested by government forces at the Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in Phnom Penh prison in 2006, where he waited for his trial.
As their patrons no longer protected them, most former Khmer Rouge fighters fled to the crushing poverty of rural Cambodia and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Even though a few elite officials of Khmer Rouge kept their local government posts because they were laying down their weapons, the simple soldiers remained poor, uneducated peasants.
“These people have benefited very little from the surrender,” said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds public forums throughout Cambodia, even in Anlong Veng
“They are anchored in the regime’s utopian agricultural ideology,
‘They grew up without any professional knowledge,
Sor Lim, 55 years old, who had joined Rhmer Rouge in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlang Veng before settling in 1998 to lead a life as a poor rice farmer.
“The life under the Khmer Rouge was good, ” he said.
“To Mok has given everyone something to eat,
“But now life is difficult because we have to take care of ourselves,
The ongoing Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also raised concerns here.
At the beginning of next year, the court will try to bring Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Oneg Sary and his wife and oneng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge Minister, to court.
The court's mission is to condemn the old leaders and those who are mainly responsible for the atrocities, but it is not said whether further acts will be pursued beyond these four cases.
This has contributed little to mitigating the fears in Anlong Veng.
Current media speculations have focused on In the Chaem, 64 years, which during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s was district chief in the province of Manteay Meanchey.
In 2007, she had told the documentation center of Cambodia that she had led the construction of Trapeang Thma Damm, a project that probably killed thousands of forced workers.
On a hot evening, In the Chaem returned from working in the fields to her wooden house on a dirty street outside of Anlong Veng.
As the sun cast long shadows on the parched grass, In Chaem refused to discuss their past at the Khmer Rouge.
If the court were to invite her, she would refuse to go, she said.
“Kambodsha lives in peace and stability,” she said.
\"If there were no more persecutions, war would be here \"
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who escaped from the Khmer Rouge in 1878, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would become uncertain, the court would charge more suspects, although experts and historians discuss this.
“Kambodsha must dig a hole and bury the past,” he said.
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia has to do to move forward, Chhang Youk said from the documentation center.
“Association with Khmer times means joining the broken pieces,” he said.
\"It is our duty to put these broken parts together, so that we can understand everything,
The centre created the first schoolbook approved by the government on Khmer Rouge, the 75-page history of Democratic Cambodia
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an appendix to the History Book for the High School of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages about the Khmer Rouge.
As in Cambodia, the young people in Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's connections to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19 years old, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said that the new school book helps students understand an important part of their story.
But his parents responded skeptically when he brought the book home to read it.
“My family rejects many parts of the book and the court,” he said.
“They’re suspicious because they’re not sure how many people are condemned by the court.”
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the school book and the court gradually gain influence, he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful attraction here.
Above the Dangrek mountains, one of the shrubs overgrown and with plastic waste, leads to a rectangle of black rust, covered with a rusty sheet roof.
After his death in 1998, Pol Pot's body was burned on a tire cluster.
Nuom Sothea, 31 years old, a cell phone salesman on the roadside, said she didn't know much about the man who had been burned here.
“But he has a strong spirit and many people here go to him to pray,” she said.
It was Nuom Sotheas' birthday and later on the day she wanted to go to Pol Pot's last rest place, where she will deposit a bush of mature bananas - hoping to bring her happiness.
Belarus agrees not to continue to collect weapons-capable uranium
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to secure global nuclear material, the Belarus government announced on Wednesday that one will no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement following a meeting of Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the Security Summit.
For many years the U.S. government had tried to convince Belarus not to collect high enriched uranium and seemed to have reached a hurdle last spring.
But official U.S. government told Washington Post that in the past two months two secret agreements with Belarus have been made to remove 187 pounds of armed uranium from a Belarusian research institute.
This prepared the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material - according to an official employee who remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the topic, about 500 pounds.
The agreement seems to be one of Obama's most important results of the April nuclear safety summit of the 47 nations, which had excluded Belarus.
And it was obviously good enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
“I was really excited by the fact that they want a seat in the Nuclear Safety Summit (of 2012),
“This proves to me that it works,” said Ken Luongo, President of the Global Security Partnership, a group to promote nuclear safety.
Clinton called the agreement \"a very important, important step\" by Belarus.
Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague to secure all the precarious nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries to get rid of their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under the government of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's nuclear safety summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko declared that the nation will never give up its uranium.
“How to keep highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is fundamentally weapons-capable, and less enriched uranium - said Lukashenko at the time.
“This is our raw material... We won’t make any dirty bombs out of it and we won’t sell it to anyone”
“We use it exclusively for research purposes, that’s all “
However, a few months ago, Belarus approached the United States as it showed interest in the meeting of an agreement.
The first approach to removing uranium Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the material was easily irradiated, officials say.
It was loaded into a special train, which has more than 1,300 miles to a Russian storage and disposal factory, officials say.
The second start was decided on Monday and was carried out by plane according to the official.
The US government is paying $14 million for these efforts, with a large part of the money flowing into Belarusian research with weakly enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
“This was extremely carefully coordinated and coordinated in order to build trust, which led to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniavsky, a representative of the Ministry of Energy working on global risk reduction.
The James Martin Center for Non-Providing Studies estimates that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of armed uranium this year and hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
According to the joint agreement Belarus intends to dissolve its camp by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States were tense for many years, primarily because of Lukashenko's harsh disregard for human rights.
But the statement of Wednesday suggests a possible approach.
\"Welcoming the progress of these global security issues, the United States of America and Belarus announce that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue in improving bilateral relations and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens.
No objections from the Spanish government against CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objections to CIA flights with Taliban and Al-Qaida prisoners across the Spanish state territory to Guantanamo, as a telegram from the Ambassador of the U.S.A. in Madrid.
This reflects the documents published by Wikileaks and forwarded to the daily newspaper \"El País\" (by cable). It is added that former deputy government chief María Teresa Fernández de la Vega called for the Spanish government to be informed, to demonstrate that foreign aircraft flying Spain are being adequately monitored,
In June 2006, after the publication of a report by the Council of Europe in which the aid to anti-human rights practices was accused in a dozens of countries, including Spain, the former North American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega spoke.
The Deputy Head of State admitted that the report of the Council had been adopted by Zapatero and confirmed that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
‘De la Vega stressed that Spain has no objections to intelligence flights across the Spanish state area,
“You just want to be informed, not to be “unpreparedly surprised,” Aguirre reports by cable.
The former Foreign Minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, also pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish government “does not want to pay much attention to this issue, although the government has little influence because they are lying in the hands of the judges,
On the other hand, in January 2007, Vicente González gave the message that he would not attempt to block the judicial initiative of declassifying the documents of the Spanish Secret Service Centre (CNI) and the Secretary of Defense on CIA flights.
“These reports do not contain any burdensome or sensitive information,” said the ambassador after an interview with the prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the United States was more concerned about the apparent coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and the German prosecutors than about the declassified information of the CNI and the Ministry of Defense.
“This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to discreetly deal with governments,” Aguirre complains.
During a lunch in March 2007, at which the U.S. Ambassador and the Spanish Minister of Interior Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba participated, the latter commented that \"although the Spanish judges were madly concerned about their independence and did what they thought was appropriate, he gave instructions to his employees to avoid \"blowing up rhetorical comments in order to let the tension fluctuate\"
The ambassador also expressed concern about the operation of the PP in this matter.
\"Despite their generally pro-American attitude, our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt that the government will have tolerated or deliberately ignored Zapatero's actions of the United States, which could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, will beat capital, even if these revelations could have a negative effect on the United States government, he highlights.
The child murderer admitted that she had complained on the Internet about the “muchsal” of motherhood.
The young woman spoke of the child when she was already dead and she had a blog: \"Terror in a galic way\"
Monatica Juanatey Fernández is online
Under this nickname, which she leads from small to small, she keeps in touch with a cousin and at least one friend. Both come from Noia, a village in the province of La Coruña, where she was born.
The notifications are from 2008.
In order to understand these, one must know their love life, which reconstructs ABC daily on the basis of testimony of their family members.
The 30-year-old galic woman established a relationship with Iván Túñez, an industrialist in 1998.
She's been there for a year.
Shortly after she dissolved her relationship, she was known to be pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby belonged to him, but his former husband never let him carry out a DNA analysis.
Soon after, she had a different relationship.
The chosen was Alberto, a young man from Lousam, a neighbouring municipality.
She lived with him for a long time.
César lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearic Islands to take care of the labour market, she stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But from the content of their news it can be concluded that their love relationship broke and they separated.
In March 2008, she is alone in Menorca and writes: “Alberto is very strange and angry because I came to work,
“When I told him that, he found it good, but now, of course, he notices what it means to be alone with the boy all day long and not be free, do and let him do what he wants,
Later, she mentions a message she just received on the phone: “I want you to come back this month or send me an address that I can send you to the boy,” she says.
She complains: \"If he doesn't like me letting the boy with my mother, I'll pick him up when I'm back\"
In May she speaks of returning to her village: “This week I am going there, but I will only stay there until the 19th because I have to imagine myself working for a job on the 20th if I don’t want to lose it,”
She explains that when everything goes well, she takes her first-born.
“He will be with whom he must be, that is, with me. Never in life will I leave him with anyone except my mother - a doubtful intention to consider their bad relationship.
In July there is another mail.
When she writes this, it is assumed that the boy who came to the island on the 1st of the month and was allegedly murdered on the 10th is dead.
‘On the one hand, César is satisfied, on the other hand,
\"On the one hand, he is with me and the place he likes a bit, but on the other hand he has to go to school every day,
She's talking about moving to Mallorca.
“There he (the boy) will attend a summer course, so I have fewer expenses for the baby girl “
On 17th: Memories and Complaints.
“A giant kiss of César asking me when you come,
“Alberto says he sent me any videos on the e-mail. If he wants to, he will find me, such a mess “
On 30th another: \"The boy is fine. He goes into a summer course to learn Catalan,
Víctor, her current partner, has one thing: \"He shoots me money\"
On the Internet, in anime and mangablogs, there are messages from her.
She even had her own blog in MySpace, which is now locked up, and in which she called herself \"Muki, the jailer.\"
‘Terror a la galega (heading)’.
The last man to live with her, an accomplished hunter, declares to have a good conscience because he feels guilty.
He can't believe that everything happened because she didn't tell him she was a single mother.
Monatica was transferred to Palma Province Prison yesterday from the centre of the court in Menorca.
The mandatory defendant, Carlos Maceda, explained that she could not remember the end of the matter, “and she did not have the intention of harming the little one,
Before that, however, she had been able to drown César in the bathtub and have his body stowed in a suitcase.
Defense and prosecutorship requested a psychiatric opinion.
Partido Popular won 4 seats in Congress and PSC lost 9
With the results of November 28th, the PP could play a decisive role in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase in votes and deputies in the last regional elections, the PP is already looking at the parliamentary elections - preferred or not. Their expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes achieved by this party in these elections is usually twice as high as those in the Catalonia elections.
Thus, the Catalan People's Party received 610,473 votes in the 2008 parliamentary elections, while this figure in the 2006 regional elections was only 316,222.
On last Sunday the PPC received 384.091 votes.
If this rising trend - resulting from the redirection of the PSC voting share and the binding of the electorate of the PP - was to continue, the analysts of the PP predict that in the parliamentary elections the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 Members of Congress, while CiU would also win four (it has now 10) and lose at least 9 Members (of 25).
These calculations demonstrate the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the People's Party, the ERC would lose a MP - at present it has three - while ICV could hold or win its MPs.
However, if the election calendar is maintained, the next date with the municipal elections will fall in May 2011. Also, the People's Party (PP) may be the tongue at the scales to put an end to socialist domination, in four provincial capitals and with its majority in the City Council of Barcelona, one of the city's administrations with the largest budget: 661 million euros for 2011.
Both the Nationalists and the People's Party agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, in which the Socialists will not be able to achieve a majority or fall back on their traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
After the Republican debacle, it is not surprising that this party will lose its representation in the Barcelona Municipal Council, in which it would have to earn 5% of the votes.
On the other hand, the PP recorded an increase in its voting share in the four provincial capitals and could become a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced to play the lead role in Tarragona's recovery. There they ruled before the current mayor, Joseph Félix Ballesteros, together with the PP.
En Lérida is the PP only 500 votes behind the PSC. Mayor, Ängel Ros, maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election campaign they met several times.
In other important places, such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus, the People's Party was also able to see a significant increase.
Currently the PP is represented in 34 city administrations of Catalonia and aims to create lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell supplied Al Qaida with thousands of travel passports
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona there were three others in Thailand
The seven Pakistani and Nigerian police officers arrested by the Barcelona secret police formed the jihadic cell controlled by Thailand, the various Al Qaida groups, including the movement for the liberation of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and Laschkar e-Taiba (Let) - the latter was author of the assassinations in Bombay, which in 2008 claimed 106 dead - with passports.
The Ministry of the Interior of Spain has shown a great deal of importance to these investigations, which goes so far as to assure that the \"operation Kampai\" has been weakened by the counterfeiting device Al Qaidas worldwide, and thus their ability to act.
Researchers believe that in the two years during which the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they were falsified and then sent to the groups from which the criminal galaxy Al Qaida was composed, so that their ‘fighters’ could cross the borders of European and other Western countries without penalty.
The detected cell is not the only one of the jihadist network that was active in Europe. That is why, besides the Thai investigative bodies, other European police units have been involved in the investigations. It is not excluded that the EU area will face similar attacks in the next few days, such as that carried out last Tuesday in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistann Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested) another was carried out in Thailand, where Pakistan's Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt as well as the Thai countries Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung were arrested.
They had been led by Bangkok from the cell established in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of it had been destroyed in 2009 - in particular stole tourist passports according to the requirements of the so-called International Islamic Front -
This means that the documents were issued on the names of men aged 25 to 45 and had to be valid for several years; they were not allowed to have visa stamps.
It is emphasised in research circles that, until now, no links between those arrested in Catalonia and the assassination in Bombay could be demonstrated, although the author of this attack, \"Laschkar e-Taiba\", was one of the recipient groups of fake travel passports stolen in Spain and subsequently faked in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be remembered that a few days before the assassination of Catalonia, several thousand dollars had been sent through a money transfer company, which had been “invested” in the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones, which were later used by members of the “command” that ended the lives of 106 persons.
The police seized extensive documentation.
PP calls for a postponement of the tax agreement by Mas
The president of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, took the opportunity yesterday to personally present Artur Mas's terms of support for his term of office as Prime Minister of the Generalitat, which do not differ from those already held during the election campaign and can be summed up with the priority of economic recovery and the failure of regionalist independence adventurers, such as a financial compensation agreement that the regionalist leaders intend to propose at the height of their mandate.
The President of the Catalan People's Party turned with certainty to Artur Mas, who gave her the 18 delegates she had won on the last Sunday - a number more than sufficient to feel indispensable. Because the candidate of the Civil-Regionalist Party CiU is required to have at least one of the opposition parties present in the vote when he took office.
The future alliances that the regionalists want to join in the upcoming parliamentary elections in Congress depend on a possible entente with the PP. However, the talks that Mas currently conducts with the other party leaders revolve around Catalonia.
With regard to the PPC's chairperson, this calls for the appointment of ‘all discourses concerning sovereignty and independence of Catalonia’, as well as an agreement on financial compensation between the State and the Autonomous Region, similar to the Basque Country, and which the Head of the Party of CiU even wishes to submit to a referendum.
Both political leaders are common in that they want to narrow down the built-up political apparatus of the regional administration and to abolish inheritance and gift taxes.
The details of the negotiations for Mas's entry into office are dealt with by the PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced a harsh opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV). Today he will meet with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The Altenpflegeheim confirms that the deaths are not due to \"missing measures\"
The owners of the Altenheim in Olot do not exclude the death of their caregivers over eleven elderly people.
The representatives of La Caritat's old nursing home in Olot (Gerona) held a press conference yesterday, which revealed the damage to the criminal acts of Joan Vila Dilmés - the caretaker who had killed at least eleven old people for whom he was responsible - to the institution.
The head of the old nursing home, Joan Sala, joined his lawyer, Joan Cañada, and announced, \"La Caritat wants to sue the person responsible (for the cases of death) - but \"the law and our liability force force us to accept the process and civil liability.
The institution must not only accept a loss of social property because it had not established the criminal acts of the caretaker in time, but now also pay a high amount of compensation calculated by the legal representatives of the victims' family members.
Joan Vila Dilmé stated that the first crime went back to August 2009 and that he has continued to murder since then.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the old nursing home - since he suspected that no doctor had personally investigated the deceased, but the formalities due to their age and disease were handled by telephone.
La Caritat's head consistently ignored this point and explained that \"the remaining measures could not have been the cause of the incidents at the moment,
The lawyer of La Caritat added that “in the dispute of law there are no indications of negligence of a person other than the accused’s,
Eleven murders who were already baptized as a \"death seal\" last night and declared that the first crime was committed on August 29, 2009, and one and a half months later the second old lady was murdered.
In this case, he killed with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime in which he had administered a mixture of various tranquilizers.
The director of La Caritat explained that access to the drugs is only difficult to control.
The insulin injections and the tranquilizer cocktail were used by the caretaker in six out of nine committed crimes to free patients with death from their suffering.
But the results of the laboratory investigations will reveal whether Vila is lying and actually chose a less cruel death for his first victims, or whether he burned them out of the inside, giving them bleaching, as he had done, according to confession in three women, which he murdered between October 12 and 17.
In La Caritat there is no faith in the statements of the caretaker, not even in regard to the number of committed murders that could be more than that. This attitude is justified by the fact that Vila had made very different statements before the court and that it makes no sense to change his course suddenly after eight successful murders.
They say they have made themselves available for this reason and to clarify the scope of these incidents of justice.
Threats of the European Central Bank (ECB)
The investors responded very strongly yesterday to the threat from the ECB President Trichet, who warned that “the markets should not underestimate our ability to react”
The risk rise of the euro periphery countries has increased dramatically and the shares of European banks have increased by more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB can be deceived and that the euro has little to do with concerns.
The events of yesterday are typical of an ill-liquid market, which, to the extent that it collapses, recovers, however, as a result of the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will not lose his fear for a long time.
Today a month ago, the European Central Bank urged us to reverse our liquidity assumptions, according to which the ECB will have to withdraw for the fourth time in two years tomorrow, and probably several more times in the future.
The Bundesbank called for the imposition of the plan for the purchase of government debt, as it was ineffective and for the abolition of all exceptional temporary liquidity measures. Only one week of unlimited access should be maintained.
After the Irish crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures to be extended, at least to March, and the quarterly invitations to tender with unlimited access at the end of the quarter, to ensure liquidity until at least June.
We also expect the program to continue to purchase bonds and to issue a strengthening signal.
If the expectations created are not fulfilled, the excellent response of the markets will be thrown back from yesterday and if the halls insist that we take back our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
As with the ECB meeting in May, in which the Bank confirmed that it would not take into account the purchase of government debt securities and then collapse markets, this story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May she showed the teeth and on Wednesday she said that she had already bought a lot, which led to a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday, the auction of one-year state titles in Portugal was rather weak.
The government's asset management accounted for only 500 million to 5.28%, compared to 750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, Portugal's interest rates fell by 30 basis points throughout the curve and thus reflected a change in perception of the markets according to the words Trichets.
In Ireland, the figures of the debt gap of Allied and Bank of Ireland were published.
The sum is estimated at about 10 000 million in the short term and possibly another 15 000 in the future.
Although Ireland has lost its credibility completely after not realizing the problem with the stress tests in July, the figures within the rescue plan are acceptable and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, on the next Tuesday, the Government must receive Parliamentary consent to its new budget, and as it still does not have sufficient support, Ireland is still a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has made its discourse more moderate with regard to the Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December. There is a demand for political unity to show that we are playing the same score together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries want the ninth Symphony Beethovens.
The President of the Spanish Government presented yesterday the plan of action to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous regions such as the financial institutions, reduction of the government deficit, liberalisation, privatisation and job creation measures. Measures that sound in the ears of investors such as Vivaldis four seasons.
The double effect of Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock exchange has increased by 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchange.
Compared to February, the reaction of the government and the Spanish Central Bank was fast and convincing, and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today, there is a major auction of a three-year government bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect, so we are putting forward a strong demand that will eliminate all doubts about our resilientness.
For Spain, applying for an aid plan would be a self-sacrifice.
We would get liquidity that we don't need. The Treasury has 40 billion euros available, three times as much as in March. Interest rates are extremely expensive and access to markets would be closed in no time.
Nevertheless, our strategy should be in line with Caesar’s wife’s motto: “Now not only does it count being, but also the appearance of being,
Just courage, we'll do that!
At the request of his children, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Eulen shall attend the Vega Sicilia General Assembly
The storm in the open conflict of the family Álvarez, owner of the societies Eulen and El Enebro, does not fluctuate.
David Álvarez, founder of the company belt, will challenge El Enebro's meeting, which will be held at the request of five of his seven children on 16th, because he considers them \"absolutely void.\" His children will try to obtain a majority to control the company's administrative bodies - owner of the winery Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his children Jesús David and María José prepare the legal measures for a new judicial chapter in their dispute to control part of the group.
The founder of the largest holding of corporate services does not appear to be willing to submit in his lawsuit for the control of El Enebro's institutions.
He was expelled from the Board of Directors by five of his seven children, appointed as members of the Board of Directors at the Shareholders' Meeting of 18 January this year, which has already been challenged in the Trade Register.
The company meeting of El Enebro, convened by the judge of the commercial court number 2 of Madrid for the 16th, triggered a new thunder strike in the lap of the Álvarez family.
The appeal of the judge to the meeting is the only legal way to ensure that the meeting of shareholders is convened.
The last strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is interpreted by David Álvarez as a - desperate means of applicants - his five children - to be recognized by means of legal findings, fraudulent machinations and legal abuse, as official spokespersons declare the meeting declared invalid on 18 January.
This argument is the basis for opposing the assembly in retrospect in order to explain it as \"absolutely void\".
In June, the same protagonists, in discreet silence, tried unsuccessfully to convene a congregation on a judicial basis.
At El Enebro - asset company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, alongside other assets - David Álvarez's seven children control 100 percent of the capital.
On the other hand, according to family protocols, the founder of the service group demands the right to use over 51% of the capital.
This is the real background of the case on which the judge has to decide in the hearing to deal with the appeal complaint for which no date has yet been set.
Red Bull wins in the F1 with a secret weapon by Siemens
The cars are improved with a software in real time.
Since Red Bull ended up in the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this fine universe is characterized by the speed of surprises and successes.
At the beginning, no one gave attention to the newcomer and despite his steeply rising turnout during the last season, all of them put on the victory of the Ferraris of Fernando Alonso in the last November.
Without wanting to reduce the skills of the German pilot and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the performance of Renault's engine, the \"secret weapon\" put into the hands of Multi Siemens Red Bull, and thus created a winning team, became legend.
In fact, it is a powerful software for simulation of processes that the German company launched in 2007 for purposes that do not have to do with car racing.
This computer software program, known as PLM, has been used for the development of assembly chains in factories around the world, power plants and high-precision instruments.
A faithful reproduction or simulation of a product or process is intended before it is actually built to avoid errors and unnecessary costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft and Nissan's most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russworm, Head of Siemens's Industrial Department, explains that with the use of this software in Formula 1 - Red Bull factory in just a few hours, almost in real time - the changes and improvements that can be identified, designed and implemented on the races and during the tests.
Russworm suggests that in 1992, on average, ten technicians worked in the racing stables, which were able to implement a maximum of three or four improvements in a season.
The Red Bulls team employs 180 highly qualified young people today. With high-performance EDP systems they conduct analysis and all possible changes to the racing car.
Siemens Manager explained that the PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all components of Red Bull's racing cars, except for the engine for which Renault is solely responsible.
The materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are changed.
The changes can be transferred from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality thanks to advanced production systems and high-tech autoclaves within less than 24 hours.
The only limit set by this crazy technical perfectionism is the $40 million that a Formula 1 team can spend on its race in a season.
Red Bull has built its high-tech factory for the development and manufacture of his racing cars in a 50-kilometer location from London.
These are two buildings in which visits - especially by journalists - are heavily restricted.
Everything that happens there is Top Secret.
The workforce comprises 580 people, including the two pilots, the World Champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bull's true Formula 1 hero is undoubtedly the newest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the enormous technological resources placed by the energy drink manufacturer in the services of his participation on the racetracks, other protagonists hide themselves, their support invaluable and their fame is equal to zero.
The technologist of the plant, Steve Nevey, stressed that five years ago it was still possible to say that progress in the field of R&E for racing cars contributed 50 percent to the victory and that the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today the share values have changed. Technology accounts for 85 percent of the success, while pilots' contribution is estimated to be 15%.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by EDP, because they are not predictable gladiators
HP will open twenty separate shops with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) inaugurated his first exclusive shop in collaboration with his partner Ront Reyes yesterday in Barcelona.
It is the first of a 20 business sales network with between 80 and 100 square meters each, which the Multi intends to open in Spain in the next two years.
The company agrees this initiative with the already existing 16 sales areas in the multi-brand business, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The deputy chairman of HP España, Helena Herrero, called as an example the rebuilt store at Gran Vía in Barcelona, property of Pont Reyes, which HP has been working with for thirty years.
The North American Group intends to set up 200 sales outlets in Europe by 2010, 20 of them in Spain.
The first was inaugurated last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third store.
Herrera did not want to betray the coming new openings, but did not exclude Madrid from being the next goal.
The Deputy Chairman, who is also Head of HP Personal Systems, assured that the philosophy of charging was always the same. She relied on a local distributor with experience and industry knowledge.
The North American Group advises on this and takes over the exclusive charging equipment (with interactive products for touching). In Europe all shops will look the same.
HP is also responsible for training the shop staff.
Helena Herrero said that it was not a franchising system and pointed out that with the exclusive sales point network, the intention would be to \"to optimize the customer service and the advice of small and small businesses when shopping and after that even the packaging\"
The Barcelona store has a pioneer pilot program that solves the technical problems of HP devices with warranty.
An online service builds a connection to the Technical Centre in Maastricht, Holland.
“In this way, we can solve problems in ten minutes, which sometimes take up to two days,
\"This system was developed especially for small and small businesses and private customers, because the major companies already have their service contracts for technical customer service,\" said Helena Herrororo yesterday.
Sabadell wants to 'close' his rivals in three years
The managing board member of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 will be a hard year for the banks, but initially a new crisis of liquidity and predicts the end of the debt war.
Nevertheless, it anticipates a break in interest rates which banks are trying to offset with increases in fees and prices for loans.
Sabadell expects to capture a million private customers in three years - an ongoing trade.
Sabadell has found the way to exploit the next three years, thus surviving in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new three-year guidance plan in 2011.
The goal is not only to survive without using public aid from the FROB, but also to increase the market share of a million private customers - 700 000, if you withdraw the customers who will lose the bank - which is the major challenge facing this bank, because it has so far paid more attention to its business customers than to its private customers.
This year it has reached 250 000 private customers and 50 000 companies.
Their market share of private customers is 3.5 percent, while business customers account for more than 10 percent.
Another principle of the 2011-2013 business plan is the increase of productivity, say austerity, cost reduction. The challenges faced by the bank will be presented together with the annual final report.
Few banks dare to set goals and publish in these difficult times, as the financial crisis has brought all the plans of the banks worldwide to one another.
Sabadell will conclude her four-year-old Optima guidance plan this year, which was initially designed for three years, but as a result of the market situation, it was extended by one financial year.
The customers who will leave the Sparkassen are the main goal of the bank.
At a breakfast organised by APIE Guardiola, 2011 would be a “severe year” with great reach.
The manager assumes that Spain came out of the crisis only slowly.
Moreover, it would be very difficult to create work in two or three years - fundamental for the survival of banks.
Even if he assumes that the war on liabilities - which penalizes interest rates - will continue to fluctuate, the risk increases that banks and savings banks will have to pay for their emissions to maintain liquidity will already be offset by the price of loans as a compensation for dwindling profit margins.
‘The issues of liquidity and financing are structural and they will put pressure on loans,
“We didn’t turn the cock off, but the interest rate differentials are very high - granted Guardiola.
Banesto announced on Thursday the arrangement for its branch network to limit long-term loans and to increase interest rate differentials (cf. Cinco Días of 22 and 27 November).
The manager also agreed that the banks were currently pursuing the stategie , \"to raise the fees , however , within a framework characterized by competition.
Sabadell's guiding plan is based on organic growth, even if the group does not exclude corporate business as always.
It does not in any way assure that more companies are needed in Spain,
“In the coming year everything will change, he assures.
He stressed that the need for capital is currently “enorm increasing” and does not exclude the dropping of some Spanish financial institutions in red figures.
He believes that the FROB can replace the money market in captita-labour stockings.
After ensuring that Sabadell can also survive a temporary closure of the markets, he refutes the argument of some bankers who are already predicting a new liquidity crisis.
He stressed that nothing could be remedied, but in contrast to the events in June, it was possible to obtain short-term financing through repo operations and thus to catch up with the crisis.
CECA excludes a second fusion wave of the Sparkassen
The CEO-General of CECA, José Antonio Olavarieta, yesterday rejected the possibility that there could be a fusion wave of the Sparkassen and stressed the speed with which the industry would be restructured.
When the concentration process of the Spanish Sparkassen began, several Sparkassen did not participate in the first phase. They held the second round.
On the other hand, the Director-General of the Spanish Sparkassen Association (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured that this second round would not take place.
“I believe that most of the mergers have been completed. The inclusion of Cajasol in the Banca Cívica group cannot be considered as a second round, but these were adjustments,
“The biggest part is completed. It may be that we have thirteen or fourteen instead of seventeen, but all important processes have already been completed. They have been controlled by Banco de España, who has strongly supported all operations,
At a breakfast organised by the Association of Managing Directors and Managers of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarieta stated that the concentration process “was carried out as soon as possible and that we must be satisfied with the time-consuming process, which was established in earlier times, not now, within the framework of the business plans with Banco de España, he stressed.
“The transition of 45 savings banks with an average of 28 000 million assets to 17 with 75 500 million each is a historically incomparable process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 percent and they are now much larger, with which we have fulfilled the Basel Agreement,” he said.
Olavarrieta explained that there were a number of undecided opinions about the slowness of the process, the insanity and insanity, because \"Banco de España encourages us to conclude in due time before the end of the year\"
The director-general of CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has one of the most rigorous financing systems in Europe and, perhaps, the whole world and added that those who doubt this are doing \"without deeper knowledge\".
The manager noted that in the current economic economy, we must not worry about the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, which have gone through a very important concentration process that will be carried out as quickly as possible.
He also recalled that the Spanish banks had passed the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the red line of Germany
Berlin has decided to maintain the euro, but at the same time it has set up conditions for the entire European Union.
The tensions in the markets have triggered a double response from the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has submitted new adaptation measures, starting with tax reductions for small and medium-sized enterprises, the regulation of temporary workers or the abolition of 426 Euro support for unemployed people who do not receive unemployment benefits, up to the privatisation of 49 per cent of AENA, the administration of Barajas and El Prat airports, and 30 per cent of the state lottery.
On the other hand, with the help of former President Felipe González, Elena Salgado, the Deputy Head of Government supports the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as responsible, who has voiced the current crisis.
How can these processes be understood?
It should be noted that Merkel's position is not a mistake in her public relations work.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
Germany takes a fundamentally new perspective on the design of our future, which collides with maintaining the old traditions of a large part of its partners.
In view of the resistance in Europe, we are beginning to speculate about three possible ways out of the crisis in Germany.
The first: A strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south would have to leave the euro area.
The second: The re-introduction of the Deutsche Mark - although it currently sounds more like science fiction - supported by a majority of public opinion, about 50 percent of the population.
The third party: a transformation of the euro according to German proposals. This means: more macro-economic control; strict budgetary management; punishment of countries which violate the requirements; possibly more the setting of payments by some countries and the extension of the costs of potential adjustment measures to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been distinct for some time. That is why there is no excuse now.
First in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission created incentives for deficits and the German government removed a constitutional reform in order to prevent this from happening in 2016.
This was the first sign of the disparity between what Germany considered necessary (strength tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign was the Central European country, when Merkel drew the decision to save Greece painfully.
At the time, this was strongly criticized, but the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and the published opinion were absolutely against a rescue of Greece.
Finally, during the last few days of October, Merkel comes out with a clear position, calling for a reform of the European Union Agreements in order to enable the rescue of a country and at the same time require private lenders to bear part of the costs.
This position was designed to be anti-European, as it pushed forward the Irish crisis and all the following.
But their proposal, if anything, was accepted, and in the coming months we will participate in the reform of the European Union, which will enable these measures from 2013 onwards.
Germany has drawn a red line which it does not think to exceed.
It tells everyone that - even if we have to take unfavourable measures now - the old functioning of the euro will no longer exist from this date.
In 2013, the birth year of a new currency area, in which the anti-dumping countries are severely punished, will be forced to declare themselves incompetent and, in this case, the private sector must take part in the costs.
Germany shows us that we need to take a hard growth course, with high savings and investment rates, a measure of consumption, improved productivity and competitiveness as well as positive external balances.
The other alternative, which is based on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments, as suggested by Spain in booming times, will simply not be accepted.
The offer is clear.
And we'd be bad at not understanding it.
Not only is it important to reduce the government deficit to 3% by 2013.
The demands are much harder.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions is deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will go into more calm.
And that we will take advantage of the opportunities we will be offered until spring 2013.
It seems Zapatero has understood this as well, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the big companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures yesterday) points out that despite the criticism of Merkel, the hypothesis of creating order in his own home has prepared her way.
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it doesn't look like something would change about it.
Among the possibilities considered is the fact that we would not have to leave the euro area fully abandoned with few serious countries.
In this case, Germany could still tell us it warned us.
Sport and regulation
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show invention spirit, but not the will to circumvent a sanction.
The alleged exclusion in the game of November 23 against the Ajax in the Champions League led to a lot of ink being shed on whether it was an unsportsman action or not and whether perhaps both players should be sanctioned by the UEFA.
As is commonly known, the two players lost a few minutes before playing (their team had already clearly won) time and played several fouls so that the judge showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid would lead its group, the two players will meet the prescribed penalty at the next league game against the Auxerre and thus enter the next game without any cards.
Finally, UEFA's disciplinary committee punished the club's coach José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten, but in this sport followed rules.
Part of the debate about the case presented goes back to the fact that a team of the Real Madrid football club (who pretends to be noble and honorable in his hymn and had punished his players for similar incidents on other occasions) played the main role, and to the dramatization by Mourinho, who added an episode more to his long history as a theatrical and provocation technician.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether it does not explicitly contradict the principles of sport, that is, whether these acts constitute a rule of conduct. In fact, this procedure adheres to the statutes of sport, but seems to circumvent its meaning.
In this matter, the damage caused by the spirit of sports should be examined.
The sports spirit defends the physical integrity of the opponents, an aspect that was not endangered by these actions because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid the opponents from taking an unjustified advantage from the counter-team. Neither did it happen.
The paradox of the action of the Real Madrid players is that it does not correspond to what we normally understand under false play or rule, because the circumvention of the rule was not carried out secretly to avoid a penalty, but it should be as obvious as possible so that it is punished by the arbitrator.
The players waited and gladly accepted the penalty.
Another question is what kind of advantage the offenders draw from the deliberate fouls.
It should be stressed here that the rival was neither brought into a more unfavorable position nor increased benefits for the game played, because the obvious result of this action was that the own team had to continue playing with fewer players.
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club then does not have these players.
The advantage is obviously that the players start the next game phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But it is a long-term, up to a certain degree uncertain advantage, as the team might eventually get out. Furthermore, the players receive a penalty with this procedure and pass into the second card cycle, in which they opt out with a card less than in the first cycle due to accumulation of cards.
So it is not so clear whether it really is an advantage.
In the end, such practices do not contradict the spirit of sport, which also includes strategic decisions in order to make the greatest possible use of the rules.
In this case, the players did not want to commit any penalty (which would actually be a clear case of rule circumvention), they wanted to choose when they were subject to it.
They made a strategic decision to escape or escape without a penalty.
Although the boundary between invention and regulatory environment is blurred, I believe that this is a clear case of invention.
I have the impression that the polemics arose as a result of two factors: because it was about two self-exclusions and because of the nature of the provoked rule transmission.
The damage inflicted on the principles of sport by these actions is less ethical than rather aesthetic.
Offer offer to catch customers for group Christmas dinner in Barcelona
The dictatorship of the calendar leaves this year an avalanche of reservations to the days 16 and 17 December.
The celebrations paid by employees themselves are spread out. They do not want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the Turrón and the Christmas lottery, there are also group dinners in the pre-Christmas season that run oxygen to the restaurant and leisure industry of Barcelona. However, as a result of the economic crisis, they also issue a price offensive to capture the customer segment, which is the big mass: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 Euros for lunch or dinner, confirm the surveyed entrepreneurs and associations.
To make accounting a bit more complicated, the calendar (Silvester falls on a Friday) has dropped all orders to the week of December 13, with the result of an avalanche of reservations from dinner on two top days (16 and 17) and almost no orders during the week before.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies have discontinued group dinners for budgetary reasons.
In order not to give up this tradition, many workers pay them out of their own pocket.
Whatever the economic situation, low prices are demanded, confirmed by the chairman of the restaurant remium of Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the umbrella association has not yet dared to predict what the holidays will look like this month.
“People will think about it a little before they reserve,
“They want to go out, but they pay strong attention to the prices,” he emphasizes.
The business will go well, “the quality at good prices with a good service,” he adds, and reminds us that customers are saving in times of crisis, which is why prices are most asked by 25 euros.
A survey into various centrally located restaurants reveals that the evening of December 17 leads the providers to collapse.
The Soteras Group says that the demand for this Friday with the intention of spending less than 30 euros would be booming. The group has adapted its menus with full offers between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation.
With another leading group, Andilana, which has 16 restaurants in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the ownership of the calendar has led to preferred reservations, even from early November.
“We have made it impossible to maintain the previous year’s prices with menus for every taste from 19,95 to 30 euros,” he explains.
At AN Grup, which leads El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 locale, optimism is not lost, after the second quarter of the year, the revenue has blossomed and good, although concentrated prospects for the Christmas business are also anticipated for a few days.
Sources of the company group highlight that the 18th will also be an overactive day with groups of friends celebrating Christmas.
A Christmas menu for 30 euros or more was added to the six group menus. One has the impression that customers are willing to spend 10 percent more than in the previous year and wish more details in return, such as Cava.
Also in some companies you see green sprouts sprouting, which is why the employees are invited again. This gives the impression that the group meals are back in the upswing.
On the side of the Roof Association Fecasarm (with mergers such as Barcelona's pub, restaurant and leisure association), the deputy chairman, Enric Gomà, trusts to see the end of the tunnel and notes that the reservations are quite lively, even though the customers \"stripped out a maximum of \"
However, the fun at the celebration did not go back, no matter who pays.
Pakistan's nuclear program is a source of great concern in the United States
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons faster than any other country,
The revelations of Wikileaks confirm relations between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the North American Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department, revealed by the Wikileaks Internet portal, confirms the enormous concerns of Washington's Pakistani nuclear program.
On the basis of the clear and judicious details provided by the documents on the content of the talks and the thinking of the accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad, they reveal that cooperation between the two countries in terms of atomic security is not reinforced, but rather \"deceived\" and that the unstable Asian country produces more atomic weapons to a faster rhythm than any other country.
In particular, the peculiar nature of the Pakistani nuclear program - that the weapons are not assembled, but their individual parts are stored to make their destruction difficult in a possible attack - prepare Washington sleepless nights.
The following risks are identified by the Ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report before the visit of the former head of the National Security Council, James Jones: “The proximity of some nuclear plants to the area attacked by the Taliban, the probable scattering of nuclear material and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear material,
The large number of people who are implicated in the nuclear arsenal and rocket programs is no longer regarded by the United States, but also by Russia as out-of-the-way and reason to be careful.
“Pakistan has to appoint highly credible personnel to guard nuclear installations; due to the low level of education and culture, extremist organizations have more opportunities to advise people who are involved in nuclear or rocket programs,” said expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a meeting with his North American colleagues.
New documentation revealed by Julian Assanges Internet Portal is that the cooperation between the United States and Pakistan is decreasing in terms of nuclear distribution and the increased pace at which Pakistan produces nuclear weapons.
In May, an office of the Embassy, which describes communication with Pakistan as “frustrating,” states: “There is generally no transparency; we do not receive any answers on aid offers or they are rejected,
In another announcement, Peter Lavoy, government intelligence official for South Asia, confirms that “the economic disaster of Pakistan produces nuclear weapons as fast as no other country’s,”
During a visit by the chief army leader General Ashfaq Kayani, Ambassador Patterson asks Washington to declare to the responsible person that \"Pakistan's army has discontinued its silent support of terrorist groups\"
Hunting for Wikileaks Chef
Obama appoints a high level of responsibility for the anti-terrorism struggle to prevent new revelations.
Interpol gives a red warning about the persecution and discovery of Assange.
Everything related to Wikileaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth in which the facts can only be difficult to understand.
Yesterday, Interpol issued a \"red warning\" of Assange for the \"finding and persecution\".
However, this is not a traditional arrangement for arrest.
Besides, she's not new, she's from November 20.
It also has nothing to do with the final disclosure of over four million diplomatic documents from the United States, but with the accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian has to face in Sweden.
The lawyer of the founder of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, also assures \"the police where and how they could contact Mr Assange,
As early as the 20th century, the International Police Authority, based in Lyon, France, issued the order at Sweden's request, but it was not announced by the Swedish authorities until yesterday after receipt of the power.
The 188 Interpol countries are required to identify and find Assange in order to temporarily capture and deliver it.
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red warning, many member countries, according to the organization's statements, view the red warning as a free letter for arrest - which must be carried out by the national police - in particular if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case of Sweden and England, where Assange is likely to cease.
The proceedings outraged Assanges lawyers, who yesterday published a letter informing them that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks is willing to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities by video conference.
They also recall that Assange requested the exit from Sweden and was compared by the state lawyer, who was granted the necessary approval by the said Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Chief Security Officer of Stalin.
“This is like a hunt, not like a legal persecution,” is accused in the letter.
While the world is looking for him - and his mother is hurting his son's innocence - Assange is staying in an unknown place, but not silent.
On Monday he gave an interview to the head of Time magazine via Skype from an unspecified place. During the conversation he requested the resignation of the United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
\"If it can be demonstrated that it was responsible for the arrangement of North American diplomats who were spying on the UN and thus had violated international agreements signed by the United States, it would have to resign, he said.
His opinion was yesterday condemned by the White House Press Secretary, Robert Gibbs, who described the request for resignation as \"shrinkling and absurd\".
“I’m not sure why we should value the opinion of a type with a website,” he explained to CNN.
Obama himself has entrusted a high level of responsibility for the anti-terrorism struggle, Rusell Travers, with preventing new document disclosures.
The attempt by President Barack Obama's spokesperson to reduce the attention of Assange is contrary to the opinions expressed by conservative politicians and commentators in those days.
Congressman Peter King, who will chair the National Security Committee of the House of Representatives from January on, has asked the State Department to examine the possibility of putting Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations, to seize their funds and to track anyone who supports them or contributes to them,
Tom Flanagan, adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, had gone further, and he had to recall his statement that Assange had to be murdered.
“Obama would have to turn it into a target window and use a non-manned plane or something like that,” he said.
Those who did not apologize were Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
“Whoever was there who had information searched through the government, he was guilty of treason and everything that is not execution is too mild a punishment,” he explained to Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in the ERC with an eye-winding to the Carod Near-Sighted Peace
The Republican leader allows the party a secret vote on its existence in the office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralist government and the end of the General Assembly principle.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe to get out of the way for the twenty-seventh time of an internal riot in the ranks of those who, after the loss of 11 Members and half of the voter's votes, left the directionless ERC.
The party chairman is aware that his withdrawal threat is not enough for the former party leader Joseph Lluís Carod-Rovira. But he also knows that the influence of this sector today is as weakened as their mentor himself and will not damage him the same head break as other former currents.
Therefore, the leader of Esquerra tries to win the new critics with an eye-winding, which would secure his position up to the next municipal elections.
For the beginning yesterday, it was announced that the over 200 regional Council members of ERC could express themselves secretly about their stay in office.
With ballots, not with raised hand.
If the Carodists wanted to miss the president a penitentiary, they could do so without having to fear repression.
In fact, the chief wants to avoid the impression of division as well as that of submission among his person.
In several interviews he confirmed that he would feel unconfirmed with half of the votes plus one, and he added, without indicating percentages, a result \"in Bulgarian style\" would not be good either.
The Carod Neighbours are demanding more from the President than just making his office available to the party. An inadequate gesture, as Puigcercós controls the supreme body of congresses.
But since they do not have a sufficient majority to force withdrawals, they will agree with the Management Board a plan of action from now until May.
To this end, they expect to be able to contribute to the preparation of the document on strategic reorientation, which will be submitted to the Council on 18 May.
Their intention is to build for Puigcercós. In return, this one should promise to present the Congress in the fall of 2011, which the party leader already considers to be a fact.
The party president of the ERC believes that the “polyphony” damage of stability and he strives to enable the organisation to wash their dirty clothes behind closed doors for all time.
In this sense, the article signed by the acting Conseller Joseph Huguet in his blog is symptomatic.
In view of the fact that Puigcercós is an ideologist, the holder of Innovació considered it a fact that the party chairman was based on “in exchange for different purposes”.
He counted five, two of which are in the foreground.
First, the \"Restructuring\" of the Management Board, so that it represents at least 90 percent of the party members, that is to say the inclusion of new faces from Carod's environment.
The second could be the great novelty.
Huguet proposes that ERC should finally give up the General Assembly principle as a function.
In doing so, he undertakes a reform of the statutes which will enable Congresses to abide by elected delegates.
From the termination of the assembly model - an exception in the Spanish party system - is Puigcercós' team, which already fought at the last two congresses for how to be possessed.
In fact, at the 2008 Beneficial Assembly, party leadership was commissioned to review the General Assembly principle at a congress that was to deal with reforming the statutes.
This date is still due to the fact that information on the internal rest of the last few years has not been advisable to address this issue.
Now, without the critical sectors being at stake, the time could have come to re-emphasize this issue and conclude it forever.

China maintains its targets for reducing greenhouse gases
The representative of China, at COP16, said that his country had made huge efforts to reduce carbon savings and that it would maintain its offer to reduce 40 to 45 percent of its greenhouse gases by 2020.
China holds its offer to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, Su Wei, the representative of this country at COP16, assures.
In his first public appearance at the 16th World Climate Summit of the United Nations (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country had made huge efforts to reduce carbon traces and to change its industry.
He explained that in the last four years his country has invested $245 million to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.
On the other hand, he explained that China would not change its objectives but would work on this issue together with the international community.
He explained that the Chinese strategy on climate change is divided into four aspects: dialogue, building capacity, building institutions and supporting pilot programmes.
In all aspects, progress has been made, including the adoption of a new energy law last year, which sets out the objectives of reducing gas emissions.
On the other hand, he pointed out that in China, the authorities of the states had cooperated with those of the central state and the municipalities in order to achieve the energy saving, effective use of energy and reduction of emissions.
In addition, he argued, several multi-year plans have already been launched or completed, both those funded by the Chinese government and those received funds from other countries.
For example, he referred to the program for the effective use of energy that has been introduced over the last five years and has received investment from the United Nations (UNO), the government and from private hands.
There is also a project at provincial level on climate change, another on the exchange of traditional light bulbs through energy savings and another on the weakening and adaptation, he explained.
Martin Krol, scientific government consultant on climate change in this country, confirmed that China’s efforts were far greater than was generally accepted.
It showed that the per capita emission of greenhouse gases in China is six tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons. China is responsible for a nine-percent total contribution to pollution.
It also made unparalleled progress in the field of energy use. Energy efficiency has been increased by twenty percent over the last five years and is expected to happen by 2020, he explained.
Legal exclusion Espinos: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN stated that the former Panist party chairman had the right to turn to the National Commission of Order and demand what the right to it was.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exclusion had been Manuel Espino Barrientos' right and that the former party chairman of the PAN had the right to turn to the National Commission of Order and demand what the right granted him.
In an interview that took place as governor of the state before Gabino Cué Monteagudos appealed, he stated that the espinos exclusion was a decision made at the local level.
‘It is an independent decision of the Commission of the Rules of Procedure in Sonora,
\"Mr Espino has the right in his case to appeal to the Comisión de Orden del Consejo Nacional in order to make a decision by a competent body, he added.
On the other hand, he explained that it was not time to think about 2012 and that an alliance with the presidential candidate never sat at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Acción Nacional was strengthened by the internal vote on the next 4 and 5 December, in which his successor was elected.
“This (an alliance in 2012) is a topic that was never on the negotiating table, at least not until now. It was a prelude to the municipal election, he was successful and fulfilled his purpose - he carried out.
The Panist leader said that the PAN looks back on 71 years of dialogue, so “the internal competition is not frightening to us; on the contrary, “we enjoy it and strengthen it” he commented.
He said that the Council would undoubtedly choose the or the best chairman, Acción Nacional, for the next three years, so that he would hand over the staff to those whom the Council would determine,
“I am completely unconcerned and open. I would be proud to transfer to each of the five chairpersons’ office,
He predicted that the party's recovery in the last elections of July 4 will be reflected in the next elections, although it is not time to think about 2012.
\"Now it's about supporting Governor Gabino Cué in his task,
In this context, he pointed out that the three governments, which emerged from alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa, would carry the flag and be observed throughout the country. Therefore, “many hopes and longings are put into it and I am sure that Gabino is at the level of requirements”
When he was questioned about the critique of the PRI by President Felipe Calderón for his discourse within the framework of his four-year government, César Nava called on the PRI's supporters to reflect on the six-year period of former President Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
\"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than Fox and Calderón's, they should begin to defend them, should they finally get out of the closet, he affirmed.
He believes that the owner of the federal government has expressions like those he could make in his discourse in the Auditorio Nacional, because there would be no mouth ban in this country and even less censorship.
Obama is working in Twitter for the law to benefit undocumented students
\"If you're law for the adoption of the Dream Act, call your senators and insist on the adoption of this law, the President of the United States tweeted on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today supported national mobilization to support the Dream Act - Law on Legalization of Undocumented Students with a message on his personal blog on the social network Twitter.
“If you’re law for the adoption of the Dream Act, call your senators and insist on the adoption of this law, Obama tweeted.
His brief release contains a cyberlink to a more extensive document that calls on the public to enter into contact with their senators, as the vote of the law is imminent.
“With your voice we are waiting for, the time has come to listen to you,” he emphasizes.
The message was spread after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block all votes for any law, except the expansion of tax reductions from Bush's times and the funding of the government would be extended.
Such a blockade, which was announced on a letter signed by the 42 Republican Senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act - law and other projects such as ratification of the new START Agreement with Russia against the spread of nuclear weapons.
Regarding the blockade of the Republicans of the Dream Act and other projects, Presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he was confident that once the tax issue was resolved, a timetable for the other projects could be set up.
“I think we still have a lot of time...”
“All of us agree that tax matters must be handled before the end of the year...”
“I think we can make an agreement about it at any time and then we can plan the course of the rest,” he said.
The president of the democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that he would apply for vote at the end of the debate, so that the Dream Act - Act, with which the Legalization Initiative of Undocumented Students could be voted in the Senate from next Thursday, although the next week would be more likely.
The version of the Dream Act - Law or the Law of the American Dream would legalize about 800 000 young people who immigrated to the United States when they were not yet sixteen years old, during the last five years of life in this country and enrolled in a higher educational institution or army.
But the defendants of the law need sixy votes to adopt the initiative, which is why they are dependent on the votes of a handful of Republicans. At present, the organizations of the advocates of this project are organizing an intense influence on the adoption of the law.
Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson from Nebraska, said he would vote against it and only one Republican, Richard Lugar from Indiana, announced his support of the law.
Therefore, the defenders of the Dream Act must get several Republicans on their side if other Democrats should decide to return the initiative.
Among the most popular Republicans are Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and Senator George Lemieux from Florida, who took over the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who in the past supported the Dream Act are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they declared that they no longer support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who had spoken out for the law, John McCain, has not yet defined his attitude.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act in the Senate is facing the greatest obstacles.
Put your finger into the wound with literature
The second round of 'The Lust of Language' was a walk in which the participants made themselves strong for the narrative
“I understand that with sex in the language, but... the finger in the wound? What is expected of me, the writer Luisa Valenzuela, who was to open the second round of 'Los placeres de la lengua', asked a cycle that celebrated Spanish literature and on this occasion used the subtitle of her question (at another event the round table was dedicated to sex in the language, she explained).
The finger in the wound... “brings us into trouble,” the Argentine writer said, in sweet contrast to the audience, mainly composed of young people gathered at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to attend this round table, which was moderated by Marisol Shultz, at which Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that she devoted to Gonzalo Celorio, and then identified Shultz as a great story. Luisa tells in first person and is the protagonist who is looking to find out what a “wound” is, and goes from doctor to doctor, of whom she does not receive any answer, but is given instructions for the guide of her story.
She convinces the infectologist: “I don’t think I’m strong, maybe that’s my wound.
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the traumatologists, who took her breath in the middle of the corridor, but who explained that wound is not a scientific concept, the psychoanalyst reveals the secret: \"the wound is the real open, the symbolic is the scar,
The main character of the narrative sighs with ease and concludes that “from the wound she only learned that it is really open and doesn’t exist, but she is convinced that the desire for language and its traps mix.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a delightful narrative, which he called 'Lob of Invention', and in which the finger in the wound is not mentioned, but discovered.
With plays on magical realism, he tells of a famous magician who touched the clouds, returned far traveled men, or restored the virtue lost by a girl. The story made a turnaround and told of America, the great novel it did not lack of its own chronicles from the beginning, and he quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticized the abundance of stories told by the conquerors.
“Cervantes, who invited us all (the writers), mocked the preposterous witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as true, but in other ways, the story of America would never have been told - with the power of education that even the shame had come off -
However, he points out, “it’s the crazy and liars who imagine things the best - and there, reality and falsehood approach each other, where one no longer knows, on which side the narrative belongs, where fictional literature reaches the summit.
He actually calls this the 'Tradition Cervantes'.
\"From him we have inherited to be what is told,
When Mayra Montero was on the line, the writer commented and praised the variety of interpretations to which the FIl invitation to the round table 'The finger in the wound' had contributed.
The Cuban and Puerto Rican contributed to the great wound of social violence, which affects their country - as in Latin America - as a result of the fights against drug trafficking.
“I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a silent, not intentionally planned commitment,” she explained, after she stressed that literature is communication and commitment that builds up between the author and the readers as in a ‘chemical reaction’.
In the evening, the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose contribution was also “this finger of the dedicated writer in the wound of the writer - hevorhob.
He noted that in a fast-paced world, intellectual habits and the control of consciousness also run out of dogmatism, and will forget, “that behind every confirmation there is a small no and behind every denial a small yes”
\"In order to be in possession of our thoughts and reality, we must nuance: and nuancers often mean putting their fingers in the wound and harassing those who feel much better when they think in the form of cartoons, in black and white, in prefabricated ideas without nuances, and also harassing the powerful who prefer to divide the world into black and white, and invite them to rediscover the sense of writing.
Romano fights for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks back at three defeats in final games, he has experienced ups and downs in his career, but three times he played crucial games.
In the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the endgame, there are also two different styles, defined by their respective trainers, and their encounter marked by opposites is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back at three defeats in final games, he has experienced ups and downs in his career, but three times he has had crucial games, and so far he has kept himself well, which is why this opportunity is of particular importance to him.
The Argentine has played high with the medal as the second champion, he has remained a step behind the winners and surprisingly he has played consecutive finals with the same team.
The santist strategy reached the first final game as coach at the 'Torneo Apertura 2002', when del Morelia had the reins in his hand, with which he suffered a great defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, at the 'Clausura 2003' he reached the crucial duel, which he also lost with 3-1 against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010', in which they played against Los Diablos, Rubén had to take a backlash again, as the game with 2-2 against Los Choriceros went out undisputed after 210 minutes of play, but at the eleven-metres he came forward with 3-1 and got two ways to insert his title, but eventually three of his players missed the eleven steps and the game turned into a 4-3.
Rubén had already lost two endgames with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival. Therefore, he doesn't want to be pursued again by calamity and free himself from the evil spell to celebrate a title for the first time, although he confirms that for him the most important is the game itself.
“I want to become a champion, I don’t want to break statistics, that’s the most important thing for a club, for my affection, and that’s why the title will come to me, but what happens before is what’s going on, the tax man commented on when you ask him about the lost endgames.
The final final game has remained strong in his memory, he assures us to have learned a lot from it: “The only lesson we can draw from it is that until the judge does not end, we cannot celebrate, we are prepared on the line, the players are also, because the last time we were prepared to leave with two elf meters, and I think that this is a lesson until the game is finished, there is no occasion to celebrate “
Knowing that this series could be decided by Elfmeter shooting, he does not worry, because he trusts his players: “You never want to arrive at the Elfmeter shooting, you want to finish in the regular play time, but sometimes there is no alternative and you have to be prepared for it, in the previous tour we were prepared, but unfortunately the fate prepared us a bad game, sometimes due to nervousness or the keen desire to keep the title already in the hands, that left us something for this final game, and we hope that this time it will not come up with it,
It is in Romanso power not only to be second champion and to cost for the first time the fame that the titles bring with them.
The US changes the rules for obtaining a visa
The persons must present themselves to the consulate before the visa application service is discussed; the cost of waiting is reduced accordingly.
As of 10 January 2011, the procedures for applying for a visa in the United States Embassy and in the consulates will change.
In the new procedure, most applicants must present themselves to the visa application services (ASC, the initial letters in English) prior to their consultation in the consulate.
The staff of the ASC shall record the biometric data of the applicant, which shall be reviewed by the consulate before the interview.
The new procedure has certain advantages for the aspirants, including:
The total cost of handling the visa is reduced, as it is no longer necessary to pay separately the deadline, the processing of the visa request and the transport service with which the document is handed out.
The applicant shall make only one payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the counterparty to 140 dollars for a tourist visa, 150 dollars for visas with application (including visas for time workers) and 390 dollars for hands and investors.
Those who only want to extend their visa do not have to talk to the consulate, they only have to imagine themselves at the nearest ASC, where they are presenting their documents and their fingerprints are taken.
As the biometric data is collected in the ASC, applicants who need a second date for consultation in the Consulate remain there less time than before.
Those applying for the visa in the consulates of Ciudad Chihuahua, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo no longer have to pay the service charge of $26.

NASA announces the find of extraterrestrial life
The North American Space Agency called for a press conference to introduce a finding tomorrow that will have an impact on the search for living beings in all.
The United States National Aviation and Space Authority (NASA) announces tomorrow, Thursday, an astronomical discovery that could confirm the theory of extraterrestrial life.
The find will be presented tomorrow at a press conference in NASA's Washington headquarters by experts in astrobiology, which will be a science that investigates the origin, development, distribution and future of life in the universe.
When the press conference was convened, NASA assured that it would present \"a supervisory find for the search for extraterrestrial life\", which triggered speculation among experts from other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that human-like creatures can exist in hostile environments that were previously considered to be invincible. The hypothesis was raised that they could turn into intelligent living beings - like humans - if their living conditions improved.
It is apparently a microbe found on the base of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California. It lives there in an environment that has been considered too toxic for all conceivable life forms since the lake is highly arsenal.
In some way, the microbie uses the arsenic as a survival resource. Taking this ability into account, the chances increase that there might be similar lives on other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere.
When these organisms metabolize the arsenic, it has been demonstrated, according to the astrobiologists, that there is, in fact, another form of life, a second form of life that differs from that known to us,
The space agency will announce the actual reach of their find at the press conference tomorrow, Thursday.
At the conference, the geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who investigates the possibility of life on Mars, and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (the largest moon of Saturn) under the question of whether its chemical composition resembles Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón form an opposition block
With the reform of the organ law on Congress, the two-party system will be introduced, they complain.
The 60th legislative period had just begun, and already an opposition block was installed, led by the members of PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who presented themselves as independent. The four questioned the introduction of the 'two-party system' into the Chamber.
Before the opening session in the 60th legislature period, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of PRD and Patrón Montalvo protested the reform of the organ law, as they would be excluded from it.
With this reform, they repeated, a 'two-party system' would be introduced, because now there would be two people, the same number as parties who controlled Congress.
These four members, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the Bureau appointed by the Panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca in his capacity as Deputy Chairman.
Corvera Quevedo said that the PRI and PAN parties had institutionally introduced their political stance with these reforms.
He argued that in the next few days they would speak with the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme. In doing so, they were out of their political will and if they did not, they would again be unjustified by both parties, thus ending the opposition coalition.
“I come here (the opposition coalition), that is what I see, because we are excluded from all decisions, which do not even take into account the opinion of the others,
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia explained that there were similarities with PRD, PT and Patrón and that therefore a pluralist group would be formed.
It cannot be admitted, he continued, that after being monopolistic, the Congress should now be \"duopolistic\".
“It is not the spirit of the reform of law that an eternal two-party system should prevail in Congress,
\"For the beginning, this group begins with five Members and talks with other colleagues so that they can become more and more\", said the Convergencia Member.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from PT led in an opening to PAN and PRI that the Congress had at present turned into a 'beech' for two.
\"Before that, it was only one party, now they divide up the two too secondly,
Patrón Montalvo asked to respect the Members and to give them their place in the negotiating table.
\"The five who are currently seen as being split into different groups have decided to unite in order to take our place at the negotiating table because of the reform carried out by the others and we have not agreed to this reform,
200 000 peso more for \"the supplier\"
Mazatlán City Administration pays another check to the controversial owner of the company for electrical material.
Another check over a little over 200 000 Peso in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the city administration.
Thus, the sum paid to the owner of the electrical material company in the second half of the year is 1 200 000 pesos.
According to the page for more transparency of the city administration, this check was issued to an amount of 200,144,56 peso with number 9258447 last 16 November with the purpose of calculating open invoices.
The treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had already predicted that more money would go from the municipality to this supplier. It is observed by the Auditoría Superior del Estado because it sells at higher prices.
What has not been mentioned is the total amount that is still owed to it and as a result the number of checks that are still being issued in favor of Camacho Palazuelos.
“There was nothing purchased from her, it’s just going to pay off the debts, as well as from the other suppliers,” he said in an interview.
The last checks again took place in the last quarter of the year: September 24th, October 15th, October 19th, October 29th and last of November 16th.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal, as required by law, when a company is questioned by the ASE to prevent other administrations from applying for their services, the treasurer assured that their services would not be used again.
After the Noroeste newspaper published on July 25 the examination of the checks issued by the City Administration to its suppliers, it was announced that from March 2008 until July 9, 2010, during the three-year term of mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez had paid the municipality over 10 million pesos with 42 cheques to Camacho Palazuelos.
There were also shops with Jumapam, where they included cheques worth over 3 million peso.
Tourist places must be improved
Tourist companies regret the accident of the foreign tourist due to the poor condition of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in the fall of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, Mazatlán's tourism industry asked the authorities to pay special attention to the areas in poor condition and a poor picture of the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, chairman of the Zona Dorada Dealer Association, reminded us that on different occasions it was required to maintain the destination and to transform the bad conditions that tourists face into new employment opportunities or routes.
He said that the bad condition of the streets and highways would have had a negative effect, as tourists would come to slump and see the disorder that would cause them to turn their backs on the nearby shops.
“Politicians don’t know what it means to close a company one day and they don’t think about how much money you lose, because otherwise they wouldn’t carry out the construction work in this way slowly and planlessly,
Hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the tourist's overthrow would have brought attention to the lack of prevention and the remaining maintenance work on the side of the city.
“The community must take responsibility and avoid that happening again. How to do this? Well, through preventive maintenance instead of improving everything afterwards, he explained.
“We are longing to have a clean city. Not only because it is a tourist area, it must be maintained, we residents also have a right to a clean living space. The city’s administration must change its strategy to maintain the city in good condition.
\"There are other places that also look unaccustomed and unfinished, he said, \"for example, el Escudo y el Venadito of Mazatlán\"
“Today we need more than just advertising to attract tourists. It must be offered a good product, a city that cleans its beaches and streets, and keeps tourist attractions constantly in ruins,” he added.
“These precautions have not been given enough attention and this kind of incidents are just what is obvious to all: Maintenance is urgently needed “
Raúl Llera Martínez, Under Secretary-General of Promoción Turística, expressed the importance of saving the tourist places of Mazatlán because they would not be used properly and created a bad image.
He mentioned a number of places that, together with the city, would have to be brought to the fore. The city should be designed clean, orderly and attractive for tourism.
\"Unfortunately, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites, which must first be cleaned up and cleaned up in order to make them attractive for tourism and to introduce them to the inventory we are buying for this destination.
IP calls for results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of the CCE, suggested that Members take the great responsibility of giving an example of a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
The Mazatlán business sector demands a worthy parliament, free from agreements between the parties and the government, because Sinaloa is upset and faces major problems.
The 60th Parliament was inaugurated yesterday. It consists of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 of PAN, three of Partido Nueva Alianza, two of PRD, one of PT, one of Convergencia and one of PVEM. This makes a total of 40 people representatives.
The new members of the State Congress are expected to do a clean job, feel committed to society and to different social groups, who are dependent on responsible parliamentary work, and that they do not repeat the same patterns of partiality and paternalism.
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of CCE Entrepreneurial Coordination Council, suggested that the new Members should take on the great responsibility of giving an example of a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
\"We hope that Members will really exercise their right to act freely from agreements between the parties, because it is customary for them to make agreements with which they represent their own interests, thus transforming themselves into carnival comics of the governors and the leaders of the parliamentary groups,
He said that they should demonstrate their commitment to building the necessary bridges to support the current government.
“We take care that they do a trustworthy job and work for society and its groups in the first place, because they were the residents of Sinaloa who expressed their trust in the last elections,
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, chairman of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, believes that one of the major challenges faced by the 40 people's representatives is the drive and the joint work for the economic growth of the state, since today the economic situation is extremely complicated.
\"The most important thing is to encourage economic growth, encourage investment and infrastructure, which will promote job creation in any way,
With regard to the tourism sector, he called on the new Members to give the necessary status in the state budget in order to promote the Ministry of Tourism.
\"I have understood that it is the Ministry with the second least resources, which is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings foreign exchange and investment into the country and is in direct competition with the agro-industry,
The tourist projects must be allocated funds, the state security must be supported and the alcohol law, which has not been re-established during previous legislative periods, needs to be updated.
Holy King Seeking
Dolls, cars, bicycles and other toys the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family longed for.
It will be difficult for parents to meet these wishes on the next three-kingly day, because the budget is no more than 12 people and a goat-bock.
Nevertheless, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not give up the hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar will give them the toys and clothes they so long for.
The family lives in a modest house in the settlement Salvador Allende. They live by hand in the mouth, because the father has no firm work.
“Sometimes hard times are said because my husband doesn’t have a job. But we sell Mandarins and potatoes... Even in the afternoon I go to the street with the gören for sale,” said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
The four-year-old Adelaida would like to have a doll or a bicycle, while her three-year-old sister Isabel wants a barbie doll.
For some time now, ten-year-old José Alfredo has wanted a 'Monsterwagen' and for his eight-month-old brother Jesús, Cayetana, proposes clothing in size for one-year-olds.
“ (José Alfredo) said to me, ‘I would have liked this monster’, but I replied to him, ‘Let’s wait, boy’ because it was very expensive - Cayetana remembered sadly.
For the older children who were in school, clothing and shoes would be ideal.
Eleven-year-old María Guadalupe has the size 12; ten-year-old Isaías has the size 10, during the eight-year-old Miguel size 8.
The 14-year-old José Juan lacks tennis shoes. A pair in size 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you want to help realize the dreams of the Coronado Valenzuela children, you can participate in the campaign 'Holy King is sought' by spending a toy or cash in the reception hall of the newspaper Noroeste.
14 suspected drug dealer arrested
On Wednesday, as part of the destruction of a production and sales network of cannabis, around ten house searches were carried out in the Estrie administrative region.
Forty-four persons were arrested and will be charged with various charges.
The house searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, where places should have served mainly drug production.
“About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, cash and equipment serving production have been confiscated, ” said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman of Quebec Security Police.
A total of 11 men and three women were arrested, two of whom were from Sherbrooke.
The arrested persons will have appeared in Sherbrooke hours after their arrest.
They could, among other things, be accused of the production of cannabis, its possessions for sale, the plot and the service of crimes.
These house searches had resulted in a lengthy investigation that took place for over a year.
“The information received from public authorities has enabled us to carry out these arrests, specified by M. Ruel.
About 70 police officers from the Estrien Regional Investigation Unit of the Quebec Security Police, Sherbrooke Police Service and Memphis Police Department participated in this police operation.
Secret immigration could easily be pursued
The draft law of the Conservatives, according to the government, will deal with the problem of vessels loaded with secret immigrants, and it will be hoped that the three opposition parties will have announced on Wednesday that they will not be able to support the proposal.
\"I strongly oppose this charter,
“I hold up with a party that has laid your hands on you,” said Michael Ignatieff, head of the Liberals, in front of the delegates after the weekly Caucus session.
The Liberals claimed that the draft law, which allows to hold for up to a year any person identified as a ship for the transport of illegal immigrants, violates the Canadian Constitution of Law and Freedom, as suggested.
Gilles Duceppe, head of the Bloc Québécois, also indicated that he could not support the draft law because he opposed the wrong target group.
“We’re against it, and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we’ll wait for what the government is doing,” said M. Duceppe.
The criticism of Olivia Chow's immigration issue, NDP, has turned the critics out of the hands who demand that their party did not behave steadfastly enough to the secret immigrants.
\"The neo-democrats agree to take action against the blind passengers, and this is exactly what we are trying to enforce by passing another draft law, the C-35, Chow stated.
We therefore do not support the Conservatives' draft law because it seeks the blame for refugees and keeps children imprisoned for at least a year - explained Chow.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties of playing with politics and ignoring Canadians' will.
\"The Canadians strongly inform Members that they do not tolerate this kind of secret immigration, these criminal acts affecting Canada and treating the country as a footman,
\"They expect Canada to take tough action, according to Minister Kenneys' reaction.
\"The government has not announced any vote of confidence in its draft law, which could have led the country to elections which the government would have rejected.
A conservative, however, said to the QMI agency that the government would call for a vote so that any opposing Members would immediately explain themselves to their voters.
The new unit finds no unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a new, standing unit to fight corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the formation of a public investigation committee on this issue.
Robert Dutil, Minister of Public Security, claims that this idea did not come from yesterday: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this issue last January.
The metropolis has had a standing unit against corruption since 1870.
Nevertheless, the announcement of Wednesday has more than one surprise.
It must be said that this measure was not least discussed at the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Quebec Police Service on 29 October last year despite the presence of Robert Dutils.
Nor was it missing that Stéphane Bergeron, critic and member of the Québécois party, qualified this announcement in terms of public security as a solution \"made by the hat enchanted rabbit, as well as \"rightly crafted at a table end\".
In turn, Minister Dutil had turned to those who feared that political power had too much influence on the future unity in question.
“They will see the result when we announce it, ” he pleased to confirm.
\"One is aware of this problem\"
According to Réjean Parent, the President of the CSQ, nothing can replace the conduct of a public survey.
“The more Mr. Charest insists on preventing the formation of this committee of inquiry, the more people like you and I think he has something to hide,” he explained.
“The only means of forming an investigation committee is the resignation of Jean Charest,” said Yves Boisvert, lecturer for ethics and policy systems at the ENA (state college for the training of senior administrative officers).
In order to get out of this dead end, he proposes to Quebec that financial audit control be given a special mandate so that it can conduct research on corruption and secret agreements accordingly.
“One should be able to extend the mandate of audit control,” he decided.
He also believes that Quebec's audit could grant the same power as Commissioners, which would also allow her to commit the people to the statement.
The formation of a standing unit is not the only project in the Charest government drawers.
Quebec is also required by Ottawa to amend the criminal law in order to be better exposed to this kind of crime.
This request comes from the Chief Attorney of Operation Marteau, who informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law in this type of prosecution is not clear.
Vic Toews, Minister of State for Public Security, confirmed his colleague of Justice, Rob Nicholson, who is currently dealing with certain novelties concerning this matter.
During the Operation Printemps 2001, which involved the groups of motorcycle police, 131 persons had been arrested, although the criminal law had not been revised.
Ottawa has, as a result, enforced the law against gangsterdom.
Rivers under strict surveillance
Several river runs remain under strict surveillance due to the high rainfalls that have occurred in some regions of the province since Tuesday.
In Shawinigan, in the Mauricie administrative region, a drought occurred on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses were evacuated preventively.
In the evening another drought occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the Lanaudiere administrative region.
A road is sunk together.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, strong rainfalls of from 40 to 70 milliliters have caused rainfall in several regions.
Between 20 and 40 millimetres of rainfall were expected here according to the regions until Thursday evening.
The areas north of the river and the valley of the Outaouais region were most affected.
There were up to 100 millimetres of rain showers down here.
Since the snow melt, which has already accumulated in certain sub-areas, has been added to these rainfalls, it is feared that the crossing of several watercourses will occur.
On Wednesday evening, warnings were issued by the Quebec Security Service on the flood alarm concerning the rivers Ouareau and Achigan in the Lanaudiere region.
The rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentine mountains and the Chêne in Lotbinière will be the object of flood surveillance and will continue to be observed.
In the Lanaudière region, the violent defeats have led to the crossing of several lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and also in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte an escape bridge was pulled away due to the heavy rainfall.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais the crossing of certain lakes has caused the closure of several roads, especially in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The security service continues to be alert and closely monitoring the situation, says Security Councillor Annik Bouchard.
On Wednesday, the Quebec State High Water Centre issued warnings of the strong rise of several rivers, in particular by Maskongé, Assumption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partly justified
The Quebec Radio Moderator Stéphane Dupont has suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Supervisory Board for Radio Standards (CCNR) because of his controversial statements about social welfare and Haitian, as well as because of his outspoken speech about radio.
Although the CCNR is of the opinion that M. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team would have the right to express their own views, certain statements would have contained some inaccurate information about the social welfare and unfair negative representations of Haitians as well as a sort of unbridled manner of speech which is not appropriate to the broadcasts broadcasts broadcast during the day.
The Supervisory Board also concluded that a discussion of suicide involving the dissemination of the names of two persons who committed suicide violates the code of broadcasting.
The CCN had received several complaints concerning the comments made during the 2008 and 2010 broadcasts.
The first order was filed as a result of a complaint by the \"Front Communon des persones asistées sociales du Quebec\" (Front communé des persones asistées sociales du Quebec).
The activist organisation complained that the amounts mentioned in the consignment were uncertain.
Moderators should provide solid information rather than misleading information.
Regarding the subject of suicide, Moderator Stéphane Dupont had expressed the view that suicide is an expression of cowardice.
The majority of the Supervisory Board members had concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life crises.
‘The majority of the Supervisory Board takes into account that the relevant consequences of the broadcast ‘Dupont le midi’ have been a sensitive issue in a family-oriented and appropriate manner,
Therefore, he was not tried against his person.
The last point of dispute was the statements related to the Haiti earthquake.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had provided a media-effective discussion that caused a lot of reactions.
The CHOI Moderator had declared not to have donated in favor of Haiti aid, as one did not know with certainty whether the needy would really receive the money donations.
The Supervisory Board believes that these comments have not been abusive characters, but that their cumulative effect presents an unfair negative representation of Haitians.
\"I have already spent my three-day suspension sentence in this matter,
“My file has been virgin for one and a half years,” said the moderator.
In all decisions, the Supervisory Board recommends the dissemination of an unbridled form of expression.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM has acted as broadcasters on behalf of its obligations.
The consequences for the broadcaster, who, among other things, had to communicate his decisions once during the main broadcasting period within a period of three days, are minor.
A King of the Kung Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, Montreal Algerian origin, has taken a very special course.
The athlete, who excels in “Sanda” (full Kung-Fu contact), kickboxing and Thai boxing, is now looking for new challenges to the Tatami and the boxing rings of the world.
“I started combat sports such as Kung-Fu and Kickboxen 12 years ago in Algeria,” said Zemal, who has been based in the metropolis since 2008 to develop among the professionals.
I personally seek the fight of all sorts, because for those who do not like the ground fight, as the mixed martial arts present to him, competitions in North America are rare,
Recently, the security officer of his sign, as well as the company UPS, had given bad news to his rivals, in which he won two gold medals from the World Karate and the Kickboxing Association (WKA) at the world championship held between 23 and 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland.
“I have won the victory in the categories of full-contact kickboxing and Thai boxing,” he explained.
“I am preparing for the World Cup in San Shou in China at this time,
“Those fighters were invited from every category who had placed themselves among the first four in the last World Championship,
“I babe 2009 in Toronto bronze -
“I went back to Vietnam in 2005,”
“I finished the tournament in China in the fifth place in 2007, while I was third in Toronto in 2009, he added.
\"It is worth mentioning that I have made progress in every competition,
\"With this rhythm I will become first this time or next year,
\"San Shou\" or \"Sanda\" are disciplines originating in China, in which fists and footings as well as ground throws are permitted.
The two fights usually play on a platform, rarer in a box ring.
The most renowned box fighter that emerged from this type of combat sport is the American Vietnamese origin Cung Le, which is well known in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal only kept a single event in his career, he would certainly call his presence at the Super Tournament “King of Sanda” the Super Bowl of the Kung-Fu.
“This competition is the highest ranking and most respected in China,” said the sympathetic Poundskerl.
“It’s a bit like the equivalent to the stadium Lumpinee ( Thailand’s largest stadium).
\"This was a great experience,
Zemmal had won his first battle in the semi-finals of his category (80kg) before he lost in the finale.
“The one who defeated me was a real professional, so he analyzed.
‘There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg).’
\"The winners of the semi-finals meet each other in the finale of their category\"
“Then the winners of each category offer themselves the forehead to crown a single champion, the king of the Kung-Fu,
450 million in contracts without tender
In mutual agreement, Hydro-Québec has approved project planning companies for 450 million dollars in contracts for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydropower project.
A consortium consisting of the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor has received the most important share, namely that of the project management, to a sum of $295 million without tendering.
This consortium, called 'Energie gerance', was formed in 2004 as a companion to the decision of Hydro-Québec, the private sector to give its responsibility to this important hydroelectric project amounting to a sum of $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium, Energie Gerance, entered into the lucrative contract without a public tender.
For the Québécois party, the withdrawal of corporate consortia is a serious ethical problem that raises the risk of distortion of competition and a price increase.
\"This is a new way of playing a carded game and is a challenge to competition,
“This means that instead of playing cards, you are now performing in an open form in a secret way,” said Sylvain Simard, a PQ member at the press conference, yesterday.
In the early morning, Simard had raised the question before the National Assembly, as it seems difficult to understand how the interest of the public can be served in this way.
Minister of Resources Nathalie Normandeau had responded in the afternoon by vehemently agreeing that this contract had dealt with a carded game.
“I remained faithful to my line,” she watered, affirming that the PQ was “unreasonable,” and“missing her of hardness”
She said it was the minimum that the PQ apologized for.
The consortium's model is common practice worldwide.
This is usually a temporary alliance, which allows two or more companies to pool their expertise with regard to a bid for an invitation to tender for a complex project.
The project, Eastmain, has a high level of complexity with regard to its extent of work.
The construction process is underway and is scheduled to be established by 2012.
Nevertheless, the treaty was awarded without the possibility of a competitive struggle; negotiations had already taken place.
In addition, the model of the consortium in Quebec itself is no longer an exception in relatively simple projects.
As the newspaper Le Devoir noted last week, the model of the consortium, applied in the field of civil engineering and consulting, is the subject of government grants.
A short fleeting of the Quebec company register allows more than 200 consortia to be named, some of which seem to be of permanent duration.
In this way, for example, the company Dessau works in partnership with the majority of its core competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or Roche and Tecsult.
Any link, and of these there are several dozen, leads back to one and the same legal person, namely Dessau.
Regarding the consortium énergie gerance, Minister Normandeau emphasised that \"the territory of the Baie James is subject to a special labour force dynamic and that Hydro-Québec has taken this fact into account in a special way since the 1970s,
Réal Laporte, the great employer of Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has made a statement that the nose has been trampled on the fact that the contract on project management has been approved after agreement.
“If you make a tender and there are only a few applicants, your prices will be up fast”
“You have two possibilities: either you take the people who are on this mart and tell you: you will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price,” you say.
“The idea, however, is that not the price is crucial, but the facts of the persons - confirmed Laporte.
This contract granted to the consortium, Énergie Gerance, is part of a long list of contracts over more than 50,000 dollars received from the Québécois party.
The contracts were approved by either the Hydro-Québec or the SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After review, the newspaper \"Le Devoir\" counted more than 100 engineering and consulting contracts, which were approved by companies or their branches, especially resource laboratories, between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had entered into 22 contracts, Génivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without having to take part in \"Energie gerance\".
All these contracts have been negotiated.
They total 449 783 344, including the contract with \"Energie gerance\" over $295 131 564.
Sylvain Simard had reported that the four companies forming the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) were probably known by the party libéral du Quebec.
Minister Normandeau had complained that the PQ was equally associated with the companies that they had \"financed\" before it specified that it was rather their managers.
Barometers responsible consumption - The \"green\" label is not reliable
Greener, but unwelcome skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has little confidence in the main actors of sustainable growth, but also little in the marked brands or eco-labels to control his choice.
Damage, even though it bathes in a media-effective universe, where it only throws away from information in favor of a more responsible consumption: the barometer of responsible consumption has a lack of credible information to complain, an inadequacies that makes itself known as a brake on its commitment, as the first reading that was held yesterday.
Although they have driven the consumption of the so-called socially compatible products in 2010, the Quebecers still seem to be trying to sell them less credit.
Two thirds of the Quebec population admit that, in fact, they have little faith in the environmental commitment of the companies as well as in green company advertising, the measuring instrument developed by the responsible consumer centre of Sherbrooke University has been abandoned.
Another finding: half of consumers doubt the trustworthiness of official certificates attached to the supposedly fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands, which declare themselves to be environmentally conscious, says the barometer.
Following the same pattern, the politicians' discourse on this issue is taken seriously by only 14.6% of the Quebec population.
However, information on responsible consumption seems important to stimulate this segment of consumption, which is currently alive by almost one-third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, empty and doubtful nature of the information dampened the zeal of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the barometer after the higher price of the products.
In addition, a third of the Quebecers are suspicious of the stated performance of the green products and services they are seeking to lay their hands on.
According to another communication, over half of consumers had already changed their habits in 2010, mainly changing the brand of one or more products in order to express their conviction.
According to Barometer, they had also preferred 61% purchases from merchants of their district and favored the purchase of food grown in their region.
Greener and more responsible - the index of environmentally conscious consumption had reached a 64 of the maximum value of 100 this year - the Homo consumer of Quebec loves to present himself as king of recycling, who tries to reduce his traces left in the environment by caring for animal welfare.
But social and environmental awareness still seems to stand in front of his car, the barometer says: just 28% of Quebecers have indicated using public transport in 2010 or prefering the railway station to demonstrate their ecological interest.
The access and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of participants in this comprehensive behavioural survey who fed the cliché performances.
State bond for the acquisition of eXcentres
The Quebec Government, which was invited by Société Angus and Parallèle to participate financially in the acquisition of the eXcentris cinema complex, agrees to cooperate, but only in the form of a competitive bond.
The developer company Angus and the company Parallèle, which had hoped to make a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to take over the eXcentris cinema complex belonging to Daniel Langlois on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent, in order to re-responsive it to its actual cinematic function, do not seem to receive what they requested.
Although the government has accepted to involve itself in this matter, on its own terms.
Instead of the anticipated donation, the Quebec Government offers a loan lower than the initially expected amount, which could create a viable solution to favourable conditions, at least in the opinion of the sources from the state rumour kitchen.
A first action plan and a request for 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, and the request for a bite has been corrected to the bottom again.
A proposal along with an action plan was already sent by the president of the “Société de développement des entreprises kulturalles” (SODEC), François Macerola, to Minister St-Pierre, who is head of the eXcentres Act.
Several days ago he had her send a final report.
However, the counter-proposal of the Cabinet was sent to the SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallèle and Angus now have until 31 December time to respond to them.
In any case, the premise of the state donation seems to have really been pushed to the side.
Let us remember that the Quebec owner community of cinemas and cinema complexes had opposed a direct state investment in support of the acquisition of eXcentris by presenting the argument that the Minister of Culture had no financial assistance for real estate projects there that he had not allowed other cinema halls to reach.
However, several other market participants in the segment claimed substantial economic assistance in contrast.
After the self-financed design of the cinema, director Daniel Langlois had presented the author's cinema in the premises of his cinema complex for over ten years under great difficulty, which could justify the exception of the state fund.
The lack of cinema halls showing independent films is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew how to keep his clientele at the bar.
The Société Angus and the Parallèle company, with Christian Yaccarini at the top, are charging a privately funded campaign, of which they expect a sum of $700,000 to boost the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, only one screen continues to show films in eXcentris, namely Le Parallèle.
The goal of the future acquirer is to reopen the three cinema halls on 27 February next year with the presentation of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvois-Des hommes et des dieux.
Christian Yaccarini, however, has not called down the newspaper Le Devoir and ignored what he and his group think of the proposals that were corrected down to them.
The secret of the complex-shocked Canada is revealed
The new American diplomat lines, which were disseminated by WikiLeaks, revealed the secret of what the United Nations considers to be the inferiority of the Canadians to the Americans, but with the same blow, they reveal the superiority of the latter to Canada.
Consequently, the American diplomats are amazed that the Canadian electorate does not have Canadian-American relations in mind during the election, and they believe that President Obama's visit would have helped the conservative government to enforce its 2009 budget!
The four new communications between the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were publicly distributed yesterday, offer even more picant details than the mere substantial content on which one has to kneel.
A link dated 22 September 2008, i.e. during the period in which the federal electoral campaign was in full swing, reports on the point from which the United Nations no longer participates in the efforts discussed by its political leaders.
To the great amazement of David Wilkins, the American ambassador used in Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins offers various explanations of this situation.
\"One of the Canadians, almost inhabitant inferiority complex, may well cause Canadian, political leaders to talk much more about internal issues of everyday life than to push the United States to black Peter in this election (such as the Free Trade Campaign in 1988), he describes.
The United Nations, he concludes, is thus “the proverbial Goliath of this choice: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to speak of it,
The ambassador understands this \"early silence\" all the less, as the two countries have intense political and economic relations.
“Logistically, he assessed, “it should be the ability of a candidate, a party and much more of a party leader to lead such an essential relationship, which the electorate has in mind as a key factor in the process,
The other expression of this feeling of importance is the announcement sent by Terry Breese, Managing Director in Ottawa, on January 22, 2009, that President Barack Obama will prepare Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
\"Your trip will help to ensure the continued existence of the government in the vote of confidence over the federal budget in early February, where Canada will announce its first deficit after more than a decade, which has been created by a 30 to 40 billion dollar auction programme, describes Breese.
Nowhere did he mention that the government had to postpone the parliamentary session before Christmas in order to prevent Parliament from falling off the coalition and thus the continued existence of the opposition parties would have had an impact on the quality of the proposed revival programme.
Another communication, dated January 2008, written by the Ambassador Wilkins, agrees with Washington's increasingly negative image that the dramatic series broadcast by the United States via CBC.
The ambassador is alarmed by broadcasts such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which there are little subtle recordings of Maher Arar, the No-Fly list, or even abductions for the purpose of muscle prots carried out by the CIA.
Another communication again reports in detail on how Hillary Clinten asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner at their first bilateral meeting whether Europe was willing to take certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner should have answered the question with yes, but on the basis of an individual ‘fall on case’ decision.
At the end of the meeting, he said, \"he handed out a paper to the Secretary of State in puncto Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim Canadian origin,
‘The Secretary of State has promised to review the act,
Finally, let us remember that the mothers are heating up WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper very close counsellor, had explained through CBC that the person responsible for this massive leak should be \"conducted\".
He had been here referring to Mike Huckabe from the United States.
Global plan for the renewal of lighting
Yesterday in Cancun, the UN has proposed a plan to renew the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries in order to achieve a reduction in greenhouse gas (FCKW), which corresponds to nearly one third of the additional reduction that needs to be realized in order to stabilize the Earth's climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its position in the steps of concrete major projects that the UN hopes to implement in Cancun in order to compensate for the absence of mandatory reduction commitments by the industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, the main problem would be avoided in the form of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of the FCKW issued on the ground due to lighting if the white-flowering pears, which are still a 50 to 70% monopoly on the market, would be replaced by fluorescent or better, LEDs.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This corresponds to an equivalent of 70% of the exhaust gases of the global fleet.
Last year, in Copenhagen, the major exhaust emitters, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed themselves to voluntary reduction plans to cut global FCKW emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, it was necessary to withdraw 5 Gt from this balance sheet in order to stabilize the climate increase by 2 degrees Celsius from today to 2020 in order to prevent this from being out of control.
In the white-glossed pears, 95% of the energy escapes in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce the light.
With the compact light bulbs, energy consumption decreases by 75%, with the new LED bulbs, this energy requirement is again reduced by twofold.
The compact light bulbs keep on average between 6000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those brought to the market by the manufacturer Philips this week - this company, by the way, has participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a white bulb, which gives an indication of the savings possibilities of the exchange plan to be applied in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that your completely new bulbs give off very little heat, they can also work with a rule resistance.
And they do not contain any mercury.
Several specialists have indicated that compact light bulbs have reserves, as they contain mercury and therefore have to be disposed of as special waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, except the producers provide an acceptance body.
However, according to the report, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the compact light bulbs, but rather the coal power plants, which emit much more mercury to produce the electricity wasted by the white-glossed pears.
In the United States alone, these coal power plants emit 25,000 tonnes of mercury annually.
The report details the profits that each country would generate thanks to this international programme.
Indonesia, for example, would save one billion dollars annually in the purchase of electricity and eight million tons of CO2, which means an equivalent of 3.5 coal power plants, the construction of which would cost 2.5 billion.
Ivory coast awaits with excitement the announcement of election results
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon called for the publication of the results of the presidential election of the Côte d'Ivoire immediately after their expiry.
\"The Secretary-General stressed the need of the independent Electoral Commission to obtain its work and to announce the provisional results without further delay, a press spokesperson of the UN Head of State or Government.
\"It asks all parties and institutions of the Côte d'Ivoire to prove their responsibility and to include each initiative until the provisional results are announced,
Despite the pressure exerted by certain foreign governments, the Electoral Commission had the deadline set on Wednesday at midnight three days after the election on Sunday without publishing the results.
About forty minutes before the expiry of the deadline, the President of the CEI had confirmed on television that the Commission would \"continue working\" to announce the results.
On Wednesday many calls from around the world have become loud, but CEI may finally call out the name of the winner of the second round of elections under Laurent Gbagbo and his opponents Alassane Ouattara.
The Gbagbo camp, however, expects the cancellation of 'defraud' votes in the north by the Constitutional Council, which was achieved by the Ex-Rebellion Camp of the Forces novelles (FN) during the coup failed in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, head of the Ivory Coast presidential campaign, had confirmed that by the UN, the maneuvers to intimidate voters in the north of the country had deterred the President's supporters to the election.
The whole election could be cancelled if the complaints filed by Gbagbo were taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
However, the Gbagbo counterparts now feel that the highest court of the country is not neutral, as he is led by Paul Yao N'Dré, a politically closely linked with Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man of the north who rejects any connection with the ex-rebels, has considered the delay in announcing the election results as \"unacceptable\" and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, even if he has not gone so far as to demand victory.
His alliance parties confirm that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results as he knows he has lost; and filing a complaint before the Constitutional Court after the electoral commission has been prevented from publishing the results is illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections on Sunday was held for the coronation of the unification and reconciliation process of a country which had been divided into two parts for years.
On Wednesday, the United Nations had warned the Ivory Coast politicians that they could be held responsible for this in case of possible outcries.
Laurent Gbagbo had the first round of elections on 31 October with 38% of the votes against the 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who received the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment in France remained stable in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France, as defined by the International Labour Office (IAA) in the metropolis, is at stable 9.3% (including the overseas department at 9.7%), shows the provisional seasonally adjusted data published on Thursday by the Federal Statistical Office of Insee.
The unemployment rate in the metropolis is 2.631 million.
The figures for the second quarter amounted to 9.3% of the working population in the metropolis and 9.7% including the overseas department.
Over the year, the unemployment rate recorded an increase of 0.1 percentage points.
The French metropolis had not been employed by 3.4 million workers in the third quarter, but wished to find a job, including whether they were able to use every two weeks or not or whether they were looking for work or not.
The situation of young people in the labour market has continued to worsen with an increase in the unemployment rate of 24.2% in the metropolis (+ 0.9 percentage points within three months, +0.5 percentage points over the year) and 25% involving overseas regions.
In the third quarter, 637.000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed according to the IAA.
Seniors have seen a slight increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropolis (+0.2 percentage points over three months as well as over the year), i.e. 482 000 in over 50 years of age, 6.6% involving the overseas departments.
Only the 25-49 year olds could benefit from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 percentage point over three months, +0.1 percentage points over one year) and 8.8% in France as a whole.
After an examination of its calculation procedures, the Federal Statistical Office of Insee has no longer published monthly unemployment figures since 2006.
Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, continues to use this method and announced on Tuesday a 9.8% quota in France for October (included by the overseas departments) compared with 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini accused and arrested
Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a disposal company and brother of the President of the General Council of the Bouches-du-Rhône region (PS), was launched an investigation procedure and he was transferred to Luynes near Aix-en-Provence in the course of an investigation concerning the public and suspected markets.
Alexandre Guérini was accused of underprivileged company assets, violation of general property, healing, mediation in corruption, illicit bribery and weapons ownership, according to his lawyer.
“Alexandre Guérini is ready to fight and has the task of expressing himself on all questions that the prosecutor will ask him, instead of spreading brain-spinned,
“It is easy to submit to him a number of criminal charges, another thing is to prove them,” said his lawyer Florence Rault of the AFP (Agency France Press) before hearing his client.
Mr Guérini, brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first man of the PS (Parti Socialists) in the department, had insisted on giving the judge a memorandum to his justification before his hearing by means of his lawyers.
A relative of Guérinis, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and imprisoned on Wednesday evening.
According to lawyer Lucien Simon, her client had never done anything different than keeping his deposit he had to lead.
As far as the business competence area or the target location of the associated funds is concerned, he would never have known, according to Simon.
In this affair, Daniel Pinna, former Director General of the Public Service of the Aubagne Ballroom, was also charged on Wednesday for failure and complicity, but then, under the obligation to stay away from the protagonists of these acts under judicial supervision, was put on a free footing.
“My client was able to provide explanations on the facts that were told to him,
“The chief prosecutor took into account not to rob him of his freedom, said his lawyer Yann Arnoux.
Four other persons were accused and released from prison on Wednesday on Tuesday, including two of them under legal supervision, according to Deputy Supreme Attorney Michel Ruffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Managing Director of the Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is prosecuted by \"unauthorised influence and passive bribery\".
Two government officials of the Aubagne Balling Area, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, were also arrested, one due to the title of 'intervention and mismanagement of general property by a public service officer, the other because of 'mediation in the event of public funds mismanagement'.
The life partner of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was also accused of “healing and breaching of company assets”.
Among the people who were confronted with Guérini are Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned due to a similar affair of fraudulent public-owned craftsmanships that had affected Corsica.
The detainees suspected his society of contributing to the washing of money coming from “high” crime circles.
The investigation against X for alleged fraud in the award of public contracts, particularly in the disposal sector, will be carried out in April 2009 following anonymous letters in the files of several open investigation procedures.
According to close investigation sources, the investigation focuses on the conditions of the surcharge and the operation of a La Ciotat deposit, which also refers to waste from the Aubagne area, as well as from certain cities of the municipal catchment area Marseille (MPM).
Affaire Clotilde Reiss: the Elysée Palace exaggerates its intermediate function for Syria
Within more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher who was detained in Iran for ‘spionication’, breathed the French public, put the diplomacy in alertness and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All of this with the attentive views of the diplomats of the United States.
The American documents received by WikiLeaks and viewed by the newspaper \"Le Monde\" give some background to this crisis.
They describe how Elysée had explained his strategy to the Americans, who went so far as to give these advices on dealing with their own crisis of 'disinfection' in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They point out how the French responsibles tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young French did not benefit the release of Majid Kakavand, a prisoner in France, and from the American judiciary due to trade in material for the benefit of Iran's nuclear program.
Finally, they put the way in which the French Bureau tried to manipulate the media for the purpose of making them believe the idea, the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss, into a grim light.
In fact, he had done nothing in this regard.
A diplomat telegraph edited in Paris on 12 August 2009 is entitled ‘Iran: French comments on how to deal with hostages’.
François Richier, Elysée-Consultant on Strategy Questions, accompanied Patrice Paoli, Director of Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle Orient with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They told her the French method.
They told the Americans to put everything in place to bring back their own nationals who would be holding violently in Iran.
“Making noise, they said, “articulate loudly and clearly and without interruption - the words “basic rights - “innocent” “immediate release” in the media.
This is necessary to embarrass the Iranian regime, which is very sensitive to its image.
“Do this all the more, especially as the Iranians ask you not to do so,
Because “Stellsweep doesn’t solve anything - past the discussion attempts on the inconspicuous ways that Iran’s “masters in escape maneuvers”
Mr Richier added that the arrest of foreigners was a ‘common Iranian tactic’: ‘opinion for political extortion’
He announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which was due on 16 August, on the day she flees to the French Embassy) will extend the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians (230,000 euros deposit).
And he makes it clear that Elysée anticipates further hostage captures, a phenomenon that \"is getting worse\"
The Iranians could, in the near future, arrest another of about 1,800 French citizens living in Iran, he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss was released from prison twelve days ago, but is still detained in Iran.
An information was relayed: the Iran Majid Kakavand, whose extradition the United States demands from Iran due to illegal trade in sensitive electronic material, has been released from prison after the decision of a judge in Paris.
The American Embassy, like many other observers, raises questions about this disturbing co-incidence.
For Washington, who pursues the illegal Iranian networks of acquisition of the material intended for the nuclear programme, the release of Majid Khakavand is a bad news.
Did France buy a cow trade ?
The liberation of the Iranian against that of the French?
On the occasion of another discussion with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, François Richier assures us that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only \"fullly surprised by the judge's decision\" but also tried to resist it.
'There has been a regular exchange between the French Bureau and the French Minister of Justice (currently Michèle Alliot-Marie), but 'the French Government cannot change the judicial decision' he declares.
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand is still under the control of the French intelligence service.
The Elysée consultant selects a telephone number, puts it again, then informs the American diplomat, the Iranians, who are currently starting their way into the buildings led by the Iranian Embassy in Paris,
During the custody of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée does not make its efforts to believe, through explanations and media-organized attempts to escape, that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad is playing a \"important\" and \"influenced\" role.
Americans do not observe this activity without irony and note that manipulation bears fruit, as several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 refers to the rise of the French authorities’ media flash.
What is based so much on \"thanks' testimony\" to Mr. Assad, the Paris Embassy is asking itself.
\"In spite of their explanations of praise, the French authorities secretly admit that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians actually did,
The document is then concerned with the reasons why the Elysée has brought this fiction to an end.
He analysed the intensive communication efforts aimed at confirming Sarkozy's policy of opening to Syria.
A policy launched in 2008, which was perceived to be premature and undeserved, at that time by numerous critics in France and abroad,
\"The Syrian role building up - trying to lead Paris-Syria to see what praise can be achieved by playing a constructive role in the region,
In addition, the aim is to \"seal disputes between Syria and Iran\"
The American Embassy knows this from a good source.
On August 11th, François Richier had entrusted her with: \"Of course, we don't know whether the Syrians have done anything,
“But despite everything we thanked them,
‘This should at least create confusion among the Iranians,
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her in the Elysée.
In a communiqué, he thanked the president of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their “active role in favour of the release of our countrymen”
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government will adopt a law called \"the Aschenbrodel\", which will prohibit young people from playing online games after midnight by blocking them from accessing it, as explained by government responsibility.
A draft law to require online game operators to deny young people under 16 years of age from midnight access to these games will be presented to Parliament in December, by representatives of the Ministries of Culture and Family.
\"Many children play these games all night long and then have difficulties with learning in school and also with living a normal life day after day\"
“We believe that this law is necessary in order to ensure their health and their right to sleep,” said Jo Rin, with this draft bill, the Ministerial Representative of the French press agency Agence France Presse.
The online games would be accessible again from 6 a.m.
The manufacturers would have a year to prepare for the application of the law, so he specified.
The government also looks forward to asking manufacturers to cut down the daily time limit granted for access to these games to those young people whose parents ask for it, added the controller.
It will also provide free software to those who wish to be able to limit the amount of time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most “networked” countries, and newspapers regularly report various events associated with intensive Internet use.
The country is also an undisputed champion in worldwide online game competitions.
In November South Korea won four gold medals in the World Cyber Games against 58 other nations.
2018-2022 World Cup: FIFA appoints the Founder Country
On Thursday, FIFA's Executive Committee, in a bright excitement due to suspicion of corruption, will appoint the World Championships Founders 2018 and 2022, a highly political election in which the rankings for influence and lobbying threaten to push the technical criteria into the background.
However, one thing is certain: the 2018 edition of FIFA's Royal Discipline will take place in Europe, its traditional Hochburg (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 issue will then be somewhat more exotic; the International Football Association hopes to be able to win new territories (Katar, Australia) after the premiere on the African continent in 2010, or further pursue its branch in the United States or Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities belonging to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch Head of Government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) presents the measure of the economic and political commitment of a world championship.
So the machinations behind the scenes threaten to stop until the last minute.
It's hard otherwise to set up a hierarchy of candidates.
According to FIFA's evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) files offer better arguments than those of their competitors.
But these considerations will not be so important for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the hour of the election.
The Sunday Times, which was the start of the execution of two members of the Executif committee (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu) at the beginning of the revelations, could also have ruined the opportunities for their own country, the cradle of football, which was only allowed to take off the World Championship once, in 1966.
The BBC had once again given it to the nutrition floor on Monday by broadcasting a documentary report, which takes three influential members of the committee: Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Reason enough to anger FIFA and embarrass the English representatives, who, in the first place, had been running intensive lobbying with David Cameron in these last weeks.
The Head of Government hopes for a new edition of the board of chess, which was successful by his predecessor Tony Blair, who won the 2012 London Olympics organization in 2005.
Would this intensive effort be sufficient to revalue England's image before the committee?
Nothing is less certain, because the duo Spain-Portugal doesn't lack the troubles with its already finished stadiums, its expertise (WM 82 in Spain, Barcelona Olympic Games, EM 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the economic and financial shadows of the two countries could weaken their ambitions.
The possible repressions against the English as well as the doubts about Solvency of Spain and Portugal have increased the chances of Russia becoming a weighty outsider despite its gaps in the Dossier (Statien, Hotels, Transport).
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, however, has decided to call upon the uninformed interpretation of the complaints of the English press, an unfair competition in the preparation of the vote, on the part of the committee members.
“You throw it with dirt, you try to compromise it - watered Putin.
For 2022, the United States, strengthened by the 1994 experience, seems to be the logical favorites.
First economic world power, the headquarters of FIFA main sponsors, the country seems to have a long list of advantages towards Japan and South Korea, which have separately set up a very beautiful project.
But these new candidacies seem premature for two countries that had co-organised the competitions in 2002.
Another threat: FIFA's hotly sought approval of the 2026 World Cup for China, which will cause the Asian chances to fall to 2022.
With Australia and Qatar, which with the expectation of futuristic stages, all registers have been drawn, FIFA is pursuing its expansion towards new areas, but these two countries are at greater risk than certainty.
Australia, as well as Japan and South Korea, may suffer from the weakness of television rights acquired by European countries (due to the shift in time), the sensitive nerve of FIFA.
Second mandate: openness
De Gaulle had really stooped.
Mid-rand had let him believe that he stuttered.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than this one.
A mandate in Elysée calls next.
The current head of state will be ergo candidate in 2012.
But the openness does not stand well on the side of the mystery attached to the presidential function.
So you have to do as if the doubt existed.
In one, as in the other sense.
In 2006, the supporters Jacques Chiracs stated that a third mandate was not excluded without even believing in it.
On November 15th, Nicolas Sarkozy assured in serious tone that he would make his decision “at some point in the fall of 2011.
The fact that on Tuesday evening in Elysée before the UMP parliamentarians he would have the view of \"two mandates\", had thus spread a little feverishness.
Was that the official announcement of his candidacy?
Far from it.
The President merely recalled that the 2008 constitutional amendment limited the number of five-year term to only two.
He made a statement, not an announcement.
It is not the first time he mentions the presidential election at such meetings in a humorous tone.
“You have a worst case with me for seven and a half years, or at best,” he told them in July 2009.
To a new one in May 2010: “I don’t believe that I don’t think about the phase after that,”
His words from before yesterday make him no more a candidate than the previous day; but also no less.
Should they call out comments, then for a two-fold reason.
The acceleration of the race around the candidacy with the PS on one side.
But it is not the admission of the competition with Ségolène Royal, which is driving Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is its obvious candidacy in 2012, which reminds many members of the PS early as adopted to combat.
The bad surveys on the other side.
For the first time, the voters of the Right would prefer a candidate of François Fillon who was elected by Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to the BVA-L'Express survey).
“We have a candidate, and there is no discussion with the UMP about it,” responded immediately and cautiously to the Prime Minister’s environment.
“If he were to be a defeat, he would not be a candidate,” Jean-Pierre Raffarin tells him.
“He will always believe in being able to win, Alain is correcting Juppé, who has become aware of it.
Euro: the ECB is forced to maintain its purchases of government papers
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB last year should provide an opportunity to show how to get out of the crisis, or at least to announce the arrangement of a large number of unconventional monetary policy measures to reach their conclusion at the end of the year.
The crisis of European government debt requires the central bank in Frankfurt to fail to cope with the current situation on the European bond markets, even if it does not cause their deterioration.
The political costs would be far too high.
The French Minister for Finance Christine Lagarde had welcomed the ECB's active role in solving the European public budget debt yesterday at a press conference.
It did not dare to say whether it believed that the central bank could do more, for example by stimulating its programme of acquisitions of state bonds.
“I reserve my considerations for my European trading partners (...).”
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, had not very much spoken about his projects on the eve of Brussels on the occasion of his hearing by the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Committee, but rather was pleased to point out that the programme of the purchase of state papers on the secondary market would be ‘further operating’ and that we will be watching the decisions at the meeting on Thursday,
Only certainty: The ECB will leave its central interest rate unchanged at 1%, the historically lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the bond purchases of the treasury were doubled from the ECB last week to approximately 1.35 billion euros.
And according to some traders' indiscretions, yesterday she will have made new purchases on Irish and Portuguese state papers.
Since May 2010, the Eurosystem central banks have made purchases of 67 billion euros.
For dealers, the anticipation of a follow-up to the purchase price is not doubted (see page 29).
People's farmers no longer expect a remarkable change in the course.
If the bond transactions of more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the latter will still make itself available to the unlimited reserves in a generous manner over a period of one week to three months.
People's farmers are already concerned that this measure will be extended by a few months.
\"I cannot imagine that the ECB will substantially change its programme,
\"Otherwise, it would take the risk of experiencing new tensions in the short term, according to Michael Schubert, Volkswirt der Commerzbank.
“A progressive departure, scheduled for the first quarter of 2011, seems more likely to me,” he said, “anticipated Norbert Brams, Volkswirt bei Sal.
Oppenheim.
In the field of its intervention on the public debt market, the ECB should maintain such a buying volume of bonds that will give rise to the emerging market, adding Norbert Brams.
In view of the relevance of the exposed position of European banks in the euro area’s debt markets, the central bank has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
“It must enter the market at any price and act in such a way as to prevent the rapid enthusiasm over the returns paid to the weakest countries,” said an important bond holder yesterday.
For if interest rates began to rise, the States would be more prevented from reducing or only stabilizing their debt.
This is the price to protect the euro.
The Berlusconi government goes into cover in Italy
After a week of alarming concern for Italy, yesterday the situation has relaxed a little with the decline of corner interest rates to 10 years.
A return to deceptive silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister for Economic Affairs, Giulio Tremonti, the region's chairmans had heard the situation as \"undisputable\" and had been able to tell him about an \"unpredictable\" weekend, but the person was immediately demented.
On Tuesday at any rate, the shear with the German interest rates would have reached its record of 210 basis points, and the prices of the contracts to cover the risk of bankruptcy would have increased to 263 points, which had caused some headlessness in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi had pointed out to his Council of Ministers that Spain's discrepancy on German interest rates is at 400 basis points.
His right hand, Gianni Letta, had, however, been \"severely concerned\" by the \"market turbulence\" and a possible risk of infection from the direction of Ireland.
\"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland,
“The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal,” explains Irwin Stelzer, Volkswirt at Hudson Institute.
It is clear that his problem is the absence of economic growth and the associated, divisive tax inputs that put the state at risk of being unable to meet its financing needs.
The last Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
In the future, Italian growth of 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012 is expected... although this budget is estimated to be 1.3% or 2% in the Senate to be audited.
Under these conditions, according to the EU Commission, the budget deficit will continue to account for 4.3% of GDP next year (in contrast to the 3.9% predicted by governments) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Therefore, the rioter also has a new budget collective, which could be used after the holidays to a sum of 7 billion euros.
\"If necessary, new austerity measures must be taken, says Wirtschaftscher Olli Rehn.
At the hour Italy receives support from international institutions.
\"The basic festivals of Italy's economy are in order and its accounts are regulated, which we have been repeating for a long time - assures Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, who is entrusted with Italy at the IMF.
\"There are no problems at present, neither in the short term nor in the long term, because Italy, despite its high debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, A. d. R.) requires lower stabilization progress than from other countries - observed Pier Carlo Padoan, head of OECD.
The question remains of political unsteadiness.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of distrust from the Chamber of Representatives, which would allow the preferred elections to be organised at the end of March.
It is therefore a relatively favourable period for a decision on a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about expanding anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde had stressed it again yesterday at a press conference in Paris: “I believe it was still demonstrated on Sunday afternoon as well as in the evening: Europeans clearly hold together, are ready and committed to defending their currency and their currency area,
Although completely relative - yesterday's drop in the interest rates of European government bonds was water on the mills of governments and the ECB.
However, it is not yet possible to speak of a normalization.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's had announced that it could reduce Portugal's debt mark, the probably most effective target of the speculators today.
\"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political perceptibility, particularly on banking systems, according to the opinion of the people's farmers of Exane BNP Paribas.
Above all, especially \"political time is going much slower than that of markets\"
The European countries, which are well aware of both this gap and the danger involved, intensify discussions to strengthen the anti-crisis measures already in place.
The informal consultations between the most directly concerned finance ministers and, in a sense, their counterparts in the G20 are progressing well.
And this also with regard to Eurogroupe and Ecofin meetings at the beginning of next week.
The ECB meets today.
The plan sets out the lot of unconventional measures to strengthen euro area countries in the cross-border cross-markets (see below).
As far as the EU Stability Fund is concerned, its Executive Director Klaus Regling has already started his Asia tour in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors in the Far East about developments in the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of his visit is not explicit fundraising, he will certainly prepare the ground for it.
The EU Stability Fund's first advertising expenditure is scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an official American representative of Reuters Agency had entrusted, the United States supported a possible increase in the funds mobilised by the additional, direct commitment of the IMF.
Portugal and Spain, the countries in the first row, are, on the other hand, sending themselves to adopt structural reforms, particularly in the field of labour market organization.
Reforms that will be added to the austerity measures, however, will have an impact in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid take a different path from Greece and Ireland.
Both the one and the other is at any price to avoid the need to seek international assistance before they have set up their own budget correctively and decided on essential structural reforms that will bring them back to their trust in the long term.
European investors, in turn, talk about the available options to speed up the standardisation process of the markets of government bonds.
Axel Weber, who was on his way through Paris on 24 November, had the first idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to re-enter its own pocket.
Barclays Capital's economy, with regard to the European public debt market, is at the forefront of an actor's assessment that an extension of around 100 billion euros would be sufficient, preferably, in the form of a direct liquidity injection.
This funding is available: the European mechanism of depleted financial stabilization, which is currently EUR 60 billion.
A advisory board, which has all the opportunities to be carefully examined in the European capitals.

Snow and Glatteis: 24 departments in Alarm Level Orange
The snow episodes are still driving difficulties, particularly in Britain's secondary transport networks, threatening to affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in the Orange alarm stage due to the threat of snow and glare.
The regions of Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne are added to the 20 departments already in alarm stage Orange; 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, then later at night.
According to Météo France, the intense snowshoes dance north of the Gironde as well as the Charentes, it snows easily on the et Ile-de-France.
In the affected departments, snow covers are expected from 2 to 5 cm, sometimes from 7 to 10 cm, as well as from 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the Paris region.
The regions Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin are affected.
Snowfalls are considerable enough to cause road obstacles and to affect certain economic activities, says Météo France.
In the Côtes d'Armor region, several regional roads are blocked for heavy transport of over 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp Lannion and Saint-Brieuc Loudéac.
The transport situation of the secondary transport networks in Britain is very difficult, according to the traffic police, who refuse to use their own vehicle only in case of emergency, and the use of some TER buses has been cancelled throughout the day.
In the Picardy, school traffic was lifted for Thursday.
No specific restrictive measures were provided for heavy transport on Wednesday evening.
The prefecture \"requires drivers to the highest level of caution on the roads and to adapt their driving behavior accordingly\"
On Thursday, the Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked airlines to remove 25% of their flights starting from Orly from Roissy Airport and 10% from Orly due to expected heavy snowfalls.
The DGAB recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
Gatwick Airports in the south of London and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Métro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate on modernising the transport industry on the Ile-de-France is in full swing, it has rained billions.
At least in the discussions.
In particular, the 23 billion worth of the Metro Grand Paris is called to mind, which is to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
In order to guide the beginning of construction of the SGP, the state has launched a capital donation of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum that the SGP would then allow to give part of the financial sum to its twofold in the markets.
Today, it has finally come to first calculations.
The Supplementary Budget of 2010, which was passed by the National Assembly's Finance Commission in the morning, contains the measures envisaged to raise the first part of these funds.
These are two types of measures: the creation of a special tax to open up and improve the taxation of the offices at Ile-de France.
First, Article 15 of the draft law is drawn up in favour of the public-law institution Société du Grand Paris,
This is the case: \"The product of this tax amounts to 117 million euros per year\"
The second is a re-ordering of the company tax already in place: \"to modernise it in order to increase the product resulting from it and to answer this increase in the Société du Grand Paris,
How much would that bring?
A puzzle.
This sum is not given in the text.
Of the 4 billion, one is far away.
\"It is said that the tax resources will be added to the 4 billion euros of the capital dotation imposed by the State and the Société du Grand Paris will gradually be made for the project, so the explanatory statement should be taken from it.
In SGP, this system is not found to be insidious.
\"Since the moment you spend income (both taxes, i.e. R.), you can cover the project for over three years and then only get out of the 4 billion, it is explained.
“This is recorded in the budget and subtracted gradually,
The SGP suggests that 2013 will start to note the 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, the 4 billion of which can still be sought for for a long time, is at risk of creating a quite moving, parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
Racism hackers and emsitating spies
The Affairs WikiLeaks has a twofold significance.
On one side, it has become an obvious scandal, a scandal that is merely a scandal in the sense of hypocrisy that governs relations between the states, the citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at the international level, giving a taste for the future dominated by regression.
But let's go ahead of the row.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that each file created by a secret service (an x-like nation) is composed exclusively of newspaper excerpts.
The--exceptional--American revelations about the sexual habits of Berlusconis are nothing more than what was read over months anyway in every x-like journal (except those whose owner is Berlusconi), and the frighteningly caricatured profile Gaddafis offered cabaret artists for their sketches for a long time.
The rule that the secret files may consist only of already known news is essential for the dynamics of secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go to a library dedicated to esotheric publications, you will realize that every work (about the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templar or the Rose Crossler) repeats exactly what has already been written in previous works.
This is not only because the author doesn't want to publish any research (but because he didn't know where to find news about non-existing), but because those who dedicate themselves to occultism don't believe in anything but what they already know and confirm what they have learned.
This is also Dan Brown's success mechanism.
Likewise to the secret acts.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited spirit) is also the head of the intelligence service (otherwise, he could be whatever, for example editor at Libération), who only considers what he recognizes to be true.
The top secret information about Berlusconi, who had sent the American embassy to the state department in Rome, was the same as those who had already published Newsweek the week before.
So why was such a removal made around the revelations of these files?
On one side, they say what every educated person already knows, that the messages - at least since the end of World War II and since then the heads of government can call each other or take an airplane to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of some small representation tasks, have turned into spy centers.
Any viewer of investigative films knows this very accurately, and it is not because of hypocrisy that one does so to ignore it.
Nevertheless: the fact of repeating it publicly violates the task of hypocrisy and serves to put American diplomacy in a bad light.
Second, the idea that an x-like hacker can touch the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world is a major blow against the prestige of the state department.
In addition, the scandal brings the victims less than the “sharpeners” in distress.
But we dedicate ourselves to the profound nature of what happened.
Once, at Orwell's times, you could bundle all power like a Big Brother, who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy could have been seen as completely correct since then, where one can control every movement thanks to the telephone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the chosen highway and so on; the citizen would become the total victim of the eye of power.
However, if one reveals what is going on today that even the secret crypts of power can no longer escape the control of a hacker, then the control stop being unilaterally directed and becomes circular.
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - selected as the judges of the citizen - can experience the secrets of power.
But how can a power no longer be able to keep its own secrets?
It is true that Georg Simmel already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge of the character Berlusconis or Merkels is basically a secret free of secrecy as it praises the public sphere; but in the style of WikiLeaks revealing that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets, means to rob them of any power.
WikiLeaks did neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wrong, but Clinton and Obama did.
What will be the consequences of this restriction, which has been added to such a tremendous power?
It is obvious that the states will no longer post any reserved information online in the future - that would be similar to a slope glued to the street corner.
But it is equally obvious that using the current technologies is futile to hope to keep confidential reports secret via telephone.
Nothing is easier than finding out if and when a head of state moves on an airplane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How could certain relationships be maintained in future, both private and only for certain ears?
I know very well that my prediction now sounds like science fiction and romantic, but I see it necessary to introduce the government agents to me, moving in secret on uncontrollable marching routes, carrying their messages nowhere other than in mere memory, and beyond, hiding the few written information they have received in the shoe set.
The information would be stored in a single copy in closed drawers: basically, Watergate's spy attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is progressing like a cancer today, namely backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communication, the Internet reconstructed a telegraph with (telephone) wires.
The (analogs) videocassettes enabled film researchers to explore a film band for tape by playing from the back to the front and venturing all the secrets of assembly, while the (numerical) CDs today enable nothing but jumping from chapter to chapter, i.e. in macroportions.
With the high-speed trains you drive from Rome to Milan within three hours, while this requires three and a half hours by plane including the changeover.
It is therefore not unusual for politics and communication technology to return to car and horse.
A last observation.
In earlier times the press tried to understand what secrets were forged between the messages.
At present it is the messages that require confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France beautifully speaks about its financial promises
A year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to examine compliance with the rapidly resolved financing promises (also called ‘fast start’ or early financing) implemented by developing countries.
And already the rough French beautiful speeches are revealed.
With the Copenhagen Treaty, the developing countries have committed themselves to providing 30 billion dollars between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has promised 7.2 billion euros over three years, France 1.26 billion euros (i.e. 420 million a year).
At the opening of the COP16, the EU has drawn up all registers to convince its partners of its commitment to fast-start funding: detailed progress report of its Member States, press conference, major side events, brochure distribution.
Operation transparency is remarkable and highly valued for its real value: developing countries and civil society like to see all developed countries do the same at the same precision level.
The EU announces that it has released 2.2 billion euros in 2010, bringing it to the right path to respect its commitment of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look into detail, things are a little more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Treaty, this money should be ‘new and additional’ in order to ensure that additional use has been made without being due to the disadvantage of public development assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus as to what “new and extra” means.
While the EU Commission has proposed harmonisation, certain Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the value of guidance that he considers best.
For example, the EU Commission has chosen to be the target value for those of 2009: international funding will be maintained and 150 million will be allocated for over three years as part of the funding \"Fast Start\".
Other countries have chosen similar guide values, either for the year or for conditions at the level of public development assistance.
In return, France was of the opinion that the financing of ‘all new projects’ of 2010 would be ‘new and additional’
In other words, there are no indicative values in the expenditure of the previous year or at the global level of public development assistance.
In concrete terms, the total amount of French support for developing countries can remain stable (or also decrease) - France intends to maintain its commitment to new and additional financing.
Another crucial element is the breakdown of donations and loans.
There is no rule about it yet, and everyone chooses his mode of calculation.
Some, such as France, are 1 loaned € as equivalent with 1 donated €.
Obviously, this is difficult to represent: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for certain profitable investments (often linked to emission control projects based on the most effective technology), it is deceptive to present the euro that is taken as equivalent to a donated euro... Furthermore, only the cost of the loan for the investor country should be counted as commitment (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has nothing but the following considerations: it respects its commitment of 420 million euros by making 91.5% of its loans (389.8 million euros) and spending 8.5%) 36.1 million euros - see also the EU document to convince itself of it.
France is the only country in the EU that makes large use of loans.
Germany demands 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among other things) meet their obligations to 100% with donations.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union spends €1 to fulfill its obligations, France is just 10 cents and understands a comparable use below.
Nice hokuspocus!
All in all, France operates in its fast-start financing with a double threshold: in part with a further development of the action over time and in part with the reality of financial commitment.
France succeeds in making it believe that it has spent 420 million (new and additional) million in accordance with its promise and saves 36.1 million euros.
Manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (as it seems it was Bercy who carried out the arbitration) could have a double negative effect; once EU internals (why do the other Member States continue to donate if it is enough to borrow) and then in negotiations because the developing countries cannot be completely deceived...
The chapter of early financing is only a small issue in a relatively short time compared to the overall discussion on climate.
But it could be too much in the immense machinery of the UNFCCC.
Let's hope this won't be the case.
Whatever the case, it is essential to learn his lesson from this first year of early financing.
First of all, France could announce a change in its accounting method for 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of respect for its obligations and balanced justice with the other countries of the European Union.
But, above all, France could bring forward the discussions on the issue of long-term financing (a different, crucial and currently discussed issue): one does not escape the question of the \"reliability\" or the type of accounting of its loans.
France could change its position in order to be just as progressive with regard to disputes as it is with other things.
The hope is thus based on the new Minister for the Environment, Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprising announcement about the fast-start France and its vision of \"reliability\" as well as the use of loans would naturally raise the international trust base necessary for further discussion.
Alarm - pesticides taken by children
A child of 10 years takes on different chemical substances over the day 81, a study published this Wednesday by the Association of Genérations Futures (former movement to protect the rights and respect of generations).
The association, which explains that its results “refer to the low number of samples analysed do not represent a statistically significant value, but rather an illustrative character of the problem treated, had normally bought between July and September the food consumed by a child of around ten years at meals plus an intermediate meal in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris.
These typical meals - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit parts, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day - have been examined as well as sewing laboratories looking for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The counting balance is negative: 81 chemical substances, including 42 classified as potentially or likely to be carcinogenic and five classified as safe carcinogens, as well as 37 substances with endocrine disorder factor, according to studies of several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
“Even if, in the near future, the legal limits for each chemical substance taken individually are not exceeded, this survey is very well understood that the reality in which the consumer may be exposed to carcinogenic substances or substances with endocrine disorder is a source of concern,” the association notes.
Even at breakfast, butter and tea containing milk already contain more than ten of the potentially cancerous residues and three proved to be carcinogenic, as well as more than twenty residues that may affect the hormone system.
The apple imported from Brazil, as a intermediate for the study, shows traces of six chemical substances, including a fungicide prohibited in France.
The same applies to the green beans from Kenya, included at lunch, where the study has identified traces of an insecticide strictly prohibited in the EU.
Furthermore, the hack steak, tuna from the bushes, even the baguette and gum of pesticides and other chemicals were spun.
The analyses have brought the presence of nitrates and chloroform to light in the conduction water.
At dinner, the salmon steak with 34 determined chemical residues was the “most abundant” and even the plastic plate used to warm up the meal in the microwave was not without charge.
According to the study, the final risk of this 'damage cocktail' for consumers is likely to be underestimated.
The ‘Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts’ (EE-LV) has proposed, on the other hand, ‘in view of the urgency of the situation’, to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop the ‘increase in civilisation diseases’.
In July a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) identified 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
