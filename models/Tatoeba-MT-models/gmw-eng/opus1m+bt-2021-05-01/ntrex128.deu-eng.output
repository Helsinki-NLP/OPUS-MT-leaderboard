Members of the Wales National Assembly feared confusion with the Muppets
The proposal to change its title to ‘MWP’ (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Welsh Parliament) has been welcomed by some members of the national assembly.
The reason for this is plans to change the name of the National Assembly in Welsh Parliament (Walish Parliament).
National Assembly members of all political directions fear to become the target of the mockery.
One of the Labour Party members said that his group was concerned because the name “Twp” and “Pwp” rhymed “
For non-Walisian readers: In Welsh, \"twp\" stands for \"doof\" and \"pwp\" for \"Aa\"
A National Assembly member of the Plaid Cymru Party stated that the entire group was \"not happy\" and proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said that his group was open to the change of name, but pointed to the great similarity between \"MWP\" and \"Muppet\".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similar to the letter u in the English spoken in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission (National Assembly Committee), which is currently designing a name change law, said: \"The final decision on names for the members of the National Assembly is of course the members themselves,
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 authorized the Welsh National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the board published the results of a public hearing on the proposals that provided broad support for the name \"Welsh Parliament\" for the National Assembly.
With regard to the title of the members of the National Assembly, the \"Welsh Parliament Members\" (Walisian Members of Parliament) or \"WMPs\" - while at a public hearing the option \"MWP\" was the greatest support.
The members of the National Assembly seem to suggest alternative options, but this could pose a problem for President Elin Jones, who is supposed to submit a draft law within weeks.
The reform law will include further changes in the functioning of the National Assembly, including rules on disqualification of members of the National Assembly and the design of the committee system.
The members of the National Assembly may, in their debate on the law, final vote on their names.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on a change of country name
On Sunday, the voters decide whether their country's name should be changed to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The popular vote was put in place to settle a decade-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has a province with the similar name Macedonia.
Athens has for a long time insisted that the name of its northern neighbour means that it is entitled to the Greek territory and has repeatedly expressed itself against its admission into the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the popular vote on the change of name, said he would not accept the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change in the name of the price to be paid for accession to the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's silent in view of the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
“The old people I was talking to said that in the past there was a bar and a church at every corner, ” said Adams.
\"Today there is both no longer \"
He said the disappearance of the bars would be understandable.
“The social life of the people looks different today,” he said.
“Bars are no longer the living room of the neighborhood where people regularly find themselves”
With the churches, he fears that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the church leaders accept, and that they will be \"early or later at the beginning\"
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment houses with residences where people live who do not support the remaining places of refuge.
“The overwhelming majority of people who buy real estates in these buildings will be white,” he said, “and thus speed up the complete closure of these churches, as it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these residences will become members of these churches.
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist community was formed in the 1930s.
A black community, which held its services nearby, became the owner of the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black community under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, a large shopping street in Harlem that refused to hire or support blacks.
During a fire in 1939, the building was severely damaged, but when Father Johnson’s community members planned to rebuild it, they ordered the bell game.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's, proudly described the bell game as \"the bells of the poor\"
The expert who louded the bell in July used other words: \"A cultural treasure and \"an irreplaceable historical instrument\"
In addition, the expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, found that it was the world's first bell game played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who was changed 18 years ago to the larger bell game in the Riverside Church.
Merriweather said he wasn't replaced by St. Martin's.
What has taken place in St. Martin's in recent months is a complicated story with architects and contractors, which were partly drawn by the lay leaders of the Church and partly by the Bishops' Diocese.
In July, the head of the municipality, consisting of lay leaders, expressed in writing to the diocese that the diocese would try to pass the costs on to the board of the municipality, although it had not been involved in the commissioning of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Hai hurts 13-year-olds in California while diving after Lobstern
In California, on Saturday, the first day of the praise season, according to official statements, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy by diving after Lobster.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Hammel told the station KSWB-TV in San Diego, on Saturday morning he had been diving with friends for about half an hour when he heard the boy's cry of help and, with several others, paddled to the boy to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said he first thought the boy was happy to have caught a praiser. But then he realized that the boy was yelling, \"I've been bitten!
I've been bitten.
When Hammel arrived at the boy, he found that his entire key leg had been torn up.
“I cried that everyone should come out of the water: “There’s a shark in the water!” - added Hammel.
The boy was flown to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is in critical condition.
The type of shark responsible for the attack was unknown.
Rescuer Captain Larry Giles told the media that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier. However, it was concluded that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper body area.
Officials locked the beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Encinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
According to Giles, there are over 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to advance the cosmetic market in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's attacks with the department of cosmetics, which are occupied with specialized assistants, boats, superdrugs and Debenhams.
As part of a major advance on the 2.8 billion UK pounds of cosmetics market in the United Kingdom, which continues to grow, while fashion and household goods sales decline, the larger cosmetic departments will be tested nationwide in eleven branches. If they prove successful, they will be extended to other branches next year.
The investment in cosmetics coincides with the search of supermarkets for opportunities to use previously used store areas for televisions, microwaves and household goods.
According to Sainsbury's data, for the first time, the scope of its cosmetic offer is doubled to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Twezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Even existing series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees receive more space and brand areas similar to those in shops like boats.
In addition, the supermarket conducts a relaunch of its \"Boutique\" make-up series, so that most of the products are vegan-friendly, an aspect that is increasingly required by younger customers.
In addition, the perfume dealer Fragrance Shop will test in two Sainsbury's branches. The first sales center was opened last week in Croydon, South London, and a second will be opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, this year.
Online shopping and the transition to the daily purchase of small quantities of food in local demand items means that supermarkets need to do more to get customers to visit them.
According to Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, sales outlets are increasingly looking like department stores, as the supermarket chain tries to fight against the discounters Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food items.
Since the purchase of the Argos and Habitat chains, Sainsbury's has established two years ago in hundreds of branches of Argos sales stations and also a number of habitat sales stations, which has increased food sales and profitability of acquisitions.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to reorganize its cosmetics and pharmaceuticals departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with boats in the early 2000s, which ended after a dispute over the distribution of revenue from the drug dealer's branches in the supermarkets.
The new strategy is followed by Sainsbury's sale of its 281 branch comprehensive pharmaceutical business to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million UK pounds three years ago.
The company stated that Lloyds will play a role in the plan when an extended range of luxury skin care brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy is added in four branches.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director at Sainsbury's, said: “We have redesigned the appearance of our cosmetics departments to create a more attractive environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in specially trained colleagues who are available as consultants.
Our brand palette is tailored to all needs. Due to the seductive environment and the favorable locations, we are now an attractive destination for cosmetics purchases, which questions the previous type of shopping,
Peter Jones, angry, after the withdrawal of Holly Willoughbys from a business worth 11 million British pounds
“Dragons” The “Star Peter Jones is “wound” after TV moderator Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from a business worth 11 million British pounds with his lifestyle branding company to focus on their new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for the common homewear and accessory brand Truly.
The business of the two was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop.
The “This Morning Moderator, 37, announced her withdrawal to Instagram.
Holly Willoughby provoked “Dragons” The “Star Peter Jones” by its extremely short-term withdrawal from its lucrative lifestyle branding company to focus on their own new connection agreements with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Jones is supposed to have been “worn” when the “Golden Girl” of television was given a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, due to their new business, to not devote enough time to the common homewear and accessory brand Truly, worth up to 1.5 million British pounds.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and would probably have doubled Willoughby's estimated wealth of 11 million British pounds.
While Willoughby, 37, announced her withdrawal from Truly at Instagram, Jones left Britain on his way to one of his holiday homes.
One source said: “Truly had the highest priority for Holly by far.
It should secure their future over the next decades for them in the long term.
Their withdrawal decision was completely surprising for all parties involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, just before the launch of the market.
At the Marlow headquarters, a warehouse full of goods is waiting to be sold,
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the “This Morning Moderator, which is one of the most promising stars in the UK, could cost the company millions due to high investment in products from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear and possible further delays in market launch.
Moreover, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close friends for ten years with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby founded Truly in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, came as chairman in March.
The couples spend the holiday together, and Jones holds a share of 40 percent of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is to become a brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as the moderator of the ITV broadcast \"I'm A Celebrity\".
A Jones nearby source said yesterday evening: “We don’t comment on his business matters”
Hard words, and then we fell in love,
He scoffed at the criticism he had received from the news media for a comment that some would consider “non-presidential” and thus expected positive statements about the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said the voice of a news Moderator follows:
\"I didn't give up anything,
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting, as the first meeting in Singapore was held in June by Trump as a major step towards the denuclearisation of North Korea.
However, the denuclearisation negotiations have come to a standstill.
Over three months after the June Summit in Singapore, Ri Yong Ho, the top diplomat of North Korea, said on Saturday to leading politicians from all over the world at the UN General Assembly that the North saw no “responsive response” to North Korea's first disarmament measures.
Instead, he found that the United States was holding sanctions that should maintain the pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
“We are very successful with North Korea,” he said.
“We faced a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship,
He said his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim showed positive results: end of rocket tests, support in the release of hostages and retransmission of the mortal remains of American military personnel.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about the relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be presidential, but instead of 10,000 people standing outside and trying to get into this crowded arena, there would be about 200 people standing here,” Trump said, pointing at the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquakes devastated an island in Indonesia and cost hundreds of lives
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that they would not be needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the Lombok population were displaced, no national emergency was declared a prerequisite for the mobilization of international aid.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it very clear that they do not demand international support, so that’s a bit difficult - said Sumbing.
While Save the Children assembles a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet sure whether foreign employees can work on site.
Sutopo, spokesperson of the Civil Protection Authority, said that Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu to see if international bodies should participate in the relief measures.
In view of the earth tremors that Indonesia is constantly struggling with, the country is unfortunately ill prepared for natural forces.
While building in Aceh Tsunami Protection Centre, they are not a daily sight on other coastal beaches.
The missing tsunami warning in Palu, despite a warning in force, probably contributed to the deaths.
Traveling between Indonesia's numerous islands presents a challenge in the most optimal case.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
The Lazaret ship stationed in Lombok for the treatment of earthquake victims is on the way to Palu, but will reach the location of the new disaster at the earliest in three days.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of the proposed Indonesian infrastructure the core of his election campaign and has spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
However, the government of Joko's next year's re-election is suffering from financial deficits.
In addition, Joko is under pressure by persistent confessional tensions in Indonesia. Members of the Muslim majority there practice a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands expelled from their homes and homes, when bands of Christians and Muslims fought on the streets with machetes, arrows and bows and other primitive weapons.
View: Liverpools Daniel Sturridge achieves deep compensation against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool on Saturday at the London Stamford Bridge Stadium with a hit in the 89th minute before a Premier League loss against Chelsea.
Sturridge received a passport from Xherdan Shaqiri at 0:1 in about 27 metres away from Chelsea gate.
He aimed the ball to the left and then shot it in the direction of the rear post.
The shot sailed high over the prison room and drifted into the right upper corner of the net.
Finally, the ball fell over the jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and then into the net.
“I only tried to get into this position and get to the ball. Players like Shaq always play as much forward as possible, so I just tried to make as much time as possible for myself,” Sturridge said to LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante coming and had a contact with the ball. I didn’t think too much about it and just accepted the shot “
Chelsea, after a hit in the 25th minute, ran through the Belgian Star Eden Hazard at half-time with 1:0.
The blues storm gave a pass with the heel back to Mateo, then turned off near the midfield and sprinted into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic played a fast double pass in the midfield.
He then shot a good steep pass so Hazard got into the prison room.
Hazard left the defenders behind and closed with a left shot at Liverpool's Alison Becker by the back of the net.
Liverpool will be playing at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples on Wednesday at 15:00.
Chelsea is facing the UEFA Europe League Videoton on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
Number of tsunami deaths in Indonesia increases to 832
The number of deaths of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, as reported by the Civil Protection Authority on Sunday morning.
Many people were to be caught in the ruins of buildings that had been destroyed by the earthquake of the force 7.5 of Friday, which had caused up to six meters high waves, reported the public speaker Sutopo Purwo Nugroho in a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was overcrowded with the ruins of collapsed buildings.

The Cromwell status before Parliament becomes the new monument subject of the dispute over the rewriting of history
Their banishment would be poetic justice for the destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious art products by its fanatic Puritan supporters.
The Cromwell Society, however, described Cricks' proposal as a \"toority\" and attempt to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in the current debate on removing statues that Oliver Cromwell’s statue in front of Westminster’s palace became the target.
The picture tower in the English Civil Wars was neither arranged nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the false Cromwell would sacrifice for the deeds of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent portrayal of Cromwell is evidence of the 19th century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that is still worth celebrating.
Goldsmith said to Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps at the end of the 19th century more than today, as someone who defended Parliament against outside pressure, in his case, of course, by the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate representation is the subject of ongoing historical debates.
It is certain that the conflict formed in the middle of the 17th century the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single recognizable figure that represents one side of this gap.
His achievements as a Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and remembering them,
Killer pig bites Chinese farmers dead
According to local media reports, a farmer on a market in southwestern China was attacked and killed by a pig.
The man, to whom only the surname ‘Yuan’ was called, was found dead with a blood-flowing artery near a pig stall on the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, reported the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig breeder prepares to inject vaccines on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He was reported to have arrived on Wednesday with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and saw that a door to a neighboring pig stall was open.
He said there was a large male pig in the stable with blood on the snout.
According to the report, a forensic study confirmed that the 250 kilos pig had eaten the farmer dead.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and mutilated,” the cousin named “Wu” was quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
Records of a security camera showed how Yuan entered the market on Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was neither Yuan nor his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been imprisoned to prevent attacks on other people while the police were collecting evidence at the crime scene.
Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating reports of compensation for his death.
While it is rare for pigs to attack humans, such cases are known.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on her farm in Massachusetts, and the man suffered serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a 290 - kilo pig held a Welsh farmer between itself and a tractor until the farmer's wife was able to transport the animal.
After a farmer was eaten by his pigs in Oregon in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the taste of blood could act as a “exposure”.
\"They're just playful.
They like to grow and are very curious, ... they don't want to hurt someone.
One only has to treat them with the right degree of respect - he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa bring widespread strong rains to the southwest of the United States
How does Hurricane Rosa predict weaken on the way across the colder waters on the northern coast of Mexico?
However, Rosa will bring floods in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
On Sunday at 5:00 o'clock east coast time, Rosa showed wind speeds of 136 km/h, which corresponds to a hurricane of category 1, and was 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a trough begins to form across the Pacific, which moves east to the west coast of the United States. On Monday, when Rosa reaches Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm, high tropical humidity is transported northwards to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will cause up to 25 centimeters of rainfall on Monday in parts of Mexico.
Then, in the coming days, tropical moisture will result from interactions with the approaching trough of widespread rainfall in the southwest.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation can cause dangerous floods, water-driven shelters, and possibly droughts in the desert.
High tropical moisture sometimes leads to precipitation rates of almost 5 to 7.5 centimetres per hour, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest, especially in a large part of Arizona, precipitation is expected up to 5 to 10 centimeters.
Due to the spread of tropical rainfall, there is the possibility of fluctuating floods with rapidly worsening conditions.
In view of the threatening tropical rainfall, it is urgent to avoid going on foot into the desert.
Strong rainfall can result in torrential streams from canyons, and thunderstorms bring local windstorms as well as wind that leads dust with them.
The nearby trough brings local strong rains in parts of the southern California coast.
It is possible to reduce the total rainfall of above a centimeter, which can lead to a small amount of water-drying shelter and smooth roadways.
This would be the first rainfall of the rainy season in this region.
The first single tropical rain showers reach Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning. On Monday evening and Tuesday it rains.
On Tuesday strong rains spread into the Four Corners region and continue on Wednesday.
In October, strong temperature fluctuations are possible throughout the United States, as the Arctic cools down while the tropics remain relatively warm.
This sometimes leads to drastic temperature differences over short distances.
On Sunday there is a good example of drastic temperature differences in the middle of the United States.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, there is a temperature difference of almost 12 oC.
In the next few days, the continuing summer heat tries to develop and expand again.
For a large part of the middle and the east of the US, a warm October start is expected with wide temperatures around 27 oC from the Southern Plains to parts of the northeast.
New York City could reach 27 oC on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high probability for above-average temperatures in the first half of October in the east of the United States.
Over 20 million viewers have seen the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
Over 20 million viewers saw on Thursday six television networks the captivating statements of the Kavanaugh board nominated for the Supreme Court and the wife, Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assaults in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political path was halted. On Friday, the TV stations interrupted their regular program due to a turn in the last minute: a deal negotiated by Jeff Flake, Senator from Arizona, that is why the FBI is to carry out a one-week investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate's Judicial Committee to be 100% sure that Kavanaugh had been drunk at a high school party, had harassed her and tried to remove her clothes.
Kavanaugh said in a passionate statement that he was 100% sure that this had not happened.
It is likely that more than Nielsen's 20.4 million viewers have seen the hearing.
The company determined the average viewer numbers at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
For other networks such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, which had broadcast the hearing, the figures were not available immediately.
Besides, Nielsen usually has problems measuring viewer numbers in offices.
In order to get this into the right perspective: This corresponds in, for example, to the viewers in a play-off football game or in the Oscar award.
The Fox News Channel transmitter, whose opinion-oriented moderators strongly support Kavanaugh's nomination, reported the highest numbers of all networks, with an average of 5.69 million viewers, all day long.
ABC came second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS, according to Nielsen, had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers.
The interest remained great after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in the drama of Friday.
After the office of the moderate Republican had published a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was filmed by cameras from CNN and CBS on Friday morning, as protesters were threatening him in the elevator on the way to a hearing of the Judicial Committee with words.
He stood with a lowered view for minutes while he was being shot. The scene was transmitted live at CNN.
“I’m standing right here in front of you,” said a woman.
\"Believe that he tells the country the truth,
“They have power while so many women are powerless,” said one woman.
Flake said his office had published and supplemented a statement before the elevator concluded that he would have more to say at the hearing before the committee.
All cable and broadcasting networks sent live hours later when the Judicial Committee was to vote to the entire Senate on the forwarding of Kavanaughs' nomination.
However, Flake said that he would only do this under the condition that the FBI, as demanded by the democratic minority, investigate the accusations against the candidates in the next week.
Flake is convinced in part by discussions with a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After an interview with Coons and then several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flakes' decision was of great importance, as it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to confirm Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the charges raised against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of using Brexit for political purposes
Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, accused critics of their plans for the withdrawal of the European Union to use the future of Britain for political purposes and to undermine the interests of the nation.
The British Prime Minister Theresa May will attend the Conservative Party Party Day in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In an interview with her on the newspaper’s title page, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson intensified his attack on her so-called “Chequers Plan” for Brexit by presenting a proposal, which provides for the mutual drive of customs by Britain and the EU, as ‘fully absurd’.
Dead shots on Wayde Sims: Police Detain Suspected Dyteon Simpson in connection with the death of the LSU player
The police arrested a suspect in connection with the deadly shootings at Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University (LSU).
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned by Baton Rouge's police for killing.
The Authority published video footage of the dispute between Sims and Simpson. According to the police, Sims lost his glasses during the battle.
As reported by the CBS partner station WABB, the police secured the glasses at the crime scene and said that Simpson's eyeglass DNA had been found.
After a hearing with Simpsons, the police stated that he had faced the deadly shootings on Wayde.
The Advocate reported that the deposit had been set at $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office published a preliminary report on Friday, according to which the cause of death was a gunshot wound.
The police thank the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the Federal Police Criminal Laboratory, Southern University Police and citizens in the area for their support in the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the Regional Executive Authority for \"their care and their desire for justice\"
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1,98-metre-long wing player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played for LSU basketball.
In the last season he scored an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU's basketball coach, Will Wade, said that the team was deeply shocked about Waydes death and was shocked.
“You’re always afraid of something like this,” Wade said.
Volcano spews ash in Mexico City.
The ash ejected from the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern quarter of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned the Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the activity had increased in the crater and was registered within 24 hours 183 emissions of gas and ash.
The Authority monitored numerous cases of flurries and tremors.
Images in social media showed thin ash layers on the windscreens of cars in quarters of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists, since September 2017, had shaken an earthquake of 7.1 central Mexico's strength, recorded increased activity on the 72 kilometres southeast of the capital.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Conflicts between police and Catalan separatists prior to the anniversary of the independence vote
In Barcelona, six people were arrested on Saturday after clashes between the readiness police and pro-independence demonstrators. Thousands participated in other demonstrations to commemorate the first anniversary of the polarizing independence referendum in Catalonia.
A group of masked pro-separatists, held back by the ready-to-do police, threw them with eggs and also slid dye powder, resulting in dark dust clouds in the streets normally populated with tourists.
In the course of the day, the police also used their batting sticks to curb the fighting.
For several hours, pro-independence groups “no forget, no forgiveness, while they opposed Unionists who called “long live Spain”.
As reported by the local press, fourteen persons were treated for smaller injuries suffered during the protests.
A year after the referendum of 1 October, which was considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by separatist Catalans, the situation in the independent region remains very tense.
The voters had decided by overwhelming majority on independence, although the electoral participation was low, as the split opponents mostly boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to prevent voting in violent clashes in front of the electoral venues.
Pro-independence groups had camped outdoors on Friday night to prevent a demonstration for the national police.
The demonstration took place, but was forced to take another path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated with his wife in the protest of separatists, said that he no longer saw the prospects that Catalonia would gain independence, with hope.
“Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents weeping for joy because they could choose, but now we are stuck - he said.
Despite an important, though scarce, victory in the last December's regional elections, the Catalan pro-independence parties have had difficulties in maintaining the momentum this year. Many of their most well-known leaders are either in the themselves imposed exile or in detention, where they wait for their proceedings because of their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent Declaration of Independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in favor of the police on his phone, said that the conflict had been sparked by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is becoming more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in investigative office since the end of last year, announced his candidacy for election to the European Parliament next year.
\"As a candidate for the European election, the best way to challenge the reduction of democratic values and oppression by the Spanish government is by saying.
Londonderry: Men arrested after house had been rammed by car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a house in Londonderry had been rammed by a car several times.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 a.m. after British summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself were damaged.
In addition, an armbrush may have been shot on the car.
Menga hit means for Livingston 1:0 win over Rangers
Dolly Mengas' first goal for Livingston secured the victory.
The rising Livingston FC surprised the Rangers and led to the second defeat for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox Association.
Dolly Mengas Treffer proved crucial for Gary Holt's team to be equal to Hibernian in the second half of the season.
Gerrard's team will remain in the Premiership without a win out this season and will face the Hearts next Sunday, which are eight points behind.
Previously, the Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Europe League.
Livingston can in the meantime increase his winning series in the division to six games, that is, Chief Trainer Holt hasn't recorded any defeat since his acquisition of Kenny Miler in the last month.
Livingston misses opportunities for free-playing guests
Holt's team should have been in leadership long before the hit, since his directness put the Rangers in front of various problems.
Scott Robinson broke through but got slower in front of the gate. Then Alan Lithgow was only able to shoot far after he had been evicted to pass Craig Halkett's head shot at the gate.
The hosts were pleased to let the Rangers play in front of them, as they knew that they could hinder the guests in the case of standard situations.
In this way, the decisive goal came into being.
The Rangers gave a free shot, and Livingston presented a chance where Declan Gallagher and Robinson jointly took Menga to the shooting position. This shot the gate with a ball contact from the center of the prison room.
In this phase the Rangers had dominated the ball property, but were unable to overcome the host's defence, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly remained largely unheld.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos once forced Kelly to defend himself.
Scott Pittman was rejected by the Rangers' torguard Allan McGregor with his feet, and Lithgow dragged the ball from another standard situation of Livingston.
Flangen got back into Livingston's prison room and was regularly taken out of the danger zone, while two defendants, one of Halkett's opponents and one of them because of handplay, were denied.
“Pheomenal - by Livingston - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland in Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and a strong result for Livingston.
They were exceptionally excellent and again exceeded expectations during this upward trend.
Their way of playing and their team have hardly changed since their return to the top teams, but Holt deserves great praise for the way in which he has awakened the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great and led an excellent organized defence while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall kept on Trab throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
As well as being temporarily under Gerrard, they could not reach this standard.
Her last ball was insufficient - only once they were able to penetrate the host team - and this is something like a wake-up call for the Rangers who are in the middle of the table.
Receive Erdogan with mixed reactions in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), smiling faces and blue sky prevailed, when the heads of government of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which should serve to repair relations between NATO allies.
There had been disputes on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan traveled to Cologne to open a large new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police called security reasons for keeping a 25,000 people strong enough to gather in front of the mosque. However, many followers found themselves nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan demonstrators, many of them Kurds, also listened. They condemned Erdogan's policies as well as the decision of the German government to welcome him in the country.
The opposing protests reflect the polarizing effect of the visitor, who is praised by some German Turks as a hero and mocked by others as an autocrat.

Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flood-like floods (during areas may benefit)
It is rare for tropical depression to reach Arizona, but this is likely to happen at the beginning of next week when the remains of Hurricane Rosa move across the desert-shaped southwest and the risk of fluctuating floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings about flood-like floods on Monday and Tuesday from the west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada as well as to the southeast of California and Utah including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will approach rain on Monday evening and will move directly across Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix informed in a tweet that “since 1950 only ten tropical cyclones have come close to 320 kilometers as tropical storms or tropical depression Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 64 kilometres from the Arizona border,
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimeters of rainfall with up to 15 centimetres in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
In other areas of the south-west of the desert, including the central Rockies and the Great Basin, 2.5 to 5 centimeters are likely to be possible, and a total of up to 10 centimeters are possible.
For those who do not have the risk of fluctuating, the rainfall associated with pink may be a blessing due to the drought in the region.
Although floods are of great concern, this rain will probably be useful in some cases, as droughts are currently in the southwest.
According to the U. S. Drought Monitor, at least extreme drought occurs in a little over 40 percent of Arizona, the second highest category - reported weather.com.
First of all, the path of the hurricane means that Rosa will meet on land on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa will still have hurricane strength with maximum winds of 136 kilometers per hour and will be located 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico. Then the hurricane will move north with 19 kilometers per hour.
In the Pacific, the storm will hit colder water, weakening.
It is therefore expected that on Monday afternoon or evening in Mexico, Rosa will meet with the strength of a tropical storm on land.
The rainfall can be severe in parts of Mexico, so there is a significant risk of flooding.
“From Baja California to the northwest of the Sonora Desert, precipitation amounts of 7.5 to 15 centimetres are expected, with up to 25 centimeters possible - reported weather.com.
Then, as a tropical storm, Rosa will move northward across Mexico, reaching the border with Arizona on the early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, and then move through Arizona to the south of Utah until late Tuesday evening.
“As the main threat is expected in connection with Rosa or its remains very severe rainfall in Baja California, the northwest of the Sonora Desert and the desert-shaped southwest of the United States, the National Hurricane Center informed.
As a result of these rainfalls, floods of life in the desert and in the water-driven shelter as well as in mountainous areas of Erdrutsche are expected.
Attack in Midsome Norton: Four arrests for attempted murders
After the discovery of a 16-year-old with stab wounds in Somerset, three boys in teenage age and a 20-year-old man were arrested under the suspicion of attempted murder.
The teenager was found injured on Saturday at 4:00 p.m. in the Excelsior-Terrace area of Midsome Norton.
He was taken to a hospital, and his condition is \"stable\"
According to Avon and Somerset police, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and 20-year-old man was arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
The officials asked all those who had records of the events on a mobile phone to report.
Trump said that Kavanaugh suffered “under the community, the anger of the Democrats.
“A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the unscrupulous and unheard of tactics of the Democrats,” said Trump in a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh suffered the anger of the Democrats throughout the nomination process, including the community.
Kavanaugh said before the congress on Thursday and rejected the charge raised by Christine Blasey Ford, he sexually harassed them decades ago when both were teenagers.
Ford also expressed her accusation at the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that the American people saw the brilliance, quality and courage of Kavanaugh that day.
“A vote for the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for the confirmation of one of the most experienced legal heads of our time, a lawyer with an excellent balance in service to the general public,” he said to the crowd of his followers in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the nomination of Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of the participation of Republican voters in the interim elections.
\"Five weeks before one of the most important choices of our lives.
I don't act on, but in reality I'm acting on, he said.
“That’s why I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere, ”
Trump argued that the Democrats saw their mission of “conquering and blocking resistance”
The first important procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place in the Senate at the latest on Friday, said a senior GOP leader to CNN.
Hundreds killed in earthquakes in Indonesia, victims rise
According to the authorities of Saturday, at least 384 people were killed. Many of them were swam off as a result of a strong earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, which hit giant waves on the beaches.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Friday at a feast at the beach of the city of Palu, when, at the dawn of darkness, waves hit the beach up to six meters high and many people were torn to death and destroyed everything that was in their way.
The tsunami was preceded by an earthquake of 7.5.
“When the threat came up by the tsunami yesterday, people still went after their activities on the beach and did not immediately run away from it, and they fell victim to it,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the Indonesian Disaster Protection Authority BNPB at a conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, he swam cars, tree trunks and houses, he met on land all the time - he said Nugroho. He added that the tsunami had moved over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people were climbing trees on the run from the tsunami and had survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated and housed in 24 centres in Palu.
A number of destroyed buildings and shops, congested and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water, were published by the Civil Protection Authority.
On Saturday the coastal city was shaken by other aftershocks.
The earthquake series was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian authority BPPT (Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology) stated in a statement that energy released during the massive earthquake of Friday corresponded to the 200-fold energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
Due to the location of the city at the end of a long, narrow bay, the tsunami could have increased, said the Authority.
Nugroho described the damage as \"a comprehensive one\" and stated that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
According to his information, the bodies of some victims were found under the debris of collapsed buildings. 540 people were injured, and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the number of victims and damage could have been higher along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
The communication with Donggala, according to Nugrohos, was completely paralyzed, and there was no information.
According to a statement by the Red Cross, more than 300,000 people live there, and its employees and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse,” said the statement.
On Saturday, the Authority was often criticized for not having informed them that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the waves, according to official information, occurred at the time of the warning.
In social media, amateur photographs show a man on the upper floor of a building who desperately warns the people on the street under him in front of the nearby tsunami.
Within minutes a water wall on the shore forces and pools buildings and cars from it.
Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the recordings.
As a result of the earthquake and tsunami, there was a massive power failure, which interrupted communication around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue measures.
According to the authorities, the military has begun to send freight aircraft with support from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuaters still urgently need food and other vital goods.
The city's airport will remain closed until October and will only be opened for assistance.
For Sunday a visit by President Joko Widodo was planned at evacuation centres in Palu.
The number of tsunami victims has increased to more than 800.
The situation is very bad.
The employees of World Vision from Donggala have safely reached the city of Palu, where the staff in tent accommodations are located in the courtyard of their office, but after words Dosebas passed through scenes of desolation.
“They told me they had seen numerous destroyed houses, ” he said.
The situation is very bad.
Even when the relief groups began the hard task of launching disaster relief, some mounted that expert foreign aid would be prevented on the trip to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, financial assistance, supplies and personnel from abroad are only possible only if the place of disaster has been declared the national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened until now.
“At the moment, it’s another disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, spokesman of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says ‘okay, this is a national disaster’, we can accept international support, but this status does not yet apply “
While the second night since the earthquake and tsunami of Friday was sinking over Palu, friends and family members were hoping for one of the wonders that lighted up the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday a little boy was pulled out of a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been confined to her mother’s body for two days under debris.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian Paragliding National team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the beginning of this month in Indonesia to finish the Asian games.
Others of the Roa-Roa hotel prisoners, as Mandagi added, were his pupils.
“As a senior in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden to bear,” he said.
Gendon told how in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa-Roa hotel under the paragliders had made the round, WhatsApp had desperately sent news to the contestants from Palu who participated in the beach festival.
His news, however, led instead of blue hawks only to grey question marks.
“I think that means that the news has not been sent,” he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 while emptying a slot machine in Newport on the Levee
According to a Newport police press release, on Friday morning in Newport on the Levee Diebe stole an employee of Brink’s while filling up a cash machine $26,750.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied an ATM in the entertainment complex and wanted to invest more money, said Detective Dennis McCarthy in the press release.

According to the press release, witnesses saw several suspects flee from the crime scene, but the police did not indicate how many people were involved in the incident.

Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
In announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “The being formally known as Kanye West (the being officially known as Kanye West).
West, 41, has the nickname Ye for some time and has used it as the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change precedes his appearance at Saturday Night Live, where the release of his new album, Yandhi, is expected.
He acts as a substitute for the singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the producer, has declined for “emotional reasons.
The word is not only a shortening of its current professional name, but it has a religious significance for West, according to its own statement.
“I think “ye” is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means “du” - said West this year in a conversation about his album with Radio Moderator Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am we, it is us.
From Kanye, which means “the only one”, only “Ye” was simply a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, of everything.
The album reflects more on what we are,
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who used to work with West, has already written his name with and without binder and uppercase letters.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use the military against the civilian population
The elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez praised Obrador for never applying military violence against the civilian population, during which the 50th anniversary of bloody repression against students in his country approaches.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza, \"never use the military to suppress the Mexican people,
On October 2, 1968, soldiers fired a peaceful demonstration on the square, killing 300 people. At that time, left-wing student movements were establishing themselves throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador pledged to support young Mexicans through monthly aid for students and the opening of other free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training led young people into criminal gangs.
US should double financial resources for artificial intelligence
In view of China's increased activities in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double its spending on research in this field, says Investor and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow the AI announcements of various areas of the U.S. government, although the US generally lacks a formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: the country intends to become the No. 1 in the area of AI innovation by 2030.
“The doubling of the budget for AI research would be a good start in view of the fact that all other countries are so far behind the US. We are looking for the next AI breakthrough,” said Lee.
The doubling of financial resources could double the chances that the next major AI success would be achieved in the US, said Lee this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book \"AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order\" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of the company Synovation Venture, which has invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that defeated the highest-placed American Othello player. Later, he was executive executive of Microsoft Research and President of the Google branch in China.
Lee appreciated former U.S. government technology competitions such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and asked about the time of the next competition as he wanted to help identify the next visionaries.
According to Read Words, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain state subsidies.
“Not China takes away the academic top-ranking forces, but the companies,” said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have set up coryphaes from universities to work on AI in recent years.
In the opinion of the Commission, an amended immigration policy of the United States could also be conducive to the US's AI efforts.
“I think that in the area of AI, persons promoted should automatically be offered Greencards,” he said.
In July 2017, China's State Council presented its plan for the development of the next generation of AI technologies (Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan).
According to Read Words, the National Natural Science Foundation of China funds individuals to academic institutions similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organizations funds to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defense founded the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, in which partners from industry and science are to be involved. Furthermore, the White House announced the formation of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, DARPA announced the investment of $2 billion in the “AI Next” initiative this month.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) currently invests more than $100 million in AI research annually.
In the meantime, nothing has been done in US law on the formation of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on a change in the country name
The population of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday to change the country's name to \"Republic of North Macedonia\", which would lead to a decade-old dispute with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's applications for admission to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour means that it is entitled to the Greek territory. Therefore, Greece has filed a veto against taking Macedonia into NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name. Nationalist opponents argue, however, that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not vote in the referendum, and a boycott campaign is in doubt that the election will reach the 50 percent required for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the ballot was: \"Are you a member of NATO and the EU by adopting the agreement with Greece,
Supporters of the change of name to which Prime Minister Zoran Zaev belongs argue that for Macedonia, one of the countries resulting from the collapse of Yugoslavia, admission into organisations such as the EU and NATO is worth the price.
“I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, as this means all of us have a safer life - said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, enough Members have said that they would stick to the outcome so that it is crucial.
The amendment would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission said there were no reports on irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, the voter participation was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 where 66 per cent of registered voters gave their vote.
“I’m here to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko will vote in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018, in the referendum on the amendment of the country name which would open the way for Macedonia to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and presented chairs to tents set up by people who wanted to boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join raised heads, not through the back entrance,” said Kavadarkov.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the integration between Europe and Asia,
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will result in urgently needed investments for Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
\"I believe that a large majority will be in favour of this, as more than 80 percent of our citizens are for EU and NATO, said Zaev after his vote.
According to his words, a \"yes\" result would be a \"confirmation of our future\"
According to a survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum.
Another survey conducted by Macedonian broadcaster Telma TV found that 57 percent of respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
70 percent of them said they would vote with \"Yes\".
In order for the referendum to be successful, the voter participation must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first severe blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since its takeover of power last May.
View: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City maneuvered by the entire Brighton defence to achieve goal
On Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, Sergio Aguero and Raheim Sterling crossed the Brighton defence at the 2:0 victory of Manchester City.
Aguero made his hit look ridiculously simple in the 65th minute.
The Argentine attacker received a pass in the middle at the beginning of the sequence.
He raced between three Brighton defence players and then ran into the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green jerseys.
He played around a defender and then overtook several other defenders at the edge of Brighton's prison room.
He then shot a pass to Sterling's left.
The English attacker used his first ball contact in the penitentiary to play the ball back to Aguero, who crossed with his right shoe Brighton torguard Mathew Ryan and shot into the right side of the net.
“Aguero is struggling with problems in his feet,” City Manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he had reached a goal at that moment,
However, it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League duel.
This gate fell in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball at this train far on the side of Brighton.
He shot a good steep pass along the left flank to Leroy Sané.
Sané needed a few trains to control Sterling to the long corner.
The Sky-Blues attacker targeted the ball into the net, just before he slipped out.
City plays against Hoffenheim in the Champions League on Tuesday at 12:55 in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim.
Scherzer wants to destroy the Rockies game
Since the Nationals were expelled from the Playoff competition, there was little reason to force further use.
However, the always-powerful shearer hopes to stand on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies on the hill, but only if this is relevant for the Rockies, which have a game lead in the NL West in front of the Los Angeles Dodgers, for which playoffs.
The Rockies won at least one wildcard with a 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday evening, but still want to secure their first division title.
“Although we don’t play for anything, at least we can throw it because we know the atmosphere of the audience here in Denver and the other team would probably play at the highest level that would meet me this year.
Why should I not want to participate in this competition?
The Nationals have not yet announced a start-up player for Sunday, but according to reports, they are inclined to throw scissors in such a situation.
Scherzer, for whom this would be the 34th bet as a start player, practiced in the bullpen on Thursday and would throw at his normal day of rest on Sunday.
The Washington Right-Hander has this season's statistics of 18-7, an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump Quits Cundging in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation in connection with the Kavanaugh board selected by him for the Supreme Court when he spoke about the importance of the participation of Republican voters in the interim elections.
“All we’ve done is on the game in November.
Five weeks before one of the most important choices of our lives.
That's one of the big, big ones - I'm not acting on, but in reality I'm acting on, that's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere - he said.
Trump continued, \"You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by all means, they see the community, the abominability.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to pass to gain power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we won't give them,
The Democrats, he said, saw their mission of \"conquering and blocking resistance\"
\"And you have seen this in the last four days, he said, calling the Democrats \"worshipful and mean and repugnant and dishonest\"
He named the highest Democrat in the Senate's Judicial Committee, Senator Dianne Feinstein, which triggered loud buhruffs in the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you get the document outside?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh, no, I'm waiting for you - that was a really bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen -
Labour no longer allows all opinions to be taken into account.
The party is intolerant to those who express their views.
When the momentum activists in my local party voted to tease me, this was little surprising.
Finally, I am the last of a number of Labour members to be told that they are not welcome - just because we say our opinion.
My colleague Joan Ryan was treated similarly, as she had vigorously opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized with the Tadel proposal for having taken a different view than Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically on similar issues, about which Jeremy did not have an opinion with former top politicians.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated that “the meetings should all be inclusive and productive,
Mostly the Friday evening GC sessions in my eight years as a local Labour representative were exactly that.
Unfortunately, most of the meetings are not marked by this tone, and the promised, more friendly, more cautious policy has long been forgotten if it has ever begun.
It is becoming more and more evident that differing views in the Labour Party are not tolerated and that any opinion on whether or not they are accepted by the party's top.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a party leader. Colleagues, with whom I previously believed to share similar political views, now expected me to take a resurgence and take positions that I would otherwise never have agreed with, be it with regard to national security or the European internal market.
Whenever I speak publicly, where it doesn't matter what I say, I follow a chimptirade in the social media, which calls for my election, calling for the political center and saying that I shouldn't be a member of the Labour Party.
And with this experience, I'm not alone.
In fact, I know that I am better off than some of my colleagues, since the comments I make are mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues, who face daily a flood of sexist or racist insults, yet never give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political age is that vaccinations have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn demanded last week that the Labour Party promote a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we no longer allow all opinions to apply, and with every proposal for distrust and any amendment to the electoral rules, the party becomes more narrow.
In the last two years, I have often been advised to withdraw my head and not express my opinion so clearly. Then I would have \"no problems\"
But I did not go into politics.
Since I was a student 32 years ago, prompted by the neglect of the Thatcher government, because of which my classroom was literally separated in the overall school that Labour Party joined, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most - as the Council of Commons as well as as as as the Minister of Cabinet.
I have never made a helm out of my political views, nor in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be unclear in any way about my political positions and about areas where I did not agree with the current leadership.
I would just like to say to the supporters of the Friday request: given the fact that the country is going to rush into a Brexit that will harm households, businesses and our public service, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
In fact, however, I address this message not to Nottingham momentum, but to my voters, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that so many threats or political intentions will not stop me from acting in my opinion best interests of you all.

Ayr vs. Melrose 38:17: Unbeatable Ayr team rises at the top
Two late trials may have somewhat distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr earned the victory in this extremely entertaining game of the day in Tennent's Premiership.
They are now the only one of the ten teams unbeated at the top of the table.
Finally, the success of the home team was due to their superior defenses as well as to their better exploitation of opportunities, and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
“We’ve been put to the test in our games so far, and we’re still unbeaten, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: \"Recognition for Ayr, they've valued their chances better than we do\"
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, which was raised by Frazier Climo, led Ayr. However, due to a yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, who had been released for the game from the Warriors, Melrose was able to speak the numbers, and Jason Baggot started a non-higher attempt.
Climo developed the leadership of Ayr with a penitentiary before reaching a hit directly at the half-time and then in the alone, made an increased attempt, so that it stood for Ayr for break 17:5.
Melrose started the second half, however, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was increased by Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
Following this, there was a prolonged interruption due to a serious injury by Ruaridh Knott, who was carried by the field. After the continuation, Ayr built his lead by an attempt by Stafford McDowall raised by Climo.
Then, as Captain of Ayr, Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, and again, at the end of a phase, Melrose had enormous pressure to pay the additional man by a non-higher attempt by Bruce Colvine.
However, the home team returned, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for tackling without ball against Climo, MacPherson got a touchdown from the penalty road behind the advancing Ayr package.
Climo has almost increased since the interruption, after Kyle Rowe captured David Armstrong's boxkick and released flanker Gregor Henry for the fifth attempt at the home team.
“Still Game -Star seems ready for new career in gastronomy
\"Still Game-Star Ford Kieran seems to be ready for a change to the hospitality after it turns out that he was called the managing director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, where he writes screenplays and in which he plays one of the main roles together with his long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last of the show, and Kiernan seems to plan a life after Craiglang.

“The sea belongs to us”: Bolivia, enclosed by land, hopes that a court will open its way to the Pacific
Matrosen patrols in front of the marine headquarters decorated with tauwerk in La Paz.
In public buildings a sea blue flag blows.
Fleet bases from the Titicacase to the Amazon carry the motto: “The sea is our legitimate property.
Reclaiming is a duty,
Everywhere in Bolivia, enclosed by country, the memory of the 19th-century bloody conflict over resources lost to Chile is as alive as the desire to drive across the Pacific again.
These hopes may not be as strong as they have been for decades, as Bolivia is awaiting a judgment of the International Court of Justice to be held on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and expects the result of course with a positive attitude,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Throughout the country, many Bolivians will follow the IGH’s ruling on large screens, hoping that the Court will decide in favor of Bolivia’s claim. According to this, Chile is obliged after decades of sporadic talks to negotiate Bolivia’s sovereign access to the sea.
For Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, who will face a controversial struggle for his re-election next year, the judgment on Monday is also much on the game.
“We’re about to return to the Pacific,” he vowed at the end of August.
Some analysts, however, consider it unlikely that the court would decide in favor of Bolivia, and believe that this would change little.
The UN body based in the Netherlands is not authorized to address Chilean territory, and has stated that it will not decide on the outcome of possible talks.
Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law, concluded that the case was \"not complicated\".
Far from supporting Bolivia’s case, the last four years could also mean a setback.
“The current Bolivian government has torn the question of access to the sea in itself,” said Zárate.
She pointed out that Morales' warrior rhetoric had choked any remaining good will of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will eventually continue their talks, but after these events this will be extremely difficult.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the view that the court's decision was unusually rapid.
On Monday Bolivia has an extraordinary opportunity to open up a new era of relations with Chile, and an opportunity to end the 139-year-old disputes for mutual benefit, he said.
Calzadilla also contends that morality, still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, uses the theme of the sea as a political force.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access to the Pacific,” he added.
\"The verdict is a chance to realize that we must overcome the past,
North Korea says atomic disarmament will only take place if it can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that his nation will never destroy their nuclear weapons first if she cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday before the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to implement the promises made during a summit between the heads of state of the rivals in Singapore.
His statements come at a time when U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo seems to be about three months after the summit with North Korean head of state Kim Jong-un in Singapore to start the fixed nuclear diplomacy again.
Ri described the idea that further sanctions and the resistance of the United States against a declaration to end the Korean War would ever force the North to the knees, as a “spinning”
Washington is skeptical and does not want to agree to the statement without Pjöngyang taking essential disarmament steps first.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread scepticism that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning an arsenal in which the country probably sees the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans a visit to Pyongyang for next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris show the latest collections for huge head coverings that will soon be available in the shopping streets near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely shield the sun, you do not have to search any longer.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed a range of crazy oversized head coverings for their summer collection 2019, which fascinated the fashion world at the Paris fashion week.
It is extremely impractical hats that Instagram has flooded this summer, and these designers have sent their exciting creations over the runway.
The most outstanding piece of Valentino was an extravagant beige hat with a feather-like wide edge that pushed the heads of the models straight too.
As other over-dimensional accessories, they have been shown with jeweled watermelons, a magic hat and even a pineapple. However, these are not intended to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a series of bizarre masks - just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colourful masks were fitted with upholstered lips and had more similarity to Hannibal Lecter than to Haute Couture.
A creation resembled a diving equipment, including snorkel and diver glasses, while another looked like a melted ice bag.
And if you want to set another huge fashion statement, you're lucky.
Fashion observers predict that the huge head coverings could find their way into shopping streets near you.
The over-dimensional hats follow the straw hat with a width of 60 centimeters, all of which range from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the extremely impractical hat, which hit large waves in the social media, sent another great creation over the walkway: a beach bag made of straw that was almost as big as the model wearing a bath suit that held the bag.
The bass bag in reddish orange with bast fringes and a white leather hem was the most striking piece of Jacquemus' summer 2019 collection, La Riviera, during the Paris fashion week
Prominent stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: “I expect large hats and beach bags to be available on the shopping streets for next summer. The designer has attracted so much attention that the demand for over-dimensional accessories will hardly be ignored,
John Edward: Language skills essential for world citizens
Scotland's independent schools continue to be characterized by academic excellence. This continued in 2018 with other outstanding exam results and is only supported by individual and joint successes in the fields of sports, art, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students from all over Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) aim to care for their students and their parents at the highest possible level.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for education and higher education, the profession of their choice and their place as world citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we see that modern languages are still popular and desirable in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to someone in a language he understands, you reach his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you reach his heart,
This is an impressive reminder that we can not only rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The current test results of this year show that languages with the highest rates of existence are at the top of the rankings of independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who learned foreign languages achieved Note A during the higher tests.
From the data collected from 74 SCIS member schools, it was revealed that 72 percent of the students in Mandarin received the A note during the higher examinations, while 72 percent of the students who learned German achieved 69 percent of the students who learned French, and 63 percent of the students who learned Spanish also achieved the A note.
This illustrates that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as an important knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now considered to be elective subjects as well as STEM subjects (natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculums of independent schools and at other locations.
According to a survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014, 17 percent of the reasons why employers called for the problems of employing open jobs were related to a lack of language skills.
Language skills are therefore increasingly needed when it comes to preparing young people for their future jobs.
As more and more open places require languages, this knowledge is indispensable in a globalised world.
Regardless of the profession chosen, young people who have learned a second language will have a real advantage through such lifelong ability in the future.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give multilingual people an advantage before competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 percent did not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, and French was spoken as the only language of a two-digit percentage share (15 percent).
For this reason, it is important for the children of today that we now invest in language lessons.
Children who speak several languages, especially languages of developing countries, will have better opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, different languages are taught at all schools.
A number of schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while other languages, with a view to 2020, will be considered the most important for the United Kingdom, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Wherever your child's interests lie, in independent schools a number of languages with appropriately specialized teachers will always be available.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment that prepares the children and equips them with the skills necessary for their success, as always the future looks.
At this point in a global economic environment, it cannot be denied that languages are still of fundamental importance for the future of the country. Therefore, this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should actually be regarded as \"international communication skills\"
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this choice, diversity and excellence.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron in front of Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
For fans who want to see LeBron James join the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time, the waiting will soon end.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday in the opening game of the season.
How many minutes he will play, however, is not yet fixed.
“It’s going to be more than one and less than 48 - Walton said on Laker’s official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will probably play only a few minutes.
At the beginning of this week, James was asked about his plans for the six games of the Lakers.
“I don’t need preseason games at this stage of my career to prepare me,” he said.
Time for Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts this evening in Wheeling, West Virginia, a series of electoral campaigns.
This is the first of Trump's five rallyes planned for the next week, among others in well-kept places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
In view of the floating vote on the confirmation of his election for the vacancy at the Supreme Court, Trump wants to build support for the upcoming mid-term elections in November, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress.
When does Trump’s rally take place in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for today, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 19:00 (East Coast Time).
You can track Trump's rally in West Virginia below as livestream on YouTube online.
Trump will probably address the hearings of the Kavanaugh board nominated for the Supreme Court to accusations of sexual misconduct that were carried out this week in a tense atmosphere. The expected Senate vote on confirmation will remain in the room for up to a week while the FBI conducts investigations.
The main objective of this series is, however, to support Republicans who have to face difficult elections in November.
For this reason, President Trump's electoral team told Reuters that these five rallyes will help to mobilise \"volunteers and followers, while the Republicans will try to preserve and expand their majority in the Senate and in the House of Representatives,
“The control of Congress is so important for its plans that the President will travel to as many states as possible while the operational election season is approaching,” said a Trump election spokesman who did not want to call his name to Reuters.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, supporters from \"Ohio and Pennsylvania and report media from Pittsburgh could participate in the program planned for tonight at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling.
The visit on Saturday is Trump's second visit this month to West Virginia, the state he won in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points.
Trump tries to support the Republican Senate candidates in polls from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come to try to drive him into the polls,” said Simon Haeder, politician at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The United States team is showing a willingness to fight to maintain the hope for the individual on Sunday.
After three one-sided rounds, the four parties on Saturday afternoon may have been exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of the momentum is as a sport concept a pure invention, but one that the players really believe in, and that is especially in competitions like this one.
So where is the momentum of their opinion now?
“They were in charge with six points, and now it’s four, so I think that means a small moment for us,” said Jordan Spieth on leaving the venue.
Europe is of course in favour and lies four points ahead, while twelve others follow.
However, according to Spieth, the Americans feel some wind in their sails and have reason to feel encouraged, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and can show three out of four points.
Spieth was incredibly strong from drop to green and progresses with a good example.
The ghtural enthusiasm cries became louder in the course of his round when he lowered an important putt to decide the fourth match with four points for both of them after he and Thomas had returned to two holes with two points.
His putt, who decided the match on the 15th hole for them, triggered a similar scream, which suggests that the American team is not yet out of play.
“I really have to cut myself in and take care of my own game,” Spieth said.
This is all that remains for the individual players.
18 holes to set a sign.
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood have won more points than Spieth and Thomas as the only player in the last two days and thus undoubtedly wrote the story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's unequal but sympathetic duo is four out of four points and cannot do anything wrong.
“Moliwood” wasn’t the only couple who didn’t beat Bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided Bogeys on Saturday morning, on Friday afternoon and at the rear nine holes on Friday morning.
This series and the seemingly between them and the amount of running energy that they are the players to beat it on Sunday. Fleetwood and Molinari are the most popular players who will win a possible European victory at the fall of the sun over Le Golf National.
Preferably both simultaneously on different holes.
Talking about European fame, however, would be premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a short trial with Sergio Garcia, the four hero of the morning, who played together with Alex Noren.
One Bogey and two doubles at the front nine holes brought the Spanish and Sweden into a clamp that they could not reach.
On Sunday, however, no one can help them out of the terminal.
The four and four pairings are due to the interactions between the pairs, the advice they give or don't give, and the way a strategy can change rapidly, so fascinatingly from close up.
The Europeans have played better as a team so far and are clearly in the lead on the last day. However, this fourth round has also shown that the team of the United States is ready to fight, which some, especially in the United States, have doubted.
Europe will be in the lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup with 10:6
Europe, after the four-parties and four-parties from Saturday to the United States, is in front of the United States with 10:6 and takes a solid lead in the last day of the Ryder Cup.
The brilliant Duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari went ahead with two victories over the tiger Woods that were struggling with difficulties and thus was able to book four points in Le Golf National.
The European team led by Thomas Bjørn, who wants to regain the trophy lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the four in the morning against the wrongly playing American team and won the series with 3:1.
In the four-parties, the United States resisted more and won two matches, but could not pick up the back.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points in the twelve individuals played on Sundays to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood won four points in a row as the first European newcomer, while he and Molinari, baptized after a sensational weekend, won four points only as a second duo in the history of the Ryder Cup in their four opening matches.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fours, they harmonized and beat the enchanted Woods and the American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau with an even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who had dragged through two matches on Saturday, had his brilliance flashed occasionally, but now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fours and fours and sevens in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested during the fours in the morning, returned and played the four parties as partner of Henrik Stenson. They won 2&1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the number one and three of the world.
For Europe, however, on this pleasant windy day south-west of Paris, there was not everything they imagined.
The three-time Major Winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the medal for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a 2&1 victory in the fours over the Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter, playing for Spain, and beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the fours after losing the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup it was only twice that a team came back after it had gone into the individual with a four-point reserve. However, as a title holder there is enough for Furyk's team to keep the trophy.
After having been in second place for two days, it doesn't look as if they could start a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea rejects unilateral disarmament without confidence
North Korea's Foreign Minister said on Saturday before the United Nations that continued sanctions would deepen their distrust of the United States and that under these circumstances the country would not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said to the annual General Assembly of the World Organization that in the past year, North Korea has taken essential measures, for example, it has stopped nuclear and rocket tests, dismantled the nuclear test site and committed itself not to multiply nuclear weapons and technologies.
“We don’t see any corresponding reaction from the US, however,” he said.
“Without confidence in the US, there is no confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances we will not be one-sided at first.”
While Ri was familiar with North Korean complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phase - approach to denuclearisation, in which North Korea would reward successive steps, repeated, his statement seemed significant insofar as it did not reject unilateral denuclearization from the outset, as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit meeting between a U.S. President and a North Korean leader on 12 June in Singapore. In this, Kim had assured to work on the “denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula” while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea aims to end an official Korean war from 1950 to 1953, while the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
In addition, Washington resists demands for a lock-up of severe international sanctions against North Korea.
\"The United States is on first denuclearisation and increasing pressure by sanctions to achieve its goal by force, and is even opposed to the \"explanation of the end of the war\" said Ri.
“The assumption that sanctions can force us into our knees is a brain sparing of those who know nothing about us.
However, the problem is that the continued sanctions deepen our distrust,
Ri did not embark on plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. Head of State had highlighted at the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the Minister pointed out three meetings between Kim and the South Korean Head of State, Moon Jae-in, in the past five months and added: \"If South Korea were instead of the United States the other party in the denuclearisation issue, the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula would not have brought about this halt,
Nevertheless, the tone of Ris' speech differed greatly from his speech last year when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target North Korea's missiles on the mainland of the United States, after \"the evil president, Trump Kim, had called them a \"rocket man\" on suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who had threatened with the “plenty destruction” of North Korea last year, praised Kim for his courage in terms of disarmament. However, he said that there was still much work to be done and that the sanctions had to remain in force until the denuclearisation of North Korea.
On Wednesday Trump said that he has no time frame for it: \"Whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter\"
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council must reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo, however, said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: \"The enforcement of the sanctions of the Security Council must in any case be vigorously continued until we have achieved the complete, final and verified denuclearisation,
The Security Council has unanimously reinforced the sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to financially dry out Pyongyang's nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri at the edge of the UN General Assembly and then said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was unsuccessful.
In July, when he left Pyongyang, he said that progress had been made, only to be accused by North Korea hours later, that he had made \"full-time claims\".
This month, North Korea praised a meeting with Moon to reduce a rocket base and a nuclear complex when the United States took \"responsive measures\".
He said that Kim told him that the \"responsible measures\" were security guarantees that Trump had given in Singapore, as well as steps to normalise relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn in a course to sleep enough
A new course at Harvard University ensures that all students get more sleep this year in basic studies. This is a measure against the expanding macho culture to keep up with caffeine and learn all night long.
One scientist has found that students at the world's leading university are often unneeded when it comes to paying attention.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, Professor of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, and is the first course in the United States in his opinion.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep withdrawal on learning.
“At the conclusion, a girl came to me and asked, “Why do I only experience it now, in my last year?”
According to her words, no one had ever told her how important sleep is. That surprised me, he said to The Telegraph.
The course for the first time this year explained to students how the basics of good sleep habits contribute to academic and sporting performance and also improve general well-being.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Managing Director of the University's Health Services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after finding that students were suffering from severe sleep loss during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, students will see the image of a room in a residential home and click on coffee cups, curtains, training shoes and books. They will receive information about the effect of caffeine and light as well as the effects of lack of sleep on the sport performance and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another section, participants learn that long-term sleep withdrawal can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke and cancer.
Then, using a map of the university grounds with interactive symbols, they are encouraged to think about their daily routine.
\"We know that it will not change students' behavior immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know this - just as you have the right to know how the decision to smoke affects your health - Professor Czeisler added.
The pride of pushing a night shift was still widespread, he said and added that modern technologies and the growing pressure on students made sleep shortages a growing problem.
Sufficiently ensuring good sleep, the \"secret weapon\" of all students should be against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said. In addition, weight gain could be avoided, as sleep loss puts the brain into the hunger mode, so that they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California studying chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to design the course. He had completed one of his courses in Harvard last year.
He said the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to push for a university-wide course.
He hopes that in the next step, all postgraduate students will be asked to complete a similar study program before taking up their studies at the competition-oriented university.
According to Professor Czeisler’s recommendation, students should be aware of the harmful effects of the “blue light” that comes from electronic screens and LED lights and can bring the circadian rhythm out of the clock. This leads to problems during sleep.
Livingston vs Rangers 1:0: Menga-tor forces Gerrards players
The Rangers lost another outplay, when the hit of Dolly Menga for Steven Gerrard's uniquely playing team meant a 0:1 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to book their first victory from the 4-1 Triumph at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holts Team added Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager, so that his team returned eight points behind the hearts leading in Ladbroke's premiere.
Menga met seven minutes before the half-time, and the low-inspiring Rangers did not seem to have a chance to compensate.
While the Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston rises to third place and lies behind Hibernian only in the goal difference.
The Rangers also threaten further trouble, after line judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound by an object apparently thrown out of the guest block.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, took over the Ayr and reached the half-final of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, remained with the same eleven Livingston players who took one point from the Hearts last week and had to be enthusiastic about how his well-trained team held their opponent on step and third under pressure.
The Rangers dominated the ball, but Livingston reached more if they had the ball.
You should have reached a goal after just two minutes, when Mengas first paid Scott Pittman to Allan McGregors Tor. However, the midfielder missed his chance and shot next.
Then, a long escape from Keaghan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow was only able to shoot at the rear of the pussies.
The Rangers took control, but their game worked more hopefully than convinced in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos was obviously of the opinion that after a quarter of an hour, he should have received a criminal offence due to a clash between him and Steven Lawless, but Arbitrary Steven Thomson did not allow the complaints of the Colombian to apply.
The Rangers had only two goal shots in the first half, but the former Ibrox tutor Liam Kelly had little trouble with Lassana Coulibay's headball and a tough shot by Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingston's hits may not match the game course in the 34th minute, it is not to be denied that they had earned him for their hard work alone.
Again, the Rangers could not deal with a ball shot by Jacobs in a standard situation.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher shot the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept the rest and picked Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard acted half-time and exchanged coulibaly against Ryan Kent. The change almost immediately showed effect when the wing player placed Morelos, but the impressive Kelly rushed from his line to block the ball.
Livingston, however, continued to bring the guests to play the game that lay with them, while Lithgow and Halkett were given a long ball after the other.
Holt's team could have expanded their lead in the last phase, but McGregor stood up well and defended Jacobs before Lithgow shot a headball out of the corner.
The Rangers exchanger Glenn Middleton also called for a criminal offence after a joint with Jacobs, but Thomson saw it again.
Almanach: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Almanach: On September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as a violin counter.
The violin counter has since become the standard element of science has also become a standard element of pop culture, for example in the 1950 film \"Bells of Coronado\" with seemingly unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: \"What is in all the world is that \"
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter used to search for radioactive minerals such as uranium.
If you set up these headphones, you can hear the effects of radioactive radiation in the minerals,
Evans: \"In fact, I hear a knock.\"
“Hans - Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention that bears its name continues to live.
New cancer vaccine can help the immune system to \"see\" detarized cells
A new cancer vaccine can help the immune system to \"see\" and destroy denatured cells.
As part of treatment, the vaccine helps the immune system recognize detarted cells.
In the method, immune cells that are changed in the laboratory are taken from a patient.
These cells can see a lot of cancers of common protein and are then injected again.
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
The ovary cancer of a woman treated with the vaccine that causes the immune system to recognize detarized cells disappeared for more than 18 months.
In this method, immune cells are taken from a patient, which are changed in the laboratory so that they can see the many cancers common to HER2. Next, the cells are injected again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the United States National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland said: “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine,
HER2 promotes the growth of various types of cancer, including breast, eggstock, lung and intestinal cancer, as Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar method in which patients are taken immune cells and taught to attack cancer cells has helped treat a leukaemia.
Kanye West released a Pro-Trump-Tirade after his appearance at SNL and carried a MAGA-head (\"Make America Great Again\")
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was built at Saturday Night Live in the studio after he had preached extensively to US President Donald Trump and said he wanted to join the presidential candidate in 2020.
After singing his third title of the evening, Ghost Town, and wearing a Make-America-Great-Again-Cape, he continued his campaign against the Democrats with a chimp canonade, stressing his support for Trump.
“I’m so often asked by whites, “How can you like Trump? He’s a racist.”
So if I were to worry about racism, I would have left America a long time ago, he said.
SNL began the broadcast with a sketch with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star made fun of the accusations of sexual harassment raised by Christine Blasey Ford about Brett Kavanaugh's statement before the Senate's judicial committee.
Although the recording of West's chimpftirade was not sent, it was uploaded by the comedian Chris Rock in social media.
It's not clear if Rock wanted to make fun of the release about West.
West also complained to the audience that he had difficulties behind the stage because of his head covering.
\"They have harassed me behind the stage.
They said “don’t go out with the cap”.
You scared me!
And then they say that I was in a sinking area, he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: \"If you want to see the sunken area, he said he'd be wearing \"my supermancape, because that means you can't tell me what I have to do. You want it to progress with the world?
Try it with love,
His remarks triggered at least twice Buhrüfe from the audience, and SNL contributors were painfully touched, reported Variety. One person said to the magazine: \"It was still dead in the studio,
West had been late as a replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, the rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused many with a lecture entitled \"I Love it\" in which he was dressed as a perrier bottle.
West received support from Candace Turner, the leader of the conservative group TPUSA. She tweeted: “To one of the bravest spirits: DANKE, DAS DUST YOU THE MASE DESTROYED HAST,
However, the talk show moderator Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just himself and that was absolutely wonderful.
“But I do NOT want to reward someone who, in my opinion, makes and gives his own ideology harmful to my community (by buying his music or his clothes or supporting his “art”.
He's free.
The same applies to us, and added it.
Before the show, the rapper had announced at Twitter that he had changed his name and was now, \"The being formally known as Kanye West\" (the being officially known as Kanye West).
He is not the first artist to change his name, and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper colleague Snoop Dogg was named Snoop Lion, and of course Prince, the late music legend, changed his name into a symbol and then into \"The Artist Formally Known As Prince\" (The former known as Prince).

‘Game of Thrones’Star Kit Harington Attacks Toxic Manhood
Kit Harington is known for his role as a sword swinging Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series \"Game of Thrones\".
However, the 31-year-old actor has attacked the stereotype of the macho hero. He said that such roles on the screen would result in boys often having the feeling of having to be strong in order to be respected.
In conversation with \"The Sunday Times Culture\", Harington said that he believed something had gone wrong and asked how to solve the problem of toxic malehood in the #MeToo Age.
Harington, who recently married also the Rose Leslie, also involved in “Game of Thrones”, admitted that the problem was very important to him.
“I personally find the question very important at the moment about what went wrong with the maleity,” he said.
“What have we taught adult men about the problem that we are now observing?
Harington believes that television may be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity due to the very masculine characters.
He continued: “What is born, and what has been learned?
What is taught on television and on the street that gives boys the feeling of having to embody this particular side of a man?
I think this is really one of the big questions of our time: how do we change that?
Because the young men have clearly gone wrong,
In addition, he admitted in the interview that after the end of the series in the next summer he would not participate in Prequels or Sequences of \"Game of Thrones\". He had \"just enough battle fields and horses\"
As of November, Harington is seen in a new edition of Sam Shepard's \"True West\", the story of a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently told him that the best thing for him was \"Game of Thrones\" was that he met his wife Rose.
“I met my wife at this mission, so in this way I received my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose Leslie played with many Emmy's excellent fantasy series Ygritte, the lover of Harington's character Jon Snow.
Both of them married on Leslie's family estate in Scotland in June 2018.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced an increase of 14°% in the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
Some 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
In contrast to the past, the transmission took place in the vast majority of the new cases through sexual intercourse.
Previously, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who thus infected with HIV has been reduced almost to zero, and Chinese health officials have given birth at a conference in Yunnan Province.
In comparison, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000 in China.
HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is an acute problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against members of the LGBT community is supposed to be widespread.
Due to the conservative values of the country, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sexual intercourse with men ultimately marry women.
Many of the disease transmissions are due to insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised, among other things, general access to HIV medicines to address the problem.
Maxine Waters argues that employees were able to search the data of the GOP senators, criticising \"dangerous lies\" and \"sacrifice theories\"
Maxine Waters, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, contends on Saturday that a member of her staff has published the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the Wikipedia pages of the Members.
The Democrat from Los Angeles believed that the allegations of “ultra-right-winged” experts and websites would be spread.
“Believes, lies, and even more repugnant lies,” said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The published information should include the private addresses and phone numbers of US senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday. They were published during the hearing of a Senate Committee on the accusations raised against Supreme Court candidates Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct by an unknown person in the government district.
The publication took place after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the contributions was assigned to Waters’ office and published the information of a member of Waters’ staff, reported The Hill.
“This unfounded accusation is completely wrong and an absolute lie - Waters continued.
\"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal data and security were endangered by these fraudulent and false accusations, was in no way responsible for the search through this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie,
Waters’ statement quickly triggered criticism online, including that of Ari Fleischer, a former press speaker of the White House.
“This dementia is angry,” writes Fleischer.
“This suggests that it does not have the right temperament to be a member of Congress.
Persons who are accused of something they have not done must not be angry.
You must not be in spite of them.
They must not question the motives of the prosecutor.
They need to be calm and quiet,
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters’ reaction to the criticism of Democrats to Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of having become angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who joined the semi-time elections to dissolve water, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“Great thing, if that is true, he tweeted.
Waters said in her statement that her office had informed the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities of these fraudulent claims.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed, she continued, and that they will be brought to account for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all the members of my staff,
Criticism of \"Johnny English\" Man lives only three times - - weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now traditional to look for Brexit references in every British-colored new film. This seems to be also true for this revival of the action comedy parody franchise \"Johnny English\", which began in 2003 with \"Johnny English\" The spy who painted it, and in 2011 with \"Johnny English\" - Now quite, it has been stuttering again.
Will an ironic self-parody on the subject, how obviously do we damage to the new export chance for the nation?
In any case, Johnny English's license for the second time was extended for the glamorous, grimassen-cut and incompetent, and his name is more than anything else that makes him a general comic creation for cinema visitors in the non-English-speaking area.
Of course, he is again the clumsy secret agent who considers himself bizarre for cool and worldly, while in reality he is made up of something Clouseau, a priest Mr. Bean and a bell of this guy who contributed a single note to the title melody of the \"The Hour of the Winner\" at the 2012 Olympic Games opening.
In addition, the figure was originally based on the chaos left behind by travellers and international secret agents, who played Atkinson in the now forgotten Barclaycard television spots.
Johnny English's last adventure has one or two nice moments.
I liked Johnny English approaching a helicopter in a medieval armour and relegating the rotor blades to his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comics is happening today, but the humor seems rather weak and strangely superfluous, especially because the \"serious\" film series such as \"007\" and \"Mission Impossible\" now offer even securely comodian elements.
The humor seems to be more directed to children than to adults, and for me Johnny English's crazy mischieves are not as intrusive and focused as Atkinson's silent movie gags in the role of Bean.
The eternal premise is now that Britain is at great risk.
A cyberhacker has infiltrated the super-secret British spy network and revealed the identities of all British agents in action, very to the detriment of the serving agent, a regrettable small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw hall for the Prime Minister, an inflated and distressed figure already standing before the total collapse due to her political unbelief: Emma Thompson gives her best with this Quasi-Teresa-May character, but the script doesn't give much to work with.
Their intelligence consultants inform them that all active spies have been disarmed and therefore they have to get someone out of retirement.
This includes the tolpatschige Johnny English himself, who now works as a teacher at a sent facility, but has informal teaching in the work as an undercover agent. There are a few gags, because English offers a \"School of Rock\"-remembering espionage academy.
English is brought back to Whitehall to an emergency meeting and reunited with his former hard-tested Kumpan Bough, which is played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a nervous woman of the higher society, in whose role Vicki Pepperdine is somewhat wasteful.
So Batman and Robin, who are always doing everything terrible wrong in the secret service of your Majesty, are back in action. They meet Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme Fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is dangerously in charge of a charismatic tech billionaire, the dark Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy, who claims to be able to solve the computer problems of the UK.
English and Bough start their Odyssey of the great-sken Spässe: As Kellner dresses, they set fire to a nice French restaurant, they provide chaos as they smuggle on board Volta's luxury yacht, and English triggers pure anarchy when he tries to familiarize himself with the inside of Volta's house with the help of a virtual reality headset.
In this last sequence all registers are drawn, but as sympathetic and fun as they are, the topic is already dealt with in detail in children's television.
Very moderate substance.
As with the other Johnny-English films, I had to ask myself: “Can’t the UK film industry Rowan Atkinson give a role that really meets his talent?
Labour contends to work on a plan after which the British work four days a week, but should be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is to consider a radical plan that provides that the British work four days a week, but are paid for five days.
The party intends to report that corporate leaders will pass on the savings achieved by the AI revolution (artificial intelligence) in the form of an additional day off to employees.
This would have meant that employees would have a three-day weekend, but would still receive the same payment.
According to sources, the idea of the economic agenda of the party and its plans to shift the balance in the country for the benefit of workers is appropriate.
The conversion to a four-day week was supported by the Trades Union Congress (Trades Union Congress) as an opportunity for workers to take advantage of the benefits of the changing economy.
A high level source from the Labour Party said to the Sunday Times: “Before the end of the year, a directive review is expected to be announced.
“A change will not take place overnight, but a four-day working week is an effort that is consistent with the party’s approach to restoring the economic balance in favour of workers and with the party’s general industrial policy strategy,
The Labour Party would not be the first party to advocate such an idea. Already the Green Party promised the introduction of a 4 day week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the approach is not supported by the Labour Party at all.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “In a 4-day week, it is not party policy and it is not considered by the Party,
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell focused at the Labour Conference last week on his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of \"anonymous directors\" and \"profit makers\" from public supply companies.
The plans of the shadow chancellor also mean that the current shareholders of the water supply companies may not hold back their total share, as a Labour government could make deductions due to alleged misconduct.
He also confirmed the corresponding plans to recruit employees to the board of companies and set up Inclusive Ownership Funds to hand over 10% of private enterprise's equity to employees who collect annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy, in the news magazine 60 minutes, say whether the investigation of the FBI in the Kavanaugh case could change their opinion
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed a final vote on his appointment as Judge at the Supreme Court for at least a week and raises the question of whether the results of the Authority could influence Republican senators to gain their support.
In an interview on Sunday, 60 minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could bring something to a close, which could ultimately change their opinion.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I told the trial that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after that, this claim was expressed, and asked if he did.
He was determined, determined and unmistakably understood,
Graham's voice, however, seems to have been carved in stone.
“My opinion is on Brett Kavanaugh’s case, and there would have to be a bomb, ” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know the following: Brett fought this vehemently, adding Graham and referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And all who called it could not confirm it,” she said.
It's 36 years now.
And I can't detect any changes,
What is the Global Citizen Festival and was helped to reduce poverty in the context of this festival?
This Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival will take place in New York City, an annual music festival with an impressive lineup to stars and an equally impressive mission to combat poverty in the world.
Tens of thousands will attend the Global Citizen Festival, which will be held for the 7th time this year, in order not only to experience the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the actual goal of the event: combating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which took place for the first time in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project. As part of this project, an international interest group is trying to combat poverty by encouraging more and more people to participate actively in poverty reduction.
In order to get a free ticket for the event (the other option would be to buy a VIP ticket), you have to complete a number of tasks. These include actions such as volunteering, communicating with a leading politician worldwide (by e-mail or phone) or similar measures to increase awareness of the goal of combating poverty.
How successful is the project when considering that global citizens remain 12 years to reach the goal?
Is the idea of setting up a cool free concert, a sensible opportunity to convince others that it is time to act, or just another case of so-called clicktivism - if you think you can change something by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Global Citizens announced that since 2011 the project has been able to record more than 19 million actions by its supporters and achieve different goals.
These actions will have helped to encourage leading politicians around the world to announce commitments and strategies worth more than 37 billion dollars, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group cited 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, at least $10 billion of which have already been paid out or entered into by fundraising.
According to the group's estimates, the secured funds have had a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
Some of the most important commitments are the The Power of Nutrition project, a partnership of investors and implementers based in the United Kingdom, who have committed themselves to supporting children in their optimal development, and who have promised to help Rwanda with $35 million to combat malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 Tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history,” the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, told the audience during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also announced that after more than 5,000 actions calling on Britain to improve the nutritional situation of mothers and children, the government announced funding for the The Power of Nutrition project to reach 5 million women and children and to provide nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, namely, what are the reasons why global citizens can combat extreme poverty,
They replied: “It will be a long and arduous path with heights and depths.
But just like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements in front of us, we will be successful as we are stronger and more influential together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists who attend this year’s New York event. Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman are also presenters.
The US could use the Navy for blockade purposes to hinder Russian energy exports - Ministry of the Interior
According to Washington Examine, Washington is able to rely on the Navy if necessary so that energy from Russia does not reach the markets including the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of State Ryan Zinke informed.
Zinc claimed that the use of Russia in Syria is an excuse to explore new energy markets. Russia is currently active at the invitation of the legitimate government in these areas.
“I think the real reason for the use of Russia in the Middle East is the negotiation of new energy sales markets, as in Eastern Europe,” he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to do this.
“The United States, together with the Navy, can ensure that the sea roads remain open and block them if necessary in order to ensure that the energy from Russia does not reach the market,” he informed.
Zinke turned to the participants in the Consumer Energy Alliance event, a non-profit group that sees itself as the “power users’ voices” in the United States.
He drew a comparison between Washington's approaches in dealing with Russia and Iran and found that they are virtually identical.
\"The use and replacement of fuels is more or less the economic option in Iran and Russia, he said, while he described Russia as \"one trick pony\" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements were made when the government under Trump was expanding the export of liquid natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is far more cost-effective for consumers in Europe.
To this end, the government officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the “unprecedented - pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which, according to Trump Berlin, became “inmate - Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 pipeline worth 11 billion US dollars, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is an exclusively economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's massive resistance to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we all think that energy should not be used as a means to exert pressure, and that consumers can choose suppliers themselves,” said Russian energy minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with U.S. energy minister Rick Perry in September in Moscow.
The USA has received counterwind from Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the Federal Association of German Industry (BDI), has asked the US to stand out from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“It’s a big problem when a third party intervenes in our energy supply,” says BDI Dieter Kempf’s Executive Board after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren wants to \"explain precisely\" a presidential candidate 2020, says the Senator for Massachusetts
The Senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would “check out exactly” a presidential candidate after the interim elections.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering a candidate.
According to The Hill, Warren said that it would be time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and that includes women at the top.
Warren plans to examine precisely a presidential candidacy after 6 November.
Warren said during the meeting that President Trump is turning this country in the wrong direction.
“I’m very concerned about the way Donald Trump deals with our democracy,” she said.
In her criticism of Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate for the Supreme Court, Warren did not take a leaf in front of her mouth.
In a tweet on Friday, she announced that an FBI investigation is of course required before voting.
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren voters did not believe that they should apply for 2020.
According to the survey of Suffolk University Political Research Center and Boston Globe, 58 percent of the potential voters in Massachusetts stated that the senator should not be able to.
32 percent of voters supported such a candidate.
The survey showed more support for a candidate of former Governor Deval Patrick, 38 percent who advocated a potential candidate, and 48 percent who opposed it.
The former Vice-President Joe Biden and the Senator of Vermont, Bernie Sanders, are among the other names of prominent Democrats who come into contact with a possible candidate in 2020.
According to Associated Press, Biden announced that he would decide officially until January.
Sarah Palin speaks on Donald Trump-Ralley for post-traumatic stress disorder, under which Track Palin suffers
Track Palin, 26, was in Iraq for a year.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday evening.
“What my son goes through, what he goes through, when he comes back, all of this can be felt by other families who feel the effects of PTBS and part of the wounds with which our soldiers return, she told the audience at a Ralley for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to his arrest as a “Elephant in the Room” and said about her son and other war veterans that they changed their return, that they would come back home and ask themselves if there was such respect for what other soldiers and pilots and any other member of the military had given to the country.
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was accused of domestic violence by a woman, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesperson of the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and D.C. support an appeal to the new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support a legal aid to the new US policy, refusing victims of gang activities or domestic violence asylum.
Representatives of the 18 states and the district filed a declaration of jurisdiction on Friday in Washington to support an asylum applicant who questioned the policy, reported NBC News.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace-Agains Sessions complaint, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed against federal policy in August, was not announced.
She announced that her partner, and his violent band sons, had abused them, but U.S. officials refused to apply for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The prosecutors who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where many people apply for asylum in the United States, as nations that face major problems with criminal gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy raised a decision of the 2014 Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed illegal immigrants to apply for asylum on the escape from domestic violence.
In a statement on Friday, the District of Columbia's Advocate General, Karl Racine, said that the new policy ignores decades of legislation at the state, federal and international level,
\"The Federal Act provides that all applications for asylum are judged based on the facts and circumstances of the application, and this court violates this principle, was stated in the Court's reasoned statement.
Furthermore, the lawyers argued in the statement that the policy that immigrants refuse access to the country had an adverse effect on the economy in the United States, as immigrants could rather act than entrepreneurs and provide the necessary labour.
In June, General Federal Attorney Jeff Sessions ordered that immigration judges who fled from domestic violence and violence of criminal gangs no longer grant asylum.
“Asylum is available for those who leave their homeland because they are persecuted or because of fear of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political conviction,” said Sessions in its announcement of 11 June politics.
It was never the plan to eliminate all problems by granting asylum, even all the serious problems people face every day.
Despaired rescue attempts in Palu, as the number of deaths in the race doubled over time
For the survivors, the situation became increasingly worse.
“It’s all very exciting,” says 35-year-old Mother Risa Kusuma, calming her little fiendish son in a rescue center in the destroyed city center of Palu.
“Every minute a new ambulance comes with dead people.
Clean drinking water is scarce
Residents returned to their destroyed houses to collect their perplexed possessions and possessions and to store everything they could find.
Hundreds were injured, and the staff of the hospitals damaged by the earthquake with the strength 7.5 were completely overloaded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who moved into vertebral fractures and a broken shoulder, remained outside Palu's military hospital, where patients were treated on the outside because of the persistent severe aftershocks.
With tears in his eyes, he told how the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“ Everything went far too fast.
I think I was stuck in under the walls - he reported the Associated Press and added that the reason for the stay in the city was a wedding.
“I heard my wife’s call for help, but then I was calm.
I don't know what happened to my wife and my child.
I can only hope they're in a safe place,
US ambassador accuses China of tyranny with \"propaganda ads\"
One week after an official Chinese newspaper had issued a four-page advertisement in an American daily that announced the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of exploiting the American press for progaganda purposes.
USA Donald Trump referred to China's paid Supplement Daily in Des Moines Register last Wednesday, the best-selling magazine in Iowa, after he accused China of interfering in the U.S. congressional elections on 6 November, a charge that China contests.
Trump's accusations that Beijing has tried to interfere in US elections correspond to the US officials' announcement to Reuters; a new phase of an escalating campaign triggered by Washington to exert pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to make advertising advertisements for the promotion of the economy, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an external trade war, with tariffs on imports for both countries.
The Chinese retaliation tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were supposed to meet exporters in states such as Iowa who supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, who exports agricultural products to China to large extent, announced that Beijing has damaged workers, farmers and businesses.
China, according to Branstad in a statement in Des Moines Register of Sunday, now doubles this tyranny by sending propaganda advertisements in its own free press in the US.
“With the spread of their propaganda, the Chinese government claims the American tradition of free expression and the independent press by switching paid advertising to the Des Moines Register,” writes Branstad.
“In contrast, you will find only a limited number of votes against at the newspaper kiosks here in Beijing and will not see any real reflection of the differing opinions that the Chinese might have about China’s disturbing economic development, given the fact that the media are firmly in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that one of the most famous newspapers in China did not accept the offer to publish his article, but did not name the name of the newspaper.
Republicans told voters before the interim elections with the debacle around Kavanaugh, warning observers
Since many of the most influential Republicans support and defend the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, in the face of several accusations of sexual violence, observers have warned of a counter-reaction during the upcoming interim elections, which might be directed particularly by women.
The mood in this context was extremely tense, and most Republicans have already indicated that they are continuing with a vote.
“You can’t undo things like that,” said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said that he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute speech (R-Arizona) would be sufficient for an FBI investigation to upset angry voters.
“Women don’t forget what was yesterday, they don’t forget it tomorrow and not in November,” she said on Friday Karine Jean-Pierre, first consultant and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the daily newspaper in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, demonstrators in the corridor area of the Senate called for “November is coming” when Republicans controlling the Judicial Committee decided to hold on to Kavanaughs nomination and reported that despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's statement, Mic.
Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are an extremely important topic, said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political observer of the news page.
“People say it’s already high, that’s true.
But it could be higher, especially among voters in the suburbs and among younger voters, people between 18 and 29, who, although they may not like the President, often do not choose,
Even before Ford's public statement detailing their accusations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court candidate, observers indicated that a counter-reaction could be the result if the Republicans advanced the confirmation.
“This situation is a disparaging situation for the GOP,” said NBC News at the beginning of the last week, Michael Steele, former Chairman of the Republican National Committee.
\"It is not only about the vote of the panel, about the final vote or about the review of Kavanaughs; it is also about the way the Republicans dealt with it and how they dealt with it; Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that supports the election of Democrats, told the news channel.
The Americans seem to disagree, however, with whom they should believe because of the statements of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a slightly greater share on the side of the latter.
A new survey by YouGov showed that 41% of the respondents were either definitive or likely convinced of Ford's statement, while 35% indicated that they definitely or probably gave Kavanaugh faith.
In addition, 38% indicated that they believed that Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied to his statement, while 30% indicated the same about Ford.
According to Flake’s pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the accusations brought by Ford and at least another complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford gave a statement last week before the Senate's Judicial Committee that she was attacked by the drunk Kavanaugh at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court had paid off his genitals when they were at a party during their study period in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to oppose Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, currently brings a start-up to the market with the aim of establishing a competition for Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of technology legends, Inrupt, is a company based on the open source platform Solid by Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who gets access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee made the best of the fact that the intention behind Inrupt is the world domination.
“We need to become active now,” he said on the topic of startup.
\"It's a historic moment,
The app uses Solid's technology to allow users to create their own personal online data storage or a POD.

Similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all content is available in one browser and at the same time.
The special thing about the personal online data storage is that the user can decide who can access what data alone.
The company describes this concept as personal strengthening and development via data.
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company uses resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid available to all.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, some developers who have been hired to work on this project, as well as a community volunteer programmer. Furthermore, a security platform acquired by IBM is used.
At the beginning of this week, technology developers worldwide can create their own decentralized apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee announced that he and his team will not exchange with Facebook and Google about whether a comprehensive change is to be made, in which their entire business models will be completely redesigned overnight.

In a post on medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that it is wrong to provide commercial energy generation and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new solid-based web.
In 1994, Berners-Lee re-designed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been involved in the debate on network neutrality.
Even with the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I am very confident about this new era of the web,” he added.
Priest Bernard Vann, carrier of the Victoria Cross in World War I, was honored
The only clergyman of the Church of England, who was awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I, was honoured in his hometown 100 years later.
Colonel Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 due to his involvement in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed four days later by a sharpman and never learned that he had won the highest British war award.
His two grandsons revealed a memorial stone on Sunday at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of the grandsons, Michael Vann, said that this act was full of symbolism, as the memorial stone was revealed just 100 years after the heroate for which his grandfather was awarded.
According to The London Gazette, Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September 1918, with dense fog and violent gun shootings of field cannons and machine guns.
Later, he pushed forward on the line of fire and led the line forward with the greatest bravery, before he sailed alone with a field weapon and shut down three of the military units.
Colonel Vann was shot by a German sniper on October 4, 1918; a little more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's deeds were something he could never justify, and at the same time something that would make him humble.
After the parade under the direction of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band, he joined his brother Dr. James Vann.
Michael Vann stated that he felt very honored to be able to participate in the parade and added that the bravery of a real hero will be seen, in particular, by the support of many people.
MMA fans stayed awake all night to watch Bellator 206, instead there was Peppa Pig
Imagine you've stayed awake all night to see an exciting Bellator 206 and then you can't watch the main event.
The bill of San Jose contained 13 battles, including 6 on the main map, and was broadcast live all night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6 p.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for their fight, the audience in the United Kingdom was not shocked when suddenly Peppa Pig was seen.
Some remained unaffected after being awake until early morning hours to see the battle in particular.
A fan described on Twitter the change to the trick film figure as a somehow bad joke.
\"As a result of a government regulation, these contents are classified as non-judgmental, so that at 6 p.m. they had to be changed to a children's broadcast, said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President in the marketing and communication area at Bellator, when he was asked to transfer.
“Peppa, the pig, exactly “
The CEO at Bellator, Scott Coker, announced that the company will work out the process plan to take into account viewers from the UK in the future.
“I think the problem could have already been solved during the repetition game,” he said.
“But it is 6 a.m. on a Sunday to the visitors in the United Kingdom, and we will not solve the incident by Sunday our time, Monday local time there.
But we'll stay there.
There was a lot of communication during the changeover. It was very nice and it wasn't always all nice.
We have tried to solve the problem, and have assumed that it is a technical disorder.
What was not the case was a problem on the part of the government.
I promise it won't happen again.
We will reduce the whole to 5 instead of 6 battles, as in the normal case, and we have tried to offer the fans the best possible experiences.
The whole situation is quite regrettable.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels \"understanding\" in the subject of sexuality
Tom Daley, who has participated in various Olympic games as a water jumper, says that he grew up feeling like everyone else was submerged because of his sexuality. But this feeling motivated him to become so successful.
The 24-year-old said that he had only realized at the continuing school that he is different from others.
In the first radio 4 Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out on gay rights to encourage others.
He also meant that since he became a father, the victories at the Olympic games are no longer so important to him.
The actual moderator of the long-term show, Kirsty Young, pauses disease-related for several months.
In the first broadcast of Laverne, he said that he used to consider himself inferior in comparison to others, since the love of boys and girls was socially unacceptable.
He said: “To this day it is felt to be inferior to others and different from others, reason for my power and strength and ultimately for my success,
He wanted to prove that he was a very special person to disappoint no one when his sexual orientation became known.
The two-time bronze medal winner at the Olympic Games is now a prominent LGBT activist and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to advance the decriminalisation of homosexuality in other countries.
He said that he had expressed himself on this issue because, fortunately, he could live without restrictions and without discrimination and would like to encourage others.
The triple world champion fell in love with the U.S. filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013. Knowing to fall in love with a man was an absolute surprise for him.
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he said that the age difference was never a topic.
He thinks that if you had to go through so much as a child and a teenager, he would participate in the Olympics for the first time with 14 years and his father died of cancer three years later, it is difficult to find someone with similar experiences at the same age.
Since June, the couple has a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley says that his entire vision has changed since then.
Last year, he'd had everything turned around for gold medals.
But for him there is now more important than Olympia gold medals.
His son, Robbie, is now his main winner.
He bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after the diagnosis of brain tumor.
Daley said that his father did not accept the coming death, and one of the last things he asked about were the tickets for London 2012, since he wanted to be at the front.
“I couldn’t tell him he wouldn’t be there anymore,” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only after that did I finally realize that he is not invincible,” he continued.
Daley won the bronze medal at the 2012 Olympic Games.
“I just knew that it was always my dream to dive in the Olympic games to the local audience, that was the madness,” he said.
His first song selection - Proud by Heather Small - was also influenced by it. He heard the song in front of the Olympic Games and was still caring for geese skin.

Mickelson, who is not currently in shape, sits at the Ryder Cup on Saturday on the replacement bench
The American Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday at his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he has to make a very hard effort so that the whole thing doesn't become a debacle.
Mickelson, who played for the 12th time at the event, was sent to the replacement bench by Captain Jim Furyk for the Fourballs and Foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the heart of the event as most of the time, the five-fold Majorssieger spent his day firing others and working on his game, hoping to solve the problems that burdened him.
Even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old Mickelson was never the most direct golfer and thus no ideal occupation for the narrow Le Golf National golf course, where misdirected balls are regularly punished.
And as if the place itself would not be discouraging enough, Mickelson meets the perfectionist British Open Champion Francesco Molinari in the ninth game on Sunday, who joined Tommy Fleetwood, a newcomer at these tournaments, to win all four games this week.
If the Americans set up a hot start at the 12 single games with four points of resistance, Mickelson's game could prove to be absolutely crucial.
Furyk was confident about Mickelson and couldn't add much to that.
“He was perfectly aware of his present role, gave me a clap on my back and put his arm around me and said he’s ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has quite a lot of self-confidence.
He is one of the world-famous personalities and he has done so much for these teams in the past and also this week.
I hadn't thought he was in two games.
I had presented myself more, but that's how it went now and that's what we expected.
He wants to be like everyone else,
Mickelson will reach the Nick Faldos record for most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
It could mean the end of a Ryder Cup career, which never completely corresponded to the highlights of his personal record.
Mickelson can record 18 victories, had to insert 20 defeats and reached seven half-times, although Furek reported that already his presence has enriched the team alone.
“He’s funny and sarcastic, original and likes to make some fun, and he’s a great person who’s popular with the whole team,” he explained.
“I think the younger players were happy to get to know him a little more this week. It was fun to watch them.
He's a really interesting person, who gives a lot of impulses,
Captain Thomas Bjørn knows that it can be over with the lead soon
Thomas Bjørn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a great advance that leads to the last single games in the Ryder Cup can quickly become an unpleasant situation.
In 1997, the Dane debuted in Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead against the Americans, but only barely crossed the finish line and went on the lead with the smallest possible lead and won a 141⁄2-131⁄2 victory.
“The thought remains that we had a great advance in Valderrama, we had a great advance in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but that was only a short time,” Bjørn said, “after he had seen the victory of 5-3 of the class of 2018 both on Friday and yesterday, to lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
Experience shows me and all team members that it's not over.
It's going to be all right tomorrow.
Put yourself in the stuff and do exactly the right thing.
The whole thing is only over when the points are on the display board.
We have a goal. We want to win this trophy, and our focus is right there.
I've always told you, I'm focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we're completely aware of what's facing us on the other hand: the best players in the world,
Asked about the performance that his players performed on a difficult golf course, Bjorn continued: “I would never miss this.
Tomorrow's going to be another caliber.
Tomorrow the individual benefits are in the foreground, and that is a completely different matter.
It's great to work with a partner when things run well, but if you're alone out there, then you'll be tested as a golfer up to the limits of his abilities.
You have to make that clear to the players: get the best out of you tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he also has to get the best out of himself,
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent Jim Furyk will make sure that his players cut off better than in the team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself stood on both sides of those big turns on the last tournament day. He stood in Brookline on the winning side before standing on the side of the losers to Europe’s “wonder of Medinah”.
“I remember every damn word,” he replied to the question as Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, motivated his players before the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you would like to take off the quick start you saw in Brookline and in Medinah.
When the momentum beats in one direction, it puts the middle games under a lot of pressure.
We set up our team accordingly and send our boys out the way we feel, you know, we're trying to magic tomorrow,
Thomas was assigned the task to counter, he had to compete in the top game against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as other Europeans in the upper half of the rankings.
“I decided for the boys in this order, as I believe it covers everything, so Bjorn said about his choice for the individual meetings.
Germany's new warship again delayed
The latest Fregate of the German Navy should have already been put into service in 2014 to replace the years of warships from the Cold War. However, according to local media, due to faulty systems and rapid growing costs, it will not be delivered until the earliest next year.
The commissioning of the \"Rheinland-Pfalz\" to the pilot ship of the brand new Fregates of the \"Baden-Württemberg\" class, according to the time that a military spokesman called for, was now moved to the first half of 2019.
The ship would have already been put into service in 2014, but the ambitious project was plagued by disturbing problems after delivery.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class, which were already ordered by the Navy in 2007, are to replace the old fregates of the Bremen class.
They are designed to contain a powerful cannon, a range of flight defence missiles and sea target aircraft, as well as tarn technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic reflection.
Another important feature is longer maintenance periods. It should be possible that the latest frigates do not have to return to their home ports for up to two years.
However, the ongoing delays can lead to the already obsolete, according to Die Zeit, of the state of the modern warships that Germany is supposed to represent as sea power.
The Fregatte F125, who was persecuted by the accident, entered the headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take off the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship to the shipyard after its delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media called a series of significant “software and hardware errors” that would have made the new ship useless in a combat situation.
Software problems are particularly serious as ships of the Baden-Württemberg class are operated by a crew of only 120 sailors, only about half as many as on the older fregates of the Bremen class.
It has also been known that the ship is far too heavy, which leads to loss of performance and prevents the Navy from carrying out upgrade measures in the future.
The 7,000 tons heavy Rhineland-Palatinate was apparently twice as heavy as ships with a similar class used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the costs of the whole project, including the training costs of the crew, became a problem.
Apparently, the cost increased to breathtaking €3.1 billion, compared to the originally planned €2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigate are particularly significant given the recent warnings that Germany's sea power was shrinking.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartel, the German Federal Minister for Wehrmand, confirmed that the navy was “going out of operational ships”
Bartels said that the problem grew over time, as old ships were taken out of service but no replacement ships had been provided.
He complained that none of the Frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could be taken from the Navy.
National Trust hears the secret life of bats
New research is being carried out in a Scottish Highlands estate to show how bats use the landscape in food search.
It is hoped that the results will provide further insights into the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help to guide future nature conservation activities.
The study carried out by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will track dwarf and mosquito bats as well as the brown Langohr and water bats in Inverewe Garden in West Ross.
Special recording devices are set up at key positions on the property to record the activities of bats throughout the season.
Employees of the NHS and volunteers will also conduct mobile investigations with portable detectors.
In a sound analysis of all recordings by experts, the frequency of bat calls is determined and the species is determined.
A map and a report of the habitat are then created to create a detailed picture of their behavior at the landscape level.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Adviser for the NTS, hopes that the results will show which areas of habitat are most important for bats and how these are used by each species.
These data will help determine the benefits of measures to manage the habitat, such as the creation of meadows, and show how to obtain forest areas for bats and other related species.
In Scotland and the whole of the United Kingdom, bat stocks have declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects places of sleep and leads to the loss of habitat.
Windwheels and lighting can also pose a risk, just as do flycatchers and chemical treatment of building materials or also attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not really blind.
However, because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated species of echo to detect insects and obstacles in their flight.
The NTS, responsible for the care of over 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout Scotland, takes the theme of bats very seriously.
It has 10 trained experts who regularly conduct investigations, inspections of sleeping places and sometimes rescue measures.
The organization has even established Scotland's first and only bat reserve in the Thrave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's 10 bat species.
Governor David Thompson explains that the property is the ideal habitat for them.
“Here in Threave we have a great area for bats,” he explains.
“We have the old buildings, many old trees and an excellent living space.
But there are many things we don't yet know about bats, so here and on other goods we carry out these work, which will help us learn more about what bats need to feel comfortable,
He stressed the importance of first excluding the presence of bats before maintenance work in the goods, since it was possible that the involuntary destruction of a single nest site could kill up to 400 females and young animals and wipe out the entire population on site.
Fleder mice are protected and it is illegal to kill them, harass them or destroy their nesting sites.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish member of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the population to help.
She explains: “We still have to learn a lot about bats, and in many of our species we don’t know how their populations are,
Ronaldo rejects rape charges while his lawyers want to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo referred to him as \"Fake News\" and said that people want to become famous by using his name.
His lawyers plan to sue the news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The storm of the national team of Portugal and Juventus Turin was accused of having raped an American named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Apparently he then paid her 375,000 dollars to buy her silence to the incident, according to Der Spiegel on Friday.
In an Instagram live video to its 142 million followers, 33-year-old Ronaldo named the reports only hours after their release as \"Fake News\"
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they reported today: Fake News - said the five-time winner of the balloon d’Or in the camera.
“You want to profile yourself by using my name.
That's normal.
You want to be famous with my name, but that's part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything is good - the player added smilingly.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue the mirror because of the accusations, which, according to Reuters, they call \"unallowable reporting of suspicions in the field of privacy\".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player demanded compensation for “moral damages at an altitude corresponding to the severity of the legal violation which is probably one of the most serious violations of personality rights in recent years,
The alleged incident is scheduled to take place in 2009 in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After they met in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went into the player's room, where, according to documents filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada, he had presumably raped them.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo went to her knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was \"99 percent a good guy\" who was \"one percent\".
In the documents it is claimed that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sex, but said it had been agreed upon.
Mayorga also claims that she had gone to the police and had taken photos of her injuries in a hospital, but had later agreed to an extrajudicial agreement, since she had \"anxiety for retaliation\" and was worried to be \"publicly humiliated\".
The 34-year-old said that she was now trying to end the agreement, as she was still traumatized due to the alleged incident.
Ronaldo, at the time of the alleged incident, was about to switch from Manchester United to Real Madrid and changed this summer in a 100 million euro deal to the Italian giant Juve.
Brexit: The United Kingdom would ‘ever regret’ the loss of car manufacturers
After Brexit lost its status as a world leader of cars, the United Kingdom would “ever regret it,” said economic minister Greg Clark.
He continued that it was “suspecting” that the BBC told Toyota UK that it would interrupt production at the Burnaston plant at Derby ahead of time, that Great Britain should leave the EU.
“We need a deal, so Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer indicated that the impact of delays on the border could lead to loss of jobs in a no-deal brexit.
The work in Burnaston, where Toyota's product lines Auris and Avensis are produced, last year produced almost 150,000 vehicles, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I am convinced that we will experience production stops in our plant at the end of March at an uncontrolled Brexit - according to Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s Managing Director in Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also raised concerns about a tough EU exit without agreement and its impact on cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, says that it will close his mini-work in Oxford after the Brexit for one month.
According to the car manufacturers, the main concerns are related to risks within the supply chain with a tough Brexit.
Toyota's manufacturing plant is operated on a just-in-time basis, which means that the parts are delivered every 37 minutes by suppliers from both the United Kingdom and the EU to manufacture the cars on order.
Should the United Kingdom leave the EU on 29 March without an agreement, there could be interruptions at the borders which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and narrowings in the parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to have a warehouse in the factory in Derbyshire that extended for more than a day, the company explained why production would have to be interrupted.
Clark explained that Theresa May's Chequers plan on the future relationship with the EU is precisely designed to avoid such border controls,
“We need a deal. We want the best deal that allows us, as I said, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to take this opportunity,” he explained in the broadcast today of BBC Radio 4.
\"The findings not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers show that we must be able to continue the very successful supply chains so far\"
Toyota could not indicate how long production would have to be interrupted, but in the long run warned that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been employed in Burnaston for 24 years and is the highest official of the Unite trade union, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “My experience of never coming back these jobs once they are gone.
A government spokesperson said: \"We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU,
Trump's planned meeting with Rosenstein could be moved again according to the White House
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein could continue to be postponed for another week, during the dispute over the candidates for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, it was called out of the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein has examined the oversight of the work of the special investigator Robert Mueller, who examines the electoral interferences by Russia, links between Trump's advisers and Russia, as well as a possible judicial barrier by the president.
The question of whether Trump would fire Deputy Justice Minister and thereby endanger Mueller's independence has been the subject of rumors in Washington for a month.
At the beginning of the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein addressed the possibility of secretly recording his talks with Trump and the President's office with the help of the 25th constitutional supplement.
Rosenstein demented the report.
However, he went to the White House last Monday, while new reports about his supposed resignation became known.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was present at the UN General Assembly in New York at that time, was announced for the coming Thursday,
Trump said he would prefer Rosenstein not to dismiss it, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid colliding with the hearing before the U.S. Senate Justice Committee, in which both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who had accused him of sexual abuse.
On Friday Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of the charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate's full vote.
Trump's press spokesman Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
She replied to a question about the meeting with Rosenstein: “A date has not yet been set for that. It could be this week, but I can still imagine that it will be postponed for another week, given all the things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
That will show up, but I always like to keep the press up to date,
Some reporters may object to this assertion: Sanders has not held the White House press conference since September 10.
Moderator Chris Wallace asked her for the reason.
Sanders explained that the low frequency of the press conferences did not give rise to a rejection of the \"effect hashing\" of TV reporters, but admitted: \"I would not deny that they are doing effect hashing\"
She then claimed that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
The President made more question-and-answer rounds than any President before him - she explained, without giving precise evidence: \"We have considered these figures,
There will still be press conferences, says Sanders, but if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it is far better than talking to me.
We often try to do this and you have seen that we have done so in the last few weeks, which will take the place of the press conference if you can speak with the President of the United States,
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York, the President may have explained why this is the case when he placed a bizarre appearance from the rower before assembled reporters.
Minister of Health writes about the Brexit concerns of EU employees of the Scottish NHS
The Minister for Health is turning to persons from the EU abroad working in Scotland's National Health Service (NHS) to express the country's gratitude and to express the desire that they remain in the country after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the United Kingdom left the EU.
The Scottish government has already agreed to bear the cost of applications for residence permits for EU citizens working in Scotland’s decentralized public service.
In your letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer the departure negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU were continued and decisions are expected to take place this autumn.
However, the UK government has also reinforced preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I'm aware of what disturbing times this must be for all of you.
That is why I wanted to express once again how much I value the contribution of each and every employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, thus benefiting the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is fully your home and we would be very happy if you stayed here,
Christion Abercrombie was subjected to an emergency operation after a head injury
The linebacker of the Tennessee State Tigers Christion Abercrombie, according to Mike Organ of Tennessee State, was subjected to an emergency operation on Saturday at the 31-27 defeat against the Vanderbilt Commodores.
Rod Reed, head coach of Tennessee State, explained that the injury occurred just before the half-time break.
“He came to the sideline and just collapsed there, so Reed.
Trainer and medical personnel supplied abercrombie with oxygen on the sideline before being put on a load and transported off for further examinations.
A spokesman from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville,Tennessee that Abercrombie left the OP at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “but no details of the type or extent of the injury were known and Tennessee State tried to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a so-called Redshirt, plays at Tennessee State in his first season after he changed from Illinois.
Before he left the game on Saturday, he recorded a total of 5 tackles, with his total number rising to 18 tackles in the season.
Foreign investors will have to pay higher stamp tax for real estate purchases in the United Kingdom
In future, investors from abroad will have to pay a higher stamp tax for the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom.
This step is intended to stem the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign for young voters
The increase in stamping fees will affect all those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance expects up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people
Theresa May will announce today that foreign investors will have to pay a higher stamp fee if you buy real estate in the United Kingdom, with the added income to benefit homeless people.
This step is an attempt to curb Jeremy Corbyn's success among young voters, who promises to provide more affordable housing and to take top servants into the visor.
The increase in stamp tax is imposed on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and additional revenue is to be added to the government campaign against homelessness.
In addition to the current stamp tax and, including the increase introduced two years ago, the supplement is raised to second apartments and residential real estate left for rent, which could amount to up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects up to 120 million pounds per year by the step with additional revenue.
Estimated 13 percent of newly built properties in London are purchased by investors who are not located in the United Kingdom, thus driving prices up and making it more difficult for first-time buyers to foot in the real estate business.
Many prosperous areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become ‘spirit cities’ due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the United Kingdom.
The new strategy follows only a few weeks after Boris Johnson has declared himself to be a reduction in stamp tax to enable more young people to become the first home.
He accused construction companies of holding up real estate prices by buying land without using it, and urged Theresa May to give up quotas on affordable housing to end Britain's \"hospital disgrace\"
Opposition leader Corbyn announced an exciting series of proposals for residential reforms ranging from a rental price commitment to banning spaces for no trivial reason.
He also wants to give city councils more powers in building new apartments.
May said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate my time as Prime Minister of the restoration of the British dream, according to which the life from generation to generation would be improved.
And that means repairing our broken housing market.
Great Britain will always be open to people who live and work here and want to build a life.
However, it cannot be right that it is as easy for people who do not live in the UK as for businesses based abroad to buy real estate as for those who are working hard.
The dream of the home has become too distant for too many people, and the worthlessness of homelessness continues to be too big a problem,
Jack Ross: “My biggest goal is to manage Scotland”
Jack Ross, the head of Sunderland, says that it is his “largest goal” to eventually become the manager of the Scottish team.
The 42-year-old Scotsman enjoys the challenge of entering the club from the north-east of England's new life, which is on the third place in League One, and which lacks three points at the top.
He moved back to the stage of Light this summer after driving St. Mirren back to the first Scottish league in the last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I managed to get it to the bank and that's what Ross told the broadcast sports sound from BBC Scotland.
“But I often saw Scotland playing Hampden as a child with my father, and that’s something that always pulls me back.
However, this possibility would only come if I were successful in the club management,
Ross predecessors in Sunderland's role as manager include Dock Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former chief of Alloa Athletic stated that he was not afraid to step into the footsteps of such established names with such a club after he had previously refused offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
The success will be measured with me at the moment on whether I can return the club to the Premier League.
In view of the structure and the possibilities in this club, he is undoubtedly part of the Premier League - he explained.
“It’s not an easy task to get him there, but I’d probably only appreciate my time here as a success if I bring the club back to it,”
Ross can show a first three-year management career, after a phase as Deputy Chief at Dumbarton and a 15-month job as Trainer in Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from the relegation to the third league and helped St. Mirren to win the championship from the side of the relegation in the following season.
Ross says he feels better now than ever before in his player career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“That was a real path of divorce,” he recalls, when he took over the responsibility of Alloa.
“I really think management was the right thing for me, more than games.
It sounds funny because I wasn't working badly, could live well of it and experienced some very pleasant high-phases.
But playing can be hard.
There are many things you have to go through every week.
I still do this in terms of stress and pressure in my job, but management feels right.
I've always wanted to manage and now I've done it. I've never felt so comfortable in my skin all my life as an adult,

The perfect time for a glass of beer is on Saturday at 17:30, according to a study
The heat wave in summer has missed the revenue of Great Britain's crumbling pubs, while restaurant chains are under greater pressure.
Pub and bar companies recorded a sales growth of 2.7 percent in July. However, revenue from restaurants decreased by 4.8 percent, according to statistics.
Peter Martin of CGA’s company counsellor, who compiled the figures, stated: “Annual sunshine and England’s longer than expected sustained participation in the football World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern to the previous June, where pubs could record sales increases of 2.8 percent. However, the restaurant hit even harder.
The decline of 1.8 percent, which the restaurant industry recorded in June, continued in July.
Pubs and bars with a focus on drinks showed by far the best performance, with a land-adjusted sales development, which increased higher than at the restaurants.
Pubs focused on food also left in the sun, but not as drastic as the restaurant operators.
It seems people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Drink sales in the managed pubs and bars increased by 6.6 percent during the month, while food sales decreased by three percent,
Paul Newman, of the analysts for RSM leisure and restaurants, said: “These results continue the trend we have observed since the end of April.
The weather and the influence of important social or sporting events remain the biggest factors for sales in the out-of-home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to face problems, but sales losses of 4.8 percent over the previous year will be particularly painful in addition to sustained cost pressures.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for operators of companies with a focus on food and it remains to be expected that the moderate temperatures in August will provide the urgently needed breath time,
Total sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July and reflected the decline in brand rollouts.
The industry sales monitor Cöffer Peach Tracker for the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the UK collects and analyzes performance data from 47 active companies with a combined turnover of over 9 billion pounds and is the recognized industry benchmark.
One of five children has secret accounts in social media that hide it from their parents
A study shows that every fifth child, some just 11 years old, has secret accounts on social media that keep it secret from parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 pupils in advanced schools found an increase in so-called \"Fake Insta\" pages.
The message fosters fears that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of students claimed to have a “main account” to show it to their parents
One of five children, some just 11 years old, created accounts on social media that can keep it secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students in advanced schools showed a rapid increase in so-called \"Fake Insta\" accounts, a response to the Instagram photo-sharing website.
The message fosters fears that sexual content will be shared.
Twenty percent of students claimed to have a clean “main account” that they can show their parents to own, as well as private accounts.
One mother, who came to the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter, found a teenager who asked others to rape me,
The study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-olds had two profiles, half of which were dedicated to owning private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, Chairman of the HMC, said: “It’s devastating that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them, ”
Eilidh Doyle becomes \"the athlete's voice\" in the Scottish Sports Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected as a non-executive member of the Council of Scottish Athletics Association of Scottish Athletics at its annual General Assembly.
Doyle is Scotland's most distinguished athlete and President Ian Beattie described the election as a great opportunity for sports officials to benefit from their extensive international experience over the last decade.
“Eilidh is respected in Scotland, the UK and the world’s athletics community and we are sure that the athletics in Scotland would benefit greatly from their choice in the Council,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I am looking forward to acting as the athlete’s voice, hoping that I can make a real contribution and lead the sport in Scotland,
The American, who won the distance over 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, called a total of four Olympic gold medals his own, and today often appears as BBC experts, was no longer able to cope with a previous bleeding disorder.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk anymore.

It was hard work, but I recovered completely, learned to run again and do mobility exercises today!
Thank you very much for the encouraging news,
An advertisement for milk pumps that compare mothers to cows provides excitement in the net
A manufacturer of milk pumps provided excitement in the net with an advertising clip in which breast-feeding mothers are compared to milking cows.
In order to introduce the \"first noise-free portable milk pump\" according to its own specification, the manufacturer of consumer technology Elvie published a music video that was not very serious in order to stress the freedom that the pump gives to nursing mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled barn with cows in the background to a song that contains a line of lyrics like, \"Yes, I'm milking me, but you don't see a tail on me, or, if you didn't notice it, that's not a udder but my breasts,
In the refrigerator it continues: “Pumpe it out, pump it out, I feed the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I'm milking my ladies,
However, the advertising published on the company's Facebook page has triggered a controversy in the network.
With 77,000 accesses and hundreds of comments, the video came across mixed reactions among viewers, many of whom say that it is the “fears” of the dairy industry harmless.
“It was a very bad decision to apply this product with cows.
Like us, they have to be pregnant and give birth to a calf to produce milk, with the difference that their boys are taken away within a few days of birth - it was said in a comment.
Elvie's milk pump fits discreetly into a still bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment was: “Surprisingly traumatic for mother and baby.
But hey, why don't we use them to apply a milk pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies,
Another person added: \"So a reality-free advertisement\"
Others defended the advertising and a woman admitted that you found the song \"urcomic\".
“I think that’s a brilliant idea.
I would have bought one if I were still silent.
I felt exactly like a cow when I was pumping.
The clip is a little crazy, but I'm not trying to overinterpret it.
This is a brilliant product - wrote a person.
Another person commented: “This is a funny advertisement directed at mothers who use milk pumps (often at work or on toilets) and feel like ‘cows’.
This is not advertising for or against the dairy industry,
At the end of the video, the group reveals to women that everyone danced with the discrete pumps in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who use milk pumps tend to feel like dairy cows.
Elvie's pump, however, is completely noiseless, has no wires or hoses and fits discreetly into a still-BH, which gives women the freedom to move, keep their babies or even go out during the pumping process.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, said: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a daring and provocative market introduction.
By comparing breast-feeding mothers with dairy cows, we wanted to focus on milk pumps and all the challenges facing them, and at the same time, in an entertaining and comprehensible way, to present the incredible feeling of freedom that makes the new pump possible.
That's not the first time Elvie's pump got into the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, a double mother appeared for designer Marta Jakubowski on the Catwalk, during which she used the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were quietly and quietly brought to a tent town on the Texan border
The number of interned migrant children is as high as never before, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively the same, among other things, since increased rhetoric and measures by the Trump government have made it more difficult to accommodate children with caregivers.
Traditionally, most of the caregivers themselves were illegal immigrants and are now afraid to become the target of an outlaw themselves when they report themselves to take up a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential supervisors and other adult members of their household would have to print their fingerprints and share these data with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior customs authority immigration and Customs Enforcement official, announced before Congress that the Authority had arrested dozens of people who had applied for the care of unaccompanied minors.
The Authority later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested did not have previous entries in the criminal register.
“Fast 80 percent of the persons who are either self-employed or members of a household of a caretaker are illegally residing in the country and a large proportion of them are criminal foreigners.
That is why we will continue to follow these people, said Albence.
In order to be able to handle the children's cases more quickly, the officials introduced new rules, which, according to employees of the accommodations, require some children to appear within one month rather than 60 days after the detention before the court, which was previously the standard.
Many will appear via video switching and not personally to appear before an immigration judge for their legal status.
In the case of negative decisions, the person is quickly suspended.
The longer these children remain in custody, the more likely it is, according to the accommodation staff, as well as reports reported in the last month from the system that they become anxious and depressed, which can lead to violent outbreaks or outbreak attempts.
Defenders say that these concerns are reinforced at a larger facility such as Tornillo, as there are signs that a child has problems due to the size being more easily overlooked.
They also explained that it could strengthen the trauma of which many of the children are already suffering if they are brought into a tent town without emotional preparation or sufficient time to say goodbye to friends.
Syria calls on American, French and Turkish “occupationaries” to withdraw immediately
In a speech before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the civil war in the country is now in the eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, stated that the foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil with the pretext of fighting terrorism and being treated accordingly,
“You have to withdraw immediately and unconditionally, ” he explained to the congregation.
Moualem insisted that the war against terrorism was almost over in Syria, where since 2011, more than 360,000 people have died and millions more people have been expelled from their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue to fight this sacred battle until all Syrian territories are cleaned, both by terrorist groups and by any illegal foreign presence.
The United States has stationed about 2000 soldiers in Syria, who mainly train and advise Kurdish forces as well as Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1000 soil troops in the war - torn country.
With regard to the refugees, Moualem stated that the conditions for their return were given and he accused \"some Western countries of spreading \"irrational fears\" of stopping the refugees from going home.
\"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to allow return home,\" he said.
\"They are politicizing a purely humanitarian matter,
The United States and the European Union warned that no aid would be granted to Syria as long as there was no political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats declared that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on a buffer zone in the last large rebel highburg Idlib represents the possibility of advancing political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey turned a broad offensive of the Syrian forces supported by Russia into the province where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had “clear deadlines,” and expressed his hope that military action against jihadists, including fighters of the Nusra Front, which was allied with Al-Qaeda, which will be “deposited”.
UN representative Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon be able to convene first meetings of a new committee consisting of government and opposition members to design a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem mentioned the conditions of the Syrian government for participation in the committee and stated that his work should be limited to the \"recast of the articles of the current Constitution\" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win his re-election
With this logic, Trump would win his re-election in 2020, should not, as many liberal spectators would probably hope, end his presidency prematurely an office theft or scandal.
This would undoubtedly be the most dramatic final of a presidency of all time.
So far, there's no sign that the viewers were tired of it.
Since 2014, the best broadcasting time for CNN has been 1,05 million more than doubled and almost tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News achieves an average of 2.4 million viewers at the best broadcasting time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago. MSNBCs, The Rachel Maddow Show, led the switching rates to 3.5 million viewers at evenings with important news.
“This is like a fire that magically attracts people, because it’s something we don’t understand, so Neal Bear, showrunner of the drama series “Designated Survivor” broadcast on TV station ABC, about a cabinet member who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an old-fashioned comedy writer and author of the book “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys” Club, has a different theory.
She recalls a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he'd choose Trump.
She asked him for the reason.
“He said, ‘because he’s making me laugh’” Scovell told me.
The chaos's worth of entertainment.
Of course, the stories from Washington, unlike anything to be found on television, can determine the future of the principle decision on abortions Roe v. Wade, the possible merging of families and the health of the global economy.
Turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet there is also the need to be an informed citizen when one becomes aware of six hours of a round of experts looking at Bob Woodward's use of sources from the so-called \"Deep Background\" for his book \"Fear\" Paul Manafort's 15,000 dollar expensive bomber jacket from Straussenleder (Let Washington Post discuss a \"clothy rich in self-overestimation\" or the effects of Stormy Daniel's rudimentary description of Trump's ähm, anatomy).
I'll never see Super Mario again with the same eyes for my part.
“A part of what he does makes him feel like a reality show, which he proposes to one every evening, says Brent Montgomery, head executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the series “The Three of the Pfandhaus” about Trump’s rotating occupation and daily actions (breaking a dispute with the football league NFL from the fence, praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss a episode, otherwise you won't come along anymore.
When I reached Fleiss this week, it was sunny 27 degrees in front of his house on the northern coast of the Hawaiian island of Kauai, but he scoffed inside and looked at MSNBC while he recorded CNN at the same time.
He simply could not get rid of the screen, not if Judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh was about to testify in front of the Senate's Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
“I remember when we made all these crazy broadcasts back then and people said, “This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization”, told me liquidation.

Donations money flows the narrowest races for seats in Congress during the interim elections
It is little surprising that the 17th parliamentary district of Pennsylvania is flooded by donation funds, thanks to the newly drawn boundaries of the electoral districts, which resulted in two official holders standing around the same seat in the race.
The recently re-marked suburban district in Pittsburgh has let the Democrat Conor Lamb enter, who won his seat in another district in the course of a special election in the previous spring.
Lamb joins another official, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which greatly overlaps with the new 17th district.
The cards were re-drawn after the Supreme Court of the State of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old districts were violated the Constitution and manipulated in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district triggered an exchange of votes between the major financial forces of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a short victory in a highly respected special election in March around the 18th electoral district of the state.
This seat was held by a Republican for over a decade and Trump won the lead with 20 percentage points.
Political experts give the Democrats easy leadership.
The US tested the punishment of El Salvador for its support for China, but then withdrew
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama Beijing had already recognized without having to face great resistance from Washington.
Trump held a friendly meeting with the president of Panama, Juan Carlos Valero, in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama to partner the management team of the Trump Organization.
U.S. Foreign Ministry officials have decided to withdraw the leaders of all American foreign affairs from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of ‘the recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan’, said Heather Nauert, spokesperson of the Ministry in an opinion at the beginning of the month.
However, only in El Salvador’s case were thinking about criminal measures, which in 2017 received an estimated 140 million dollars in U.S. assistance, including drug control, development and economic assistance.
The proposed penalties, including cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
While internal meetings continued, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which was to follow a similar meeting in the previous year and represented a step forward in trying to stop migrants from moving towards the United States.
In mid-September, however, high government officials made clear that they wanted the conference to take place and thus effectively ended the consideration of criminal measures for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now scheduled as a spokesperson at the mid-October conference to set out, according to diplomats, a sign of the importance which the Government of the Assembly has to give.
The three American diplomatic representatives returned silently and quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new scrupulous communications or criminal measures from Washington.
A spokesman for the government of John Bolton rejected an opinion on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who, under the condition of anonymity, agreed to comment on the internal discussions.
Their opinions were confirmed by an external analyst close to the government, who also spoke under the condition of anonymity.
Learning From History
The next great surprise could be the report by the Special Inspector Robert Mueller on Trump's possible judicial obstacle, for which there is now sufficient public evidence.
Mueller now also claims to investigate whether Trump's electoral team has conspired with Russia in his attack on the American elections.
If the majority of Congress were to change, Trump would face up to a body that would force him to account, exactly at the time when he was passing by, to step back in front of the voters; and perhaps before a jury jury.
These are many ‘when’s’ and I do not want to say that Donald Trump’s case, or that of his European counterparties, is inevitable.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we must make decisions that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were willing to carry out a coup against Hitler if the West had only resisted him and had supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of barbarism that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and the unstoppable march of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
Americans are facing several such turning points.
What do we do if Trump dismisses Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein, that is, the man who decides on the future of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in devil's kitchen since this newspaper last year reported that he suggested that he secretly record the president and speculated that he was not suitable for the office.
Rosenstein demented the presentation of the New York Times.
\"How will we respond if the newly appointed FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair or he is confirmed in office despite credible accusations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the interim elections for a congress that forces Trump to account?
If we fail in these tests, we will have a long winter.
But I think we're not going to fail because of what I've learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew, who was deported to Auschwitz, the same regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America and sent me away 60 years later to light up Sabbath candles on the table with the hook cross.
How can I be optimistic with this heritage?

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers optimistic before the game against Vienna
The Rangers receive Rapid Wien on Thursday knowing that a victory against the Austrians after the impressive remission against Villareal in Spain at the beginning of the month will put them in a good position for the qualification of the Group G of the Europa League.
Due to a knee injury, Graham Dorrans could not appear up to the 2-2 level against Villareal, but he believes that the Rangers can use this result as a springboard for larger ones.
“This was an important point for us, as Villareal is very good, so the 31-year-old.
We went into the game with the conviction that we can do something about it and we drove home with a point.
Maybe we could have won at the end, but overall a disparity was probably a fair result.
They probably dominated in the first half, but we worked in the second half and then were the better team.
Thursday will be another great European evening.
Hopefully, we will get three points, but this will be a heavy game, as they have achieved a good result in the last game. But I am sure that we can do this with the audience behind us and achieve a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult, with everything that happened with my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is some kind of well-being factor.
The team is good and the guys are really good at it; the training is good.
Hopefully we can look forward now, leave the last season behind us and be successful,
Fear of age prevention leads to sleepless nights in women.
Although the participants of the survey knew exactly how to care for them, few spoke to their family members about them.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide study indicated that they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% indicated talking to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but don’t take the necessary steps to conduct the conversation,” says Holly Snyder, Vice President of Nationwide Life Insurance Department.
You should start with this.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare your family to care if you don't express your wishes in time.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how you want to be maintained, as these decisions can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Bring your financial advisor on board: Your advisor can also help you find a way to finance these expenditures.
Your financial decisions for long-term care may include traditional care insurance, hybrid capital-forming life insurance to help cover these costs or self-insurance with your own assets - as long as they have the money.
Work out your legal documents: Turn down legal disputes in the last minute.
Set up a precaution, so that you assign a trusted person to monitor your medical care and ensure that the health professionals meet your wishes, you should be unable to express it yourself.
Consider also an authority for your finances.
You choose a trusted person who makes financial decisions for you and ensures that your bills are paid, you should not be able to do so.
Don't forget the details: Imagine that your older parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer drug or allergies questions?
Note these details in a written plan so that you are ready.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a strong earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, the authorities said.
Because of the failed communication systems, relief forces were not able to obtain information from the Donggala government district, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with the strength of 7.5.
Over 16,000 persons were evacuated in Palu after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a government district located in the northwest of Sulawesi Island over a coastal area of over 300 km (180 miles) in length.
In the government district, a administrative unit below the province, an estimated 299,200 people lived in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of revenue in the Central Sulawesis economy, particularly the Donggala coastal region.
Nickelab construction is also important in the province, but it focuses mainly on Morovali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesis.
According to Indonesia’s disaster protection authority, Palu and Donggala have been victims of earthquakes and tsunamis several times over the last 100 years.
In 1938, over 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
West Donggala was hit in 1996 by a tsunami in which nine people died.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific fire ring, and is regularly visited by earthquakes.
Here are some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in the north of Sumatras triggered a tsunami on 26 December, which hit 14 countries and cost 226,000 people in the coastal areas of the Indian Ocean, almost half of it in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes shook the west coast of Sumatras between the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the Nias Islands off the Sumatras coast.
2006: A 6.8 earthquake shook the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island and triggered a tsunami that hit the south coast and claimed nearly 700 deaths.
2009: A 7.6 earthquake hit Padang City, the capital of West Sumatra Province.
Over 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake with the strength of 7.5 shook one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters, destroying dozens of villages and calling for about 300 lives.
2016: A slight earthquake shook the government district of Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people died through one-story buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit the Indonesian island of Lombok, popular with tourists and demanded more than 500 deaths, especially on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded on the island.
Sarah Palin's son arrested for accusations of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former governor of Alaska and former candidates for the Vice-President's office, was arrested due to accusations of bodily injury.
The 29-year-old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for the suspicion of domestic violence, the disability of reporting domestic violence and the resistance to state violence, according to a report published by Alaskan police on Saturday.
According to the police report, he took a stranger off the phone when he wanted to tell the police.
According to KTUU, Palin is in investigative custody in the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and a deposit of $500 was raised.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where, when asked about his plea, he replied, \"Not guilty, quite certain, so the network answered.
Palin is accused of having committed three ordinal offences of Class A, which can be punished with up to one year's imprisonment and a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also charged with a class B disorder, which can be punished with a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
It's not the first time Palin's criminal charges have been filed.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently being negotiated in front of Alaska's Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, disability in the reporting of a crime and weapons possession under means of deception in conjunction with the incident.
His girlfriend told him to hit her face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by Veteran organizations in 2016 after she traced her son’s behaviour to post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of his time in Iraq.
Tsunami after earthquakes in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after an earthquake that shook the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake with a strength of 7.5 triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of houses.
Power and communication networks are interrupted and the number of dead people is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just off the coast of Central Sulawesis, which is located northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
Videos circulate on social networks from the time the wave hit the country.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal Attorney calls for rare death sentences for suspects in New York terrorist attack
The federal prosecutor in New York called for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saikov, the defendant in the terrorist attack of New York City, which cost eight lives. This is a rare punishment that has been imposed in the state since 1953 for a federal crime.
The 30-year-old Saiov is charged with using a rented pick-up of the Home Depot construction market chain for a terrorist attack, in which he raced along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October, and then crossed pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov targeted, killed and “consciously” committed serious bodily injury, says in the declaration of intent to claim the death penalty filed in the southern district of New York.
Both charges, according to the court document, could be punished with death.
Weeks after the attack, a Federal Criminal Court of Saipov filed a complaint in 22 points involving eight charges of murder against the background of organised crime, usually used by state lawyers in cases of organised crime, and a charge of the exercise of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for “basic planning and intent,” according to the prosecutors, who described the nature in which Saipov carried out the act as “detestable, cruel and corrupt. ”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saiov added damage, pain and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadet, Darren Drake, Ariel Erliy, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco.
Five victims were Argentine tourists.
For more than a decade, the southern district of New York has no longer pursued a case with the aim of demanding the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murder of two drug suppliers and finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time that the death penalty was committed in New York in a federal offense was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were accused of conspiring for the Soviet Union two years before.
Both Rosenbergs were executed with the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saikov, who was born in Uzbekistan, witnessed court documents in the days and months following the attack of lack of repentance.
He told investigators to feel good about what he did, the police said.
Saiov explained to the authorities that he was inspired to act after watching videos from ISIS on his phone, according to the indictment.
According to police information, he also called for the flag of ISIS to be hanged in his hospital room.
He declared himself innocent in all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, stated that they were, of course, disappointed by the decision of the prosecutor.
“We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty will only extend the trauma that all parties are suffering in exchange for a life-long sentence of freedom without the possibility of dismissal,” Patton said.
Saikov's defense team had previously asked the charge not to demand the death penalty.
A Conservative Party member demands NIGEL FARAGE to transfer the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to mobilize \"the power of the people\" today during a protest action at the Tories Conference.
Ukip's former party leader stated that politicians must feel pressure from Euroskeptics while a Theresa May's party member suggested that Farage should lead the negotiations with the EU.
The conservative butcher Peter Bone explained to the protesters in Birmingham that if Farage was a Brexit minister, the United Kingdom would be ready outside.
The challenge faced by May in reconciling her deeply disputed party was exacerbated by the fact that members of your party, who are for a stay in the EU, participated in a separate demonstration against Brexit, which took place in the city.
The Prime Minister has difficulty keeping up with Chequer's compromise plan despite attacks by Brexit supporters, Brexit opponents and the EU.
In spite of the counter-reactions, allies insisted that they should continue to try to negotiate a deal with Brussels, thus forcing Euroskeptics and the oppositional Labour Party to decide between their package and the ‘chaos’.
Bone stated at the “Leave Means Leave demonstration in Solihull that “chequers are on the garbage”.
He suggested that Farage should have been named a peer and that he should have taken responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he were responsible for this, we would already be outside,” he explained.
The colleague of Wellingborough added: “I will stand up for Brexit, but Chequers belongs to the garbage.”
He stressed his opposition to the EU: “We have not fought in world wars to be subjugated.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone rejected claims that since the referendum in 2016 public opinion has changed: “The idea that the British people have changed their opinion and now want to stay in the EU is completely wrong.”
Brexit’s advocate for Conservative Andrea Jenkyns was also on the demonstration and told reporters: “I’m just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The compromise is unpopular in the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular in our own party and in our activists who actually go through the streets and ensure that we are elected.
Please give up Chequers and start listening.”
In a top message to May, she continued: “Prime Minister keep their jobs if you keep their promises.”
Farage stated in a speech that politicians must “feel pressure” to cheat the decision of the 2016 referendum.
“This is now a question of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” said Farage.
“They try to cheat Brexit, and that’s why we’re here today to tell them, “You don’t get away with it.”
In front of an enthusiastic crowd, he continued: “I want you to let our political class, who is about to betray Brexit, feel the pressure.
“We mobilise the power of the people of this country, which will help us to win in the referendum and never come to rest, as long as we are not independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.”
At the same time, Brexit opponents marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city center.
A few activists swiveled banners of the Tories Against Brexit group, a group of Brexit opponents within May's party, which was launched on weekends.
Lord Adonis, the Labour Party's peer, made fun of the Tories who had security problems with a party app at the opening of the conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can make sure that the IT systems, as well as all the technology for Canada Plus, for the smooth border, are available for free trade without borders in Ireland,” says Adonis.
“This is a farce.
There is simply no good Brexit, ’ he added.
Warren plans to ‘explain precisely’ the presidential candidate
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren declared that after the November elections, she would “explain the presidential candidate carefully.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about her future at a meeting with voters in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a well-spoken critic of President Donald Trump, is currently in the race for reelection for the Senate against Republican MPs in the Massachusetts Geoff Diehl Parliament, who was vice-president of Trump's electoral team in Massachusetts in 2016.
It was the focus of speculation that it could challenge Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke has been its 36th meeting with voters in the so-called Town Hall format since Trump's accession.
One of the persons present asked if you would like to apply for the presidency.
Warren replied that it would be time for women to “go to Washington and repair our broken government and that includes women at the top”

Great Prize of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the World Championship after leaving his team the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the time Valtteri Bottas landed on Saturday in qualifying before Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that Mercedes's stable-order would play a major role in the race.
From the pole position, Bottas got a good start and it was almost as he led Hamilton before defending his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammates.
Vettel first went to the box and let Hamilton get into traffic at the end of the driver's field, a decision that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes later went to the box and landed behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtook him after a tight wheel-on-wheel maneuver, during which the Ferrari pilot reluctantly released the inside, with the risk of two moves to defend the third curve.
Max Verstappen started on one of the back squares of the field and was on his 21st birthday after the end of the first round in place seven.
He was then the fastest for much of the race, as he held on to his tires to finish quickly and to pick up Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He finally went into the box in the 44th round and failed to make a step in the remaining eight rounds, while Raikkonen finished fourth.
It was a difficult day, since Valtteri has brought an excellent performance all weekend and acted like a real gentleman when he was supposed to let me by.
The team has done excellent work to achieve a double victory, says Hamilton.
A Case of Really Bad Body Language
On Saturday, President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Dianne Feinstein, who insisted that Christine Blasey Ford's letter, in which he proposes sexual abuse to the candidate for the Supreme Court Board of Kavanaugh, should not be passed on to the press.
At the meeting in West Virginia, President Ford’s statement before the Senate’s Judicial Committee did not address directly but commented that the proceedings in the Senate show that people are “common, vicious and dishonest. ”
\"One thing that could happen and the wonderful thing that has happened in the Senate in the last few days is when you see the rage, when you see people who are angry and mean and vicious and dishonest, the President says.
“When you look at the leaks, you say, “Oh, that wasn’t me.
It wasn't me.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, were you responsible for the Leak?
Think of your answer... Publish the document - \"Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't publish it,
Okay, just a minute, please.
No, we didn't publish it, he added it by following the voice of the senator.
Feinstein was awarded the letter with Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh in July and was published in early September. However, Feinstein argues that Leak came from her office.
“I did not hide Dr. Ford’s accusations, I did not publish your story,” explained Feinstein to the committee, according to The Hill.
\"She asked me to keep the letter secret and I answered her request for secrecy\"
Her dementia did not seem to come well with the president, who said on Saturday evening at the election event: “I tell you, this was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen,
In his continuous defense of the judge's candidate, who is accused of sexual assaults by three women, Democrats claimed that they would use the accusations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by all means.
One sees the community, the evil, they don't care who they hurt when they get under the wheels to gain power and control, said the president, according to Mediaite.

The Giants took the lead early on with two goals, following the encounters of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought compensation for the home team before Dwyer restored the lead of the Giants.
Francois Bouchard was equal to Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen won the victory with two goals.
This was unexpected for the men of Adam Keefe, who beat Dundee on Friday evening 2-1 in Belfast, the third defeat in the Elite League in the season.
This was the fourth match of the season between the two teams, with the Giant winning the three previous matches.

Air traffic jam died after he was sure that hundreds of people in an airplane escaped the earthquake
A pilot in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero after he found death to make a plane with hundreds of people on board safely start.
Over 800 people died and many were missing after Sulawesi Island was shaken by a devastating earthquake on Friday that triggered a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks are still felt in the region and many people are caught under debris in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the highly swaying control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained in order to make sure that the 6321 flight from Batik Air, which was on the runway at the time, could safely be lifted.
He then jumped out of the tower when he thought he was crashing.
Agung died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesman of the Indonesian Air Safety Service, explained that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australia's ABC News.
“We have provided a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to bring him a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter could enter Palu.
We are deeply concerned about this message, he added.
At the same time, the authorities fear that the number of dead could rise to several thousand.The country’s disaster protection authority declared that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The number is expected to increase as many bodies are still under the debris, while others cannot be reached,” said the spokesman of the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho Authority.
Waves up to 6 meters in height have devastated Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute a new ambulance comes with dead people.
Clean drinking water is scarce.
Supermarkets are looted everywhere,
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said: “The Indonesian Red Cross is hurrying to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse,
Indonesia's president, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and said in a speech to the military of the country: \"I ask you to work every day and night to carry out all the tasks related to evacuation.
Since you've been ready - according to CNN.
Indonesia has been shaken by earthquakes in Lombok this year, killing over 550 people.
Aeroplane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports a missing after plane crash in lagoon
The airline, which carried out the flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now reports a missing one after first claiming that all 47 passengers and crew had been evacuated safely from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini stated in a notice that they can't say anything about a passenger's stay until Saturday afternoon.
The airline suggested working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials reported that seven people had to be hospitalized.
The airline stated that six more passengers were hospitalized on Saturday, but were in a stable state.
The cause and the exact course of the accident remained unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both explained that the plane landed in the lagoon just before the runway.
Some witnesses thought that the plane flew over the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane flew very flat.
“This is a very good thing, as Jaynes said.
Jaynes explained that he and others were able to wade to the emergency exits on the sides of the sinking plane by means of hot water.
He said that the flight attendants were panicking and screaming and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy stated that sailors who worked nearby to improve a landing site rushed with an inflatable boat to help bring people to the coast before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of deep water.
Aviation Safety Network data can be found that 111 people died in crashes of airlines registered in Papua New Guinea, but none of them affected Air Niugini.
Analyst reconstructs the course of the night in which a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the accused closed her evidence in the renegotiation of a case in which a man is accused of banishing a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst of the U.S. Department of Justice Paul Rowlett stated for hours as an expert in the field of information evaluation.
He explained to the jury how, on the basis of cell phone calls, he reconstructed the movements of 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chamber on her night of death.
Rowlett said to have received position data from various cell phones that showed that Tellis was in the evening of her death with Chambers. This contradicts his previous statements, according to the newspaper Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at rooms during the period when he stated that he had been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford came to the witness stand on Saturday and said that he had not been in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis had told the truth when he stated that he was in Sanford's pick-up that night, Sandford said that he had lied, \"that my pick-up was in Nashville,
Another contradiction was that Tellis indicated that Chambers knew two weeks at their time of death.
However, cell phone records indicate that they knew each other for a week.
Rowlett explained that Tellis had lost some time after Chamber's death news, calls and contact information from his cell phone.
“He has removed them from his life, so Hale.
The defense is expected to begin its pleas on Sunday.
The judge assumes that the proceedings will then be before the jury that day.

Another Black?!
New York's child girl sues couple for a dismissal after \"racist\" SMS
A New York child girl sues a couple because of a discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misdirected message from the mother in which she complained that she was “still a black person”
The couple fought to be racist and compared the dispute with a “suppression”
The two-time mother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed her concern when she found out that the new day's mother, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived at her first working day in 2016.
“NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEIN, NO A SWARZE,” Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
Instead of sending her husband, however, she sent the message to Maurice.
After she recognized her fauxpas, the “painly touched ” Plasco-Flaxman Maurice, who claimed that the imprisoned African American daily mother had done bad work and instead expected her to be a Philippine, says the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for her working day and then sent home with a Uber.
Now Maurice sues the couple for compensation for the dismissal and claims compensation for the $350 a day, which she should have spent over six months on the job for which she was originally booked, but without contract, and for which she had lived with the couple.
“I want to show them, look, what is not done,” she told the newspaper on Friday, “I know that discrimination is”
The couple rejected the racism allegations, arguing that the dismissal was the reasonable step as they feared Maurice could no longer trust them after they insulted them.
“My wife sent her something that she didn’t want to say.
She's not a rassist.
We're not racists - said husband Joel Plasco of the post.
“But would you trust your children to a person who was rude to them even if it was out of date?
Your newborn baby?
Come on, \"
Plasco compared the lawsuit to a “depression” and explained that his wife was expecting a baby in just two months and was in a difficult situation.
\"Do you want such a person's interests?
This is not very nice - the investment banker added.
While the dispute continues, the couple was quickly condemned in public and attacked on social media, where they were criticized for their conduct and logic.
The publishers of Paddington feared that readers would not identify themselves with a talking bear, reveals a new letter
Karen Jankel, daughter of author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, said of the letter: “It’s hard to get into someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
Today it is very funny with our knowledge of Paddington's huge success,
She said that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before he was inspired by a small toy bear to write the children's book, had no problem with it, his work would have been rejected and added that the 60th anniversary of the publication after his death last year was \"bitter sweet\".
She explained that her father was secretly proud of the success of Paddington, whom she describes as \"very important family member\".
“He was a very quiet man and didn’t brag, so Jankel.
“Because Paddington was so real for him, it was almost as if you had a child who makes something special: one is proud, even if it wasn’t really one’s own performance.
I think he saw Paddington's success like that.
Although he invented and created it, he always gave Paddington his own responsibility for his success,
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone.
After landing her daughter in Nice was taken to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital, where the doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“Nad called regularly to say that it really looks bad and that the doctors gave her little chance, ” Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I received the call from Nad, in which he told me that she would die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I told her, \"Tashi, I love you so much, my dear\"
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that the doctors gave her to keep her heart at the pumping slowly sounded down and left her body.
She had died just before, and this was the moment when everything went down.
I couldn't do anything but wait while I knew what was going on.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and other people.
I really had to get together,
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who was now grieving the loss of her daughter, along with the other passengers who did not get involved in what she was going through, went on board the plane.
“No one knew, ” she said.
I had lowered my head and tears ran over my cheeks all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight when I felt this overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved them,
Mourning women hang cards to prevent suicide on bridges
Two women who have lost loved ones through suicide try to stop others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelley Humphreys hung up on a bridge in Wales with inspiring messages and phone numbers for consulting places.
Davis son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and was just 18 when he committed suicide.
“I don’t want parents to feel the way I feel every day,” she explained.
The 45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lydney, explained that her son was in charge of a promising career as a cook and that he had a smiling smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
They all said that his smile could light up a room,
However, he announced his job before his death, as he was “in a really dark place. ”
In 2014, Tyler's body was found after the suicide of his then 11-year-old brother.
Davis said: “I always fear that this could have a consequence, ”
Davis designed the maps to show people that there are people to whom you can go and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't stay quiet: you have to talk about it,
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost her partner Mark, with whom she was 15 years old, shortly after his mother died.
“He didn’t say he felt down or depressed,” she explained.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas Day he was on the low point. When the children unpacked their gifts, he did not see them in their eyes or anything,
She said that his death was a great trauma for her, but that it had to go through: “It’s a huge hole in the family.
It's tearing us.
But we all have to go on and fight,

Brett Kavanaugh's future in the Schwebe while the FBI starts investigating
“I thought that if we could actually get something that he was asking for, that is, a temporary and limited investigation, then perhaps we could get a bit of action, so flake on Saturday, and he feared that the Committee would break down in the party political debate.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want to investigate the FBI?
Her resistance can only be traced back to timing.
The interim elections on November 6 are only five weeks away. If the Republicans cut off badly as expected, then they would be significantly weakened in their attempts to choose their husband to the highest court of the country.
George W. Bush seized the phone listener to call senators and convince them to support Kavanaugh, who had worked in the White House for Bush and met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI presents its report?
There is a vote in the Senate in which 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can unite at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the Vice-President, to decide on equality of vote and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean overflowors \"sinkt\" under Kim
The number of North Korean overruns to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un seven years ago, according to a South Korean politician.
Park Byeong-seug, who is relying on data from the South Korean Ministry of Reunification, stated that last year 1127 overflowers were registered, compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park called stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher prices of human smugglers as the main factors.
Pjöngyang did not express himself publicly.
Finally, the vast majority of the superintendents from the north are offered the South Korean citizenship.
Seoul states that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, over 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border.
Most flee across China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states.
China considers the overruns to be more illegal immigrants than refugees and often leads them back by force.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still in war, have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the two heads of state met in Pyongyang to discuss the denuclearisation negotiations.
This was due to the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, where they generally agreed to work on a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused American sanctions for the lack of progress.
“Without being able to rely on the US, we have no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to disarm ourselves at first - says I Ri in a speech before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh \"hysterical\" and says that he is not suitable for the office at the Supreme Court
The minority leader in Nancy Pelosi's House of Representatives called Judge candidates Brett Kavanaugh \"hysterical\" and said that he was characteristically inappropriate for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t resist the impression that a woman who had acted like this would have been called “hysterical” - said Pelosi about her reaction to Kavanaugh’s statement before the Senate’s Judicial Committee on Thursday.
In an emotional way, Kavanaugh demented all charges that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both were teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional. Sometimes he almost screamed and stood in tears shortly before speaking about his family and his high school time.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the Committee and called the charges against him a \"great and coordinated call murder\" organised by Liberals who were angry about Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that they believed that Kavanaugh's statement proved that he could not serve at the Supreme Court, as they showed that he was pre-intentional to Democrats.
“I believe that he was involved in these statements and the way he spoke about the Clintons and the Democrats, even declared that he was inconvenient,” she explained.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to dismiss Kavanaugh from the office, he should be confirmed and the Democrats should win the majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’m going to say so much: if he doesn’t tell the Congress or the FBI the truth, then he’s not only for the Supreme Court, but also for his current judge’s posts,” Pelosi says.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington D.C.
Pelosi continued to say that as a Democrat, she was concerned about possible decisions by Kavanaughs against the Affordable Care Act or the abortion principle decision by Roe v. Wade, since he is assessed as a conservative judge.
In his hearings, Kavanaugh raised questions as to whether he would revise certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“We don’t need a hysterical, prejudiced person who goes to this Court of Justice and expects us to say, “This isn’t wonderful,” Pelosi says.
Women need to use it as a weapon.
It is a sincere hate speech, months and years of overcooking rage, and it does not get out without weeping.
“We cry when we get angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think this is rare, and you “
She continued: “I was helped a lot by a woman who was manager somewhere and said that if she gets angry, she has developed a technique. When she gets angry and starts crying, she says to the person to whom she said, “You might think that you’re sad because I cry.
I'm angry.
And then they just keep talking.
I found the genius,
Tears are allowed as valves for anger, partly because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories is of a former job, in an office dominated by men, where one day I cried because of an indescribable rage and was pulled into a stairwell by an older woman, an undercooled manager, before whom I always had a little fear.
\"Don't let her see that you're crying, she told me.
\"They don't know you're stinkier.
They believe you are sad and will be satisfied with you as they believe you have gone to the substance,
Patricia Schroeder, then a member of the Congress from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidates.
In 1987, when Hart was caught on board a ship named Monkey Business in an extramarital affair and then withdrew his candidacy, the deeply frustrated Schroeder considered that there was no reason not to consider the idea of the presidential candidacy itself.
“This was not a well thought-out decision,” she told me 30 years later with a smile.
There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the situation “snow whites and the seven dwarfs”.
Since the election campaign was already advanced, it was at the back of the budget, and it vowed not to apply if it was not to meet for $2 million.
It was a hopeless fight.
She found that some of her supporters, who donated $1,000, supported their campaign with only $250.
“I believe I get a discount,” she asked.
In the speech in which she announced not to launch an official campaign, she was thus so overwhelmed by her emotions, gratitude for her supporters, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to acquire and directly address voters rather than delegates, as well as anger over sexism, so overwhelming that she was close to tears.
“It could have been assumed that I suffered a nervous breakdown - Schroeder recalls the press reactions.
“One could have believed that the towel manufacturer Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember asking myself what they might write on my gravestone.
‘She wept,’
Why Beijing could benefit from the trade war between the United States and China
The opening ointments of the trade war between the United States and China were very appalling. Although the battle has not been over for a long time, Beijing could benefit from a long-term dig between the countries, my experts.
Donald Trump, U.S. President, fired the first warning in the early part of the year when he carried out criminal duties on important Chinese export goods, including solar cells, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new penalties on goods worth $200 billion, effectively affecting half of all goods imported from China into the United States.
Beijing fell back in the same way every time and recently raised fines of five to ten percent on American goods worth 60 billion dollars.
China has sworn to respond to any action taken by the United States and it is unlikely that the world's second largest economic power will soon collapse.
Moving Washington in to the vanguard would mean surrendering. However, a public knock-in to the US would be far too tasteful for China's President Xi Jinping.
Nevertheless, experts believe that if Beijing played its cards well, China could benefit from the effects of the trade war in the long term by reducing the mutual dependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision could create the conditions for economic turbulence in both countries either in Washington or Beijing is actually much more dangerous than many observers previously recognized,” says Abigail Grace, a scientific employee who focuses on Asia at the think factory Center for New American Security.
Syria is 'ready' for the return of refugees, said the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country devastated by the war that has lasted for seven years.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem stated that circumstances in the country were improving.
“Today, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure,” he said.
The government rebuilds the areas destroyed by terrorists to allow normality to return.
All conditions were now laid down for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their everyday lives and basic living.
The UN estimates that over 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government welcomed aid in rebuilding the devastated country.
He stressed, however, that it would not accept any conditional assistance from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe won a victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europa won the 2018 Ryder Cup and defeated Team USA with a final position of 16.5 to 10.5 in the Le Golf National near Paris.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and won no Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the crown back after the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points it needed to defeat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had problems over a large part of the tournament, lowered his defeat on the 16th track (par 3) in the water and lost against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was able to shine in all his laps and became one of 4 players who scored a 3-0-0 since the tournament began in its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was beaten 5:4 by the player with the lowest ranking in the team Europe, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The player with the world's best ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 against the Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spaniard Sergio Garcia, veteran of eight Ryder Cups, became the best European Ryder Cup player ever with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t normally cry, but today I couldn’t hold back.
It was a difficult year.
I am so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm so infinitely happy to win back the Cup.
It's about the team and I'm happy to have contributed, according to the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He extends the torch to his countryman John Rahm, who won the single encounters against the American golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday 2:1.
I am so incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, which I have been watching on television since my childhood, according to the 23-year-old frame.
Woods lost all his four games in France and now has a Ryder Cup balance of 13-21-3.
A strange statistic for one of the biggest players of all time who won 14 important titles and is only surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
The United States team had to find the fairways throughout the weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who performed high-performance performances throughout the tournament.
American Captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance of his team: “I am proud of the boys, they have fought.
There was a time this morning when we put pressure on Europe.
We didn't make anything out of it.
Get off for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players made a good performance.
We'll regroup ourselves, I'll talk to the PGA America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll look forward.
I love these 12 boys and I am proud to be their captain.
You have to pull the hat.
We were defeated,
