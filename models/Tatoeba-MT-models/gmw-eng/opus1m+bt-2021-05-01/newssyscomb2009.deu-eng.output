Triumph of the legal populists in Austria, total they come to 29 percent
A noticeable weakening of both parties of the previous great coalition and a significant strengthening of the right-wing populist parties brought the preferred parliamentary elections of Sunday in Austria after the first preliminary results.
In particular, losses suffered by the Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), where the position of former president Wilhelm Molterer is seriously on the cliff.
In contrast, the elector of the alliance for the future of Austria (BZÖ), the Kärntner head of state, Jörg Haider, equips himself for a triumphal return to federal policy.
According to the previous results, social democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest in the country with 29.8 percent of the votes, but it loses 5.5 percent of the votes compared to the last elections in 2006.
Even worse, the OVP, which loses almost nine percent of the votes by 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in the history of the Austrian post-war period, and especially in the People's Party, which demanded the preferred elections, this is a truly disastrous outcome.
At the beginning of July, when the EPP had resigned from the coalition, the People's Party had a clear lead ahead of the SPÖ.
The electors, however, probably punished the party for failing the government.
Even in the initial reactions to the results, there was speculation about a possible withdrawal from the party chairman and former vice chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could already be the case on Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the party board.
Such a development would likely pave the way for the most probable exit from the electoral debacle, i.e. to a renewal of the great coalition from SPÖ and ÖVP.
In view of the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the liberal (FPÖ) provisionally received 18 percent, the BZÖ eleven percent of the votes - the social democrats expressed their fears at the same time, the year 1999 could repeat itself when the People's Party agreed with the populists (at the time, the FPÖ was still uniform, in 2005 it split from the BZÖ) with regard to a joint government, which even caused sanctions on the part of the European Union.
Jörg Haider, who had already explained that he was willing to cooperate with each party and went from a return to Vienna to Austrian federal policy.
In addition, the Green Party entered Parliament, which suffered slight losses and fell from third to fifth among the Austrian political parties.
No other party has probably mastered the four percentages, and consequently did not join Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool down
If it is not possible to solve the problem with the Czech scientists who have been charged in India for the illegal collection of bugs, the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg considers it possible to achieve a certain cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
This was emphasized by the minister in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherdshi.
“If this is not clear, then surely it will be a certain cooling off,” he said after a meeting that took place on a Czech initiative.
Mukherdshi said after the talks that in judicial matters the executive could only intervene severely.
Despite all this, he argued that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was released from the charge and received a fine that central government wanted with the local government in Dardjiling, in whose case the case falls.
\"His problem could be solved,\" said the Minister.
According to Mukherdshi, for Emil Kučera, who was sentenced to three years of imprisonment, it would be best for him to go to a higher instance.
He could so request the release of bail and wait in freedom for his verdict, said the Minister.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had also expressed himself during negotiations.
“He recommends a appeal to a higher court, then a pardon for him would come into question,” said the head of the Czech Diplomacy.
The only way in which the Czech side can intervene in the whole matter is to let the convicted 'competent legal support' come to an end, said the Indian Minister.
At the same time, he said that such help would already be offered to them through the Indian side.
“We have a great interest in maintaining good contacts with India that have a long-term tradition.
The Inders also state this - led Schwarzenberg.
At the same time, the Czech press agency ČTK, in front of his partner, confirmed the importance of the Czech Republic to the problem of Czech entomologists.
“We really consider it a great mistake to arrest and sue these Czech scientists,” he explained.
An answer to the question as to whether he had received from the Indian side the commitment to deal with the matter turned out to be the Minister.
“We’ve already been quite promised,” he merely stated.
A Czech is talking about ringing around the seabed
It comes to an electronic map on which Australia and the adjacent sea areas are pictured.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but a small point, lost in the blue of the ocean.
“The island belongs to Australia and along with it is also the adjacent seabed.
The area is as large as the continent itself - according to Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is one of the thirty employees of the UN Divison for Oceans and Sea Rights.
His boss, Division Director, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the interpretation and complements it.
This is where labor and enthusiasm prevails.
The sea floor has so far been a little-known world that is rich in natural sources.
This is where oil is found, the more ore and other non-growing raw materials, but also unknown living organisms, which, for example, bear the key to developing a drug against cancer.
A sea floor larger than the mainland
Today, the state states of the country have notified vehement of their right to the new seabeds.
After a UN convention, they make use of their rights to which they agreed in Montego Bay in Jamaica in 1982.
This is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often extends up to several hundred kilometers from the shore of a country into the sea.
According to the Convention, this country has an exclusive right to all sources of the continental shelf.
“Simply expressed as a continental shelf, the part of the sea floor and its soles is considered to be a natural continuation of the continent below the sea surface.
He crossed the shoreline, often the border of two hundred miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone, explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by the Commission's country to fix the external borders of the continental shelf must be submitted through a comprehensive scientific and technical documentation based on many cost-intensive investigations and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
\"One of our tasks is to provide the Commission with legal and technical assistance.
The Commission has so far negotiated five applications, namely Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Until now, only the three last countries have been successful, adding Mikulka.
A recent international echo was the success of Australia, which was the first country to significantly expand its seabeds.
But New Zealand is also a winner - the extension of the seabed, which was approved by the Commission last week, is about 1.6 million square kilometers, about six times more than the size of the actual state.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the investigations.
The profits they will gain in the future from the use of the seabed will, as they promise, have an invaluable value.
Other States will also gradually submit their applications.
They can do this for ten years from the moment they ratify the Montego Bay Agreement.
There, where the continental shelf ends, begins the area of the ocean floor, which is referred to by the Convention as the “common heritage of mankind”.
This is where no state has a special position.
The right to promote this area shall be granted to an international institution set up by the Convention.
“The seabed is not a goldland, however,” says director Mikulka with something exaggeration, adding that “some areas are legally precisely defined and the system is contractually anchored.
Czech Republic
A part of the seabed is now part of the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other countries of the former Eastern bloc within the framework of the joint organization Interoceanmetal
In 1991, as well as the investors of some of the less developed countries, the latter received the status of a so-called \"traffic investor\"
The organization has the right to promote in the ClarionClipperton Zone in the Still Ocean between Mexico, Hawai and Kiribati.
The area to be examined by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The sea floor is divided there, it is a species of tatra on the sea floor.
“Forage can be found there on an area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich site of polymetal concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese - another lawyer, the Inder Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian staff of the Rober Sandev division brings such a concretion as a pattern.
She reminds of a small potato or, with some imagination, of the legendary shem that has brought the legend to life after the golem.
German Special Forces were on site in case of hostage exemption
The Egyptian government had requested help to solve the hostage crisis from Germany - the experts came.
When it became serious, the special units were ready for use, but they did not.
European tourists who have been kidnapped in Egypt will become increasingly familiar with the circumstances of the liberation of eleven.
According to the Ministry of Defense and Interior, German special forces were indirectly involved in the rescue.
According to this, specialists from the German Federal Armed Forces as well as officials from the GSG 9, were the pilot staff of the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Office, and logistics experts from the Technical Aid Office in the place of liberation.
As Ministers spoke on Monday evening, however, German forces were not needed because hostages had run their prisoners and fled when they recognized signs of violent liberation.
The Egyptian government has accepted the assistance offered by Germany to involve it as local support forces.
“Happy it didn’t come to this,” said a spokesperson of the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
Attackers had kidnapped the group from the five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions on 19 September in southern Egypt.
After the abduction in a desert area in southern Egypt, the hostages had been dragged into the border between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of hostages remained unclear until the end as well as the details of the exemption or possible ransom payments.
The Gerettes have now arrived well preserved in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the freed hostages were in the custody of the German Embassy.
He did not comment on the details of the release.
At first, there was no information in Berlin when they returned to Germany.
According to \"Picture\"Zeitung, the five holidaymakers and the special forces are to be flown out with an Air Force Airbus and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. House of Representatives rejects rescue package
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress failed the 700 billion dollar heavy rescue package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones sprang into the depths.
With 206 to 227 votes, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government's rescue package for the financial markets.
Despite all the appeals made by U.S. President George W. Bush and leading politicians of both parties, there was no majority for the programme, with which the chaos was to be restrained in the financial markets.
In a dramatic action, the advocates had desperately tried to convince the critics of the $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiators, had called on Members to give their consent, even if the plan was unpopular.
“It is difficult to get political recognition for the avoidance of something that has not yet occurred,” he admitted.
In the course of the vote, Dow Jones broke by more than six percent or by 600 points.
The investors were worried that the state rescue package could fail.
He recovered shortly before the end of the vote to crash again after the failure.
Experts are now expecting further heavy turbulence on the international financial markets.
The entry into force of the programme requires the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Organizers report increasing booking numbers
It seems to be a good winter for the German tour organisers:
In the case of travel bookings for the coming months, sales have risen significantly in comparison to the previous year according to a study - even by more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite poor economic prospects, the German's desire for travel remains unsatisfied.
During the winter season bookings, the travel agencies recorded an increase in sales of 31 percent compared to the previous year, as reported by the Deutsche Reiseverband (DRV) on Monday in Berlin.
According to the study by the market research institute GfK, booking figures are already increasing for the autumn months.
For example, the increase in turnover of travel agencies for October was around 11 percent compared to 2007, the DRV reported.
The basis for these results are figures from the GfK, which evaluates monthly booking data from 1200 German travel agencies and is high for the overall market.
The travel bookings were recorded until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar price, travel to the United States was particularly required, the DRV reported.
This is where the increase in bookings is around a third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece as well as the local fields were particularly sought-after destinations among the Germans.
DRV President Klaus Laepple explained in particular travel packages are high in the course.
In view of the rising cost of energy and food, the cost is better calculated for the customer than for the individual organized holiday.
Money could save consumers, among other things, through early book discounts or all-inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months were also very well booked, so that sales would again be recorded compared to the previous year - although according to one further study the number of Germans who made a trip decreased compared to the previous year.
My first time of October
Ballermann-Apres-Ski-hits in the endless loop, beer made of liter-crews and promise in designer-dirndln.
A meadow debut.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't actually have much in common.
She is blond, television moderator and wears a tailor-made dirndl.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is second hand.
But one thing connects us: Almost three minutes on the meadow, the photographers already crash on us and cut the memory cards completely - very flattering and that on my first visit to the meadow.
That's how you make friends.
The Cheap-Dirndl seems to fulfill its purpose.
As Wiesn-Touri and actually north of the white-rooted staquator, the well-being remained within limits until the date.
But first arrived at Theresienwiese, it's half that bad.
Almost everyone wears Dirndl or leather pants; no one looks reticent or embarrassing - everything completely normal.
Strange views at the Schokobanan stand only harvest my Dirndlschürze.
A Municher draws my attention to the fact that I had wrongly bound the apron: “Links hoast free, middle virgin, right-forgiving, whiten behind,
At home, I freeze the loop from the back to the left.
“Passes” talk and laughs.
Others make less effort for subtle flirting techniques and wear simple fur hats on which \"To drunk to get dressed\" stands and extends to an unbought the naked back.
The young man with the exhibitionist attire is called Bob, comes from England and also visits the October festival for the first time.
He finds it \"gorgeous\" with a long-drawn \"oooooo\"
That's what he tells me after he's ridden himself of his previously drunk size.
Right next to one of these hydrants, all of whom think he's a garbage-ceiler.
So Bob is one of those notorious \"Wildbieslers\"
Others are not lucky to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At eight o'clock in the evening, sanitizers in scissors run over the courtyard, which have to take care of the poor swallowers.
The nurses always appear in the rudel - always four at once drag a covered carry from tent to tent.
This works like with most pointer visitors: Empty back, full back.
You don't see anyone lying under the plan in the Promille-Sarg.
“These are the ones where you can pack every day, ” cried one of the sanitizers on request and disappeared in the commotion.
Name of the accident victim announced by the police
The name of a 63-year-old female pedestrian who died in the hospital after she was driven into Essex by a vehicle was announced.
Carole Paulson, who lives on the Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road in the city center.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident because of suspicion of easy driving.
In the meantime he was released on bail.
Turkey extends the diplomatic horizon
Long before Turkey sought to join the European Union, the European powers were interested in entering the hinterland of Turkey.
On the eastern side of the Bosporus, perhaps just 20 steps within Asia, one of the finest relics of this failed imperial aspiration stands.
The Hydarpasha Railway Station was designed by the two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in Neo-Renaissance style.
That's at least what the guide tells you.
The building sits third at the end of the platform with a tower on each corner of the front and thus looks like some provincial German town hall.
The rock is dirty.
The whole building decays for example
But once you're inside the vaulted ticket switch, there's no doubt about the feasibility of the project, the westernmost of which was access.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolia-Bagdad Society.
Germany, which was a late mover in the imperialist game, had to implement its ambitions, the Middle East, by means of a train link to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond to dominate what is now Saudi Arabia.
But Germany's imperialist project paralysed during World War I.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arabs.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, created by the invincible limits of cold war, has disappeared.
British forces moved out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria
And there was also bad news for the Hyderpasha train station.
In 1917 a munitions train flew into the air, destroying the artificial roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has been slowly decaying, far removed from history.
Today, however, this railway line, at least symbolically, serves as a gateway to Anatolia and all eastern of it to highlight the expansion of the diplomatic horizon of Tükei.
The ruling judicial and development party, the ACP, has introduced a full new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the neighbouring regions, created by the borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
Now there is a policy of approximation.
Notably, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian split groups Hamas and Fatah, with Iran and Iraq and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to assess the key data of this new foreign policy, I have taken the night train to the Turkish capital Ankara to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts in the ACP, the Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours later, after a rough journey on tracks that produced the parallel step of the old world in the famous documentary \"The Night Mail\", I arrived in the Turkish capital, which is considered a new city, for the new world-wide state project, to return to the Ottoman past.
However, the ACP, known for its Islamist roots, represents a paradigm shift in Turkish unity
This has triggered some distrust in the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi has brought me to the main office of the AKP, a specially manufactured, ultra-modern stone and steel structure, in a developing suburb surrounded by semi-finished shopping centers and pubs in which middle managers met in suits, both men and women, to complete the first business of the day.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a mid-right politician of almost any other political party in Europe.
Dress up, tie, I'm sure he even packed a blackberry.
\"The aim of the party's foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey with its immediate neighbouring countries.
The Cold War was an exceptional event - he tells me.
Turkey had been cut off from its hinterland.
Nowadays it must look east and west at the same time.
There would not be either one or the other.
You'd have to do both.
\"But surely Turkey could at some point - I asked, \"be forced to decide\"
\"Turkey\" he said, \"if this decision is not to be taken,
He then pointed out a point that almost everyone with whom I was speaking was almost routine: Turkey's relations, not only to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, are just as beneficial for Europe and the United States as they are for Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be that, in a transmitted sense, Europe as a whole can travel on just that rail east towards Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha's train station, after another largely sleepless night, I thought about these two German kingdoms Mr. Ritter and Mr. Conu, who had been watching the construction of this building 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to learn that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East could now, too far, lie in Turkey's hands.
And when I was waiting at the mooring site to bring me back over the Bosporus, I remembered that Turkey was always called “the sick man of Europe” in those days.
At least at that time, there seemed to be little doubt as to which continent should have a claim to this fascinating country.
In memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: Since 1962, as Guildford's musical director, Vernon-Death-Handley (recall 11 September) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic and Choir.
As part of his music program for the city, he founded his great youth choir, Proteus, next year.
He was thinking of young people until 21 years of age, but when the choir sang in 1979 for the last time, some of us were already at the end of 20 - we simply refused to leave the choir.
The name “Proteus” (the mythological form changer) was used for the willingness and ability of the choir to attack any piece of music presented to him, whether it was a Madrigal or from the Messiah, whether a capella or with a full orchestra.
The musical versatility of such a young choir was often amazing, always exciting and existed only thanks to the inspiration of that man and his enthusiasm for the music that never passed down for years.
How often did death stop us from speaking the music for ourselves?
He used to say, \"The composer knows what he wants\"
It's all in music.
So it sings \"
His kind of directing was absolutely clear and precise, never heretical, but never superfluous.
As high as the musical level was, he always demanded an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any conductor had been beaten to the knight, it would have been Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, in which he led the Guildford Philharmonic.
In the last 40 years approximately I have written criticisms for over a hundred of his concerts and I can truthfully say that I was never disappointed by one person - often I was inspired by them.
Death Handley was that rare combination of greatness and personal modesty.
He abdicated conductors who, according to his words, simply went to house with one or two well-known shoppers in the world,
So many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In your call for William Woodruff (25 September), you write that in 1946 he took over teaching business history in Oxford again and in 1950 received a Houblon Norman research scholarship ... while at the same time he studied for a BSc, a MA and a doctorate.
This is a conclusion from an author's remark in Woodruff's book \"Jenseits von Nab End\" but it is not true.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a lecturer of economic history at the University of Nottingham and during that time he wrote a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry under the care of Professor J.D. Chambers, who was later published in 1958 as the British rubber industry.
He spent the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he finally left Nottingham and went to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff wanted to change this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at Philological Faculty.
`I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino `Flamenco and Life' because his photographs are fantastic in black and white, in the documentary style.
They made me aware of them because of their simplicity and the power they radiate, as they always deal with the protagonists with respect.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feelings.
Resino knows how to find the magic moments.'
Second round of excellent sale at Honda.
In November Honda began marketing the second generation of Honda Jazz.
While its predecessor model had a large interior, this large-scale limousine offers a much larger one.
In addition, the technical features that make driving and gasoline even more comfortable are also available.
Changes before the upcoming revolution.
So is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although, aesthetically, the new jazz has a similar line to its predecessor, the changes made in this grand limousine are numerous.
Among other things, the innovative design, the new room flexibility, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanics will be emphasized.
However, before you begin to analyze the new model, you have to say that this new jazz appears six years later, after the first generation had appeared on the market.
According to the first observations, Honda managed to renew this model for a shorter time compared to the other manufacturers.
Although the Honda Jazz is less known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon in terms of its sales in the other markets.
This is a case in Japan, in the country where jazz is the most sold car in 2002 and also in the course of 2008.
After jazz appeared on the market, about one million models were sold in Japan alone.
The second market was the old continent, with about half a million cars sold in six years.
Nevertheless, Honda tries to increase sales of the new jazz model within the segment.
In this way, while Japanese companies sold a total of 83 000 jazz models in 2007, the expected estimates are 10 000 cars, which is 17% of the agreed growth on the European market.
As far as the Spanish market is concerned, Honda has sold a total of 8 000 jazz models since 2002. This is 6.7% of the total sales at Honda in Spain.
As far as the new generation of the model is concerned, the heads of the branch in Spain expect to be able to sell 2 000 jazz models per year.
More precisely, the emergence of the new Honda Jazz model allows to exchange the selling discount in Spain.
In reality, the head of the brand hopes to complete the year with total sales of 22 000 models, which is 4,000 cars less than in 2007, a 16% reduction.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda has increased its market share in Spain compared to the previous year (1.6%) to 1.8%.
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to be able to reach 2% in 2010.
To achieve this share, Honda relies on the appearance of a new model.
This is insight, a hybrid car with 5 doors and a compact size of 4.7 meters in length, the Japanese company hopes to sell about 200 000 models a year around the world.
According to the market estimates of the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of Insight models are sold in the United States while the remaining portion is distributed in the Old continent and Japan.
The show of Insight on the market is scheduled for the first months of the year, for the first time its public presentation will take place in Valencia in January.
With regard to the first generation, the new jazz grows in all its sizes.
Its length is 3.90 meters (plus 5 centimeters), its width is 1.69 meters (plus 2 centimeters) and the distance between the axes is 2.50 meters, which leads to the assumption that it has grown to 5 centimeters.
The height, on the other hand, does not change and remains 1.52 meters.
Together with increasing dimensions, the interior is also enlarged.
This success is due, on the one hand, to the new spatial flexibility programme and, on the other hand, to the central position of the fuel tank, a solution also used in jazz's predecessor model.
The capacity of the trunk, which has a double loading area system, also reaches up to 339 litres, that is, 19 litres larger than the first generation trunk capacity.
It must be stressed that these measures are available in the version with a 1.4 litre petrol engine, because the capacity of Honda Jazz's trunk with a 1.2 litre gasoline engine is 379 litres.
Among other improvements, other than the additional equipment elements such as leather seats or the possibility to install panoramic windows, improved access to the seats is offered.
The opening angle of the rear doors is 80 degrees, with the first jazz only 67 degrees.
The engines of the second generation of jazz are also new.
At the beginning of its marketing this small model has 2 versions of petrol engines: 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both versions have i-VTEC system, which allows low fuel consumption and smaller CO2 emissions, has excellent technical performance and at the same time provides torque-powered power for the entire engine life.
The first version with 1.2 litres achieves the power of 90 hp at 6 000 rotations with maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4 900 min?1 .
This petrol engine - the predecessor model of jazz reaches 78 hp - has 5.3 litres of gasoline consumption and CO2 emissions of 125 grams.
With regard to the previous engine, which reached 83 hp at the previous generation, it now manages to reach 100 hp.
The Jazz 100 PS model 1.4 has 5.4 liters of gasoline consumption and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
`Auto-Biene', which avoids collisions
In order to advance the development of the technologies for accident prevention, Nissan was inspired by nature this time, more specifically by bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot whose flight relies on the swarming behaviour of bees and avoid accidents.
This robot is a Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C and represents the first step in the technologies for accident prevention.
The engineers from the Technical Development Centre of Nissan Motor Co. have developed this small robot in cooperation with Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology at the renowned University of Tokyo (Japan).
According to Kazuhiro Doi, head of technology PR and R&D-Brand Management, BR23C is an extension of the four-layer Nissan security shield.
This robot is designed to ensure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid the collisions.
During flight, each bee builds its own oval-shaped airspace, which is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important are the face eyes of the bee, which can see in all directions over an angle of 300 degrees, which allows her to fly uninterruptedly in her personal airspace without interruption.
The technicians developed the so-called Laser Range Finder (LRF) to reflect the round-up perspective.
He notices obstacles that are located at a distance of up to two meters in front of the BR23C and are in the radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to an on-board microprocessor, which is directly translated into signal for the avoidance of collision
`In the moment when obstacle is noticed, the small robot will imitate the bee flight and immediately change direction by rotating its wheels around 90o or even larger angles to avoid collision.
The biggest difference to other systems is that this escape maneuver is absolutely instinctive.
If it were not, the robot could not be able to react at sufficient speed to avoid obstacles,' explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the Mobility Laboratory and the managing engineer of this project.
In contrast to a bee, the robot can neither deviate upwards nor downwards, but also not overhead; it can only move on two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to rotate its wheels and not in the infinite directions and in an infinite way how it makes the bees.
For this reason, in addition to acceleration and braking functions, Nissan has used the rotation function to prevent the small robot from collisions.
`This device only needs a few seconds to process the information and act according to this information.
It does not require storing neither the information nor the intuitive logic of the maneuvers done, so it can work continuously with only a couple of dozens of KB of the storage space.
That sounds surprising, but it's not about the GBs and not even about the MBs of the memory space.
This is the first step in the development of technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan will introduce in the series cars in the next ten years.
The robot works with lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and hold longer than the variety of lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system by satellite to lead to the goal when driving and to avoid obstacles along the way.
She's in trouble before she's charged with a mortgage.
One must see that the US Finance Ministry, unless it has sufficient liquidity to provide support, is not without skill.
Before the crisis and to avoid the involvement of US citizens in mortgage stories of supposedly affordable banks, a entertaining and informative game was developed for Internet users: `Bad Credit Hotel', it says.
Or maybe, the 'hotel of bad credit' or the mess.
The third aspect of this accommodation and especially its receptionist is to consider once, two and up to three times whether it is the moment to ask for no credit.
And above all, where you can do it, whatever is probably the goal of the game.
She certainly has useful information, but without details.
This is more a side for teenagers than a place for all spectators.
What will happen when the game is expanded?
Well, when a dreamy room appears at the hotel.
At least something, because it's not about buying a better house
Morgan Stanley makes its capital available to MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) into its company, which would be the first bank in Japan to spend nine billion dollars and thus take over 21% of its capital, a innovation that is due to a strong fall in its stock exchange rate.
One week after a preliminary agreement was made public, the two banks explained that MUFG will buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's stock at a uniform price of $25.25, resulting in a total of three billion dollars.
The accepted price is below 19% of the share price of 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional six billion dollars in the acquisition of convertible shares, which will secure a 10% profit and can be resold at a price of 31.25 dollars.
Morgan Stanley explained that the global business is made on the basis of a single average price of $229, that is 28% above the current price value.
However, the Morgan Stanley share dropped by 6.79% to 23.07 against 17.00 GMT.
`This strategic connection is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to the status of a holding bank,' said John Mack, director general of the American group.
Morgan Stanley has adopted this status last week, which will enable him to extend his business to new areas, but under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.
Their connection with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street's biggest names to take a much more cautious stance than before.
The modalities presented on Monday also show that the agreement has been changed over the last few days: Last Monday Morgan had simply explained that she would sell up to 20% of her shares for about $8.5 billion to Japan.
`A week ago', said in Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, managing director of MUFG, 'we thought that participation would consist entirely of common shares.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and secure ourselves. '
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay 7% below its price value for its Morgan Stanley shares.
And the business will start with a reduction in profits by about 20% per share.
The agreement provides that in one year, MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential shares into common shares if the latter are exchanged at more than 50% over the sales value within a given period, i.e. to about 47 dollars.
Morgan Stanley assures us that the funds provided by MUFG will enable him to use investment opportunities, strengthen their balance sheet and increase their sales.
However, a press spokesperson of the group refused to provide more detailed information on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After MUFG's investment, Morgan Stanley should be able to book a liability ratio of about 15%, one of the best in this sector.
Morgan explained that since the end of August, his balance sheet has been 'clearly' lowered.
The last few weeks were hard for the group to look at, as their stock exchange rate decreased by half, while the price for insurance against incapacity for payment increased.
This price went back on Monday, but remained at a high level, at about 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only other 'survivor' of the large investment banks on Wall Street after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced last week, worth 15 billion dollars, in part at Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa this Monday in Quito.
Refounding the Republic around 21st century socialism.
This is the joint project of Venezolaner Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morale and Equatorial Rafael Correa.
That third party, following this Sunday, the example of his like-minded and friends, was the plan of a new constitution for election.
Mission fulfilled, because according to the 80% of voter votes, 64% voted with 'Yes' in the referendum.
According to these results 28% agreed with 'No', 7% of the ballots were invalid and 0.7% were empty.
In order for the constitutional project to be adopted, a vote must be taken more than half of all votes cast.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the exits of the electoral venues and a count of a non-governmental organization announced a clear victory for 'Yes', and predicted him 63% to 70%.
On the night of Sunday on Monday, Rafael Correa had also demanded the victory of his constitutional project.
The 'Constitution has triumphed overwhelmingly', he had insured in Guayaquil, the seat of the government 280 kilometers southwest of Quito, and congratulated the equatorials.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales, but also by his Chilean like-minded Michelle Bachelet.
The election held in silence in accordance with the observational arrangement of the Organization of the American States (OAS) referred to a 444-point text on the safeguarding of 'new socialism' for which the President stands.
The constitutional project transfers state power to the economy by leaving it the sole right to 'development planning' in a country that is largely alive by the oil promotion of foreign firms and foreign currency, sending immigrants to the country.
The project, which will be driven by the Correa elected in 2006, will also give the Head of State more extensive power, which will be able to exercise up to two consecutive mandates of four years each, and will have the opportunity to dissolve the National Assembly.
Correa already announced that he would take advantage of this power and seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also secures the principle of free medical care and education, which the President has already begun to introduce into this country with 13.9 million inhabitants living below the poverty line by 50% of the population.
Finally, it also intends to ban the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington on the use of an equatorial base station as a starting point for American anti-drug operations.
The 19 hostages were released in Chad
An Egyptian command launched the attack on the abductors of the eleven tourists and their eight companions who had been captured ten days ago.
You're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions, who were held captive in the desert for eleven days, were brought back to the Egyptian capital this Monday afternoon, healthy and unharmed.
In the morning they had been freed from an Egyptian command in Chad.
Apparently in good condition, the hostages reached the military base at 15.30 a.m. on board a special aircraft right next to Cairo's international airport.
They were taken directly without being able to speak to the press on board a helicopter to the hospital of Maadi, a foreign district of Cairo, to be examined there.
They enjoy all the 'best health' and the abductors were not paid a ransom', explained Egyptian Minister of Tourism Zoheir Garanna on the Rollfeld.
After being captured on 19 September at a land car safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat in the border area of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, the group of hostages was repeatedly brought to the next of 35 unknown kidnappers from a hiding place.
These are eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and also eight Egyptians: two leaders, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the agency Aegyptus, organiser of the Safari.
An Egyptian security officer said that 30 members of the special units, from the board of two helicopters, started the attack at night just before dawn.
'On both sides, shots fell and half of the kidnappers were killed, the rest fled,' said this controller who wants to remain anonymous.
He explained that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special units had been sent to Sudan, where they received support through German and Italian commands.
The head of the Italian diplomats Franco Frattini reported from Belgrade, where he is located, the role played by secret agents and elements of the Italian special units.
'We must acknowledge that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and performance of our men from the intelligence and the special units,' he explained without further details.
He also argued that a ransom had been paid.
On the eve of the evening, the Sudanese army had claimed to have stopped a land vehicle with a patrol, in which the kidnappers, of whom they killed six, including the leaders from the Chad, and two arrests.
The army declared that they were in conjunction with a rebel group from Darfour, the Libération du Soudan-Unité (SLA-U) movement, which, however, immediately fought this movement.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture makes headlines and is the central theme of the current electoral struggle.
That's better.
But an area of our cultural life continues to be forgotten.
Who will rise up and denounce the pitiful sums granted to the small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical sites, who will starvely starve?
What politicians dare to remind the federal government that they neglect their monuments and their culturally important buildings?
That there are no right laws in Quebec, as in Canada, that effectively protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government provides 3.5 million euros only for the restoration of Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
Our American neighbours have written in their country's constitution that the protection of the cultural heritage belongs to the culture of the American, and that this cultural heritage must be protected by all citizens, all Members and all government districts, in mutual agreement.
In Quebec, in the association of Quebec's historical societies, at least 40,000 honorary officials gathered in 211 historical societies strive to deal intensively with history, save with a few grotesques the numerous private archives, and preserve the archaeological remains.
They are also often the watchdogs of our cultural heritage protesting with the power of despair when promoters and decision-makers release their bulldozers on our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will there be a stage for history and cultural heritage?
Benelux Governments State-owned parts of Fortis Bank
With a partial nationalization, the Benelux states want to undermine the Belgian-Holland Fortis Bank, which has been hit by the US financial crisis in turbulence: the three countries provide a total of EUR 11.2 billion to the Bank and Insurance Institute, which also has branches in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands have consulted at the highest level on the weekend, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the Commissioner for Competition of the European Commission.
In the eurozone, Fortis is the first victim of the ongoing international financial market crisis for a year, so decisions that are now taken in connection with the bank could have precedent.
In the sense of the decision made on Sunday night, all three countries purchase the respective shares of the bank at about 49 percent.
The bank will probably sell part of its shares, especially the insurance activities purchased by the Dutch ABN Amro last year.
The shares of the Fortis started a steep valley trip last week, and in the second half of the week serious crisis scenarios were already emerging.
However, analysts agree that the bank, with its 85,000 employees, is far too big for a pleasure.
The Institute's securities fell by 12% on Friday to a 14-year low.
Since January, the value of the shares has decreased by more than two-thirds.
In view of the current stock prices, the Group's market value is EUR 14 billion, which according to management is unrealistic.
The management considers that the USD 700 billion expensive American rescue package and the resulting uncertainty in the markets are due to the Talfahrt der Fortis-Aktien.
On Monday, however, the courses rose slightly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed new Director-General of the Bank.
The monetary institution was also looking for a private buyer, but it did not find any interest with a reasonable offer.
The Belgian government, however, was trying to calm down - no investor should sit down for his money, it said.
No panic has erupted among customers, the branches of the bank have not been stormed.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent branches, but it also calls leasing companies its own.
Fuchs in the chicken stall
Due to the drug consumption of a person, life insurance and health insurance in America often refuse to conclude a contract with a customer.
Data protection experts fear that the data market could become uncontrollable.
“There are data protection programs that link the use of the medication data to the consent of the person concerned in any case.
These should be in independent hand, otherwise we trust the fox to the chicken - the Washington Post Richard Dick, developer of the program for tracking prescription data.
Insurance sets the fees as well as the amounts of payment in the event of damages depending on the health status of the customer, and should the risk be overestimated, the insurance will not be completed at all.
In the past, the customer was sent to a medical examination, and the contract was only concluded in knowledge of the results of the investigation.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a far cheaper method: Using the identification number of the customer, he makes reference to the data of the last one and a half years from the pharmacies, explains which preparations were bought, and the program calculates from which the customer's illness is suffering and how his health condition is.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol reducing medication, his blood fat level could be untreated, which would automatically line him up into a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the program in circulation - some even define a risk multiplier, so that the insurance companies only have to do the paperwork more, but there are minor difficulties.
One of the disadvantages is that many drugs can be taken for various purposes, such as migraines and heat walls, as well as depression.
The latter is a high risk factor from the insurer's point of view, while the former does not.
For the collection and processing of the data, own societies have formed which, before they obtain the data, ask the patient for his consent.
In the meantime, they have to do so by law, although omissions have not been mentioned so far.
Some companies even process the results of laboratory investigations and combine them with the data on drug consumption, thus providing an even more accurate picture of the health status of patients.
More and more companies have access to the data and control of their use is becoming more difficult at the same time.
While there is a private data protection law for health data, its effect is limited to healthcare service providers and insurance providers.
The draft law was already submitted to Congress, according to which the authorities could also control the data processing companies.
Dick Richard sees that this is too little, so he wants to develop his program further, so that the data can only be passed on with the consent of the person concerned.
Another question is, of course, that the data subject can hardly prohibit access to his data, since the insurance companies do not otherwise conclude a contract with him.
And so the chickens are only quite somehow left to the grace of the fox.
Global food plan from Marseille
European Union and India double trade
After the European Union and India are both leading trading partners of the other, this was the main issue in addition to other global problems at the ninth summit.
Today, the French-Indian Summit is also taking place, which discusses mainly nuclear energy cooperation.
While the European Union recognises that India is an emerging, democratic power, which should be given more votes and say no to international concerns, Member States have not yet been able to agree whether or not to support the continued membership of New Delhi in the UN Security Council.
This question was not discussed yesterday at yesterday's ninth Summit in Marseille.
The French President and current EU Council President Nicolas Sarkozy, and Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Chief Diplomat Javier Solana received the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. An agreement was reached to double trade over the next five years, i.e. to raise to EUR 100 billion.
Given that the trade in goods increased from 25 to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this objective is not even so ambitious.
In this sense, too, the 26 existing Civil Aviation Agreements with India have been legally merged into an agreement, so that air transport will continue to fly.
By 2009, India would like to sign the Free Trade Agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the pact.
The aim is to establish a balance in the currently unbalanced relationship between the EU and India: while the Union is the partner number one in India, New Delhi is only ranked nine among the EU partners.
The summit was dedicated to global concerns.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, or terrorism, which both sides strongly condemned, also called for a UN conference to be convened.
The Doha round should also be completed, with both sides to blame for the failure.
The EU stressed that it adhered to its energy and climate programme, which means that emissions of pollutants will be reduced by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agreed to conclude a sort of global compromise at the forthcoming climate summit and to reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 percent by 2050.
The rise in prices in food should also be combated, so both support the appointment of an international conference on the financial crisis.
The Indian Head of Government is visiting the French capital today, where he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, however, orders to French companies worth EUR 20 billion for the construction of nuclear reactors in India are expected.
According to Agency notifications, the agreement is to be decided for 15 years.
Over 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the International Frankfurt Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th Book Fair, the most important international event for rights acquisition.
The international Frankfurt Book Fair expects more than 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries for the current event. They will distribute over 171,790 square meters of the fair and will present over 403,000 titles. Turkey will be the guest of the event.
The Under-Secretary of the Ministry of Cultural Goods and Cultural Activities Maria Giro will represent the Italian government during the opening ceremony in the exhibition hall: Italy will be represented in the 264 sqm exhibition space \"Punto Italia\".
This will be followed by a press conference near the Room Structure in the exhibition hall 5.0 of the book fair: on this occasion, numbers, trends and perspectives about publishing in Italy will be discussed.
According to the data, the importance of the books of foreign writers is decreasing throughout the whole, especially in the adult and youth sectors.
A year ago the small plane of the billionaire Steve Fossett disappeared
Steve Fossett's small plane, which disappeared on a flight over Nevada's desert on September 3, 2007, was discovered.
The individual parts have been found on a high plateau of 3000 m altitude, in the Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes area between the states of California and Nevada.
However, there were no human remains inside the plane.
The Sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, fully voiced the last doubts during a press conference: “The plane has been located on which a troop was sent out. Now we have the assurance that it is the aircraft with which Steve Fossett flew on the day of his disappearance.
Mr. Anderson also confirmed that no human remains were found in the plane or its vicinity.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Transport Safety Office (Ntsb) noted that a team was sent a few hours after the aircraft was sighted, which identified the machine: the Bellanca 8kkab, which was lost on September 3, 2007, after Fossett started a 3-hour flight in Yerrington in Nevada.
Yesterday, too, in California, not far from the border with Nevada, some of Fossett's personal items were found by a couple near their home at Mammoth Lakes.
These are two cards called Fossetts, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of illinois, cash and a jacket.
The search for Fossett had been abandoned a month after its disappearance.
The billionaire had conquered a place in history through a long sequence of records.
In 2002, he succeeded in the sixth run, when the first man surrounded the world ball in a hot air balloon: a two-week, lonely flight.
Three years later he flew around the world in a single flight with an airplane.
Among its several records there is also an altitude flight of 15445 m over the Andes, but this one with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
A suv, which falls through its original design and special line guide, the exhausting surface and its clear angle from the conventional schemata.
With this offroader Mercedes-Benz has tried to breathe new breath into the sector.
Due to its extraordinary properties, the performance of the Suv Glk will also be unconventional, which will be seen in the showroom of Mercedes-Benz from 17 October.
Thus, the advertising drum, which will accompany the appearance of the new model, will also appear in a new dress, namely in the form of a 3D campaign - this is a novelty in the automotive sector in backward Italy.
A project with a maximum effort to be carried out in different phases, which will take the central shopping mile of Milan, the Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first face will consist of the presentation of the car in shape, with 3D glasses distributed near the Corso Como giving the whole a special look: the new suv will thus appear in its nearly real dimensions as a three-dimensional model.
In fact, the car will appear so seemingly from the poster on which it is depicted.
With the help of the Elumina8 technology, the new Glk is illuminated at different moments in all its details in order to put it together again as a whole.
Without a doubt, Mercedes's concern with this advertising is to introduce a new way of advertising into this more stereotyped field.
But will it succeed in traveling the interest of future buyers? We will see it.
Now it's clear who the Italian Hooligans are
They come from the Triveneto - now they risk stadium ban
Who are only these 150-200 boys and girls, for whom all Italy is ashamed now? They are part of the \"Ultras Italia\" group that has been traveling behind the Italian national team for years and which, in fact, has not caused serious problems until recently.
Never before has there been any clashes with opposing fans.
The origin of the group lies in the right environment.
The sponsors come from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
Other smaller groups from Campania and Apulia were among these in Sofia.
They carry the Tricolori, on which the cities of the militants appear: but they were away on Saturday to avoid identification.
Their examples are the English fans.
In Bulgaria it now came to the collision with a truly right-wing radical fan scene, that of Levski.
From Figc, the Italian fans had made 144 cards available for the game: all were issued by name and thus easy to control.
In fact, they were also controlled all by the Viminal: among those traveling to Sofia there was no one using an ongoing stadium ban procedure.
Four fans of the Italian team, who were already charged in this respect, were also denied the ticket and the trip to Bulgaria.
Now, the Viminal is waiting for the reports of the Bulgarian police to take further steps: in this case, the arrested or identified Tifosi can expect to have at least five years of stadium bans.
This is an international ban preventing access to the stadiums across Europe.
So our Hooligans will no longer put a foot in a stadium.
Good luck.
But now, of course, there is fear of imitation cities, which could follow little more than 150.
\"This fire must be immediately removed, and in no case will such conduct give such conduct the opportunity to justify it - it is from the Viminal.
Therefore, \"eyes on especially with a view to the game of the national team on Wednesday in Lecce\"
Indeed, in Puglia there is a small core of the Italian Ultras.
Tomorrow, the Osservatorio (Sport Supervisory of Sports) gathers on Tuesday the Casms, which can count on part of the Aise, that is, the secret services dealing with the problem of stadium violence.
“Duce-Duce Rufe and the raised right arm during the hymn of Mameli? In Bulgaria this is not a crime...”
This is the thought of Domenico Mazzilli (often expressed in no joy), who for a few weeks is the director of the Osservatorio on the Viminal (he took over the posts of Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Previously Mazzilli was the police president of Trieste, where a core of the supporters of the Ultras Italia, founded in 2002.
It is true, says Mazzilli, that it is not against the law in Bulgaria to praise the duce, but without a doubt the conduct of these 150-200 persons was a shame.
“I am not a sociologist, adding the No. 1 of the Osservatorio - crimes are condemned in the country of their actions.
So far, this group had been in the vanguard, but now needs to consider what is going to happen and what will happen.
But we also talk about the pipes during the hymn Mamelis: even though this is not a crime, they allow me, but there is no education...
