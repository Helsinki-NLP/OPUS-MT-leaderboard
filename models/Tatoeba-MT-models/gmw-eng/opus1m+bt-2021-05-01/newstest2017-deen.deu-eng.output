28-year-old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old cook, who has recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead in the stairwell of a local shopping center.
The victim's brother said that he could not imagine anyone trying to harm him, \"At last he got up again,
Leichnam found in the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as the 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, the judicial department in San Francisco.
The San Francisco Police Department said that death was classified as murder and the investigation is ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, informed the KGO ABS transmitter in San Francisco that Frank, who used to work as a cook in Boston, had reached his dream job six months ago as a cook at the Sons & Daughters Restaurant in San Francisco.
A spokesman of the Sons & Daughter said that they were \"shocked and destroyed on the ground\" about his death.
“We’re a small team that works like a close family and we’re going to miss him painfully,” the speaker continued.
Our thoughts and our condolences are in this difficult time with Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia stated that Frank first lived in hostels, but that, \"the things for him finally went uphill\"
“He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend,” said Louis Garcia KGO.
Louis Galicia said he couldn't imagine anyone trying to hurt his younger brother.
He was a kind person with a great heart.
His way to connect with his family was to always cook us, to prepare the dinner, - said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to participate in any sort of argument.
He was the brother who was swimming with the river.
“For everything that was going wrong in the world, he was this uncut diamond, shining brightly every day,” he said.
Any person who has information about the case will be asked to call the SFPD's notification phone under point 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I am always put in drawers
Jennifer Aniston doesn't always have to be perfect or successful.
In an interview, the Hollywood star has now made it absolutely clear.
“I’m always stuck in drawers or getting stuck from outside labels that have little to do with me and the reality,
“I don’t have the desire to be perfect and successful at all times,” he said.
\"Surely, I think these things are rather snuff to me,
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh at her as being “Miss Perfect,” as she explains in the current “Cosmopolitan”.
The actress loves to spend her time at home, forming television with loose duet and Mexican food, it says in the magazine.
To the white glut they raise the question of the child’s desire: “We women don’t have to be married or have children to be perfect, so the Hollywood star.
In her new film \"Mother's Day - Love is not a children's play\" Aniston is seen as a single mother of two sons.
The film will run with us from August 25th.
Golfer Langer receives the sports pyramid
His experiences on the horse are manageable.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and a few colleagues were looking for a little variety with a ride on the beach.
For the 58-year-old, it was a premiere.
CHIO: \"Golden Sports Pyramid\" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes, the horses remembered their party night, they chased home at the fast gallops to feed.
A mile at this pace, I was scared.
“It wasn’t a good experience,” says Langer.
And with that, the riding career ended again.
On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament victories - was again near horses.
He was able to lead his family through the installation of the ALRV, and on a horse he did not even hang himself for photo purposes.
Longer was the first time in Aachen and thus also in the CHIO.
The reason was quite convincing.
The German sports assistant handed over the Golden Sport Pyramid to the man from Anhausen in the context of a small gala.
Awards do not lack the sympathetic athlete.
Federal Merit Cross, Silbernes Lorbeerblatt, Champions-Tour-Player of the Year...
Even the British Queen has already counseled him.
Longer is the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid.
In Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
“This award means a lot to me,” says Langer, “because it is awarded not only for sports success, but also for social engagement,
For decades, Langer has been promoting young people.
And so he also passed the price money of 25,000 euros right away.
With 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time U.S. master winner was admitted to the Hall of Fame of German Sports on Saturday.
The award-winning athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the fighters Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Push and Arnd Schmitt, the rower Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob driver Meinhard Nehmer, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the jump rider Alwin Shockemöhle and the posthumous handballer Erhard Wonderful.
Many of these sportsmen had come to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrious society moved into the Spring Stadium, where the Lavazza Prize ran.
Bernhard Langer kept distance to the big animals.
Clintons and Trump's economic policy compared: It's all about the money
Investing in infrastructure and preventing the TTP trade agreement - this is what Clinton and Trump both want.
However, there is no agreement between the two US presidential applicants on tax and energy policy as well as on a fundamental issue.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental rather philosophical difference.
The, about the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warns about how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to control the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says.
He himself, however, would be quite different, Trump claims.
He will go back to regulations massively, and he makes himself strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for businesses.
Clinton, on the other hand, says that the state has certain tasks to perform, it has opportunities to open up disadvantaged ones and needs money for this.
That is why the taxes for the rich would be increased, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close to the subject of infrastructure.
Trump and Clinton almost say the same thing.
The democratic candidate has even announced the largest investment in new jobs since World War II.
State investment programmes in infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are strictly rejected, for example, by the Republican state-critical Teaparty flights.
So Trump could still have a party-internal discussion.
The differences in energy and climate policy are more significant.
Trump wants to build coal power plants and continue to drive coal transport in the United States.
Oil promotion is also to be possible in areas which have so far been protected, and the Paris Convention wants to open up.
Clinton, on the other hand, wants to expand the renewable energies with its investment programme and asks: \"A country will become the superpower of clean energies and create millions of jobs\"
“It will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be,”
But not only in infrastructure - even with international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart.
TPP, the trans-Pacific trade agreement, both do not want to sign.
At the same time, however, both of them do not want to isolate the United States from international trade - they simply want to protect American jobs better.
They're supposed to be paid better then, for example Clinton.
The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a famine wage.
She wants to raise her to $15 per hour.
What Trump wants to do on this question is not quite clear: Once he says that the minimum wage must be raised, then he says that it should not be changed.
However, the major discussion of the coming months is probably more about the fiscal policy of the two camps.
On the one hand, Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens, stands to stimulate growth.
His critics argue that the budget deficit would only increase.
On the other hand, Clinton, who at least wants to ask the rich to pay more taxes, and whose critics say that more taxes are not the solution either.
Escape: \"Every fledgling woman has experiences with sexual violence,
Sexual violence belongs almost to everyday life for women who flee alone.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house offers refuge.
There are four women sitting in a large kitchen.
Each has a baby in it, which is not even a year old.
One of them put her little son in the arm.
He looks curiously into the room with great eyes.
His mother stares at the tabletop.
Until she realizes she's being watched.
She smiles briefly and kisses the little one.
The scene is normal.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is a business manager of Condrobs, a support provider in Bavaria, and, among other things, deals with women on the run.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralized accommodation units for single fledgling women and their children in Bavaria.
In January, Condrobs opened the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid.
It has recently been officially opened.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men - not even as visitors.
The exception is a guard in front of the door.
“It’s not exaggerating to say that every woman who arrives here has experienced sexual violence on her escape,” says Bahr.
“ Men are fleeing for wars because they are being persecuted politically, because they are threatening torture or death or because their families are sending them to Europe as hopemakers,” she tells.
In women, other reasons for the escape prevail: “Many secretly steal because they see no other way out, ”
In their home country, they have had experience in sexual violence, forced marriages, honor murders, slavery, or forced prostitution.
That's what they're going to do.
On the run, this goes on.
“For example, the sleeper’s demand for a bottle of water is not a rarity,” Bahr says.
And the women are alone; they are not protected by their families.
Who believes that this ends as soon as they arrive in Germany, mistakenly, tells Bahr.
Here, too, single women in refugee accommodation would often be considered inferior and abused most badly.
As a result, about 90 percent of the women living in the accommodation in the North of Munich are traumatized, she estimates.
\"Some of the children are certainly not born voluntarily,
Many women are so accustomed to saying nothing.
“Or they don’t trust to speak openly about the experience, because the shame is too big,
Since they often don't know how to help, more accommodation is needed only for them, Bahr demands.
In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the housing of refugees.
On the question of whether they knew of a similar project as in Munich in their area of competence, some answered with No.
In the Upper Palatinate and Upper Francia, for example, there is no such thing as accommodation by the governments.
Even in Schwaben, fledgling women alone are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, the government's press spokesperson.
In Upper Bavaria, lower and middle franks there are floors or own houses in some community accommodations only for single women and their children.
The exception is Niederbayern, there are two central accommodation units exclusively for women.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality also calls for women to be accommodated separately from men in the European Parliament.
A study published for the Committee states: “It is very important for men and women to be accommodated separately,
‘If privacy is lacking or men and women are accommodated together, violence against women can be brought about - ongoing -
In particular, the washrooms should be separate and easily accessible to women is the study.
How much the women feel about this need for protection can be read at the Andrang, which is available at the House in Munich.
“Since we have been around, we have a long waiting list,” Bahr says.
You could easily open a second house.
Assistants strike: demands for new work campaign measures
Representatives of the assistants have called on their union to approve new work-fighting measures in their disputes with regard to a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called on its entire Council to adopt more work-fighting measures from the beginning of September.
The JDC stated that it had been outlawed by ministers to address the concerns of the treaty.
Assistants and medical students voted in July on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA.
He was rejected by 58% of his members who voted in the elections.
In a letter to the members who were published on Twitter on Thursday evening, the chairman of JDC Ellen McCort said that the government would have remained \"silence\" to problems, which led to the rejection of the treaty.
She said: \"In view of this, the JDC Executive Board has voted to reject the proposed new contract completely and to request official renegotiations on all your concerns,
In response to the silence of the government, the JDC Executive Board today made a formal request to a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve a ongoing programme of escalating labour struggle measures that begins in early September.
The disputes caused assistant doctors to strike six times this year, the first total failures in the history of the NHS.
The BMA Assistant Director Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed contract terms recommended by the BMA.
He informed BMA members during the meetings, which were held before the vote by 54,000 assistants and medical students, that the contract should be advantageous and accepted.
After the vote, Minister of Health Jeremy Hunt said that the contract for doctors in England would necessarily be introduced.
Russia and Turkey: An Alliance of Foreigners?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and to announce an official war of words and economic sanctions at the end of the eight-month period.
But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish opponent in the golden hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot resist the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.
There was the handcuff, yes.
But Putin's smile was narrow and he hardly radiated heat, even for his restraining conditions.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke repeatedly of his “loved friend, ” Putin, according to a report a whole five times.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but would even improve.
The next day, a newspaper described Erdogan as having acted as if nothing bad had ever happened.
His enthusiasm seemed to me rather to indicate the opposite.
But one of Putin's radiant, sustainable cooling showed that the head of state had not forgotten anything.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the removal of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey.
Moscow's reaction to the time was well-burned.
Putin distributed and accused Ankara of falling Russia in the back.
The crime was even greater, since it was committed by an alleged friend.
Rebuilding the fat can be difficult, if not impossible.
The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months the state controlled media launched a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.
At one time it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything.
The most serious were the accusations of senior officials that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from the illegal oil trade in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He fought this vehemently.
But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.
Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology he wanted to hear from President Erdogan.
Russia could book some kind of victory.
For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are clear on hand.
Erdogan, in the first place, needs all the friends he can get after he has been fired almost from his office in a failed coup last month.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.
But there are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey harshly - in particular the ban on charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The figure decreased by almost 90 %.
In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be facilitated when flights are resumed.
They count on a late seasonal storm to the Mediterranean Sea.
This week the state television forecast cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.
A report in Vedemosti put it this way: “Tourists there long, tomatoes here long -
But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West because it considers its reaction to the attempted takeover of power as a weak answer.
In addition, the persistent flurry over the snail pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is driven to take advantage of the cool mood and to reduce Turkey's relationship with the West.
In Ankara, the Russian head of state certainly won a bonus for calling for support for the elected state bodies after the attempted coup.
This is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a profound fear of change in regimes.
The summit in this shiny palace on the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to present one, as an analyst once described, “Allianz from the outside”: two countries that feel betrayed and ill-treated from the west and now ally themselves.
Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently served as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents at the press conference said that they had not even covered the issue.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus as to where a common denominator to Syria can be found.
But after months of open hostilities - and given the potential for a complete disaster, when NATO member Turkey shot off the Russian combat jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state speak to each other at least again.
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available to customers outside Scotland
According to the CEO of the Bank, the RBS brand is to be reduced only to a backoffice role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan informed BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was associated with the Bank's global ambitions.
The bank has been distant since then when it had to be almost collapsed and rescued eight years ago.
At this time, brand strategists have used “RBS” to protect other end consumer financial markets.
She supported international sports with millions of pounds of sponsorship, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to focus on more national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, the decentralised headquarters and the stock market listing will change to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller brands for the private customer business that are becoming more important - Couts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and employees in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: “The RSB brand will become our investor brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed, as we are now becoming more a bank of brands,
When the bank became a global brand itself, RBS became a global brand.
I now say that we do not pursue global goals, but local goals.
Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers under these brands.
RBS has already announced that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the likelihood of the different brands in its sports sponsoring.
“It’s time for us to get to the bank of the brands, because how we focus on making this a better bank for customers,” said the CEO.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would have been a great bank for our customers and launched these brands.
But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think, you will see many changes.
We can relaunch these brands, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori achieves his 3,000th win at Newmarket on predilection
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket, which brings him 3,000th profit
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British win at Newmarket on Friday.
He put on Predilection, trained by John Gosden, on his local race track with his second win of the night a milestone.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the milestone in the flat race.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
The three-time winner Dettori, who won Ghayyar before, said, \"It's something special\"
I'm very emotional because my family is here too.
I am very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday evening with 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very humble.
Dettori captures the jubilation when he wins the victory on predilection
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who achieved more than 4,300 victories in a record breaking career.
Lester Piggott, the nine-time Derby winner, had 4,493 career victories
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of modernism and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone that only a few have reached before him.
He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intellect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for racing, his enthusiasm and charisma have been enthusiastic fans for years for this sport.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he had already recovered 6,000 winnings if he wasn't just a weekend and big tournament jockey!
Frankie has been riding winners in GB for almost 30 years, which is great.
He has a living personality, which is good for a British race, but beyond that he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the suspension sign of the British flat race for two decades.
It was nervous.
A whole series of big tournament wins, including its famous \"Glor-rich Sevens\" in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived an airplane crash and received a drug ban.
Three years ago he initially had difficulties when he returned from his six-month locket, but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to spite his twins and return to his best form.
And he's not finished for a long time - Dettori used to say that he wants to continue in competitions up to his at least 50th year of life.
Russia's Putin fires Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
The Russian president Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was part of Putin's closest trust circle for many years.
The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environmental and Transport Affairs.
In a Kremlin opinion, Putin stated that, without giving any reason, \"the dismissal of Ivanov had ordered his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration,
Anton Vaino, who has been Ivanov's deputy since 2012, was appointed as his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he graduated from the renowned Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo.
On the Kremlin's website (in Russian) it says that he was later head of the protocol and head of the government staff.
Regarding his appointment, he said to Putin: \"Thank you for your trust\"
I think that it is the government's most important task to support your activity as head of state regarding draft legislation and controls to implement your instructions.
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Do you believe the smiling faces?
This step made Moscow mysterious.
Sergei Ivanov was one of the closest confidants to Vladimir Putins for a long time and works like him for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.
As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, who was broadcasted on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigned at his own request.
But despite the smile for the cameras, few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So is this the result of some kind of power struggle?
Nobody knows that at the moment.
But the official claim - that a man who was once praised as a potential president - once wanted to lead the Russian environmental policy - came up with great skepticism.
In his comments to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said that it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 to trust me this very complicated post - you could almost say - difficult posts for four years.
As it turns out, I have been President of the Russian Presidency for four years and eight months.
Ivanov accepted the post in December 2011.
Previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB State Security Service.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov as one of five people he trusted the most.
It was once assumed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term, since a third term of office would have violated Putin's constitution.
But this post was taken by another nearby ally Putins, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister before becoming President three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds Star Thomas Gibson fired after beating producers
Gibson was involved in a physical contest last month at the set of the series in Los Angeles.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios that produce the series announced its termination in a joint opinion.
Gibson, who played the Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized publicly on Thursday before announcing his termination.
There were artistic differences and disagreements on the set.
I regret the incident, he said in a message.
Details of how the character Gibson is written out from the series followed by a team of FBI agents are expected to be published at a later date, according to the opinion of the ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old, who previously played in the Sitcom Dharma & Greg, has been in the series since the first season in 2005.
“I love Criminal Minds and have put in my whole heart blood for the past twelve years,” Gibson said in a release published on Friday.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but that will no longer be possible.
I would just like to thank the authors, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and, above all, the best fans you can wish for a series.
The planned broadcasting of the twelfth season is scheduled for 28 September.
Puzzles about fish that landed in the garden in Banff
An inhabitant of Banff called for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks that the 75 fish could be sandaled by a spring well.
Mr. Bain, who lives about 500 metres from the sea, published on Periscope a video of the spectacle hoping someone could throw some light on the appearance of the two-inch long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected with Fife
The £1.35 billion expensive project will be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the north deck of Queensferry Crossing to the viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four closures of the \"deckblower\" which approach the completion by each of the three towers of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 ropes.
The £1.35 billion cost project will be completed by May 2017.
Minister of Economic Affairs Keith Brown made a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to travel from the country to the bridge.
He said: “This is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic measure in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for the fitting.
In total, almost 79% of the entire bridge decks are in place, and the last section of the deck today receives a concrete cast for the deck in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be raised to its place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, project leader of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: “The first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project.
In this fantastic project, the closure represents forward-looking high- and low-end construction.
After the installation of the last road deck section and its connection with the north tower deck, we then had to close the remaining gap on the north or country side.
This was achieved by pulling the north-facing bridge 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.
Massive, as the viaduct is 222 meters long, about 6,000 tons weighed and had to be pulled up at a rise of about 3%.
Heikel, since the tolerances that the team was working on were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything was very good.
Rescue in Moelfre Bay: Three men have \"happy to be alive\"
Three men are happy to be alive after being thrown by their fishing boat before Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station struck at 13:20 BST on Friday after a crew observed the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had difficulty swimming safely, while their boat moved out of its own strength.
“We saw the boat turning around nearby and presented the worst,” said the leader of the rescue station of Moelfre Vince Jones.
\"Unfortunately, the strong winds have already won the boat beyond its reach until we let it go to water, \"he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found hanging on a boje without a rescue vest.
They all came on board the coast rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
Mr. Jones said: “The three men who have been thrown into the water are lucky to be alive.
The boat engine did have an emergency stop line, but it triggered itself from the person who controlled the boat when the boat was queried.
Someone's been waiting for these men today.
He's seriously hurt - he's staring at his ex-girlfriend.
A man attacked his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and seriously injured him.
As the police announced yesterday, the 50-year-old had got the key to getting his personal things.
Instead, the alcoholic perpetrator cuts the clothes of his ex-girlfriend.
When he came to the apartment, he twice stepped in on her.
The 44-year-old was injured by the hand and the body.
The police were able to arrest the perpetrator.
During the 50-year-old who destroyed his ex-girlfriend's clothes, he called his mother.
This then alarmed his sister.
Together with her companion of life, the 45-year-old wanted to calm her brother.
But she couldn't move him to leave the apartment.
That's why she left the house with her companion.
On the road they met the ex-life companion of the man.
When the two women entered the apartment again, the 50-year-old pushed his sister aside and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
Who builds Braunschweig's cheap apartments?
The SPD and Greens believe that investors will be given much more responsibility in the future.
How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years?
The SPD proposes to the next Council meeting, an action plan for housing.
But dispute is programmed.
First of all, the question is: Who should actually build the cheap apartments?
A regulation has so far been lacking.
SPD Group chairman Christoph Bratmann says: \"We agree with the greens: In future, those who want to build on urban areas must show 20 per cent of all housing as social housings,
However, the low-cost apartments can also be created in the stock.
However, the major point of dispute in the town hall is Bratmann, who says: \"How to deal with investors who want to build on private land\"
“We want investors to build at least 10 per cent on such areas, but as far as possible 20 per cent of the apartments as social housing,
A new urban housing funding programme, which will cost millions and will still need to be financed, is designed to provide incentives.
The problem, says Bratmann: \"There is no agreement between the political groups at present\"
The CDU wants to make investors as few rules as possible.
The left wants tough conditions for investors.
Despite this, says Bratmann, an increase in the situation in the housing market began.
If the concept of action is implemented, it will provide for additional tasks in the construction management.
More staff is needed.
It's unclear if we're gonna get the experts.
However, the program is still not complete: for the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.
How, though, is the loss of more than 1300 low-cost apartments whose promotion will end in the coming years?
By 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments.
In order to prevent this, as Nicole Palm's plan-making spokesman, the city should now buy out-of-bound bonds.
In addition, it would have to be thought of bringing apartments back to the price line.
This is possible in Weststadt.
The problem could be solved at a glance.
In the Weststadt, deadlines expire at the end of the year.
About 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price ceiling for cheap apartments.
Only: This is what the owners, the housing companies don't want.
Because the number of social housings in the western city is increased dramatically again, one is removed from the goal of so-called transmixture.
There should be no more concentration of social weakness in just a few parts of the city.
The Greens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion.
Group chairman Holger Herlitschke says: \"For a broad majority, the CDU must be in the boat with \"
Although they have concentrated on more construction sites for single-family homes.
But what does not mean is that a compromise cannot be found.
Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
It is fascinating to see how the world changes.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time staring at screens, has been lamented by many in the last decade.
Pokemon Go is about getting people off the sofa and getting more active.
The time on the screen was initially on the TV, then on video games and lastly limited to smartphones.
Therefore, it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not exclude each other.
Of course, I am referring to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters that were first created for the video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs).
Like many phenomena of pop culture, interest in the release of the game in the United States, Australia and New Zealand fell somewhat in early July.
Market entry in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that overloaded the servers.
Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, the players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokémons, which are tracked by a GPS and, once they have been found, can be “photographed” (over a screenshot on the mobile phone) or“ captured.
A generation who played the game, when she was even younger, joined the madman and jumped for the search from the sofa.
In the U.S., the game resulted in a significant increase in steps that set the average person back every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, recently informed the Washington Post that within two days of the game's launch, the number of persecuted people who train 30 minutes each day rose from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance.
Many public education campaigns on health, which people want to make, take 30 minutes to come, come from the sofa, and be active every day, are on deaf ears, because many public messages are boring and come from people who look miserable.
However, the importance of sports cannot be overemphasized.
Those who regularly drive sport reduce their chances of getting sick in cancer or depression.
Physical exercise helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of advantages that is too long to apply here.
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it makes people do something outdoors that makes them have fun.
Thus three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.
Some people even close new friendships on hunting.
As always, there are also Moorish players who always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could walk in front of a door.
What are you doing?
A breakthrough occurred.
Even though smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to drive sports as this game does.
The new will lose its appeal and the use will be abandoned over time.
However, due to Pokemon's success, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with becoming active in the real world, helping many people hunt for more active, fitter and healthier.

Simone Biles creates gold in the women's tournament
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
Dynamic on the jump horse.
Easy on the bar.
Breathing on the ground.
On the whole line brilliant.
And now, finally, we're the Olympics.
On Thursday, the 19-year-old American tournament climbed into the multi-stakeholder title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.
Their overall result of 62,198 was clearly before the silver medal winner and final five team comrade Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Alyya Mustafina.
The American women Simone Biles competes on the Schwebebar during the women's single competition final in the art tournament at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a multi-stakeholder title and a total of the fifth, while she strengthens her reputation of being the best of her generation or even at all.
She broke out in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment came to an end.
This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:
Biles has dominated her sport for the past three years, winning 15 world champion medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton said she is “the best tournament I've ever seen”
She was expecting a final test in Brazil, a competition that did not go so far between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of over-dimensioned expectations.
Not returning with a handful of gold to the family in Spring, Texas, would be considered disappointment.
The American women Simone Biles, on the left, and Aly Raisman hugged themselves after they won gold and silver in the women's single multi-competition finals at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday,
Bile's first medal was held on Tuesday, while she served as a call sign at the farewell ceremony of retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles insisted on never having planned the future during her long journey to the top, this is not really true.
Part of their ground exercises - which include their typical Tumbling Pass - are adapted to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympia arena in Rio.
That's no coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a school trip to the gym where Boorman trained, became a force.
Since the summer of 2013, she has no longer lost a multi-competition competition, a winning series that will last as long as Biles wishes.
Although Mustafina was easily guided by two spins, the picture was sad.
Sweeping bars and ground turns - in which Biles holds the World Champion's Title - laundered.
She picked up again with 15,433 on the Schwebebar - and put one on it with a 15,933 on the ground.
Raisman hugged her gently as they expected her final ergency - a pure formality - and tears flowed on beads shiny red, white and blue eyeliners, when the vision she once described in her collection book became reality.
The Raisman performance was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafina in a teabrake.
This time the 22-year-old team captain, called by the Americans \"Oma\", had a lead.
After her ground exercise, she threw kissing hands at the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes appeared doubtful.
As far as Biles is concerned, the fast spreading tweet of the 19-year-olds from the beginning of this week has a completely new meaning:
Police: 3 victims shot in serial murder while listening to music in the car
According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl who had been killed in one of the most deadly attacks for a decade in the first series murder of Phoenix were shot while they were in the car and heard music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on June 12, while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said.
The perpetrator fired eight shots from a handgun while he was standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle, is read in the report.
The police reported that the triple murder did not seem to have been the result of a robbery, since the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900 that were owned by one of the adult victims.
The police spokesman of Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that shooting led the investigators to become a closer look at whether they were involved in four previous attacks.
A total of seven people were killed in Hispanic residential areas within four months in nine attacks and two more injured.
“It happens in a residential area in front of a house,” said Howard of KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, beginning of the month.
It is assumed that the suspect used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to reveal the evidence they had led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same murderer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized and later died due to her injuries.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah died on site.
A witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and from which it is assumed that it was the work of the serial killer.
The investigators found cartridge holes and secured a ball from the seat as well as bullet fragments from the engine room.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly: \"It's getting better\"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But like the few of his peers, Edmund Microcephaly, the result of a genetic disorder, did not know anything about his mother Elizabeth Picciuto during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was, I can't do that.
I can't do that.
I didn't get involved in that.
What's not right at all -- of course, you've been led to it, she said.
Her husband, Vincent, and her, was told that Edmund will never be able to recognize her, and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far that they suggested institutionalizing him.
“My first answer to this was ‘I didn’t know people are still doing,’” Picciuto explained.
Edmund can run with the help of a walker.
Edmund could neither sit nor scratch until his third year of life and he still cannot speak.
But he's making progress.
He can run and cycle with support.
He also loves playing and singing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund has designed for \"Please sing something before\"
“We teach him sign language,” said Picciuto CBS News.
But it's not a typical sign language -- she says. Edmund invented some signs alone.
Microcephaly has a variety of causes: genetics such as Edmund and viral infections such as measles or cycavirus during pregnancy.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary greatly.
It is too early to say how it will affect the life of the zicavirus infected.
Picciuto recalls the emotional price of an uncertain future.
I constantly asked what's going to happen?
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't really know it.
I haven't asked about the forecast for a long time because I don't expect someone to tell me.
But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the zikavirus.
It's getting better.
You know it's gonna be better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rainfall, flooding gives cause for rescues in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rains and large-scale floods in Louisiana forced the governor to call out the emergency on Friday. More rainfall is expected throughout Saturday.
Numerous rivers in south-eastern Louisiana and the south of Mississippi flooded their banks and threatened with large-scale flooding after extreme rainfall, reported the National Weather Service.
The Governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards announced that state officials were in constant contact with local authorities and that aid to the affected communities was already on the move.
Mike Steele, a spokesperson for the Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness of the Governor, announced that the requests for flood vehicles, boats and sand bags were increasing.
Steele said that the municipality of Tangipahoa alone had requested ten thousand sand bags.
A flood warning system is used over a wide range of parts in southern Louisiana until Saturday.
The weather service indicated that there could be additional 3 to 5 inches of rain in this area.
In the south of Alabama, a flood warning system was used on Friday, while it continued to rain in the area of Mobile.
The Comite River near Baton Rouges and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both located in Louisiana, are likely to reach record levels over the weekend.
Metereologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a downstream flooding in Ascension Parish is a danger, as these rivers will only slowly flow through the closed rivers into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level on Friday at 09.00, which has ever been recorded.
Rescue teams still used people from the floodwaters in the Amite and Wilkinson districts in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and son-in-law were among those who were saved on Friday near Gloster.
Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, usually more than 400 feet away from his house, rose greatly overnight.
He said he would have warned another stepson living nearby.
“We woke up and the water flowed and flowed in,” said Hansford.
It reached my waist.
His wife, Hansford, said that in the 48 years she lived there, she had never seen such a high level of the river.
Hansford said that he and his family members had all the disabilities and he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said that emergency workers had saved all three in a large military truck and had brought them to the next fire station in Gloster, where they were accommodated until Friday.
Krautmann said that the flood had spread rapidly, as there were still severe rainfalls and that the authorities were considering evacuation instructions.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livingstone reported from midnight to Friday morning from 13.75 inches of rain.
Krautmann said that since Wednesday the rains had caused considerable damage to the ground.
The authorities indicated that heavy rainfall and flooding caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and school failure in five school districts.
The CBS subsidiary WWL reported that an associate in Tangipahoa indicated 200 flooded houses.
The inhabitants were evacuated into two churches, both of which were now flooded.
The head of the municipality of Robby Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets washed by the floodwaters.
Emergency accommodation was established in the cities of Amite and Hammond to accommodate the evacuated.
“As soon as the water begins to return, they will be able to return to their homes,” he said.
In the city of Hammond of the municipality of Tangipahoa nearly two dozen roads were closed due to the flood and sand bags were provided for the residents to take with them, who hope to keep the water out of their homes and shops.
“The last major flood we had was in March,” said Lacy Landrum of the City Administration.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississippi, the emergency manager Rupert Lacy of Harrison County said it was still raining on the Gulf Coast.
According to his information, a handful of houses on Thursday should have been reported to be flooded, but no reports have been made on Friday.
Keith Townson, manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
“I’ve seen water in places where I’ve never seen it before,” said Townson, “and it’s still coming.”
Mahaj Brown, 6, \"crushed by bullets\" survives shooting in Philadelphia
The police report that the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week already the second time that a 6-year-old child is shot.
The boy's grandparents identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents indicated that Brown suffered several gunshot injuries, including in the lungs, legs, arms and abdomen, but that he was aware of his transport to the hospital.
“He’s been through a lot, his little body was perplexed by bullets,” his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the transmitter.
I just can't believe that.
The boy's condition was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations.
The boy's family informed the transmitter that he was expected to recover.
He should have started the first class in a local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people who were shot in Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two at the age of 29 and a 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims, according to CBS Philadelphia, are in stable condition.
The boy was shot at the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old who is in critical condition, reports the transmitter.
The other two victims were not in the car and the police were just determining whether one of the injured men could be in the perpetrators.
Investigators informed CBS Philadelphia that there was apparently a crossfire between several shooters.
Patron housings for storm rifles traced back to various storm rifles overlooked the crime scene.
It seems that this has clearly been an ongoing struggle.
On the road, on both sides of the road, there were hills.
For example, there seems to have been several armed fighters who were very active, - police officer Anthony Ginaldi told the police in Philadelphia.
Several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area.
There was no arrests and the police are currently checking reports according to the surveillance video.
On Tuesday another 6-year-old girl was hit by a cross-breather on the arm when she played in front of her house in the West Oak Lane residential area.
She's recovering and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's what I imagine under the women's olympia team in the tournament and that for more than one reason.
First of all, I have been in every summer olympia since 1984, and the USA has never been so dominant.
And secondly, this team has three tournaments, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren-Laurie-Hernandez, who were inspiring to many young girls of other skin colors.
The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, who is a Jew, and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, rounds off, makes everyone proud.
This team finally reflects the US.
It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.
In the last four years, the number one among the female gymnasts has been an African American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.
This shows strength.
During the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America was cheered.
Now, the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they expected, but provided masterful Gymastic routines.
On Thursday Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American who won at an individual multi-stakeholder event for women gold.
Team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We experience the top of this sport, but this is not how turnclasses look all over the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison in order to get it into the Olympic team.
They are the “Last Five” because the next Olympic team will have only four tournaments in the team. Furthermore, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as coach.
But the reality is that tournaments are an expensive sport and tournaments are primarily held in private tournaments, which are held by parents who come up for training, furnishings, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their tournaments and families).
The majority of these tournaments are located in prosperous suburbs that can support the business.
In these clubs the Turners receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started the tournament.
We need to give the communities countless young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a more easy-to-read and easy-to-access turntrain.
I founded my turnstiftung of 20 years.
At my events we offered free and affordable tournaments in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youths (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.
In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth high quality tournaments that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Turnen develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.
It's the inspiration of this team that makes thousands of young girls get interested in the tournament and that's great.
It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.
That's such an exciting time.
Thanks to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of \"Girl Power\" by holding the Olympic team gold and thanking her, so many young girls with different backgrounds find it motivating to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
Assistants want to organize further strikes after they have rejected Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the British Medical Association officials, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistants who voted in an election rejected him.
In July Hunt had revealed plans to introduce the contract and said that the NHS was in a non-mandatory country, and any further delay would be harmful to the employees and patients.
The first assistants are expected to receive a new contract that contains changes to night and weekend work to improve care at unguestly hours.
Dr Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the BMA Committee of Assistants last night, announced: “Assistants still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will raise the current staff crisis and refrain from treating all doctors justly,
With only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new treaty, progress needs to be made and time is running out.
Efforts by the BMA to resolve the disputes by talks led the government to take a stand against the will to participate and sometimes on ear-doubt silence.
This was the case of a promise made by Jeremy Hunt last month that his door would always be open.
“Jeremy Hunt must act now, raise the force and address the concerns of assistant doctors,
If he does not, the assistants have made it clear that they are willing to carry out further work-fighting measures.
The last strike at the end of April saw an upturn of almost 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments, since nurses and specialists were involved in providing coverage to doctors on the strike post chain.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting the reformed Treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants a better weekly pay for the 54,000 assistants who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Director General of the NHS staff, called on assistant doctors to end the strike.
Mortimer said: \"Work campaign measures do not achieve anything of the little, but already burdened teams and service providers and only provide the patients, caregivers and their families with worries, distress and interruption,
In the last two months, we have spoken to the Committee of Assistants and have responded positively to the health ministry as well as to other ministries' concerns about the boarding and whistleblowing.
Employers hoped that the continued positive engagement on other important issues - such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from a professional break-up, training costs, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training leave and gender pay gap in medicine - was a sign of how serious it was for employers, the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health to respect the agreements with BMA in November, February and May.
The £2 per day medication that can reduce heart attack risk
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £2 per day medication after the authorities have been advised to administer this more people for a longer period of time.
Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attack for people with heart disease.
The drug has been administered for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of stroke or further heart attack.
The NICE regulatory authority of the NHS has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
The NICE regulatory authority of the NHS has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attack and stroke are caused by accumulations of fatty material in the arteries walls that form layers.
When the coating breaks apart, it can cause a blood clot that clogs the blood flow to the heart, causing a heart attack.
If the blood clot dissolves, it can flow through the bloodstream and block the flow of blood to the brain, causing a stroke.
Those who have already had a heart attack are at a higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by the UK company AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more unlikely.
The draft guidance of NICE, published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg Ticagrelor followed by 60mg with a double daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre said: “Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack, a further heart attack or a stroke - often with disastrous consequences - have had another heart attack.
The fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on a person's quality of life.
Experience shows that in combination with aspirin, Ticagrelor is effective in reducing further heart attack and stroke in people who have already had a heart attack.
Through a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
The information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years.
Culture of Political Correctness makes electoral fraud flourish in Muslim areas
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed last year on the occasion of a government report on corruption from office
A culture of political correctness has led to widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities knowingly ignored as a destructive government report revealed today.
Former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks the police, election observers and councillors to have ignored evidence of electoral abuse due to \"oversensitivity to ethnicity and religion\".
The former Minister for Integration and Municipal Government, who is now an anti-corruption king, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that it should be allowed by the police to set up lock-off bands outside of electoral booths to protect intimidated voters.
He recommends that voters take a card with them in order to prove their identity in elections.
At present, a voter only has to call his name and address.
The report proposes to apply non-removable ink to a person's fingers when they give up their vote to prevent someone from choosing twice.
Whistleblowers should be given more protection, says Sir Eric.
He called for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions from non-official committees or working groups.
“This not only serves against electoral fraud but also aims to protect the municipal government from the wider corruption and financial fraud culture that goes along with it,” he said.
The report was arranged by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlet electoral scandals in East London.
Last year, a special electoral court decided that the deputy mayor Lutfur Rahman should be removed from his office after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.
The court held that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community “in a cynical way” and that he had silenced his critics with Rassismus and Islamophobia accusations.
Rahman should have \"run his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him\"
Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the result of a imitation in which one person chooses as another.
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud throughout the country.
He was particularly alarming about the fraudulent choice of letters - in which older members of the Muslim community had pressured people to choose a candidate for their election.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system, including leading evidence to prove identity
His report states: “As evidence has been given that pressure has been exerted on vulnerable members of certain ethnic minorities, in particular women and young people, to choose according to the will of the elders, in particular communities with Pakistani or fear-laden backgrounds.
“There were concerns that... state institutions would have knowingly ignored such behavior due to “politically correct” hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion,
Sir Eric spoke out 50 recommendations to clean the system, including the prohibition that political activists are editing letter-election documents to stop “Walking Parties”.
The report, which is considered by Theresa May, also requires tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral list from being used for immigration and social fraud purposes.
Consider options to ask voters for your ID before choosing.
Use non-removable ink on a person's finger as soon as she has given her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice.
Perform systematic checks on a person's nationality to ensure that they are eligible for election.
A three-year limitation on applications for an automatic letter selection.
Prohibited political activists from editing full letter elections and envelopes of letter elections.
The police have the power to set up barriers to electoral stations.
A legislative amendment that facilitates an indictment charge under the Representation of the People Act 1983 (Volksverreteigungsgesetz 1983).
Photographic prohibition in electoral stations.
Requirement that only English may be used in the electoral stations (except Wales).
Intensification of training to ensure that employees enforce the rule that voters go to the ballot booth alone.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it \"excellent\" that no criminal notice was issued after the Tower Hamlet's case.
\"The Electoral Court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy to be unfair because of a litany of corrupt and illegal practices,\" he said.
For a number of reasons, he has been known to be guilty of being sufficient, in accordance with the high requirements in criminal proceedings.
He also criticises the non-effective-checks of the electoral registration departments of the council halls.
Sir Eric said: “The court judgment in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.
As the mother of parliaments, our country bears a proud legacy, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and the denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation.
Intrigued by Kates Radler-Doppelganger and other famous doublers of Olympic athletes in Rio
Fans of the Olympics 2016 in Rio have this week come across the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot besides Rand and Band, who has proved to be an impressive doubleman of the Duke of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympics this summer is by far not the only athlete to fight gold, who shows his own famous double-goers - at least not if one can give faith to social media.
In honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that are currently flashing on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of Olympics that show more than just a certain similarity to Hollywood celebrities.
The hunter and the wolf: team member of the U.S. team in archery Brady Ellison, on the left, has been compared since his childhood with Leonardo DiCaprio
In addition to Kate's double rider on the bike track, many people on the Internet point out how a certain archer of the twin of A-Promi Leonardo DiCaprio might be.
The team member of the U.S. team in archery Brady Ellison has caused an attack on Twitter, after images on which he looks mysteriously similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star appeared.
In fact, the archer got mad at the social media and admitted that since childhood he has been getting to hear that he looks like Leo.
“I don’t see much similarity myself, with the exception of facial hair,” Brady told the Huffington Post.
\"He's a good-looking guy, so I guess I'm going to take this as a compliment \"
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly become even more important this year: the striking similarity between the British wide-springer Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian tournament Aliya Mustafina with her large, expressive eyes is supposed to be a double-legged singer for the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the swimming pool, the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to the Glee Star Matthew Morrison for years.
One step higher: This user believes that Nathan is the “athletic version” of the Inception actor
Another persistent comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who has similar heavy eyebrows and lips.
The Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimova shows more than just the sun-burned skin and blond hair like the actress Annalynne McCord, while the American Nathan Adrian was attested by fans to be a \"athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt.
Strong women: football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar facial shape and eyes
Not the only one: A Twitter user was very happy that others noticed the similarities as well
Theory put into space: According to this user there may be a reason for the similarity of the couple
A Twitter user expressed her satisfaction that “the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical“
In fact, the US football star Hope Solo and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney and the gold medal winner in the Gabby Douglas tournament, which shows her own beautiful, broad smile similar to that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.
CBC commentator for the Olympic Games apologizes for his statement that Chinese swimmer - like a pig died -
Byron MacDonald's analysis of the fourth place of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at dr 4x200m freestyle swimming staff outraged spectators of the CBC live transmission of the Olympic Games on Wednesday
The Canadian broadcaster CBC had to apologize after one of his commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer, like Mief, went off and died like a pig during the race,
The commentator Byron MacDonalds thought that his microphone was turned off when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m freestyle swimming staff.
MacDonald, who had been brought on board the CBS's commentor team to give more color, could be heard saying: \"This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby,
Too excited, went off like mief, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
The Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swim the second stage of the swimming staff 1:57,79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, which allowed Canadians to unlock the gap with China.
Visitors across Canada responded quickly online after being shocked by the tone and language
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, \"Did the CBC commentator just say that the 14-year-old swimmer from China \"was like a pig died?\"??
The idiot didn't get that they were still on mission,
Ai Yanhan from China was described at the final 4 x 200m women's freestyle swimming staff: \"This little 14-year-old Chinese woman lost the connection, baby \"
The criticism against Byron MacDonald on Twitter came quickly and hard, in which many spoke to him
Twitter users did not hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: “Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and let us all look like racists.
Shortly later, Scott Russel, who moderated the CBC broadcast, apologized live for MacDonald's comment and said: \"We apologize that the comment about a swimming performance was broadcast,
It was an unfortunately chosen formulation, we are sorry that it happened,
At the end CBC apologized more than 90 times to the people who responded to the remark about Twitter
The commentators colleague Scott Russel had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald
CBC copied and added his apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments
The network also apologized quickly and issued a communication.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that they were allowed to be broadcast.
Last night we quickly apologized to our viewers on broadcast and to our followers in the social media.
To clarify one, Byron's comments relate to the performance of the swimmer and not to them as a person.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and a very difficult-chosen formulation. Byron is very sorry about what he said.
On Thursday afternoon MacDonald apologized in the broadcast and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention to interpret it as a personal attack.
“I would like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made after the women’s swimming staff at the CBC Olympics,” he said.
“I have been referring to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person,”
Of course, no disregard was intended and I am very sorry.
Buyers in Primark are outraged over women who try shameless underwear in the middle of the shop
The buyers did not know where to look when a woman would wear her clothes in the middle of a primark to try underwear.
To worsen the situation, she patterned it as she looked, pulled it out, and put it back into the shelf.
She pushed on and tried four pairs of underwear in a shop in the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone.
The Primark shop in the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone, where the woman tried the underwears before putting them back into the shelf
A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in business at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman had tried the underwear, she went back to the store and left without buying anything,
“ People couldn’t believe what they saw, ” she said.
Standing at the heart of the sale area, she took a pair of underwear from the exhibition, pulled out her own tights and pants and tried them out.
“She didn’t even try to find a more discrete place to do it - she just stood there, kind of like Oskar,
“Everyone stared at her as she pulled out the underwear that obviously did not like her, as she put her back into the shelf,
She repeated the same with three other underwears before she finally decided that she didn't like anything, went back on and went out.
“They didn’t seem to bother thinking of someone watching or thinking about the person who might buy the underwear she had tried, ” she said.
Ms. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said: “How disgusting to think that someone would take underwear home that another person had and that was not washed,
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: “As I have come along, employees have tried to pull the clothes out of the sale after they went - which is just as good -
“I would hate to go home with a new pair of underwears and find out that another woman was wearing them and pulled them out again and they weren’t washed,”
A spokesman from Primark said: “Primark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday, August 9, at our Folkstone branch, on Tuesday, August 9, “
All products in question were withdrawn from the sale.
How to Protect With Krav Maga From Weapons Attacks
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at a distance.
Regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or the back, this video will show you how to turn the spear for your robber.
If you are approached from behind, then you should turn around as first, so that you can see your attacker and get out of the shooting line, Mizrachi says.
Then grab the weapon between your forearm and your shoulder before hitting it with your free elbow face.
Then hit him with the knee into the ledge and twist as the attacker bends in front of pain, the weapon from his hands. Hit him with the run into the face and move backward while they direct the weapon to him.
In the case of attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the shooting line, take the weapon and twist it so that the attacker cannot shoot.
At the same time, publish the weight on the weapon and hit the attacker on the chest, then twist the weapon out of his handle before moving backward and directing the weapon on it.
Does it sound difficult?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi pretends.
But remember that in a robbery it is safest to hand over your money - unless you are a Krav Maga Grandmaster.
Traveler Ian Wright creates his tongue in the most dirty places in Europe for a guide
A British traveler subjected his immune system to a serious test by licking out some of the most dirty and disgusting places in Europe.
The moderator and travel agent Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk put his trains on a euro-shoe, a member of the Piccadilly Circus, a sink on a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to demonstrate the resilience of his immune system.
Before leaking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he will let himself in.
But the experiment, filmed under the title “The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strictness,” brought some surprising results to light.
The idea of licking the sink of a train toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.
On his journey through Europe, Mr Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he seemed to leave behind left more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.
Mr Wright became known for testing the resistance of his intestine by traveling through the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
From public geese to railway stations to toilet sinks, the task of his immune system was definitely under a sample
In the film he said: “Prepared as a child, I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all possible things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water,
In the film, he definitely got his call straight.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
Its sample section showed a luminometer number of over 4000 units.
In comparison, the luminometer number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to detach, after her luminometer number was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands were one of less than 60
Mr Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film \"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strict\" which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom
In the film he says: “This is the worst thing I have ever smoked in a toilet, ”
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not going to attract anything here because it's disgusting in here.
The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strictness was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Valio.
The company is running Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.
Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: “We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.
We carried out crazy brainstormings that ended by saying \"Let's call me Ian\"
They claim that the interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: “Let me say it so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had leaked some of the things I had instructed him to lick, just like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film,
Of course, there were things that made it easier for Ian to attract them and others, where this was quite difficult.
I'm glad we recorded some of these dirty delicacies on film,
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of all surveyed lactic acid bacteria associated with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said that they use at least occasional products containing attached lactic acid bacteria.
Asocial family destroyed before demologing Social apartment in Saltash, Cornwall
An asocial family left their social home after a delogon with a damage of £50,000 because they had terrorized their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown out of their property in Saltash, Cornwall after a long list of complaints.
After they were violently removed from their property, shocked employees of the House Society found property in an irreparable state.
The walls showed clapping holes, wooden parts were torn up, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was smashed on the walls.
The family was relocated and it is assumed that she now lives in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works for the home management at Cornwall Housing, said she feared that the apartment would no longer be repaired.
She said: “It was an absolute nightmare for the people here, and I think people don’t have to live that way.
There are many things to consider, as this property is likely to be regarded as not so beautiful part of Cornwall.
The family is notorious and their reputation is likewise.
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inflicted included street fights with baseball players, instigators of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screaming, disputes and curses.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease contract, received an order for antisocial behaviour in June.
Old garbage has been found in some rooms of the house that may be destroyed
The property in which drugs have been used in the past has been torn down the wooden parts
Neighbors said that they saw them fighting on the street and had to be called on the police regularly
Cornwall Housing, she and her partner, this week violently deloged from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily withdraw.
Delogs were cheered by relieved neighbors who said that their lives were made to hell.
One of them said, “They screwed around no one, ”
We lived alongside them for 20 years and it was always bad.
The countless times we tell the police here are incredible.
\"Today tomorrow we couldn't sleep,
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it!
Now, where they're finally gone, it'll be nice.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that the family would have to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house to which the police were called at regular intervals, for 20 years
Waste and old toys were dropped on the covered side of the town hall
He added: “It’s a shame that the tenant was reluctant to assume any responsibility for her behavior and that of her family, as a delogger is always the last step to consider Cornwall Housing.
This was a very difficult case, as the behavior was extreme and their actions for their neighbors had to be horrendous with them.
I appreciate all the work that my team, Devon's police, and Cornwall's members and members of the community who have courageously gone to us and let us know.
I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbors and convey the message that antisocial behavior is not tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.
A dirty mattress left on the ground in one of the bedrooms of the house after the demologation
Workers of the household administration will now have to clean waste mountains that surround the house
In 2014, the police carried out a raid in the house and found over 70g cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and cash worth £1,700.
Skeldon received a fine after she had confessed to the possession of a class B drug in trade intention.
She claimed that the money was for a gravestone of her son Lee Skeldon, who was killed in a car accident in 2013.
After being without a child, Tanya and her partner are assumed to now live in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many of the house's rooms were decorated with graffiti.
The police say they're going to delog tenants who don't stick to the house order.
Angela Crow of Devon's police and Cornwall informed us that the delogoning was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not comply with the house order.
“This is the case with those who think that they can behave without self-prejudice and those who have been harmed by such behavior,” she said.
Devon and Cornwall's police will never tolerate criminal and antisocial behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal panicked after flying a military jet beach
Sun worshipers in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
A Portuguese P-3C Orion aircraft of the Air Force put down an incredible crash flight
The air forces indicated that it was on a training flight but insisted that there was no safety risk
This was the moment when scared tourists start to panic after a deep-flying jet descends over a full beach.
Dramatic video shows showed how the military aircraft flew almost in tangible proximity over the sun beds on the beach section in Aveiro in northern Portugal.
Holidays sprang up when they understandably began to worry about the noise of the nozzle engines, without first seeing what was coming on them through the clouds.
The incident took place yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many holidaymakers who posted videos on the dramatic Fly-By in social media, said: “It really flew away twice and there was a moment when it looked as if it were crashing,
Nuno Arroja added: “I was just surfing and it felt like the plane was falling on me,
Tourists at the beach of Aveiro were panicked when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep
The Portuguese air forces today indicated that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to fly so deep that this was the only way to recognize them.
The speaker said that because of the poor vision conditions, the jet flew slightly deeper than usual through nearby ground fires, but the air forces insisted that safety was not at any time at all at risk.
Area fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer, where four people also died on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese air forces today indicated that the pilot had to fly so deep due to the conditions - strong fog and fire smoke - that limited his vision
The aircraft was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
Supercup: Barca with worries against Seville
Seville - FC Barcelona is fighting the first step towards winning the first title in the new football season on Sunday.
The Catalans attack the Spanish supercup out against the FC Seville in the duel, the replay rises three days later in Camp Nou.
The Double Winner must, in the Force Fair, with the inferior Cup finalist and ruling Europe-League Champion, among other things, give up on Neymar, who fights the Olympic football tournament with Brazil.
Goalie Marc-Andre is also missing.
In training, the German suffered a tapesty in the knee, which explains the question at Barca at least for the first time in favor of Claudio Bravo.
The Chilean International and Ter Stegen have been competing in Barcelona for two years for the status as number one.
Coach Luis Enrique so far refused a clear decision and left Bravo in the league, but Ter Stegen took the lead in most other applications.
Before the first game of duty of the new season, there is doubt at the Spanish master about the fitness condition of the team, which on Saturday was humiliated in a test game of Liverpool with 0:4.
Even at 3:2 at the Probegalopp against Sampdoria on Wednesday, Lionel Messi and Co. still did not know how to convince.
Seville, on the other hand, has the 2:3 defeat after extension in the European Supercup against Real Madrid and aims at the second triumph at the \"Supercopa de Espana\".
Barcelona is in this competition with up to eleven successes of record winners.
Ma Long in her own league to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic.
On Thursday in Rio de Janeiro, the 27-year-old defeated his countryman and title defender, Zhang Jike 4:0 (12,5,4,4) in a one-sided final.
The first of the world rankings, with success at World Cup, World Tour final tournaments and Olympia, won the \"Golden Grand Slam\".
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani.
The two Chinese made it as expected in the final game and made up the title among each other.
So it was clear that for the third time in a row, a Chinese would get the single title in the mark of the five rings.
The last non-Chinese in the top Olympics was the former SVS-NÖ-Legionary Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left on the record alone, between the sentences and on time-outs they had no coaches with them.
They had retreated to the tribune and let their shooters go to each other alone in fair competition.
\"The matches so far I played for my country,
“I’m playing for myself in the finale,” Zhang said.
After the party, gold and silver medal winners posted with the China flag.
The match itself was unexpected one-sided.
Ma had only really to fight with his 28-year-old opponent in the first sentence.
After that he determined the pace on the plate and dropped Zhang there only a total of 13 points.
Due to Ma's superiority, the expected co-triggering match did not develop.
Nevertheless, there was a lot of breathtaking ball change to see.
Mizutani won the game for bronze against the 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov 4:1.
In his quarter finals against the German European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov, the White Ruse had caused a rib injury, after which he was in medical treatment, had to enjoy sheeting.
The Sweden Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and Jürgen Persson (42/2008) had also become Olympics in similar high table tennis age.
Donald Trump mentions \"violent problems\" in the election campaign
The leadership of the U.S. Republicans is plagued by massive concerns, even in traditional conservative states, about their majority.
President Donald Trump now admitted weaknesses of his election campaign in the former Republican Hochburg Utah.
A rare moment in which the usually large-scale and self-sustaining multimillionaire expressed such concerns as correspondents reported.
After throwing 16 rivals out of the race within his own Republican camp, the doubts about his success in the fight for the White House are growing.
“We have huge problems in Utah,” Trump said to evangelical Christians, who he asked for support in important states such as Ohio, Florida or Virginia.
Blame was false reports about his candidacy, and he recaptured his well-known media shell.
Republican Hochburgen Wakkeln
Utah is usually a safe bank for Republicans.
According to a survey by SurveyUSA from June, Trump and his competitor of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, were similar.
Other institutions do see Trump in front, but not with the distance that is common for Republican candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are also considered at risk.
In an interview of the channel CNBC, Trump answered the question of how to stop Clinton’s advance: “Just as I have done so far,
And soon afterwards: this will be \"either successful, or I will make a very beautiful, long vacation\"
He did nothing but \"tell the truth\"
If it was not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness, it would be fine, Trump continued.
Then I return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, the Trump Party should have threatened to delete funds to support its electoral struggle, should it not be able to present better poll values.
Instead, the Republicans' candidates for the Congress are more likely to be under their control.
Olympia: Dreist fraud in doping test
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary commission on the case.
Kenya's athletics threaten the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro after the second doping affair.
After a fraud attempt at a doping check in the Olympic village, Kenya sent a coach home.
The International Olympic Committee announced the immediate establishment of a disciplinary commission to investigate the case.
A Kenyan official had announced that the former Sprinter and present-day Coach, John Anzrah, had given a urine test under the name of the 800-metre runner Ferguson Rotich in the Olympic village.
This was reported to Kenya's team leader by the Doping controllers.
The IAAF World Association has asked the IOC for information on the case to try out their own investigations, an IAAF spokesperson.
‘Depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent actions of the IOC, IAAF will carry out an assessment, it was mentioned in an IAAF statement.
“He (Anzrah) went to the Doping Control Station and turned out to be Ferguson Rotich, who gave the test and signed it,” said Kenya’s Chief of Mission Stephan Arab Soi.
He was in possession of the athlete's accreditation, which was on the list for the training controls of the world anti-doping agency.
Ferguson Rotich had become over 800 metres in Beijing World Cup fourth in 2015.
Four days earlier, the Kenyan athletics delegation chief Michael Rotich had been withdrawn from the Rio Games.
He is to have informed athletes of upcoming doping tests against money payments from his country.
According to media reports, he was to have been arrested on his return to Nairobi Airport.
Kenya has for a long time been under special observation at the IOC following numerous doping procedures.
In announcing the more than 2000 doping target checks imposed by the IOC before the Rio Games, it was noted that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia are being taken into the visor.
The World Anti-Doping Agency had exerted a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil, creating an anti-Doping law and a functioning control system.
The law was passed a few weeks before Olympics began.
As a result, WADA took Kenya from the list of countries whose doping combat is in line with the rules of WADA.
Kenya is considered a major runner-nation.
The country's athletic athletes won the most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.
A number of television reports by the ARD have repeatedly raised allegations that there is easy access in Kenya's Doping Centre and that there should be a significant mentality of sports fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound recently requested a similar investigation in Kenya as he had employed them in Russian athletics.
It could be demonstrated that this type of sport has been extensively and systematically submerged.
Russia's athletics were then excluded from the summer games.
Salzburger - West Side Story - with Cecilia Bartoli
In Shakespeare's year, the Salzburg Festival presents the \"West Side Story\" with Tony and Maria as a tragic love couple, similar to Romeo and Julia.
With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical conquers Salzburg: the \"West Side Story\" of Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.
The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical to the temple of the classics and filled himself with the role of Mary a youth dream.
In the orchestra, the Simón Bolívar orchestra under the direction of Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel says: “This music is full of rhythm, and he is soaring.
We always say that it is very Latin American.
There are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and melody.
It is a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I would say that we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!
In this setting Bartoli plays an older Mary.
She reminds herself of her love with Tony, while the younger Mary plays and dances.
The role of Mary has always fascinated me.
First of all because it is musically exceptional!
And then there would be Mary's personality.
She says it in her song: “I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright -
It is therefore smart, of course also naive, and very passionate.
“She very much resembles me, my Italian character I have as a Roman,” she laughs.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: \"Cecilia is a wonderful artist\"
It's such an honor to work with her.
She's an enormously generous person.
And Bartoli returns the compliment: \"Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate,
Conducting is a necessity for him.
You see it in every one of his movements, in his eyes, it's his life!
It is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a more southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a happy approach to life, which is very important at all!
For American director Philip Wm. McKinley, the \"West Side Story\" is highly up-to-date: \"This piece deals with prejudices and fanaticism\"
Today we have the refugees, then the Puerto Ricans went to New York, and the New York residents didn't want them.
They are the same issues, and they are as meaningful today as they were then.
59 years later the piece is still relevant.
London Schoolgirl who joined IS was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls, left London last year to join the IS, according to reports in Syria.
The lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said that her family had died in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago.
It was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air raid in Raqqa, the group's boltwork in the country, reported ITV News on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and died shortly after she had planned to leave the war - torn country and return to England.
“One can only hope that the only good is in it - as a reminder and a warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to stop people from ever making this decision,” said Akunjee.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from the east of London entered a plane towards Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was informed that she had married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months.
Reid says Clinton will remain as candidates for the Supreme Court in the event of a victory at Garland
Harry Reid, leader of the Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
The Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garlands confirmation since Barack Obama's nomination in March.
The majority leader in the Senate Mitch McConnell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the deceased judge to the Supreme Court Antonin Scalia.
On Thursday, during a telephone conference, Reid said he expected to choose Garland, with a certain degree of certainty, from Clinton.
A spokesperson from Reid later said that he had not yet spoken to Clinton whether she would nominate Garland and he speculated.
He praised Garland and said Clinton's team wouldn't worry about having a new candidate.
Garland is the top judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Raid said Republicans blocked the Garlands nomination, being Lakaien and helpers of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also found that Donald Trump was inappropriate for the presidential office.
Treats wants nude calendar for women and men
The Treats Magazine cooperates with photographer David Bellemere to bring out a 1970s Pirelli-inspired Calendar for 2017.
But instead of the famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their NU Muses Calendar for 2017.
The editor-in-chief of Treats Steve Shaw told us at the beginning of this year that his naked magazine was different from Oldschool playboys, since \"Playboy is for men\"
I'll do this for women.
Apparently he believes that it does the Calendar as well.
“We have to return to the representation of timeless and classical nudity, in which both women and men feel comfortable and are inspired by these images of a female body,” said Shaw in a press release on the publication of the Calendar.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit their images online or personally at open casting calls in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish municipality reckons with mass flight
“He who does not adapt and praise Erdogan, sits on packed suitcases,” says the chairman of the Gülen-nah Foundation Dialogue and World, Ercan Karakoyun.
In the short term, the Kurdish municipality of Germany expects tens of thousands of people seeking protection to flee from Turkey to Germany.
In the medium term, it could even become \"some hundred thousand\", believes the president of the Association Ali Toprak.
Due to the hard action of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt, the Kurdish municipality of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany.
\"In the short term, I expect tens of thousands, in the medium term with a few hundred thousand people seeking protection from Turkey in Germany, when the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition - says the president of the Association Ali Toprak of the World - on Friday.
Because the government had already overlaid Kurdish Hochburgs with criminal actions months ago, 500,000 Kurds within Turkey were on the run.
After the failed coup, secular and oppositional ethnic Turks came.
Many will want to start again in Europe if they continue to be oppressed in Turkey.
“It can’t be that a state that owns refugees produces refugees in its own country,” said Toprak.
The head of the association complained of the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish but also in Alevitian cities.
In doing so, Erdogan wants to increase the pressure on the remaining Kurds.
“They are the last large minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have been eradicated or driven away in the past hundred years,” said Toprak, who is also a CDU member.
The Chief of the Association demanded that the Federal Government position “as strongly as Austria against Erdogan and its supporters”
There is also a \"Hexen hunt\" against Erdogan critics in Germany.
I don't feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months.
The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad.
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and Oppositionals.
The branding as a gulle trailer destroys the professional existence of teachers and other academics.
“He who does not adapt and praise Erdogan, sits on packed suitcases, by the way, also the Kemalists and Seculars,” said Ercan Karakoyun, Chairman of the Gülen-nah Foundation for Dialogue and Education, the “World”
As reported by the newspaper calling for figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, the Turks represented the largest group of asylum rights in Germany, recognised for political persecution, even before the coup.
On the day of the end of June 30 this was 11,386 people, and thus almost 29 percent of all recognized as asylum rights (39,625).
This survey does not include those who have fled from war, poverty or prospectslessness.
Asylum rights under the Basic Law are exclusively political, i.e. from the state side, individually persecuted.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: \"Go where it hurts\"
Rare Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: The locals do not get anything from the summer election campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country day.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.
In 2021, the election will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.
Because it doesn't go as much as ever: summer holidays, heat and country day election campaign - it bites.
The locals to be convinced by the voters are on vacation.
The most common holidaymakers who are in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so do not choose the day of the country.
In addition, practical problems arise: In the holidays, helpers who hang posters, blow up balloons, distribute flyers, and count voices at the end of the trip are just effortlessly driven up.
Until September 4, 2016, the election day and last holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern once again had to pass the election campaign almost by the people.
The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.
And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Selling, leader of an SPD/CDU coalition, has to fear his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys.
It is exciting to see how strong Neuling AfD is cutting off and what is left of coalition solids at the end.
Selling, 66 years old and since 2008 Head of Government, makes an almost inconspicuous election campaign, you can see from his major posters.
He travels through the country, distributes roses and chats a little with the people, as did his legendary wortkarger predecessor Harald Ringstorff.
Otherwise, soul ring has got cold feet and chancellor Merkel blames the flowering of the AfD.
Her refugee policy, her \"We create this\" has accelerated the rise of the right-wing populists, which is now likely to cost him the beautiful office.
The CDU, with its prime candidate, Interior Minister, Lorenz Caffeer, has already experienced how it is to make elections at the right place at the wrong time.
She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to major conferences; Merkel Bundestagswahlkreis is located in the northeast.
But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berliner and Sachsen there as Mecklenburger and Vorpommern.
“There was probably the majority from other states,” said Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in the NDR.
But neither does it harm anyone from other corners of Germany to listen once to Angela Merkel.
Otherwise, the Northeast CDU largely ignores the usual electoral stands in marketplaces and in front of shopping centers with umbrellas and balloons.
That, says Kokert, only plays a \"subordinate role\"
Also, the Union has noticed that it is breaking down the base on the land, that it must work very hard to find a wire to the people again.
You're going like the left, the SPD, the green ones: hardly present in the country's wide areas.
However, the advice of the CDU election fighter Kokert to his fellow fighters is also self-exploratory: “You have to go where it hurts, namely where people are: village parties, Golden weddings, every birthday celebration has to be used,
Because much is on the game, Sellering has now called his SPD for a particularly committed election campaign.
In surveys, the social democrats were last with 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and just in front of the AfD (19).
In the 2011 election, the SPD had clearly won 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).
The Greens, small and small parties with seven per cent in the surveys, are expected to make the leap into the country day.
They make a modern virtue out of the holiday need and leave their electoral struggle largely on the internet.
\"Online election campaign\" is called the country's president Claudia Müller.
Otherwise, green voters go for tracks looking for local citizens among the vacationers.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, is running a houseboat through the Mecklenburgian lakes and finds it beautiful.
Her impression: \"Punishment in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment\"
B27 remediation: restaurants suffer from blockage
At the speed with which the B 27 is renovated, there is nothing to meddle with.
For those responsible for the construction work starting at 5.30 a.m. and ending at 20 p.m., there is praise throughout the day.
“They’ve done everything pretty softly,” Elvira Tetzlaff tells of the Jet tank station.
That's a super team.
There's no delay either.
The construction site could be moved to the south at the beginning of the week at half-time, until the end of October.
It is also praised to meet those responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to the establishment of emergency entrances.
Since the construction site has moved south on Monday and the blockage of Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen has also been lifted and the connection to Rottenburg is thus restored, the traffic situation within the place has relaxed.
The citizens can now move both sides from the B 27 onwards.
The way out through the place seems to go back.
“There have been some significant complaints,” says the deputy head of the Florian King, responsible for traffic management of the renovation.
The inhabitants of Bachsatzstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to struggle with more traffic noise, because many of them sought and trusted their navi rather than the sign.
As a result, some trucks in residential areas were invigorated.
Since the speed limits were also not met, the municipality called for the measuring vehicle from Mössingen to be strengthened.
“There were considerable excesses,” says King, who once made himself aware of the situation on the spot.
There have already been flashes of two to three per minute.
The fastest was at 77 hour kilometers in the tempo-30 zone.
Since the construction site has continued, however, it has become quieter.
For businessmen at B 27, it is only a small comfort that the road is now open to customers from Rottenburg.
Look into the cards, businessmen don't like it.
But that the B 27 remediation has led to revenue interruptions, let everyone you ask look through.
However, some are more affected and some are less affected.
Those who have less to do with the \"end customer\", that is, for other companies, for which the renovation has little consequences.
Thomas Sulz also speaks of a \"highest slight decline\" at the Maier Autohaus, but also acknowledges that, of course, \"the running skills are missing\"
The most heavily bred are the locals along the road.
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the steakhouse, formally Krone, finds clear words.
This is already life threatening.
Not only did he, but all restaurants met with “heart”
The customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.
We must be happy about every euro turnover.
The loss of turnover is estimated to be over 50 percent
The road remediation has thrown its plant back for two years.
Half of his employees had to dismiss him.
If I had a company with 4000 employees and half had been released, the policy would have responded differently.
Instead, Government President Jörg Schmidt replied to Göhner's question about whether there could be a financial compensation with the indication that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the benefits of the situation at B 27. Now it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the renovation.
Göhner knows about other counties where such a generous operation was carried out.
For all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.
Finally, since 1715 the family business has been located here, it refers to the long history.
The fact that other regular guests are now less frequent because of the complicated transport, he can understand.
If you can't get here, it's nice elsewhere.
Göhner has no doubt that his regular clientele will return after the end of the renovation work.
Despite the crises with BSE and bird flu, Göhner considers the impact of B 27 construction on his clientship to be the biggest crisis his restaurant has experienced in its long history.
Six months of construction work, it's already brutal.
In the name of the fight against terrorism, laws are constantly being scrambled.
After the recent attacks, Minister of Interior de Maizière is now presenting a thick security package.
But what's got to do with terrorism?
And what does the coalition partner say about all this?
Thomas de Maizière gives the reconciliation.
All its proposals are to the coalition partner - politically reasonable - the Federal Minister of the Interior says in the presentation of his new security package.
They don't demand anyone.
Other further points would initially be discussed within the parties.
I'm also involved.
As Minister of the Interior, however, he had results and a “achieveable consensus” within the coalition.
According to the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, De Maizière has had a little time spent before presenting his conclusions on safety in the Republic.
But they are now all the more extensive.
Some are already known, announced, recommended: that a new security authority should take care of knocking encrypted communications is not new.
Nor is it the fact that Germany has to implement several EU regulations on passenger data and arms law.
The call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is not surprising either.
In part, de Maizière will launch a second call for proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD: he wants to punish sympathy for terrorist groups and to knock down jihadists with dual citizenship to the German passport.
“These will be difficult points for the SPD - include the CDU man.
He nevertheless considers this to be reasonable and does not demand anything from the coalition partner whatsoever.
A few new ideas also present de Maizière.
They have it partly in themselves: it plans rapid procedures for deportations and more possibilities for arresting people before deportation.
Refugees who are specifically brought into the country are expected to have their smartphones checked and to disclose social media accounts for a security review.
In the case of duplications for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to place some even worse than ever before - for example, those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers in order to conceal their identity.
Some of these are politically and legally delicate.
Some of them are still unexplained and leave questions open.
And in the case of a few points - for example, the imbalance of the patient - the question arises: what does it really have to do with security and terror?
Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terrorism.
But it can't be said that the attackers of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
In addition, many people were worried about safety in view of the high numbers of refugees.
And things that were deeply occupied by the people did not allow themselves to get out even in electoral times.
Internal security is enormously focused.
First the attacks in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The uncertainty is great.
And yes, there are electoral struggles.
Union and SPD are therefore increasingly involved in the issue of internal security.
In the past few days, there has been a high gap between the two parties.
First a garish dispute over the facilities of the federal police, then about a security policy collection of some of the Union's internal ministers, in which the heads of the resort also demand a Burka ban and a withdrawal from dual citizenship.
De Maizière also strives for conciliatory tones.
He doesn't keep anything from a double pass.
We have satisfied the discussion in Germany.
It's not a good idea to re-open it.
And on a Burka ban, he has constitutional concerns.
Whether or not its own package is constitutional at all corners and whether it is actually \"assumable\" for the coalition partner has to be shown.
There's a lot of things in it that could cause conflict.
However, the SPD is also currently trying to profile itself on the issue of internal security.
Head of Party Sigmar Gabriel is cautiously speaking and says: “The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security,
Volkswagen's still going through brilliantly.
Despite diesel scandals, delivery figures worldwide are rising.
But it's not all around in all markets.
In the recall action, there is a vertebral term.
Volkswagen starts in the second half of the second half of the delivery.
Europe's largest car maker, despite the diesel industry's many brands and some well-running markets, has been able to continue to show a plus in the past year.
But in July the VW core brand weakened mainly in Western Europe and again burdened the overall sales, as reported by the Dax company.
In July, the VW brand sold 1.8 percent less vehicles with 449100 cars than in the previous month.
In Western Europe alone, according to China, the second most important market, sales were 14 percent below the previous month.
In Germany's home market, deliveries dropped by almost a sixth.
Brand Sales Chief Jürgen Stackmann reduced the weaker figures from July to two sales days less in Europe.
In addition, in some core markets, there has been a decrease in purchase due to “changed economic conditions”.
In addition to the situation surrounding the coup in Turkey, the British vote on the withdrawal from the EU has also charged a spokesperson.
In the U.S., where the waste gas cases first escalated, there is also another minus to be booked.
Large support for VW is the Chinese market.
In all, the mainly affected house brand of the Lower Saxonyes still shines through the diesel scandal: after the first seven months, there is only a zero delivery from 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles.
Company sales manager Fred Kappler was able to continue to show sales growth from January to July.
1.3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen at this time, 5.904 million worldwide.
Volkswagen had manipulated exhaust gas testing software.
In Germany alone, VW calls about 2.5 million cars to the workshops for refit.
As a result of the upgrade, VW confirmed that the conversion of cars has no negative effects.
There was no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance after the refit of the vehicles.
The car maker shall issue a \"guarantee equal\" certificate to the customer after the upgrade, but shall not speak of a \"guarantee\" as it was called in corporate circles on Friday.
The reason was legal fines.
The “Focus” had reported that Volkswagen was now providing a guarantee to its German customers for upgraded diesel models.
This was confirmed last Monday by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport.
It was confirmed from the Ministry of Transport that there was this meeting.
‘VW has to comply fully with the requirements of my investigation commission and the KBA,
\"Derogations from this are not accepted\" declared Federal Minister for Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) according to the Ministry.
VW has taken over the guarantee that there will be no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance after the upgrade and that all type-approval-related vehicle values will remain unchanged.
Volkswagen itself uses the term \"guarantee\" but not as it was in corporate circles.
With the broad term \"guarantee\", Volkswagen sees the possibility that, for example, half a year after the upgrade, customers could come into a workshop with an engine damage and return it to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
It is also important in the interests of customers to avoid any other damage that has nothing to do with the exhaust scandal, as it was called, from any other damage.
Therefore, VW does not use the term “guarantee”.
The Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee demands criminal interest from rich savers - as the second institute in Germany.
Bank Chief Josef Paul said on Thursday: \"It's only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on giro or daily cash accounts,
The Bundesverband Deutscher Banken speaks of a single case and does not see any signal in it: normal savers should not be afraid to pay for their savings-gross criminal interest,
Banks store money overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB), they have to pay 0.4 percent penalty interest.
This fee will be charged by the Reiffeisenbank Gmund from private and corporate customers to Giro or daily cash accounts for deposits over 100,000 euros from September.
\"The first 100,000 euros are free,
“The next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year in the future,” Paul said.
He has been guarding 40 million euros for some time, which could be lifted from one day to another and which he could not consume.
“These are on the central bank account with me and cause 0.4 percent costs,” said the bank chief.
“I can’t lay down 4000 euros for every million “
The costs are now further borne by the polluter principle.
Just leaving the cash in the safes of the Reiffeisenbank would be far too dangerous: \"I've already experienced four attacks, I don't have the fifth one yet,\" said the Banking Board.
Most customers understood and switched to other types of equipment.
Only a few migrated to other banks.
The Bayern Association stated: “The ECB’s extreme monetary policy rate is a significant cost for all banks,
To carry them alone would be \"not permanently viable\"
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for accounting, credit cards or transfers.
The Thuringian Volks- und Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land, with its Skatbank branch 2014, had made headlines with fines for deposits of three million euros.
Michael Kemmer, head of the Banking Association, said: “We do not expect private customers to have to pay flat-rate fees for deposits, so competition in Germany among banks and savings banks is far too strong,
A banker said there was a client at Lake Tegern, which is a bit more elaborately equipped by the property,
“This can become a problem for a small bank - if it keeps money for free.
Founded in 1911, Gmund has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
In the region there are well-known actors, athletes and entrepreneurs.
The Bayern cooperative association “is not currently aware of any other banks that charge a deposit refund for deposits by private customers,” said the speaker Ernst.
At the end of June, Uwe Fröhlich, President of the Federal Association of German Volksbanken and Raiffeisenbanken (BVR), said: “The threshold to go into negatives towards the private customer is very, very high,”
Competition is hard, and it threatens the migration of investors into competition.
The customers in Germany will not like this in width.
Destination plates: who actually buys records?
Lone men of middle age love records.
Before you rush to the comment part to send it under the pseudonym NotAllUnsame MenMiddle Agers with harsh insults, this statement derives from current data.
According to YouGov, the widespread recovery of records is not based on a tree in Millennials who want to welcome the novelty of physical objects, but on midlife nostalgia.
Those who have recently bought a plate are expected to be between 45 and 54 years of age.
In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer group.
It is also not hordes by hobby collectors - it has an emotional significance: older record buyers retain their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).
But the results of YouGov?
If this blog were a news report on television, the camera would follow me as I walk in the midst of a busy street in Soho, wear a modest grey suit and steer wildly before I stand still, hold my hands, and say something definite like, \"So, let's take a closer look at it.\"
So let's take a look at it.
Even though the heart of Sohos slowly bursts into its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were based - there is still a handful of fantastic record-special shops.
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part in which I am in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and mood by observing.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I follow from Sister Ray (data count: two young women, three men of middle age) into the Reckless Records (data count: eight men of middle age, a woman, probably around 20), is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector, I ask?
“I guess so,” he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by email, I didn't follow him home), dress out the walls of his living room.
The reason why he owns such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records that he could not afford when they appeared and buy again items he sold when he was young and pleading.
“Many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. Things I was probably a little too young to buy them to me,” he says.
He agrees that those who buy plates are more introverted and like to spend time alone, adding: “I don’t smoke and I don’t drink very much.
That's my truck.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets meet meet the YouGov profile.
However, he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media hpe, people who have heard about the comeback and are tempted to buy their old records again.
Of the conversations I have conducted, people usually took part in their collection around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again, he says.
This would explain the tree to followers of a certain age.
But what about the supposed emotional significance of records?
It takes only a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realize that record business offers a soothing community of like-minded people.
According to Wez, some of the older customers took advantage of the contactless payment system.
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record covers, from items that wake happy youth memories.
“I think sometimes it can be filling a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort,” says Wez.
It's like this to me as a collector, and I think it's like that to many people.
It's an easy way to get involved spiritually.
“We are like their social workers - an employee flows from a record pile.
A April survey of ICM revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record last month have not yet heard it.
The survey also found that 41% own a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not own record players.
At this time of the news report, I would probably look very concerned, as I browse through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (number of data: three middle-aged men), has noticed a “trophy aspect” of the revival.
“Someone came in here just recently and said: “I don’t own a record player, but I would like to buy a radiohead record so I can put it in the shelf,” he says.
This is not a large percentage, but it definitely happens.
More produktlastig, less musical.
We have people who say, \"I don't have a record player\"
These are younger people, not older ones who come in slowly.
Fopp, who has devoted almost an entire floor to the records, has a dazzling audience when I go in.
There are couples around 70, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the above mentioned shops - Wild Beast's latest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz dries from the speakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but the following mental traumas are difficult to detect when standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been running around in business for a few minutes and considering the variety of records for sale.
She's doing more of a window-screen than a big purchase.
She doesn't deserve much, so collecting records isn't a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It is easy to hear music from a computer or in other ways, but the beauty of records is... - it drives off with a fallen sigh.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I gave the appearance of patterning the jeans hot pants, I observed a group of young teenage girls who were grouped around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter consider buying a Crosley record player.
To the left is a stairwell, a wall full of records of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential records for an average collection.
No one looks at them - maybe because they're just decorative, some of them up so far that it's impossible to touch them.
It is pure \"platten art\"
But in view of the fact that every attraction for these items means more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain about.
It is no surprise that a population that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends most on luxury items like records.
Even though my researches found that the results of YouGov are true, they leave the large number of female collectors who exist in reality, record shops and online forums, at least in record shops in Soho.
These people are probably working hard in school or in offices.
They certainly do not spend their Thursday morning with the bumping through record shops of Berwick Street and the leafing through plates, while avoiding the staring sight of a mysterious 30-year-old false moderator who has nothing to do with the shoulders of middle-aged men.
The Greenland shark is the longest living vertebrates - video report
Scientists say that Greenlandhai has the longest life span of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who examines sharks, says that the record was with a female, from which it is assumed to be between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long
French court rejects offer about demolition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected an offer from the authorities in Calais to downturn dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.
In a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be empowered to tear down 72 provisional transactions where persons inside the warehouse sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, or offer hairdresser services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.
The Prefecture of Calais argued that these places should be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would pose a risk of fire and sanitation.
Humanitarian groups informed the court that the shops and restaurants were important, as the free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They also explained that the provisional shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of people who run the 72 provisional business, but admitted that the concerns of Calais Prefecture were \"absolutely comprehensible\"
Judge Jean-François Molla said that the grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than just feeding people who “live in extremely precarious conditions”
He said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by the downhill was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is operated non-profit and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum matters for hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café.
In a letter to the Guardian, it was said that the closure would be for these children a disaster of which the youngest eight years are old,
On Friday, the two relief organizations Help Refugees and the Migrant's Auberge estimated that the number of living in the jungle camp had increased to over 9,000 people - the highest number up to now - after a steep increase in newcomers during the summer.
Despite Olympian disappointment: Martin remains combative
Despite his disappointing appearance in the Olympics, Radprofi Tony Martin does not want to get under way.
“I continue to keep the World Cup in mind, remain confident and fight further,” wrote the 31-year-old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro at Facebook.
He does not have an explanation for his miserable twelfth place at the sugar hat.
“I’m telling you, it’s hard to comment on the timing of yesterday, ” Martin said.
He had to analyse in peace what reasons had led to the debacle.
At the time trial World Cup in Qatar in October Martin actually wanted to fight for the title.
“I’m going to look at everything that we’ve changed in recent times,
“This is also my position,” wrote the three-time time trial world champion, who had lost more than three minutes on Wednesday on the 54.5 km Olympic Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland).
Olympia: Tennis Profi Siegemund missed Half-finals
The victory of Laura Siegemund ended in the quarter finals of Rio: The world rankings-32. from Metzingen missed by a 1:6, 1:6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico/WTA-No.
34) clearly the semi-final of the Olympic tennis tournament.
Shemund, who was plagued by back problems, was only able to pass her pitch once and acted powerless compared to the previous rounds.
On Thursday, Angelique Kerber (Kiel/No. 2) still had the chance to jump into the preliminary round.
The Australian-open winner met the British Johanna Konta (No. 10).
In 2000, Tommy Haas had obtained a medal (silver) in Sydney as the last German tennis professional.
There were two German DTB starters in the quarter finals of summer games last 1992.
Never stood a German duo in an Olympic single half-final.
Group increases at start-up for live video game transmissions
Other people watching video games play is a giant trend - it also wants to benefit Microsoft.
The technology company buys the start-up tree that specializes in this hobby.
How much money flows for the takeover, Microsoft did not share on Thursday.
With his offer Beam did not start until January and already has more than 100,000 users.
You can watch others while playing, but also intervene yourself.
For example, they can give up missions to players and face enemies as well as provide equipment.
The player's Activision Blizzard starts a new HD video service for the booming world of e-sports.
On the way to the global media event, Facebook is supposed to help.
The advertising industry is already listening.
The staff of the start-up, which has so far been based in Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington, moved to Microsoft headquarters in the California Redmond, as Beam co-founder and chief Matt Salsamedi reported.
Therefore, the customer should not change anything by taking over.
According to Microsoft, Beam is integrated into the video game department around the Xbox console.
The market for live streaming of video game activities is growing rapidly.
Well-known platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch was bought in 2014 by the online retailer Amazon - for almost one billion dollars.
YouTube Gaming belongs to the Google Mother Alphabet.
Here comes the Enforcement Trailer
Germany's breeders have to adjust to the next generation speed gauge: new lightning devices are being tested in various federal countries, including Hesse and Brandenburg, which are supposed to be particularly effective in transposing tempo probes.
The futuristic-acting Enforcement Trailers of Vitronic from Wiesbaden, for example, can be used at accident issues where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, at motorway construction sites or to renovate bridges with a temporary speed limit, there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure compliance with the speed limitation there with a stationary flasher.
However, permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or elaborate.
The Enforcement Trailer is self-evident: Its battery holds five days in the case of continuous measurement operation, the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem.
With laser measuring technology, all vehicles can also be recorded simultaneously across multiple tracks.
Variable speed limits as well as throughput bans after time, driving lanes and vehicle class can also be monitored.
The trailer can be moved in a state of high speed by means of every car with trailer coupling, according to the manufacturer.
To avoid being simply stolen, it is lowered in the measuring operation, so that the wheels disappear in the armored and, by the way, shot-proof outer shell.
In addition, a built-in alarm system is designed to protect the blitzer from vandalism.
Since 2015, the trailer has been tested according to Vitronic's data in various federal countries and has now also been used.
Foreign authorities are also blitzing with the new technology: recently France has ordered 100 pieces, after an order of 150 pieces last year.
Great Britain picks silver in 7-Rugby, after Fiji Masterclass brings gold
The impressive performance of the UK at the 7th rugby came at the finale on Thursday evening to an abrupt stop at the last hurdle in the form of the Fijis when they were hit with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji awarded a master class in handling, side-stepping, backs, line running and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat was offset by the not too bad price of the silver medal - the UK's fourth day - and they could be very proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The sharp defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day, could fall on them in the final.
But no matter what the form, Fiji would have hit a 15-man team in the best form.
It could be a comfort for GB - but it probably won't - that at least a British will have a gold medal hanging around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's chief coach Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon.
GB had a difficult way behind.
Eight years ago, she lost every match with the Adelaide Sevens under Ryan.
They just lost one here.
This sleep is going to hurt, but progress is amazing.
Fiji began to be wonderful and let the attacks of GBs jump out of fun.
It felt for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. that you would run into driving buses. The World Series winners went up 5-0 when Osea Kolinisau crossed the corner.
With another four minutes of play time Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner, which he converted.
12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.
A prominent Tackle by Mitchell stopped reaching the mountain of Mann Leone Nakarawa a third gate, but it only stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua left a touchdown in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new one since the return pomp and there was still over a minute play time ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou excelled through other weak tackings of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a goal.
The transformation took a 29-0 to break.
It is as if Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning to do so.
That's how it is.
GB carried out fundamental changes at the mid-term and closed the Fijian gap...for four minutes, which was good for the first half-time conditions until Joshua passed Tuisova after a brilliant interplay of Fiji.
Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game had long been in favor of the South Sea islanders whose fans sang, swung flags and danced on the tribune.
It wasn't hard to admire the playful Fijis approach.
Mata Viliame put the i-thick with another try in the last seconds.
The peacocks, the Fijis hugged themselves and GB kicked destructively beaten in the lawn.
Earlier that day, Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi-final with 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa into a nearly semi-final match from the race - the UK's transformation of the difference.
Kyle Brown brought the boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and scored a gate under the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late tacking by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured the winning - and thus the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by fighting with the cancer of the coach for rowing victory
There will be no more emotional gold than in these games, and that's what it wants to be.
From the first rower strike to the last, 220 hard hives that enter the story, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.
Although it was only the two who sat on the rower, there were three voices in the boat. The echo of the coach Robin Williams, was present when she rowed for the second Olympic gold in the two without a tax woman in a row, the first women in the history of British sport, which set such a standard.
Their dominance was absolute, after all, their 39th unbeatable commitment, which is also unparalleled.
What we see are two brilliant athletes that glide across the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the kind of triumph to shine.
Behind each gold row is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental progress that makes up the difference and there was no one more helpful than the trainer who did not know 30 months ago if he would survive this day at all than was diagnosed with cancer.
As he said, he was risky.
I had bladder cancer, which is operational, and they did.
If you don't, he's spreading everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes a little the outlook.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The Trio were lucky that he was able to start treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if it is even the right term under such circumstances.
I needed money, so I needed to get better soon.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and walked around at the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice.
That's how it starts.
Rowing in itself is already a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one.
In the immediacy of victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking a little more than usual, trying to cope with his own fears.
Stanning, who was the chief at the Royal Artillery Regiment in Afghanistan, said, \"I was an emotional wreck this week. This may be a bit extreme, but it means so much.
It only repeats how much this means to me, how much I and Helen and Robin have worked.
There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anybody, so a massive thanks goes to him, he's the best trainer in the world.
I couldn't have wanted a better person to train or a better trainer.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years.
The couple had a hard rhythm that their opponents could not cope with.
Even in the last 500 metres, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to join, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very caught right now.
Helen ryfeib in process, stay in process,
It is really important not to let go of yourself.
We had a good start and at the same time we weren't looking to do something great.
We didn't want a fireworks today, we just wanted to achieve a good result, go out and win the race, whatever we did.
The couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about their future.
Glover has to appear next week on a wedding, her own with TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say that was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London it took about six months to understand that I was an Olympic woman.
It was all so new for me and I was so stressed out.
It took about four minutes.
That feels so much better, she said.
For 31 years, exemplary care should be taken to ensure clarity
The Managing Director of the Water Purpose Association, Veitenstein Group, Ruppert Göller, is retired.
The association is considered to be “bayern-wide exemplary”
A small Franconian drinking water association as an example for the large water producers.
So it was some time ago in the original tone in a contribution of Bayerische Rundfunk.
Only later did the Water Forum of the Government of Unterfranken honor the Association of Purposes.
The work of the Veitenstein Group is considered to be exemplary.
Behind all is Rupert Göller, who was a staff member for 31 years, of which 28 years as managing director.
He was now retired at the age of 65.
The Drinking Water Association of the Veitenstein Group, based in Kottendorf, municipality of Breitbrun, each year promotes about 150000 cubic meters of water and provides 32 villages and hamlets with about 5500 inhabitants.
The municipalities are Kirchlauter, Breitbrun, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the town of Baunach.
Water supply contracts are available for other cities and municipalities.
The current Chairman, Breitbrunn's mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), reminded us that Rupert Göller was appointed waterguard in 1985 and already in 1988 was appointed managing director of the association.
\"His duties have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work to office and organisational activities, budget creation, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends, the chairman said.
As outstanding events, she mentioned the commissioning and inauguration of the new well (1994), land purchases in the area of the new well (1998) and compensation for farmers, the renovation of the high containers (1999), the re-creating of a central computer control (2004) and the partial renewals of water pipelines.
There was no stoppage and there have always been innovations because water means life and drinking water is the most important food.
In her Laudatio she praised the faithful, reliable and correct service of the age of 31 years.
He worked with a lot of heart blood for his water-use association and he lived the water-purpose association as if it were his own company.
A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of the Veitenstein Group on the Nitrate Reduction in the Water Forum of the district of Unterfranken.
For this he has received a great deal of recognition and praise.
Rupert Göller, for his part, praised Waterwart Alfonso Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.
He's the best waterguard and he was a faithful button.
Together we were an unbeatable team.
As a highlight from his point of view, he described the well building and the restructuring of the purpose association.
The biggest challenge and the most difficult use, however, was the pipe break at the high-container at Kirchlauter on a 3rd January.
Here, at minus 17 degrees the whole night would have to work so that the localities could be supplied with water.
Even the supply of new browns could only be maintained once, because the high-container of Pettstadt was filled with hoses.
The management of the Drinking Waters Association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who joined Rupert Göller's successor.
The soprano Anna Netrebko openly interacts with the autism of her son Tiago - and turns to other affected parents: \"You must have the courage to talk about it,
“The medicine has made great progress,” said the 44-year-old of the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.
When the disease was recognized with her son, she believed that she had to die.
The eight-year-old Tiago, however, has progressed well and is now learning privately in New York where there are the best therapists.
“To give an example, if I ask him something that was back two years when I sang to the Milan Scala, he doesn’t remember anything,” Netrebko said.
But he is the happiest man on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebko's connection with the bass baritone Erwin scrap.
She is now married to the Tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Relational status in Bargeheide - Man shoots at life's companion
On Friday, a 35-year-old man shot his partner at a multi-family house in Barteheide (Kreis Stormarn) and fatally injured her.
“The man called on us and told us to have shot his life companion,” said a police spokesman.
The perpetrator is on the run, after which he is found publicly.
In the meantime, Sven S. could be on the road by car.
The man is about 1.80 meters tall, musculoskeletal, brown-burned and has a glare.
Meanwhile, the police released a photo of him.
It is, however, a few years old.
In the meantime, the man wears a gluing.
The man should not be addressed directly.
He could still carry the gun with him, the police said.
If you see Sven S., call the 110.
The police speak of a \"relationship state\"
The victim was the year 1988, the perpetrator 1981.
At first, the competent police in Lübeck did not want to make any information about the Tathergang or the relationship between perpetrators and victims, but they confirmed that a human being had been killed.
‘This is a killing offence,
“We’re not saying more at the moment,” said a police spokesman in Lübeck.
According to eyewitnesses, a special use command (SEK) was at the crime scene.
Steel - Lichtblick für Deutsche Stahlindustrie
The crisis-provided and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared from additional costs in millions of heights.
Financial burdens that threatened the sector from eco-current demand are off the table.
It remained in the liberation from the renewable energy environment of the existing plants for the so-called own-power production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the West German General Newspaper (WAZ, Friday issue).
\"I am really glad that after two years of negotiations, we were finally able to achieve this,
The European Commission had therefore first planned to ask the steel producers who are using gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption to pay off.
According to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year.
Gabriel told WAZ that there was now a principle agreement with the EU Commission after discussions with Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only when the generators are replaced in the steel works will an EEC envelope fall by 20 per cent.
But these too are not raised in the steel industry.
The IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the EU Commission on the production of own electricity.
In this way, the status ratio of the previous regulation is largely fixed.
The successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry are of particular importance.
\"In view of our campaign 'Steel is Future', this is a first step,
‘More must follow
“Against the reform of the emissions trade, climate and employment objectives are to be considered,” explained IG Metall-Chief Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt.
The steel industry in Europe has suffered from overcapacity and a significant price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008.
Last year the situation worsened as the world's largest producer country, China, in view of the weakening domestic demand, threw massive steel onto the world market.
European producers present Chinese steel companies price dumping.
During this spring the situation has relaxed somewhat.
On the one hand, imposed import duties show effect on import steel, on the other, the economic outlook in China has shone up.
It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.
The German industry prime minister Thyssenkrupp remained careful on Thursday.
Finally, the prices would have stagnated again.
The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
Thyssenkrupp did not want to exclude closures of individual works.
In the German steel industry around 86000 people were employed by the end of 2015.
In July, despite rising prices and increasing orders, German steel manufacturers remain cautious.
They produced about six percent less crude steel at 3.4 million tons than in the previous month, as reported by the Steel Economic Association on Friday.
After a short increase in May, the quantity produced now declined in the second month.
Production has been below the previous year by two percent since the beginning of the year.
In the coming months, the association expects an improved order situation with an increasing output.
Community, Spirit, Health: Singing does seniors well
The singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp all her life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, in the teaching office study she took the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.
“Singing moves me - emotionally and physically - she describes.
After a sample she feels balanced, cheerful and generally more lively, she says.
By the way, she does something good for her health and her mind.
Because singing is a great hobby for seniors right from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler of the German Senior League.
Most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, describes hackers.
Through regular co-operation, seniors can establish and maintain social contacts.
Because often social and family structures arise in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: “To meet and organize yourself, to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of co-operation -
Singing can be strenuous in the positive sense, says hacker.
In doing so, seniors train deep and controlled breathing.
Those who regularly demand their lungs do not get out of the pussy even in everyday life.
Even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby.
For older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz of the federal working community of senior organizations.
In older generations, singing together had a much higher significance, it was one of everyday life, both in school and in leisure, she explains.
Lenz frequently observes that singing or listening to songs in older people raises many memories, often associated with positive feelings of her youth.
Through lyrics and especially melodies, even people who suffer from a long history of ill health are part of their lives.
When singing, a special performance is also required for the head, explains Lenz.
Concentrate on your own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a major cognitive challenge.
Older people who live alone do so not just to focus on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition experienced by singing in the choir, says Hackler.
An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.
The feeling of self-worth also grows through singing in the choir.
To show myself: If I practice for a long time, I will be better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens.
So there are good reasons to start singing.
Who wants to try out a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent, Lenz advises.
You're not singing alone - with 50 singing people, who's listening when a sound goes next?
In search of the appropriate offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.
If someone from the group sings in a senior choir, you can simply join.
Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the area.
Anyone who wants to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or the church leader.
Many senior choirs can also be found via the Internet.
If you do not have access to the Internet, the family, friends or neighbors can ask for help with the Internet search.
Anyone who wants to sing should definitely join a choir, advises hackers.
Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - this applies to every age.
Cats react more sensitive than cat to screams of the young
In Hanover, biologists have investigated the effect of calling cat babies on adult animals.
To her surprise, the honey also did not cold the males - however, they were always the same in contrast to the females.
Female cats can detect the level of excitement of cat babies at the miauen of the little ones.
They react faster by ten percent to sounds from cats that are in great distress, as scientists from the Veterinary University and the Medical University of Hanover (MHH) have found out.
Kater also responds to the calls of cats - but always the same.
“The acoustic differences between the miauen of less and much-earned young animals for the males are not obvious or significant,” said biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH.
She is the first author of the study to be published this Friday in the magazine BMC Evolutionary Biology.
In a previous study, the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of the kitten screams differed with the urgency of their need for help.
A total of nine adult cats and eight cats were observed from the animal husbandry of the MHH.
They were introduced for the first time to calls of little ones who were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and siblings.
On the other hand, they were confronted with screams of more prolific cats, which were also raised up.
The researchers consider their results to be meaningful despite the low sample.
“All women, even those who have not yet had their own offspring, responded differently to the screams,” Konerding said.
They turned to the speaker more quickly when this call was played by the very errands of cats.
This ability may have been innate or developed with sexual maturity.
\"One surprise was that the males reacted at all, said the biologist.
In the past, scientists have studied the reactions of women and men to baby sounds several times in humans.
Also, some studies have shown that women responded more sensitively to infants, whether they were mothers or not, reports biologist Marina Scheumann.
Podolski grabs to Supercup with \"Gala\"
Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey.
In Turkey, a warrant has been issued against the former football star Hakan Sükür.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
An important football game will take place in Turkey for the first time after the coup.
Before the duel of the arch rivals between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolski's Galatasaray Istanbul around the supercup in Konya, the official line is clear: \"Business as usual\" is stated.
Even when the exceptional state was imposed after the resurgence attempt in July, the government did not consider that the daily life of ordinary citizens should be affected.
But this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is held responsible for the coup trial.
There is no stop in front of the football team.
Against the former Starkicker Hakan Sükür, the prosecutor issued an arrest warrant.
Therefore, the now-in-a-American acid is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
Sükür should be a supporter of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is held responsible by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the coup trial.
Although the exceptional condition initially imposed for 90 days is still valid until October, it actually has no effect on the lives of most Turks.
On Wednesday, Erdogan declared that the nocturnal “democracy growth” in public places throughout the country had ended.
The sport is divided - like the whole country - into followers and opponents of Erdogans.
Especially fans of the Besiktas working club do not traditionally count among the President's friends.
However, what the Turks grow up in the face of dramatic experience in history is the strict rejection of military coups.
There even the fans agree - no matter whether their heart beats for Galatasaray or Besiktas.
In the case of Pokal victors, \"Gala\", it will be particularly common for Lukas Podolski to arrive again.
The Cologneer proved his sporting value in the season ended: with 17 goals and nine presentations in all competitions, the 31-year-old finished his first season as top scorer of his club.
In the final match against Fenerbahce, he won the 1:0 victory.
The newspaper \"Fanatics\" cheered him: \"He was the best in the place\"
He finished the season in an excellent way and secured his team the Cup.
Thanks to Poldi, the disappointing season for the record champion found a reconciliational conclusion.
After the pre-run K.o in the Champions League, the \"Lows\" also broke out early in the Europe League.
In the Süper Lig it was only six years old.
The season wasn't good.
The Cup was the only way to win something.
“That’s what we did and that’s the most important thing,” Podolski said.
For Master Besiktas, the year of play was better.
In particular, thanks to Mario Gomez, who made the base for the 14th title with 26 season hits as a sower-lig-Torschützenkönig.
That is also the reason the fans hope for the return of the 31-year-old.
After the coup, Gomez was under contract with the AC Florence and announced to Besiktas only that Gomez would not return after his EM leave because of the political situation in the country.
“If Mario wants to come to us, he just has to say it — quoted by the specialist magazine “Kicker” club chief Fikret Orman.
But if the storm were to be willing to give up about one-third of its annual salary estimated at EUR 7.5 million, Orman made it clear: \"We cannot pay his salary at Florence.\"
Despite doping: these athletes still have medal chances at Olympia in Rio
The 34-year-old Justin Gatlin was already locked twice because of dopings (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblower Julia Stepanowa is not allowed to start in Rio.
Other transferred athletics sinners can only laugh at it - they fight for medals in Rio.
The theme of Doping still determines the headlines at the Olympic Games in Rio.
The Russian swimmer Julija Jefimowa, who had filed her starting rights shortly before the games after a doping locker, was unmerited and built out at her start (100 meters of chest).
It was a scrambled scene: with a smile she was still proud of herself in the hall and had provoked her appearance.
When it became clear that they would not get gold, the audience broke into a cheerstorm.
However, there are still numerous other athletes who, despite the doping past at the Rio Olympics, are going to start.
Here is an overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100-m-staffle/USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in athletics.
He was already blocked twice for dopings (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since its launch, the 2004 Olympics and the 2004 Ex-World Champions are even faster than before, it is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.80 seconds and is considered the largest challenger of Usain Bolt.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100-m-Staffel/Jamaika): The two-time Olympic champion and seven-time world champion had to leave a six-month lock in 2010 after she was shown to take Oxycodon.
After surgery they had severe toothaches, the 29-year-old defended himself.
Sandra Perkovic (discuss/Croatia): In 2011, the 2012 Olympic Champion, World Champion from 2013 and European Champion from 2010 to 2016 was tested positively for the banned stimulants center of methylhexanamine.
Perkovic fought the scientific admission and was locked for six months.
The four widest throws this year go to the account of the great gold favourite.
LaShawk Merritt (200, 400, 4x400-m-Staffel/USA): The Beijing Olympic champion and two-time world champion over 400 m, was tested positively in 2010 and locked for 21 months.
A tool for penis enlargement had been responsible, but Merritt was indicted.
This year, the 30-year-old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 metres.
Ivan Tichon (Hammerwurf, Belarus): hardly any athlete has been recognisable for so many medals.
Tichon lost his 2005 WM title nine years later, after being diagnosed with testosterone doping.
The now 40-year-old also had to give up Olympia-Silber 2004 due to steroid dopings and the EM title 2006 due to testosterone abuses.
He returned the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games to the International Sports Court on the basis of a ruling by the International Sports Court.
At 80.04 m he is ranked two of the world rankings.
Liu Hong (20 km to go, China): World Recorder and Gold Favoritin were only tested positively in May, but is still allowed to start in Rio.
At the 29-year-old World Champions, evidence of taking a prohibited food supplement was found, the locket of the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA fell out mildly and ran off on July 13.
Bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Several dead
The Austrian Embassy in Thailand was in contact with the woman, said the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Thomas Schnöll, Friday morning.
She suffered cuts and had been treated in the hospital, but she could have already left.
She planned her home trip for the beginning of September.
Whether the other explosions on the island of Phuket as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon are also affected by Austrian citizens is still unclear.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities, says Schnöll.
Hua Hin, located about 200 kilometers south of the capital Bangkok, was first exploded two bombs in a single out district on Thursday evening.
According to police, a Thai country was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three German, three Dutch and three Italians.
On Friday morning two sets of explosives went up again, and another human being was killed, according to the authorities.
Phuket also reported a bomb explosion in the early days.
A taxi driver was injured when detonating near Patong’s popular beach, which is popular with holidaymakers.
In Surat Thani, on the south-east coast of the country, another bomb exploded, killing an urban employee.
According to the authorities, the explosive rate went to air in a flower beet in front of the coastal police district.
Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the southwest coast as well as in Chumphon on the southeast coast called for several casualties.
One goes from a connection to the explosions in Hua Hin, it was called.
“The bomb attacks carry the same handwriting,” said Army general Danai Kritmethavee Friday morning before journalists.
“We assume that this is a coordinated attack,
It's too early to talk about possible motives - but probably it's about the actions of Muslim rebels.
Thai media also wanted to see a pattern typical of the bomb attacks of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
The Thai police, on the other hand, explained that the assassinations were not related to the Islamist uprising movement or to international terrorism.
“This is only local sabotage, which is limited to limited areas and provinces,” said a spokesman in Bangkok.
Instead, it was assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military junta.
In recent days, the authorities have been informed about the exact date and places of the attack in the south of the country.
It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.
The police instructed their officials throughout the country to strengthen security around important government buildings, as well as airports, railway stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.
In Thailand there are still smaller bomb attacks, but they usually do not target tourists.
In Hua Hin is a palace used over the years by Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
Following the recent bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, on its homepage, strongly recommends following the instructions of the Thai security authorities.
High security risk (security level 3) applied to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as to Preah Vihear and the surrounding areas.
After disputes between security forces and Muslim populations, no necessary travel to these provinces is discouraged.
Increased security risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drawn up by the military junta.
This also has great influence for the military in the coming years.
Junta chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to establish chaos while the country moved towards stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism.
The military-unta, who had taken power after a period of bloody unrest in 2014, holds itself well to have led the Kingdom back to stability and order.
However, the military has also failed to cope with the insurrection of Muslim rebels in the far south of the country for years.
More than 6,500 people were killed in the conflict.
Almost a year ago, 20 people had also been killed in Bangkok in an attack on a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists.
It was the bloodiest attack of the country's recent history.
The right-wing \"Identitarian Movement\" has become the visa of the Federal Constitutional Protection Office.
After several national offices, the constitutional guardians in the federal government also placed the group under observation.
“We see points of reference in the ‘Identitarian Movement’ for aspirations against the fundamental free democratic order,” said Constitutional Protector Hans-Georg Maaßen of the Deutsche Presse-Agentur in Berlin.
In this way, immigrants of Islamic faith or of the Middle East are differentiated in an extremist way.
That's why we're watching the movement.
The \"Identitarian Movement\" is a group of French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012.
It opposes \"multi-culti-wahn\" \"uncontrolled mass immigration\" and \"the loss of one's own identity through alienation\"
Constitutional protectors in nine states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hessen, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - already observe the \"identitarians\".
Maaßen said that his authority had agreed closely with the State offices in the decision.
“Groups such as the ‘Identitarian Movement’ try to pick up their target group where it stands,” said the Chief of Constitutional Protection.
In general, extremists try to address them with youthful language, often with poppy music.
The Islamist, as well as right-wing extremists, did this.
That's not a benevolent advertisement for one's own thing.
Propaganda is supposed to appeal to people emotionally.
Young people are particularly susceptible to this.
That's dangerous.
Last but not least, there have been reports from several federal states on contacts between the \"Identitarians\" and AfD politicians.
Maaßen said he had no knowledge of it.
For the protection of the Constitution, possible contacts of this kind were only relevant from a certain point of view.
It should be noted that the respective party - in this case the AfD - is changed by certain people who are extremists, their goal and thus become extremists.
Therefore, whether such persons have taxing influence on the party is decisive.
This is not obvious.
In view of the significant increase in legal-motivated crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee accommodation, Maaßen said he would not speak of new right-wing terrorism in this context.
But in recent years we have found that there can be legal terrorist structures.
There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freital group.
It may be obvious that other legal terrorist groups or microgroups are planning attacks against asylum seekers, refugee homes or attacks from other right-wing extremist motives.
However, a German-wide or Europe-wide control of legal terrorism would not be discernible.
The previous groups were created at the regional level or on social networks.
Maaßen expressed his concern that many attacks on the account of people who had not previously appeared in the right scene.
That's the alarming one.
Many of the suspects in the case of attacks on asylum accommodation had not previously been known as criminal, politically motivated criminals or supporters of the right scene.
“Many people have thus committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right-wing extremists who may have been politically indifferent or have chosen CDU, SPD or Left, which have then radicalized themselves through right-wing extremist mood movements,
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte becomes Internet hot
The Olympics or world records do not always determine the headlines at the Olympic Games.
This shows the courageous performance of Robel Kiros Habite during the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.
At the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmers from Ethiopia swam so slowly that he was temporarily no longer seen in the TV images.
It simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut was selected.
In the social networks, Habte became a viral Internet hit.
In fact, the 24-year-old ended up with a 48-second reserve and took 59th place from 59 starters.
But it was rather his not particularly sporting figure that attracted the attention of the international media.
Why the 24-year-old still participates in the Olympic Games?
The Ethiopian got a special starting right from the international swimming club.
This is distributed to make swimming more popular in under-represented countries.
Since most athletes are running in Ethopia, Habte simply wanted to do something else.
Preparation is all: Robel Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.
Quickly the first nicknames made the round.
Some media described him as the \"robel of the whale\"
The English Boulevard Journal, The Sun, with \"Dad Bod\", made fun of him in response to a \"Wohlstandsbauch\".
His time, he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter freestyle, played no role.
Comparisons with \"Eric the Eel\" were also drawn.
At the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Eric Moussambani's performance provided media attention.
The appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea was unforgettable, when he had to go on his own in a course of 100 metres of freestyle.
It was then that Moussambani was fired in French.
The 22-year-old learned to swim only eight months before Olympia and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.

Geretsried - The owner of a store at the New Place has been ordered.
According to the police, the 67-year-old Geretsrider had left her business on Monday at 5.30 p.m. and had forgotten to close a window on the ground floor.
When she returned the next morning at 8.15 p.m., around 250 euros had disappeared from the cash desk.

Trump does not see the threatening electoral defeat so narrowly
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a campaign event in Florida.
If there's nothing to do with the US President's election, Donald Trump already has an alternative idea.
He's going on vacation.
If Donald Trump lost the U.S. presidential elections in November, it would be relatively important to him: “At last it will either work, or I have a very, very nice, long vacation, the candidate of Republicans said in a telephone interview with the U.S. television station CNBC.
If it was not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness, it would be fine, said Trump.
He named the U.S. President Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, as founder of the Islamic State Terror militia (IS).
More and more resistance was formed within his party.
Post increases in trade with electric transporters
An electric extra vehicle of the German Post in action.
The interest of other companies in the company is apparently great.
The post plans to sell their electric vehicle StreetScooter as well.
In a short time, the Group intends to start trading with the carrier.
The post wants to offer its electric transporters from next year also on the free car market.
“We want to get into the sale to third parties,” said a mail spokesperson on Friday.
The company has been testing for months whether it will sell its self-developed StreetScooter, with which letters and packages are delivered, also to other companies.
Post-President Jürgen Gerdes had said that there were always demands, for example from craftsmen.
According to information from the news magazine \"Der Spiegel\" the Bonner Group will soon take part in the mass production of the vehicles.
In post-owned manufacturing, the company plans the construction of up to 10,000 cars per year and shift.
Gerdes had announced that the Group would like to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and, in the long term, make a complete shift to environmentally friendly vehicles.
“We’re going to take a very, very robust step towards 2020,” he said at the end of July.
I can imagine that we're changing the entire fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active on Germany's roads since 2014.
GfK leadership comes after disappointing business figures
The consumer research company GfK exchanges his boss Matthias Hartmann.
The resignations came suddenly - but not surprisingly.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK made it clear that the chair of CEO Matthias Hartmann is becoming all the more uncertain, the longer the success he promises will remain.
Turbulence at the head of the Nürnberg market research company GfK: After again disappointing business figures and the resignation of corporate governance, the worldwide number five of the industry is ahead of a new person.
At the end of the year, GfK CEO will leave the company.
The Chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board Arno Mahlert will leave the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September.
As of 1 September, the management of the board took over the previous board member Gerhard Hausruckinger, the company told him.
He should officially take over the function of a \"voting speaker\" until a successor for Hartmann was found.
As a reason for the withdrawals, the company called \"different views\" on long-term business policy orientation.
Details didn't want to be mentioned by a company spokesperson on Friday.
Those who will lead the market research company in the future are still unclear.
In investor circles it was called on Friday that the shareholders were most disappointed about the remaining outstanding achievements of the restructuring initiated years ago.
Mr. Hartmann has been at the GfK peak since 2011.
“The results of the restructuring can not be seen even after 5 years,” it said.
Given the last bad GFK business figures, each shareholder will eventually become restless.
“If this were the case with BMW, the quandts would do that too,” it said.
The company had not been able to stop its losses even in the second quarter of 2016.
At 361.2 million euros, revenue was 6.1 percent below the level of the comparable previous year's quarter.
With regard to the first half of the year, sales decreased by 3.4 percent by 721.2 million euros.
In the second quarter, the company's profits were mainly burdened by the fall in its value in the face of its difficult economic situation.
The company value depreciation of 139 million euros in the Consumer Experience business unit paid the Group a loss of 148.2 million euros under the line.
In the second quarter of 2015, the GfK had generated a group profit of 19.7 million.
Accidents - Bus slips into pits in crumbs: Eight injured
Eight people were injured in a bus accident involving 43 senior passengers in Krummhorn (Aurich County) on Thursday.
Two inmates suffered serious injuries, and the police told him.
The 66-year-old driver of the bus of a traveler from Eisenach had to deviate from the information given by an incoming truck, which was partly on the counter-road.
The bus came to the right of the street and slipped into a grave, as a police spokesman Aurich/Wittmund reported.
\"Because of the location of the bus, the people couldn't leave the bus on their own, she said.
The firefighter released the inmates.
Six rescue cars and a emergency car came to the accident site on Landesstraße 2.
The uninjured travelers were brought back by a line bus to the Pewsum district of Crummhorn.
There they should wait for a replacement bus from the travel company.
The investigators invited the trucker and possible witnesses to report to the police.
The fees per cubic metre of waste water from 1 October 2016 for the wastewater plant Neudorf/Reuth/Welchenkahl 3,44 instead of EUR 2,10; for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp 3,36 Euro (up from 2,26 Euro) and for Azendorf 3,64 Euro (up from 2,18 Euro).
At the plant in Azendorf, the wastewater fee will increase again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are needed.
After a superfluous calculation, the wastewater price in Azendorf will then be at 4.37 Euros per cubic metre.
According to Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU), the Landratamt Kulmbach found that undercovers were available for these wastewater plants when the budget was approved.
The market for Kasendorf was obliged, on the basis of legal grounds, to operate the facilities cost-effectively.
As of 1 October 2016, the citizens as well as the commercial and industrial companies from Welchenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to take a deeper look at the money bags.
The fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.
As Director Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the board, a recalculation of the fees was necessary for the wastewater systems of the market community.
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- and under-covers from the previous calculation period were also balanced.
The gravitating increase in fees was due to Schmidt's fact that all three wastewater systems were relatively small facilities with a very small wastewater attack ranging from 6800 to 12,000 cubic meters per year.
For example, the low distribution base would have a serious effect on expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros.
In addition, wastewater emissions in all three plants were slightly decreasing.
Furthermore, during the previous calculation period, not least in all three plants due to their age of remedial and repair expenses, they were significantly affected.
The plant in Azendorf was almost 30 years old, the plants for Welchenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp for almost 20 years.
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced in the Azendorf wastewater plant due to damage.
The almost 20-year-old conveyors had to be picked up from the ground and at the Lopp pond clearance plant, after almost 20 years of operation, the first clearing pond had to be excavated, the sewage sludge disposed of and an additional ventilation possibility built to comply with the water law requirements in the future.
Schmidt: \"These extraordinary expenses included the continued care and maintenance costs to be taken into account in the new calculation period,
The same applies to electricity costs, which were significantly below the current level during the previous calculation in 2011/2012.
Steinhäuser made it clear that in the case of the small wastewater attack in the three plants, the costs for operation and maintenance are \"fully spent\"
Schmidt added that the market community has been spared from large entertainment costs for wastewater plants over the past 20 years.
According to Steinhäuser, the situation for these plants will continue to remain precarious in the long term, especially since these plants cannot be expanded by the wastewater-use zone of Friesenbachtal because they are deficit-related facilities.
Bulgaria for the first time in 8 months of inflation
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% on a monthly basis in July.
This is the highest value (since June 2012) and the first above zero since October last year, when positive 0.2% were reported.
The average annual inflation of the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was measured according to the CPI -0.8 %.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation in July 2016 was -0.2%.
In July 2016 a price increase of the following groups of consumer goods was observed compared to the previous month: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); leisure and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); various goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and shoes (2.2%); furniture, household appliances and routine maintenance (0.5%); health (0.1%).
Prices remained unchanged, as in the previous month, for alcoholic beverages and tobacco; apartments, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communications; and education.
Snapchat Anime Effect criticized as Asian cartoon
Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races.
With its filter tool, Snapchat allows around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that is already adjacent to the Absurde.
You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that might be paintings from a Roy Lichtenstein.
The filters are unblemished, feature-responsive tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All misdeeds come to the public.
Snapchat filters have criticized themselves in the past, in which they were accused that the Blackface app would promote promoting or white skin as beauty ideal.
This week, when some users suggested a filter that gave them flash eyes, false teeth, and upturned cheeks, some critics called it a racist cartoon by Asians - \"Yellow face\"
They wondered if this repeated controversy pointed to a greater problem that the company has diversity.
The news and the outrage were spread widely on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat announced that it had deactivated the feature.
The company offered an apology: The filter was intended as a tribute to anime characters and not as a cartoon by Asians.
But outsiders who have experienced Rassissmus remembered the filter to hurt clichés.
Others decided to reject the Anime comparison.
In an e-mail, Grace Sapapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweets were widely spread over the photos, wrote that the filter was “injurious and thin, ”
She added that “it’s difficult to argue with the comparison of a very hostile Asian caricature and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow-looking, but that the yellow face has been pulled into the depreciating extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company crossing this cultural steel wire.
American culture seems to be engaged in an endless diversity and integration struggle, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all keep in hand.
And Snapchat's large audience of young people - who are more diverse in terms of race than their older counterparts - might rather assume to expect sensitivity.
If one of Snapchat's filters creates an image that is insulting to a user, “so it is much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed than they used to be,” said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account, calling on others to do the same.
In an essay for medium and in a telephone interview, she said that they believe that racial-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in the recruitment practices of Snapchat.
Zhu criticized the largely white, only male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
“They either have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so they can make such decisions,” said the Chinese-American Zhu, “or they have people with other skin colors who work there but are not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable to say something about it.
Others share their opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has largely left unresponsive.
The company does not publish any figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his employees, but according to a spokesperson, the company recently hired a staff member focusing on underrepresented populations and on internal integration efforts.
Zhu told her to close her Snapchat account and added, \"I'm wondering if she needs more users like us to be able to say that is not O.K.\"
Military leadership falsifies ISIS intelligence information, establishes Congress Committee
Military members of the United States Central Command changed news service information to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than would have allowed the actual conditions on the ground, a congress investigation committee reported in a report on Thursday.
The preliminary report, created by a Task Force of the Republican Members of the Armed Forces Committee, Secret Service Committee and the Wehrbudget Committee, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments to the American efforts in fighting the Islamic State.
The Central Command, in short, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
“News service information, which was typically picked up by high-ranking Centcomers, regularly drew a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism than would have allowed the actual conditions on the ground and were consistently more positive than other news services analyses,” quoted a newspaper article as citing the report.
\"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders - Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives, stated.
The leadership errors in the Centcom range to the top of the organization.
The 10-page report shows in detail persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi armed forces.
Although there is no direct indication that government leaders under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts saw themselves exposed to pressure from their pre-laws to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
\"During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before the congress were significantly more positive than the facts, the report noted.
For example, a Centcom member publicly announced that a military recapture of Mossul could begin in April or May 2015.
Mossul, the second largest city of Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
“After months of investigations, so much is clear,” said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in an opinion.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the Heads of the Central Command changed the news service reports to downplay the danger posed by ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans called the Task Force into life after being told that analysts were worried about manipulating reports to the Islamic State.
The report published on Thursday will be completed with more detailed findings as the investigations continue.
In addition, further investigations of the Centcom reports are underway by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Defense.
On Thursday, Democratic members of the News Service Committee published their own findings, which were consistent with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
“In 2014 and 2015, the Centcom created an excessively limited process for the preparation of news service assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services,” announced an opinion of the highest-ranking Democrat in the Committee, member of the Adam B. Schiff House of Representatives.
This process, says Mr. Schiff, \"repeated the publication of news service reports - damaged the morale among analysts and gave excessively little room for disparate opinions\"
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats indicated that there was no evidence of any White House intervention among the Centcom analysts regarding a \"determined political opinion\".
The preliminary results of the conference's investigations were published on Tuesday by \"The Daily Beast\".
Last August, the New York Times reported of investigations by the Pentagon General Inspector, which were recorded after complaints by Centcom analysts.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a press spokesman for the Pentagon, stated in an opinion that the Ministry of Defense would not comment reports of Congress, while the General Inspector's investigations were still under way.
But he also stated that “experts sometimes have very divergent opinions about the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence,
The investigations have an impact on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).
However, the accusations of last year raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
The criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State reminds us of the doubts of more than ten years ago when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a piece about how the then government under George W. Bush faced the recommendations of many analysts for only a small crew force in Iraq and spent little time thinking about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting of the Islamic State.
Last year, the team around Mr. Hooker stated that contrary to the government's statements, air raids against the refineries held by the Islamic State did not have a significant impact on the terrorist group's financial situation, as these provisional refineries had been operating to sell oil on the black market.
However, this knowledge was not published, reported the Times in September.
Centcom's former commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature for his overly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at the Central Command.
The USA won fourth match in the women's field hockey, a showdown with the UK is ahead
One day after she had shot three goals over Japan during a 6-1 victory, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3-0.
Five goals in two games should actually be a memorable achievement, but Bam (27) said she could not remember ever having done that.
“I have no idea,” she said.
I don't belong to the people who keep their doors in mind.
However, she knows this: The American women are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are equally in their group with the British women in the first place, who remain unbeatable against Japan after their 2-0 victory.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter finals, the game will decide which of the two within their group will win the first and second place in each of six teams.
The first-placed will leave the strong Dutch for a little longer from the path leading the other group.
As always the game may go out on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising whirlwind through their success story, four years after they landed at the last of 12 places in the last London Games.
Bam was part of this team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and for the first time with three years she had a hockey striker in her hands (her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), at the age of 16, she became a national player of the United States, the youngest in the history of the team.
She missed the Olympics in 2008 because she could not qualify for the framework.
Then came the year 2012, in which everything went wrong for her and her team.
In the following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, coach of the national team, began to turn things over to the better.
“A cultural change, a mental change and a physical change,” said Bam.
We didn't have the workpensum in London that we have now.
We've been able to pull the rudder around completely.
On Thursday evening, Bam opened the Torreigen in the first half of the game with a backhand stroke from the nearby area.
India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament, but the team showed itself surprisingly tender and held the level from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into her hands.
She performed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then pulled the ball into the middle and grabbed the goal to give the American women a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.
The Shutout was the first of the entire tournaments for the U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who had to book a goal in each of the previous games.
She's running.
Like tree.
“We are in a good position,” said Parnham, but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday.
In the midst of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of Trampolines
Wherever you are, as late as it is, it is the Olympic Games.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inexhaustible, a fast-paced race between competition and striving.
It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which is extended from the armbrush shooter to the swimmer to the triathlete.
You cannot turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor in the queue at the coffee shop without listening to Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is at the Olympic Games for the first time and who is a women's swarm with grubs, could well have been among these well-known names sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and well-being TV advertising, if he were a swimmer, Turner or even a fighter.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in the Olympic trampoline tournaments.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event the same.
Further from the centre, partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally recognized: air gun shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We will always have the breast swim and may rule for a long time.
But if I should modestly make arguments for my particular lover, then let me turn my attention to the discrete charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it has been so sparsely perceived for the last 16 years that many who I had questioned did not know that it is an Olympic sport at all.
This could also be regional ignorance.
Although the United States sent athletes to compete, it has never won a medal in trampoline jumping and by 2012 had an athlete who made it until the final round.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
The trampoline jumping has a certain outer side charm, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unexplained ear for a clown school than for the Olympics.
At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an earth-bound enthusiast.
It has humorous potential - the cartoon-like tremor of its never-ending impact - but also the grace of the tournament and diving, the two sports that essentially unite it.
The word “trampoline” comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as “spring board”
Struggle winners jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and have a series of falling movements (drying, hedges and saltos) before landing on their feet.
According to the official Olympic programme, they are assessed according to performance, difficulty and flight time.
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will oppose each other in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight.
Medal hopes must go on in their pursuit of gold, faster, up and over, sometimes to the goal, sometimes back and forth, up and down on the playground.
They not only hunt the target line or the starting wall, but also another houndish goal in television transmission: that of the world or the Olympic record.
The goal-oriented pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatical - and it is enough to touch even a viewer to tears.
But it is also what I feel to be a bit tiring when watching these games.
The trampoline offers a breath rate.
The vector of the trampoline jumper is up.
A forward movement is not the goal.
He or she jumps off, seemingly heavy like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up.
Here too there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no waves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.
It is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be.
The women's qualification and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon, in the streaming at 13.00 Eastern time; that of men on Saturday, also at 13.00.
NBC will broadcast the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days starting at 14.00.
In the midst of the Olympian mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in general tumult.
If the increase in awareness can only be achieved by offering and objectifying male athletes - as the male US-Turner recently suggested, according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley expects his new fan community to turn to air.
“A Generation Protests — In Ethiopia, Long An Ally of the USA
Violent Protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators calling for political changes in Ethiopia were fighting for violent resistance from the government.
Witnesses say that tens of protesters were killed during the clashes with the police in gunpowder.
Is Ethiopia breaking up right now?
In the last ten years it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.
But in recent months, protests against the government have shaken the country and spread to more and more areas.
Last week thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.
According to human rights organizations, the government’s response was unmerciful.
Witnesses reported that policemen shot and killed on twenty unarmed demonstrators.
In circulation, videos about the protests that are likely from the last or the beginning of this year show how security people beat young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a handstand against a wall.
The head of the UN Human Rights Authority now demands an in-depth investigation.
“It has always been difficult to hold this country together and it will become even more difficult in the future,” said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is estimated by the West.
American military and secret services are working closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats beyond the region, especially in Somalia. Only a few countries in Africa, if any, receive so much Western assistance.
Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.
Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.
The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia was all other than a model of democracy - human rights organizations have continually led to the oppression of the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted, effectively silenced by dissidents.
Many were sent to exile or prison, killed or driven to the desert.
But that could change.
“If you suppress people and have no other options except to protest, it will break out,” said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopia.
The whole youth is protesting.
A generation protests.
There are numerous complaints that cover everything from use of soil to seizure in terms of power of the ruling coalition.
After a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions rise along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this delicate, controversial line claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogade National Liberation Front, who have been more or less constrained in recent years, will be able to exploit and rearm turbulence.
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness explode after years of aching under the surface.
The first seems harmless: smartphones.
Only in recent years have many Ethiopians been able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more and more popular and Internet services have improved.
Even if the government locks access to Facebook and Twitter, which they do at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they stop.
Several young Ethiopians indicated that they had gathered to protest.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
Since Eons, the Amharas, who come from Ethopia's predominantly Christian highlands, have prospered in politics and economy while exploiting the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in flatland areas.
But that's also changing right now.
“We are in the process of coordinating under a screen,” said Mulatus Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The biggest protests took place in Amhara and Oromos areas.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group who account for about 6% of the population and who are dominant in the military, secret services, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was the prime minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until his death from an unpublished disease in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think of corners.
Analysts say that he was particularly captivated to perceive early signs of dissatisfaction and use Special Representative to deal with opponents and make them harmless.
\"The current regime lacks this basic ability,\" said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively opaque reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.
Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of security services controlled by the Tigray.
Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such a riot in 2005, after thousands protested against elections, which, according to analysts, were apparently spoiled by the government and then stolen.
During the ensuing races, many protesters were killed, even though they were less than in recent months, and this time of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and for their measurable progress in combating poverty.
But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the internal disfavor of the Ethiopian government.
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month protesters in Gondar, an Amharic city, attacked businesses run by Tigray, and hatred of the Tigray is becoming more and more common in social media.
Analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a unique position.
The U.S. government used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighbouring Somalia, even though it recently announced that it closed this base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse into a already volatile area.

Donald Trump explains his claim Obama founded ISIS was “Sarcism”
Donald J. Trump tried to break the last controversy on Friday that surrounds his campaign by stating that his repeated assertion that President Obama and Hillary Clinton would not have been seriously meant by the “founder” of the Islamic State terrorist group.
This clarification raised new questions about the communication capabilities of the Republican presidential candidate, whether he was able to communicate clearly and in an understandable way with the American public.
It also brings to his fellow contenders, who strive to protect him during an eventful phase, into the peculiar position of having to explain statements which he could not have meant at all.
After he had made the announcement at an election campaign event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump rowed back on the allegation on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to indicate that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
But in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic.
The tweet was the opposite of the previous day on which Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews that he meant the accusation perfectly serious.
When conservative radio moderator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know anything about it.
The last storm of criticism is prazzling down on Mr. Trump, while he has tried to direct the focus of his campaign to the economic situation because of falling poll values.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday Mr. Trump tried to return to this issue.
Reporting on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he had found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already brought Sarkasm to his defense.
At the end of July, he drew strong criticism when he said that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he stated, \"Of course, I meant that sarcastical\"
This method allows Mr. Trump to shift the linguistic boundaries in politics and then to row back as needed.
“I think it’s one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans, how they arrive, and then, if necessary, to “explain, depending on how the reaction happens.” Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates.
But I also think he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.
Instead of defying the tone for presidential elections, Mr. Trump has adopted an even deeper tone, as his polling values have continued to decline.
A new survey by NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Friday, showed a guided tour of the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally tries not to apologize for his provoked statements, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humor.
But as he has increased the focus of attention in the last few months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's shearers have brought his loyal associates into the uncomfortable situation of having to stand with him, no matter how prone his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent spokesmen, made great efforts today to defend the candidates in a Thursday CNN interview.
“I think what he says is legitimate political comments,” said Mr. Giuliani, so he was questioned about the correctness of Mr. Trump’s statements as to whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
In this sense it is true that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called it back-banders, completely wrong and therefore it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as foreign minister, allowed ISIS to spread by preventing it from aggressively controlling the situation in the Middle East.
Before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and told them to ride around on each of his words and take action against him.
He pampered the \"poor, pitiful\" television experts trying to understand him and said, \"You can't do it.\"
Some of the Democrats mocked Mr. Trump's apologies as just another proof that he was inappropriate for the presidential office.
Once pushed over the price from the market, café comes back in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shabby café in Williamsburg, where one could only pay cash that had no Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the prices from its Bedford Avenue Ladenfront have been pushed down.
The shop Soap Cherie, which replaced the verb in summer 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
The locals mourned it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, “I know New York is changing, but I still can’t believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is excluded and Verb is now a soap business,
But if New York is changing, then it's also new invention.
A reviving verb cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same employees and a similar simple atmosphere.
Coffee is still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the old café, the owner and managing director of the new café.
He started working with Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When a customer offered him money for a new office, he was excited to do so, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot.
Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment too.
It introduced new ingredients.
On the menu are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnishes such as capers and sautéed onions.
There are natural travel bowls.
The café no longer serves beer, there are fresh juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez said that he had noticed a steady stream of old tribal customers.
“Many old customers were also driven by prices from Williamsburg,” he said.
Recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she would take her way.
After the verb had closed, she gave up drinking coffee for a while, she said.
“It became clear to me that it was on the coffee and culture in the verb that I liked,” she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, even if she ordered a blended Chai Tea instead of her usual Iced Coffee that day, which is another new addition.
Tom Rosenthal has been another long-standing and faithful customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003.
He went there before work and inevitably always ordered the same thing.
“I came in quarter after seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch and they’re preparing my everything bag with butter,” he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu.
Nowadays Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he changes his everything bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said that he didn't think that the soap business had taken the old business space.
In fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for verb with the cold brewed coffee of the café as an ingredient.
“I think we’ll go on her offer,” Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish citizens of Greenpoints also accepted the café.
A new customer translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said he intended to expose them soon so that his new neighbors would feel welcome.
The location also has further advantages.
A local juice shop wants to fill and sell the cold brewed coffee in the bottles.
There is a chance that the café expands to a neighboring building.
A new verb is enough for many customers to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a tribal scientist and said he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed.
When the new café opened, Whitt said that entering the locals and ordering a new coffee felt like a homecoming.
“I had to smell that,” he said.
The depressing food of the economic crisis in “a rich meal”
In March 1933, shortly after his ascent as president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.
As a fine taster, President Roosevelt had a faible for refined delicacys of Fifth Avenue such as Pâte de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup.
His menu on this day was a little more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, potato purée and as dessert a plum pudding.
“It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people,” said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, \"It was also a message to Americans about how to eat,
The couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coes' last book, \"Chop Suey\", was about Chinese cuisine in the USA, while Ziegelman, in her book \"97 Orchard\", tells about living in a home on the Lower East side from the food perspective.
Her latest collaboration, \"A decent meal\" which will be published on Tuesday in Harper's publisher, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, snorkelless snack in the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the market crash in 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces while Coe, 57, turkey with potato purée and vegetable mixture ate.
When the reporter ordered hackbraten, the couple found this suitable for a discussion about eating in the era of the Great Depression.
“Rerich foods were very popular,” Ziegelman said.
There was peanut bread, liver cheese and beans bread.
They were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap that would stretch the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinner.
Coe boundary.
“It must have been in the stomach like lead,” he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table in an American household, especially in rural areas, was an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Women's teams cooked for male field workers and it was served freshly baked paste for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the first world war. “A Square Meal” marks the way in which the country was no longer to be the slave country.
“It was a time when food became a central theme for the Americans, and Coe wanted to write about it with his wife.
The new budget diet was just as tense: mysterious foods such as bread and cash rolls became basic foods, the cash rolls as a “wonderful way to reuse food residues,” Ziegelman noted, since cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dry fruit.
Meat, which was the center of American cuisine for many years, became a rarely served luxury.
Unique mixtures were tried out, as a calorie-rich and nutritious satisfaction had priority over taste or even healthy cuisine understanding.
During her research for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from this era, baked onions with peanut butter.
“It wasn’t a popular addition at lunchtime,” says Coe.
Ziegelmann continues: \"It was surreal\"
Peanut butter and baked onions do not match each other.
It was typical of many of the household business recipes.
As never before or since, household economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - have driven the eating habits of the country.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become “housekeepers” and the challenge of turning pampe like creamy spaghetti into delicious meals.
“A Square Meal” is a festival of historic delicacies.
In particular, the reports on the Government's response to the hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's Lass-mich-Kuchen-Essen-Haltung, are tasty.
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farmhouse kitchen of his kitchen, he fed like the million-severe man of the world to whom he has become.
“He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce,” said Coe.
He ate in an almost golden dining room and wore a smoking.
He was wonderfully out of reality.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not asked him to state an example with his stomach.
As described in the book, hiring a housekeeper with no interest in tastes by Mrs. Roosevelt led to the White House producing the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most restless preparations,
Many of the species from the era of the Great Depression to deal with food were discarded as soon as the land came back to its feet.
The legacy lies on our continued focus on calories and food, Ziegelman said, as well as on how science has been applied to food.
The couple stated that when writing the book, they understood better the eating habits of Ziegelman’s mother - for example, how she could not discard food.
“She was really afraid of the waste of food,” said Coe.
Ziegelman remembered: “She actually made people sick.
There was the windbag incident.
After the plates were removed at Eisenberg's, she and Coe produced a dessert that they had prepared at home: the plumbing dessert that President Roosevelt ate at lunchtime.
“It is called Prune Whip,” said Ziegelman, adding that it was a common trick to miss humble recipes a sent name.
There was no beaten cream, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly dived a spoon into the tough brown glue.
Surprisingly, it didn't taste bad.
Come on. Come on. Come on, come on.
Like a Can-Do-Budge animal, he said to his wife, \"A few chopped walnuts would help\"
He was the hero of Aleppo. He was killed in a bomb attack.
He spent his own life playing to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar devoted his life to the people of Syria.
He risked everything to save others' lives.
Now the 30-year-old himself died in a face bomb attack by the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the White Helmets, a civil protection group, which, according to Bild-Zeitung, saved almost 60,000 lives.
2900 Volunteers are putting their own lives into play to attract people from bombed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone.
They are the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: a video of the civilian protector showing him around the world in a 11-hour rescue of a baby from the debris of a house.
It made the Syrian a shining symbol figure in the horror of war.
However, as a hero he never saw himself, according to the picture, \"This is the real jihad for me.\"
“If I die saving life, I think that God sees in me a martyr,
Shortly before Omar himself fell victim to an attack, he had spoken in a video about the last bomb attacks in Syria.
The helicopters dropped four barrel bombs over the Alzadia area, one filled with chlorine gas.
A woman and two children died, seven people suffer from respiratory distress.
“We now eliminate the toxic remains of the bomb, so that children don’t play with it, the picture quotes his last words before he dies.
The deadly bomb of the Assad regime was supposed to have hit terrorists.
Greenlandhai: The oldest vertebrates is almost 400 years old
Rare sight.
Greenland sharks usually come to the surface only in winter.
This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the Sanna research ship.
He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km/h through the North Atlantic - to this day.
Greenland sharks are only born at 150 years of age.
Usually the Greenlandhai swims along the bottom of the North Atlantic, and in one hour it averages about 1,220 metres.
Only when it comes to it, the five-metre-long animal accelerates to a depth of 2.6 km/h - and is half as fast as a robe at this maximum speed.
However, this lifestyle characterized by slowness seems to be a patent recipe for a high age.
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal Science, at least from a Greenlandhai, which may be 392 years old.
“Wassiness - Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock comments on this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates.
Although the evolution biologist had long suspected that Greenland sharks would be stoned.
Only the evidence was missing.
Greenland sharks are hard to observe, and they live mainly in the ice sea off the thinly populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures around six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in winter.
Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland sharks.
They measured their time-lapse rate when they equipped six animals with a transmitter in front of Sitzbergen.
However, prey makes these sharks: In the stomach of one animal, researchers found the remains of one robe, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.
Perhaps they hunt sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice sea and search for cadaver, which swirl down from higher layers of water.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues have now examined 28 Greenland sharks, which caught fishermen from Greenland or Spitsbergen as a bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic between 2010 and 2013.
The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest was 502 centimeters.
In order to determine the age of animals, they analyzed the lens nucleus of sharks using the carbon-14 method.
This centre of the eye lens is formed before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it are no longer renewed later.
The two smallest sharks had a striking amount of carbon-14 in the lens core.
Its birth should therefore be after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons tests poured more quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
On the other hand, the lens core contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons tests in the third-smallest animal length of 220 centimetres, so it should have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012.
On the other hand, all larger Greenland sharks have normal carbon-14 amounts in their lens core, resulting in cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon-14 clock for a 493 centimeter long Greenland shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502 centimetres should even be 392 years old.
That Greenlandhai female was only born when they are longer than four meters was known.
Now the researchers were able to assign the length to an age.
Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres was probably at the threshold of sexual maturity and was determined to be 156 years old, Greenland sharks can obviously be increased for at least one and a half centuries.
This is also expected to be world record for vertebrates.
It is no coincidence that such methusaleme lives mainly in icy waters.
Also the previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale, in whose speck on the neck had a 120-year-old harpoon tip, was captured in front of Alaska.
Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on arson flames.
So they mature later - and age more slowly.
In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals also often become particularly large.
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface through which the animal's heat is consumed.
The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much greater than with one gram of elephant.
Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.
“A smaller animal thus lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as early as possible,” explains the evolution biologist Scheuerlein.
A very large animal, on the other hand, should invest its resources in a long life.
Building ground in double pack
In the recent meeting, the Council has focused on the issues surrounding construction.
With ease, the board adopted the communication from Mayor Robert Putz that \"the marketing of the recently designated residential areas can begin,
After clarifying the land, parceling and opening questions and making requests for measurement, the sale of the land in the residential areas of Straßlweg- und-Schönau-West (Binderstraße-Exploration Section 1) to interested parties is no longer in the way.
The Municipal Council is convinced that the construction areas in the rurally shaped and quiet residential community of Schönau are addressing young families and well-equipped seniors alike.
As it was said, construction volunteers can immediately report to the town hall, the council is expected to advise in its September session on the award of the parcels.
In order to be able to respond also to requests for further business activities linked to job creation, the Council decided to amend the land use plan in sub-areas only created in spring of this year.
In the sub-timelarn area, the already designated commercial area is expanded by two parcels towards Staatsstraße 2112.
Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
The city of Main therefore has the best chances of attracting shifted jobs and firms from London in competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg.
“It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit the most from the Brexit vote,” says Michael Voigtländer, head of the field of competence of financial markets and real estate markets of the IW.
After the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether money houses can continue to operate from London’s financial operations across the EU.
To date, the so-called EU passport has been authorised in the United Kingdom.
That's what big US banks are using.
Several banks have already announced moving jobs.
The Lobby Association -Frankfurt Main Finance - expects 10,000 new jobs on the Main within five years.
For Frankfurt, according to the IW, the headquarters of the European Central Bank (ECB) combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the euro area’s largest banks, as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Supervisory Board EIOPA and the ESRB risk board.
Although the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has its head office in Paris, this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB.
“The proximity to the Notenbank is important for banks because they can communicate directly with the supervisory authority,” says IW Professor Voigtländer.
Although Luxembourg is home to a large fund industry, Dublin is also less likely to cut infrastructure.
Thanks to the large airport, Frankfurt was much easier to reach.
Furthermore, the city points with easily available commercial real estates.
“In Paris it’s not so easy to find free high-quality offices,” says Voigtländer.
Moreover, his rents for first-class commercial real estate were 50 percent higher than on Main.
Frankfurt also offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and less crime.
In a ranking of Mercer's company counselling, the city is in place seven, Luxembourg in place 19, Dublin in place 33 and Paris in 37th place.
Even though quality of life is a matter of preference: \"With its already strong position as a financial location for the European internal market, Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors, the IW follows.
London, however, will remain the most important financial centre in Europe despite Brexit vote, the economic researchers say.
The conditions of power also speak for this: In London, according to the figures of the Landesbank Helaba, some 144,000 people worked in the banking industry at the end of 2015, there were 62500 in Frankfurt.
Gilead receives legal costs from the Hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
A U.S. official decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to refund the legal costs arising from the Hepatites C lawsuit with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was exempted from a $200 million compensation payment for the violation of Merck's two patents, which were in connection with the blockbuster physicians Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead, after a U.S. judge discovered a pattern of misconduct by Merck, including the Meinid and other unethical acts.
On hearing the complaint on Thursday, U.S. official Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead has the right to issue the costs incurred during the defense of the case.
Merck is trying to align with Gilead, which dominates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck claimed each other's property for laboratory work, which was based on Sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead's medicines.
The US-supported troops say that they have regained full control of Manby from the Islamic State.
The US-supported troops have regained full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters left the city, said a spokesperson of the group on Friday.
The Democratic forces of Syria (DKS) are fighting through the city after the withdrawal of the remaining group of fighters who have buried inside the city.
They freed over 2,000 civilians who were held hostages by the fighters, told Sharfan Darwish of the Manbij Military Council Reuters, which had been allied with the DKS.
“The city is now under complete control, but we are just doing cleanup work,” he told Reuters.
Clintons earned 10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2% Federal tax
Hillary Clinton published its 2015 tax statement on Friday, which resulted in an income of USD 10.75 million for the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2%.
In 2015, Clinton's USD 1 million was spent on charity, mainly on the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton generated nearly USD 5.3 million in Red Honors; former Minister of Foreign Affairs announced an income of USD 3 million from the publisher Simon & Schuster for her book on her term of office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's candidate for the Vice-Presidentship, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, together with his wife Anne Holton, has published his tax statements for the last ten years.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
\"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards on financial transparency,\" announced Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri in an opinion.
In contrast, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and retreaters regarding his previous promises to publish his tax statements.
It is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations, although they are not required by law.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have stated a tax audit by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal.
\"They are on the train\" wrote Clinton's electoral assistant Ian Sams on Twitter, regarding the publication of the presidential candidate of the Democrats.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump's special advisor, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish anything before the tax audits were completed.
Trump's critics, including the Republican presidential candidate of 2012 Mitt Romney, have already reported that his refusal raises questions regarding assets, his donations to charitable organizations, his business gestures and various other connections, in particular to Russia.
Clinton has already fallen on the subject and published a video on the Internet on Friday, in which high ranking Republican Trump calls for his tax statement to be published.
On Thursday, she also addressed the subject during a speech on Michigan's economy.
\"He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done over the last decades and to publish his tax statements, she said to the crowd.
Politico has reported that during the 1990s, Trump paid no or only very little taxes, and an economic journalist from the New York Times cited on Friday a number of tax lawyers and tax advisers who stated that this could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign.
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that persons earning more than USD 1 million would pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During an election campaign for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska asked Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate is based here, to exchange Trump for a meeting to exchange their tax statements.
Buffett said that he had also been subjected to a tax audit of the IRS and Trump had \"anxiety\" before voters and not before the tax authorities.
Clinton's campaign has published tax returns until 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, on average paid an effective federal tax rate of about 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5%.
The 2015 Clintons tax statement showed that they only earned USD 100 of their income as wages, unlike most of the Americans.
Their main investment was a cost-effective index fund, from which the Clinton dividends and revenues of USD 109,000 taxed.

Condoms with chili powder, fireworks promote Tanzania's elephant protection
Naturalists in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to stop elephants from going into human-occupied settlements - they throw condoms on them filled with chili powder.
The method has proved effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had already had the idea years ago, has intensified its support together with U.S. nature conservation by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent four-step method to protect their homes and crops without harming animals.
Previously, many spears used to defend themselves.
Friday is a world elephant day dedicated to animal welfare.
“Since we developed the ... toolkit, we have been able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities, and they are much more confident that they can keep the elephants from their fields without harming the elephants,” said Honeyguide Damian Bell's managing director in a notice.
The first two steps include lighting the elephant with a torch and blowing into a horn.
If he is not scared, a so-called \"Chiliwolke\" is thrown.
Chili powder mixed with earth is packed together with a fireworks body into a condom, whose end is turned toward the ignition cord.
When it is lit, the condom rises with a bang and sprays fine dust on chili powder into the air.
A hint quite usually already out to chase the elephants.
One last possibility is a thrower who shoots a gold rainworks into the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
City Council decides unanimously: No kioskneubau am St. Goarer Rheinufer
Normally, St. Goar's investment projects are taken by the merchants with a kiss hand - but the retail trade in the core city is considered to be significantly expandable.
The request for the new construction of a sales kiosks at the Rheinufer in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine balcony, however, was rejected by the City Council.
\"In principle, we welcome new business drivers, but at this location in an exposed location at the Rheinufer this kiosks does not fit in - said Michael Hubrath for the CDU Group.
Jewish director smashes Berlin's hotel because Israeli pre-election after \"Arabic\" has been removed - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots set up a media riot after he had told us that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list any Israeli preference, since it had asked Arab guests, according to an employee, to \"
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentation \"Shoah\" left his anger in the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel's country preferences list.
However, the country was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and deleted?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinksi Bristol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via its own Call Center.
Looking for an explanation, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he received there \"shocked him\" as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel employee said that the measure was a \"a deliberate decision of the management of Kempinski Hotels\"
The reason behind it triggered even more anger in the director.
“The majority of our guests are Arabs and they demanded that the pre-election be deleted,” the employee was quoted by Lanzmann.
The Israeli ambassador in Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a \"great shame\" reports the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
We were devastated and devastated by this event.
That's really embarrassing.
The fact that this has been done in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even more embarrassing.
There is no need for an explanation.
We expect the hotel to “draw the right conclusions,” said the official.
The incident triggered a rather large response on the Internet, where people called it a scandal.
Some submitted to the Kempinski Hotel that it had \"remained\" the alleged requests of Arab guests.
“Be ashamed of you,” it said in another post, pointing out that the hotel, located at the noble Fürfürstendamm, is close to a synagogue.
The hotel quickly dismissed all charges and called the incident a \"accident\" and \"repudiate\" at Lanzmann, reports Der Spiegel.
“There has never been a direct instruction - not to include Israel in the quick election list - the Süddeutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesperson of Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the country preference has now been added.
Police use tear gas & rubber shots against protesting Brazilian students
On Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo, students joined the police when they gathered to protest the government's reforms for the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber shots against the demonstrators.
The difficulties began when police officers tried to drive the students apart, which led to the police using rubber shots and tear gas.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their concern about the plans.
According to the proposals of the governor of the state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, a little less than 100 public schools are closed, while 300,000 students are implemented to save money.
Some of the protesters were seen to spray graffiti against provisional President Michel Temer on walls.
The recent protests took place a few days after demonstrators went to the streets in masses to support the suspended president, Dilma Rousseff, who had been removed from office by a Senate vote for their appointment.
Trade between Russia & Iran suddenly rises to 71% - RT Business
According to the Russian ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagarian, the trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran increased by 70.9 percent each year.
Since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, the ambassador has shared a strong interest on the part of Russian companies in business in the country.
Russian companies establish existing links with Iran while new companies are ready to access the market.
Of course, further trade expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran, \" said Dzhagarian.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, trade sales between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $856 million.
In particular, Russian imports to Iran increased by 91.5 percent and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The trade upturn was achieved through supplies of machinery, land vehicles and weapons, the ambassador said.
For this year, Dzhagaryan is from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia.
Last year, the Russian foreign representative issued some 35,000 visas, primarily travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
Iran also reached the top 20 of the countries with regard to the number of tourists in Russia.
One could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia of last year, are broken, - he said.
At the same time, only relatively few Russians visit Iran, something that the ambassador hopes will change.
“I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, who have preserved monuments of ancient Persian civilization in a good condition,” he said.
Witnesses searched: Drinking market in Waldbröl
A robbery has been committed on Thursday evening on the beverage market of Rewe XXL on the Waldbröler Gerberstraße.
Subject to a firearm, three darkly dressed persons, who had mutilated their faces, demanded from the employee of the beverage market the issue of cash and then fled first by foot and then probably with a silver-colored VW golf.
How much money has been spent, the police won't share.
The perpetrators are supposed to have been between 1.60 and 1.70 meters tall, so they are relatively small.
The beverage market is directly accessible from the park deck of the Rewe market and is poorly accessible.
The perpetrators must have run towards Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg after the attack and have fled from the gravel parking lot opposite the park entrance with the silver car, possibly towards B 256 (Schlandernring).
Those who have made observations at the time of the incident (again from 7.45 p.m.) associated with the robbery should report urgently to the police.
Nagold: game and fun at summer leisure
Eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the social educational daygroup/social group work of the Nagold Children's Protection Federation with their caregivers on their summer break in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
In the quiet, leisure home Hardtwäldle, the happy group was quartered during the first week of school.
Several full day trips were on the program.
On the one hand, it went to boards with the visit of the petting zoo.
On the other hand, after Maulbron, where there was a special child guidance in the world-famous monastery.
The third trip led to Pforzheim.
At the Keltenmuseum in Hochdorf, the group learned much about the daily life and food of the Celts.
On the hot days, the group enjoyed the deep lake in Maulbron, which included jumping, swimming and planting.
Culinary children and caregivers were spoiled with their self-prepared body meals such as the Saurs Spätzle, the Pfänderle Seebronner, Iselshauser-Bloff, the English-Breakfast and Tübinger Bolognase.
In workshops, beautiful jewelry made of pearls and stones was created or made of wood a Roman mill game.
Further highlights of the leisure were fishing in a nearby pond, evenings at the fire and the final “bounty evening”
On the day of home travel, the sun smiled and the children and young people returned home contentedly.
Haigerloch: Pilgrims to the Gate of Mercy
The ministrants from the Eyachtal-Haigerloch S. Anna soul care unit were on their way on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.
Four steps were taken together.
In order to bridge the time until the next Romwall tour of all the mini-strands in expected two years, the St. Anna Oberministrande decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.
Various pilgrimage targets were examined and it was decided for the Bishops City of Freiburg, where a special pilgrimage goal was offered this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, with the instrument of mercy opened to it at the Freiburg Münster.
16 Minis of bitel-bronn, Gruol, Haiger-hole, and Holy-rooms made their way.
In the evening before, parish priest Storost sent out the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrim crosses and gave the pilgrims a blessing.
From Horb, a train was taken to the starting point of Villingen, where a Münster of Our Lady stands and the Pilgerweg was started by the Münster.
The individual daily tours were framed in the morning and evening by a brief impulse with various prayers, songs and scriptures.
But also on the way, the minis on field crosses, chapels or churches made a constant rush to sing together a song of their own composition of the Pilgrim song.
For the nights there were private homes of the local parishes.
At the stages, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty as well as strengthening dinner and breakfast.
On the second day, Furtwangen went on to Goedtenbach.
In the next day, the stage went to St. Peter, which was the most demanding route, but in the case of sweater heat, it was first necessary to go down about 500 metres and then climb again.
The earned reward was a common barbecue at the bathyard in the evening.
After the morning impulse on the fourth day of the pilgrimage in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter, the final stage went to Freiburg.
Visually facilitated and happy, the minis arrived at the Freiburg Münster in the afternoon and passed through the gate of mercy.
God was thanked here with a little impulse.
In the evening fair in Münster, the minis arrived at the pilgrimage destination were welcomed by Kooperator Markus Obert.
After the worship, the pilgrims were able to visit the shrines and the high altars.
The next day was still time for the Brisgaumetropole.
In the afternoon it went back to Horb by train.
In conclusion, all participants agreed that the days were marked by spirituality and a strong community experience.
Schotte Callum Skinner storms home when Brite gets Gold for cycling
Scotland's Callum Skinner rose to fame last night at the Velodrome in Rio, when the British team defended the title of London in 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took on the anchor role that his countryman Sir Chris Hoy had made himself his own. The boy's spun made the legend proud when he stormed home to take a victory from the favorites New Zealand.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic gold medals.
They repeated the trick after they won only a modest sixth place in March at the London World Railway Championships despite Hoys' resignation.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.
They did this in time as Hindes appeared.
Hoy's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
Skinner was the man they stayed with when they saw potential in the shot that has now unfolded.
Hindes, Kenny - who won four years ago with Hoy - and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualification rounds, but in the standard round the New Zealanders won in the first round.
And the British Trio won the duel with gold.
Hindes was barely back after his round, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner kept it.
A strategy change made up a large part of the transformation where Hinders went in a higher path to slow him down and allow Kenny and, above all, Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy looked out from his position as BBC expert and appeared to Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they rose to the podium.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said: \"It's a flattering comparison\"
I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set up an Olympic record in the final round and defeated the World Champions.
It was just incredible.
There's no better way to win this.
After the triumph of 2012 on the side of Kennys and Hoys, Hindes admitted that after a weak start he deliberately fell on the track.
He later withdrew this statement and there was no opposition from England's rivals.
With such a superior victory, there was no such problem this time.
Hindes said: \"It feels like the whole GB flags on the tribune like London,
We have come together as a team in the last three months.
We have gone so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which was won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and in London.
If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect to be successful five days in the Velodrome.
With Kenny's form, it is in the area of possibility that he repeats Hoy's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.
That would mean for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on 23 March (an apparently holy date for British sports; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were also born) - an yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.
That's what Hoy's got.
Kenny participates next in the sprint, which will start today and go for three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said: \"I only enjoy this for the moment\"
The team event is always best.
You can win it with your colleagues.
It feels a bit lonely to win alone.
Hindes said: \"If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight\"
It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometer race.
They arrived at the destination in 3:51,942.
The world record, which won in London Gold in 2012, was 3:51,659.
The first and final round (22.42) takes place today on the second day of the bet, where Wiggins will be safely focused.
He had fought yesterday with officers before the qualification when he called officials to measure his body size.
In the women's competition that continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in world record time in 4:13,260.
The GB team relies on its strong rail bike team to dominate the mid-period of the Olympic Games and to get a pair of medals.
After a truly exceptional representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were dropped.
Dramas were played in the background, according to the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April in the midst of sexism and mobbing threats, as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrome, it looks like the legendary call of GB, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated.
Future of the portland smeltering due to the suspension of the Energy Treaty
The future of the Portland aluminum melt in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workers’ jobs - is at stake, as the plant operator has announced the energy supply contract and will thereby abolish all supply contracts, as told by the supply company.
This step followed the decision of the Government in Victoria at the beginning of this year not to grant any further subsidies for the operation of the plant.
A subsidy for 20 years expires in November.
Up to 2000 jobs at Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.
No less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure.
In addition, domino effects could occur as the melting consumes about 10 percent of Victoria's total electricity generation.
In 2014 Alcoa closed the point Henry Schmelzerei, which led to a closure of the Anglesea Power Plant.
The melting of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks a closure.
This step follows the years of speculation regarding the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and lastly due to the electricity price for the plant.
AGL, who supplies the large aluminium smelting plant with his Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that it would assume that three more owners would terminate their contracts.
The facility is located in the majority ownership of a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.
‘AGL assumes that the plant is still operating in Portland, which means a further physical demand for electricity through the melting industry,’ the company informed.
AGL continued to state that the contracts were so-called \"safety operations\" that would have entered into force as of November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will end in 2017.
“AGL therefore assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenue in the financial year 17,” said the electricity supplier.
All potential impacts on revenue on AGL from the CJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong term markets for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL announced that it had already depreciated the value of the contracts in its annual conclusion of $187 million in the expected termination.
Alcoa said that the decision to book out the contracts, to operate the “ability of Alcoas... the smelting or to ensure the supply of electricity to the smelting industry, does not interfere.
The US company said that it concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which would have entered into force from November this year, even if it was still guilty of explaining why it resigned from the contract.
Analysts warn of the possible closure of Portland smeltering in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the poor economic conditions of the industry.
Regarding the statements of analysts at the beginning of the week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumes about 600 megawatts and Tomago around 900 megawatts of electricity annually.
Should both plants disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [power market].
And for us as a power generator, that wouldn't be good, he said.
More than just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September edition of the Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of Kardashian-Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted September edition of the US Vogue.
Kendall, who is brand ambassador to Estee Lauder and ran at Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
“In a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover made me cry,” Kendall wrote.
The cover's revelation followed a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians similar?), scripted reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (with the exception of the troubles Rob and Caitlyn and in the presence of the most popular showbiz uncles and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), as they forgot the cover of their sister and ended with a classic turn: they all planned a surprise party.
This represents the cliché-bearing action of almost every birthday episode of a child’s broadcast (Seacrest brought the phrase, “You thought we had forgotten you?), with the honesty of a cartoon rabbit on a broadcasting pitch at 8 o’clock in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity.
With regard to the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of Kardashians has certainly begun.
Kendall's big sister Kim likes to beat her about the Vogue-Cover (she and her husband Kanye West were there to see in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for themselves.
The September issue is the most sold issue of the year for Vogue.
With an extent that resembles a tape rather than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista were of the 832 pages of the Wälzer 615 pages of advertising).
The revelation of his cover star is so eagerly expected that in the last two years images of the magazine have been leaked even before the official announcement.
Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have clearly been more \"famous\" models than \"Models which are celebrities\" on the cover.
Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga had the honour.
But even at the low chance that Mrs Jenner, described by the magazine as the \"through-break model\" of her generation, falls under the previous category, she is in good company.
These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or young people of today who know how to play a good Snapchat video (even if everything is on Jenner).
They are truly talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the publication of Lemonade.
Of course, Jenner's success does not appeal to everyone.
With their reality TV story, Jenner's position in the fashion world was always a bit tense.
In June, the former Victoria's secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague, Gigi Hadid, criticized and called her \"the mists of the moment\"
These feelings cooked up again when the message came out with Jenner's appearance on the Vogue Cover.
But on the way around, it seems to pass by the point.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vogue.
It is in the truest sense of the word a supermodel.
She's running for Marc Jacobs.
It advertises your founding of Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective Paywall apps.
She sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, she can be seen on reality TV. Probably only to see her sister Kourtney and her children.
Municipal law centres annually reject 160,000 people
More than 160,000 of the country's most needy aid are rejected annually by the municipal law centres, while the industry focuses on the effects of further budget cuts on already overloaded transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five persons - mostly older persons, immigrants, needy workers, victims of violence, and those who do not have funds for unjust delogs and the like - are already denied free legal advice and legal assistance when applying for assistance.
Legal services of the municipality, which are already excessively taxed, are ready for further cuts.
As of June next year, these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds.
The Director of the Community Law Centres of Queesland James Farrell said that the last survey of the National Association of Municipal Rights Centres revealed that thousands of people have already been rejected each year.
Farrell said that the situation would only worsen if the federal government decided.
“Queensland’s community law centers are chronically underfunded, which means that thousands of people from important services you need are rejected,” he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with insurmountable and oppressive debts, families who go through separations, workers who have been unjustly released - all these people have problems of a legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot receive the help they need.
The Federal Government will cut the funds by 30 percent from June 2017, which means that thousands of more needy people from Queensland will be forced to deal with their legal problems without any assistance.
We call on the Federal Attorney General and Minister of Justice and Queensland Senators George Brandis to immediately remove these cuts, so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems.
Last year, the State Government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of the municipal law centres and their customer communities and that the government invests Palaszczuk in this important work.
Donald Trump filed election campaign after employees alleged to have pulled weapons
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was accused of alleged inactivity after she was informed that her campaign leader for North Carolina had directed a gun to an employee in February while they were on a jeep in February.
The incident is described in an indictment filed by Vincent Bordini on Wednesday in Charlotte State Court, a former software programmer for the campaign in that state.
Bordini stated that he had waited for months for the matter to be regulated internally before realizing that - that would not happen -
The campaign leader, Earl Philip, - pulled a gun, put his right index finger on the detour, and rammed the run into Vincent's kniekehle, - announced Bordini in his charge.
After complaining at the local and regional campaign management, Bordini found that at least four other people had already had the same experience with Phillip, he stated in the charge.
“Weapons do not need to be fired to cause damage,” said Bordini.
The charge comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate triggered a riot when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the \"Second Amendment people\" - gun owners and gunfriends - should take action if his rival Hillary Clinton is elected and Judge should be appointed.
Trump's campaign made it clear that the media had torn his words out of context and that he would not resort to violence.
Bordin's complaint demands compensation from the campaign for violation of the duty of care and from Philip for bodily injury and permanent mental damage.
Trump's press spokesman Hope Hicks was unable to reach an opinion.
Attempts to contact Philip also failed.
WCCB, a local news station in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer a campaign employee.
No response was made on calls to his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services.
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has led a controversial campaign so far.
The proceedings are Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin/Schwerin: Survey before country elections: losing SPD and CDU
In the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September), significant losses for the government parties SPD and CDU are recorded.
This resulted in representative surveys by the Institute of Opinion Research INSA for the \"Image-Time (Friday).
While the red and black government coalition in the north could hardly continue to rule, this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin.
In both states, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would thus have a good chance of continuing to put the head of government.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD dropped from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.
According to the survey, the party is only in front of the CDU, which could return to 23 percent.
The third place is disputed between the left and the AfD.
The left came to 19 percent (previously 18.4 percent), the AfD would be represented for the first time in the country day at 19 percent.
Despite slight losses, the Greens reentered the Schwerin Landtag with 6 percent (previously 8.7 percent).
NPD and FDP would not be represented at 3 per cent each on the country day.
According to the SPD, the selection of members in Berlin was only 23 percent (Wahl 2011: 28.3 percent).
The CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.4 percent.
They are therefore behind the greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but before the lefts with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).
The AfD would represent 14 percent in the House of Representatives for the first time.
With 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return, but the pirates would miss the entry in contrast to 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The First Smartphone
E-mail and Internet in Tijdlupe: 20 years ago the Nokia Communicator came to the market.
The successors dominate the world today - his manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and bigger, so it was not good in the hand either.
On the contrary, it was pretty clumsy.
The built-in memory initially amounted to eight megabytes, which would be sufficient for about two selfies with high resolution today.
An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.
The “Nokia 9000 Communicator” came into business exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet, but they somehow come from the stone age.
20 years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the Cebit Computer Fair in Hanover as an office in the West Bank format.
In fact, the new mobile phone could reach a lot for then standards: SMS and emails could be sent and received, even by fax was the communicator to reach.
Even access to web pages was possible via HTML browser, though painfully slow.
A pocket calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the cell phone could be popped up similar to a laptop.
Then a small keyboard and a black and white screen were found.
Very proud was the price: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 Euros.
The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.
No one was able to imagine in August 1996 that the communicator would be the beginning of the smartphone era.
Everything's been different since then.
The smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.
The women's cell phone section experienced an unprecedented disaster, was eventually sold to Microsoft and processed.
Today, the market dominates suppliers, all of whom came much later than Nokia.
Being always and everywhere online today is for many people everyday.
In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.
Some 1.4 billion devices have been sold, with Samsung and Apple accounting for 555 million pieces alone.
Global revenue from the equipment is around 400 billion euros.
In addition, the well-running business of the countless app providers and the telecommunications companies.
A whole industry has now been created around the smartphone.
The decisive breakthrough to the mass market only came in early 2007, when Apple Chief Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhone on the Mac World.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and an Internet communicator, to easily operate everything via touch screen.
Apple's winning move started, yet today the iPhone is the most important product in the group.
Nokia, Motorola, and Blackberry, who dominated the market, had the sense of belonging.
They finally disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.
The saying now has Apple and Asian providers like Samsung.
The smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention.
On average, every German today looks at his cell phone 88 times a day.
“We all have to learn to put the smartphone away once more,” said Janina Kugel, in the Siemens Board of Staff.
Permanent reach is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time.
England needs to direct the Olympic spirit and to expand Heathrow
Tomorrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country.
For me, this was the biggest attraction of Heathrow, as was then in London in 2012, when we made a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympics brought great benefits for Stratford and the East End.
And this will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities, we will already create 10,000 new teaching places, 40,000 new jobs, and end youth unemployment in the airport environment.
Just as they were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of enlargement has been too big.
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be blaring on the world stage.
The Zweifler were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong at Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers each question he asked.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project.
Expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in scientific growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment to both the airport and the entire GB.
We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from the T5 - which has been elected the world's best airport terminal for five years, to the T2 built in the middle of the world's two most frequent runs.
Now they are ready to deliver a third runway, which is supported by £16 billion of private investment.
The 2012 London Games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.
It is time that we direct this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in the ‘Cat and Mouse Game’ with respect to ad blocking
For companies making online advertising money, according to one of the software manufacturers, attempts to bypass ad blocking are equivalent to a “cat and mouse game.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad blocking on its desktop page, Adblock Plus published a blog post that told users that they could update their filters in the program to block advertising in the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the coding regarding its advertising ads to make it more difficult to recognize ad blocking the detection of which part of the page advertising is.
But Adblock announced that it had found a new way to bypass the new codes.
In a blog post, the spokesman of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that “this kind of Hin-and-Her-Kampf between the advertising-blocking Open Source Community and the vice versa has been in progress since the invention of ad blockers, and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has joined the struggle is a strong indication of how worrying advertisers have become for the industry.
According to a study conducted last year by Pagefair and Adobe, around 200 million people use advertisement blockers; almost four times that much in 2013.
With 1.03 billion active users daily accessing Facebook via their mobile devices, mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of Facebook's advertising revenue.
The company has opted for ad blockers on desktop PCs because mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook's mobile app for the social network and Instagram, a speaker told them.
Advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficiently large share of revenue, making Facebook appear to be worth investing in such a step.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would update its advertising preferences tool to give people more control over their targeted advertising.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters were worrying because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising.
“This is not a positive experience for users, so we are planning to address the problem,” said a Facebook speaker in an e-mail communication.
Ad blockers are a stupid means, so we have instead focused on developer tools such as Ad Preferences to put more control into people's hands.
Women who are likely to commit suicide on Swiss highway
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police call for witnesses after a woman was overrun by several vehicles on a highway in the early morning hours on Thursday.
The incident took place on the A1 near Morges in the Canton of Waadt shortly after midnight.
In the dark, a woman, in an act of despair, sat on the street and was hit by several cars, the police said in Waadt.
It is obvious that a Swiss woman aged 49 who was overrun by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill herself.
She's still dying on the spot.
Several drivers have already been heard, but some have still not been identified, said the police, who urged these and every witness of the incident to report.
Gilles Hofstetter informed Le Tribune de Geneve that he was a member of the Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be expected that one of the drivers will be displayed.
Was a collision avoidable?
That's something the prosecutor has to decide, said Hofstetter.
Two similar cases over the last five years show that drivers are not held responsible.
In each of the two cases - in which a person was walking on the highway in the dark, it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian is walking on the highway in the middle of the night, as the newspaper said.
Last year, a police officer was released from the negligence after she attacked and killed a man who was one night at the A1 near Payerne in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had drunk and became unconscious on the road, the court heard.
The court found that the policeman -- who had responded to an emergency call -- was in a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a “perfect exceptional and unpredictable situation,” the judge said.
Anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police under number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 44.
NASA Climate Model: Venus was once habitable
Venus was probably once habitable according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus could once have had earth-like conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-tight atmosphere.
Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus might have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and still slowly drifted.
The model also illuminated the topography of early Venus.
The planet probably showed more dry areas than the Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and protect it from faster evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.
“In the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exhibits its day side of the Sun for almost two months,” said GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the sun's heat.
The result is average temperatures that are a few degrees cooler than the Earth today.
The model produced a history of Venus that resembles the evolution previously suspected by planetary researchers.
Although she was once probably habitable, Venus -- over the course of several billions of years -- was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Her oceans diluted and her water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light.
When her Hydrogen escaped, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect was left behind -- the Venus, as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy returns as coach of the Avalanche
Patrick Roy resigned from Colorado Avalanche on Thursday as coach and Vice President of Hockey Operations and claimed too little co-determination in the team's decision-making process.
Alternative President/General Manager of the Colorados Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the club will immediately look for a new coach.
“In the last three years, I have fulfilled my duties as Chief Trainer and Vice President of Hockey Operations of Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination,” said Roy 50 in an opinion.
I've been thinking for a long time and a lot about how I could improve this team in order to give him more depth, this needs it and bring it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the vision of the trainer and Vice President Of Hockey Operations must be perfectly aligned with that of the organization.
He must also have a right to co-determination in decisions that influence the performance of the team.
These conditions are not currently being met.
Sakic, who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
“Patrick informed me today about this decision,” said Sakic.
We appreciate all he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future.
Roy was awarded the best coach of the league during his debut season at the Avalanches 2013-14 as winner of the Jack Adams Award.
He led the club to 112 points and to the first place in Central Vision, but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the Playoffs of Minnesota and missed the post season in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches recorded a 39-39-4 brand in the 2015-16 season and dropped five points behind the Wild for a second Wildcard Spot at the Western Conference.
As Hall of Fame Torwart, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume talks, put out strikes
The labour struggles concerning the remuneration for North Sea oil workers will be suspended, while all the parties to the dispute are putting themselves at the table for a new round of talks, the negotiators said.
Strikes against the Wood Group oil field service provider were performed sporadically on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
“Wood Group as well as the Unite and RMT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the settlement process of the current dispute,” it says in a joint statement.
We will hold some full-day meetings in the next few weeks, starting the beginning of next year to tackle the problems again.
The unions said that their last strike, which is the first in over 25 years, was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group has reduced the rates to its contractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent this year due to negative market pressure.
The company's discount rate is followed by a 10-percent decrease for onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said that additional cuts will give the company the necessary space to get through the market down.
Shell has released thousands of people for his part and has announced plans to abandon his oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries, since it rationalizes his business as a result of his megacooperation with the UK energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to the lower prices of crude oil, an economic situation which had been reinforced by the British decision to leave the European Union in June.
The Scottish Member of Parliament Dave Anderson met with workers leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes that have taken place in the North Sea for a generation.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
“In the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not just for few,” he said.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion of expenditure on new projects in the North Sea is expected compared to an average of about $7 billion in the last five years.
Kepler measures rotational rate of stars in the star cluster of Pleiades
The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalog of rotation rates among the stars of the star cluster of the Pleiades.
The new data helps astronomers understand why stars rotate at different rates in the cluster of stars and in what context the rotational periods are related to the planet's evolution.
“We hope that by comparing our results with other stars, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system,” said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.
The star cluster of the Pleiades is 445 light-years away from Earth.
Many stars in this cluster of stars, created about 125 million years ago, now reach the adult age.
They're turning the fastest now.
At peak rotation rates, these ripening stars emit large amounts of star winds.
As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.
When a star ages, its rate of rotation begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sunspots.
The latest catalog of rotation rates indicates that massive stars rotate slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars with dancers, while larger stars rotate slower pirouettes than smaller ones.
“In the “Ballet” the Pleiades we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars,” said Rebull.
Since the star cluster is so close to the Pleiades, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotational rates.
“The star cluster of the Pleiades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older,” said Rebull.
There is still much ahead of us about which we would like to learn more about how, when, and why stars slow down their rotation rates and hang their “dance shoes,” so to speak.
Rebull and her colleagues have reported in detail in three newspaper reports on their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the Pleiades, which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.
A controversial baseball star comes off
The tears ran at Alex Rodriguez faster than the US Baseball Star in best days from Base to Base.
After his emotional resignation, the 41-year-old professional on August 12 against the Tampa Bay Rays will lastly wear the jersey of his New York Yankees.
\"I love this game and this team\"
“I say ‘Goodbye’ to both,” explained the 14-time all-star game participant of Major League Baseball (MLB).
Rodriguez was the most valuable player in the league, and in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees.
His signature under a ten-year contract has given him $27 million annually since 2007.
By the end of the contract on 31 December 2017, he will be acting as consultant and youth coach at full salary.
As a player, Rodriguez paid it back for a long time with performance.
With 696 homeruns, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams, Runs, for the Seattle Marines (1994 to 2000), the Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004) and the Yankees since 2005 he created several milestones.
With Hall-of-Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two other baseball players show similar values in the most important statistics.
However, the 41-year-old should not be included in the baseball glory hall.
Because Rodriguez was so successful - nicknamed \"A-Rod\" - in the field, his appearance outside the square is controversial.
As early as 2009, the Superstar admitted to \"ESPN\" to have taken out prohibited steroids between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013, he was locked for 211 parties due to an engagement in the so-called biogenesis scandal by the end of 2014.
Rodriguez is considered the main suspect to have received performance-promoting funds for years via an anti-aging clinic in South Florida.
After a lawsuit, the locket was reduced to 162 encounters.
“The league could even have done me a favor for 2014, because I spent 20 years without a break,” Rodriguez said süffisantly.
His farewell days also did not run out of noise.
While many baseball legends have once again won the big stage in their last games, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bench.
“My job does not include a good-bye tour,”
“My job involves trying to win every game,” said Yankees-Coach Joe Girardi.
After all, Rodriguez, who was married to actress Cameron Diaz, was told about the relationship with Popstar Madonna and actress Kate Hudson, the fans' sympathy stories of the Yankee-Erzrivaln Boston Red Sox.
“We want A-Rod - the followers sang against the Rodriguez team at the 4:9 defeat.
Olympia 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases
Gets: Due to a positive doping sample, weightlifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland must not start in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overestimated by the first official doping cases.
A caught athlete would almost have won a medal.
Before the seventh day of the competition, the first official doping cases became famous for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-metre obstacle runner Silwia Danekova from Bulgaria and Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were tested positively in Brazil and excluded - immediately before the beginning of the already critically critical athletic competition, these news are coming to an end.
At Chen the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide had already been demonstrated last Sunday, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.
The CAS International Sports Court confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon.
On Sunday the 18-year-old had the fourth place in the finale over 100 m butterfly, only 0,09 seconds missed the bronze medal.
On Friday, Chen would have participated in the proceedings over 50 m of freestyle.
Chen requested the opening of the B trial and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
The national association took the matter very seriously and requested Chen to cooperate fully in the investigations, quoting Xinhua from a statement: \"We will cooperate with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the ruling,
For the first time in history, the IOC is no longer responsible for sanctioning athletes with positive cases.
Also at the night of Rio, the message of the positive trial at Danekova sickened, the 33-year-old went into the offensive himself.
“I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive, this being “an incredible shock,” she told Bulgarian TV station BNT.
She was innocent, “the only explanation could be dietary supplements,” explained the athlete.
According to the report, the prohibited substance should be EPO.
Danekowa was suspended provisionally, according to BNT, the B-probe should also have been positive.
Bulgaria's Prime Minister, Bojko Borissov, immediately spoke with criticism of the athlete.
“I don’t understand why athletes don’t draw the right conclusions,” he said, “we Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded.
For example, all weightlifters from the chronic doping-taxed nation should not participate in Rio.
On Friday, the case of Adrian Zielinski was also known, the London Olympicsman in class up to 85 kg was tested positively for the anabolic steroid Nandrolone three days earlier, like his brother Tomasz.
Both contest the intake, but both must not start in class up to 94 kg.
Prior to the start of the athletics, the Danekova case is a further heavy blow for the reputation of the entire sport.
The IAAF World Association had forbidden the launch of the entire Russian team until an exception due to systematic dopings, and Kenya was also producing numerous bad news in Rio.
In the swimming sport, the earlier crimes in China had also caused fierce disputes between athletes.
Thus, French Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympics' Sun Yang harsh.
‘Sun Yang pinches purple
“When I see the podium over 200 m of freestyle, I want to surrender,” Lacourt said in French radio.
Sun was also at the heart of an argument with Australian Mack Horton.
“I don’t have time and no respect for doping cheaters,” he said.
Sun had been tested positively for the Trimetazidine at the Chinese Championships in 2014, but only a three-month locker had to be removed.
Data clause: So perfide extort hackers their ransom
Programmers of extortion malware are currently attacking targeted companies - and are successful in doing so.
According to a recent survey of malware defence specialists malware bytes among 540 companies in North America, the United Kingdom and Germany, 40 percent of the companies surveyed have been at least once in the past 12 months, partly multiple victims of an attack with extortion software.
In Germany, nearly 20 percent of the companies were already targeting ransomware extortion.
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransoms demanded by the perpetrators to be able to re-use the attacked systems and data.
The perpetrators specialize their extortion software according to the observations of malware bytes looking at attacks in corporate networks.
If they succeed there, the potentially extorting ransom is significantly higher than in private users.
“We are currently observing a frighteningly fast evolution of the damage software,” explains malware byte boss Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the “world”
In 2008, most malware programs were still designed to send advertising.
Then the perpetrators discovered extortion software for themselves.
First, private users were the target, but the change to corporate attacks has been frighteningly fast in recent months.
Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: Once active on a victim's computer, it specifically searches for recently modified files such as Word, Excel or Database files as well as archives of images and videos.
These files encrypt the ransomware and delete the originals sustainably.
The software then presents the demands of the extortioners.
In order to get the end-key code to the files, the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.
But where private users play the personal photo database, companies are concerned about sensitive customer data or project databases without which production stops.
Accordingly, the damage results when a ransomware strikes.
22 percent of the German companies concerned reported losses of revenue due to ransomware, 13 percent even had to interrupt their business completely, in one case people were at risk of life.
In Germany, multiple hospitals have already been victims of attacks, whose patients may be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.
“We always say to the victims: don’t pay, you only promote the problem,” explains Kleczynski.
But 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay get their data back.
For managers, it is difficult to reject the demands of the perpetrators in view of a halt in the operation.
The hackers, in turn, know this and try everything to build a good reputation.
In a recent study, F-Secure security researchers have examined the user interfaces and contact with the extremities and come to the conclusion: The perpetrators are actually trying to build some kind of customer service to take more money.
They explain to their victims via chat how to pay via Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support sites or decrypt example files.
And after payments of only a few hundred euros, private individuals have to negotiate in part hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data back unencrypted.
Given the potentially high and relatively riskless gains from ransomware extortion, the hackers become more and more professional and share the work, security expert Chester Wisniewski explains from the antivirus provider Sophos: “A single person can write a ransomware circa within a week,
However, it is more likely that they are three or four persons.
The programmers then sell their malicious software in the form of a software building box to the actual extremities.
The previous malware kits were created by buying the malware itself, consulting and additional tools for a unique fixed price of between $1000 and $10,000.
“The delivery includes an adjustment tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed,” says Wisniewski.
The extremists then look for other hackers to distribute the newly purchased software among the victims.
We live in a service economy.
So you log into one of the forums in the background, buy the set from a criminal and commission another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
The payment is made per infected computer.
“Perhaps the criminals then commission spammers with the spread,” explains Wisniewski.
The risk of Ransomware is now well known in many companies that make their data more secure.
Over 50 percent of corporate IT managers in the malware bytes survey rely on being able to reject ransomware using file backups and scanner software.
Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.
“If the encryption of data alone is no longer a sufficient threat to successful embezzlement, the perpetrators instead threaten to release sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations,” explains Malwarebytes chief Marcin Kleczynski.
Thus, the potential for damage depending on the type of data is still a multiple higher than before.
Even in future, the perpetrators could take on completely new goals on the Internet of Things.
At the Defcon Hacker Conference, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.
In the middle of winter, the release of such blocked heating could well be worth a ransom.
If, instead of heating, the perpetrators block an entire production road in a factory in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.
One for all cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and daily
In the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivan.
Sounds rather overloaded, but the HR-V, which was designed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.
Although the HR-V is only 1.60 m rather small, passengers have a lot of space both in the first row and in the fund, it does not seem tight in any place.
The interior materials are well processed and act pleasantly, only the cockpit top falls there something.
The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in storage space.
There is not only a case room of 453 l for high-strength and 1026 l for folded backrests, but there are the \"Magic Seats\"
This is less magical than it sounds: the seat surfaces of the back bench can be folded up like cinema chairs and thus provide storage space that is 1,24 m high from the ground to the ceiling.
The trunk can be loaded well, but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The tested 1.6-l diesel with 88 kW/120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.
However, he is expected to do his work a little less.
The daily consumption of 4.7 l/100 km is enjoyable.
There is another motorization: a 1.5-l gasoline with 96 kW/130 hp.
An all-wheel drive is not offered.
Driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.
But the steering should be a little more direct.
The equipment does not reveal any wishes in the tested top variant — executive.
The safety systems include the City emergency brake assistant (worked up to tempo 32), the collision warning system and the track maintenance assistant.
The collision warning sometimes irritates because it assesses many obstacles as \"close objects\" when ranking.
The Fernlicht assistant works very reliably.
And the intelligent tempo controller responds to the traffic sign recognition and dries the speed when needed.
The full connectivity, however, is only available for the top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, navi, app integration and more.
Two USB and an HDMI sockets are under the armrest and are therefore a bit around to reach.
The around 29000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.
If you don't want to invest as much, the petrol will receive EUR 20000, the diesel from EUR 23000.
The engines meet the Euro-6 exhaust standard.
With the HR-V Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.
Airline is not liable: fall on passenger bridge
An airline is not liable for the overthrow of a passenger on the passenger bridge.
The Oberlandesgericht Dusseldorf (Az.: 18 U 124/14) argued that liability is only possible in the event of dangers typical of air traffic.
The plaintiff had broken a knee disc at the fall.
However, the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life, the court said.
The airline didn't have to pay the man any damages.
Case of illness: When paid to the organiser
After their journey, sick people only get money back when the cause of the disease is undoubtedly found in the hotel.
But this is only the case when more than 10 percent of the guests show the same symptoms.
In the negotiated case, on the second day of her holiday in Turkey, a family was seriously ill with diarrhoea and vomiting.
She spent almost all of her holidays in the room.
Their illness led the holidaymakers back to a defective sewage system, which supposedly polluted the seawater.
The family felt that the trip was a lack of order - and complained against the organizer.
In court, the plaintiffs had no success.
Although the cleaning system was in fact defective.
But the organizer only learned of it shortly before the plaintiffs left.
He had to assume until then that the sea water was in order.
So he didn't violate his information obligations, he said.
No impurities were found in the samples of the water.
The disease of several hotel guests - possibly by contagion among themselves - is at the general risk of life.
Of 691 guests, only 38 were ill.
De Maizière said that following the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people were worried about further attacks.
The state must be determined to react to terrorist threats at the same time.
Certainly, our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division.
We won't give this triumph to the terrorists.
If criminals had to leave the country faster, however, it would increase security and also strengthen the approval of the population for refugee policy.
De Maizière aims to achieve the implementation of the proposals by the 2017 Bundestag elections.
He also announced a further strengthening of security forces in the medium-sized four-digit scale over several years.
Sympathy advertising for terrorism must again be subject to punishment.
Video surveillance is aimed at improving the right of arms so novel that, above all, the purchase of weapons on the Internet becomes difficult.
The last much discussed duty for doctors is to keep in mind the Maizière's words.
However, in dialogue with the medical community, he wanted to look for solutions to reduce the danger of citizens, with a view, for example, to mental emergencies.
In order to counter radicalisation of refugees, the Minister considers that better social care is needed.
Teachers need to be better prepared to deal with traumatized people.
To persecute criminals in specific areas of the Internet (Darknet), de Maizière plans the use of hidden investigators.
SPD Chief Gabriel said: “The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase safety -
It is important that the Minister of the Interior has clearly opposed actionism.
“This was an eardrum for the sharpeners in the CDU/CSU,” Gabriel told the newspapers of the Funke Mediengruppe (Friday).
De Maizière had rejected calls from the Union for a Burka ban and the abolition of dual nationality before.
A general prohibition of full-skilledness is a problem for constitutional law.
You can't ban everything you refuse, and I refuse to wear the Burka.
It is possible to talk about rules such as road traffic or witnesses in court.
Green Chefin Simone Peter told the minister that he wanted to simulate the power and ability of action with ever new anti-terror packages.
Left party leader Bernd Riexinger said: \"Flotted speeches and a tightening of the right of residence no longer bring security to the people in this country,
Better traffic flow on the motorway
It is regularly standing on the bypass road - here a picture of November.
But that is to change: the legal bid is to be extended.
This is a good news for all car drivers who are in traffic on the surrounding street every evening in the bar, when they drive to the motorway (A 43).
The Landesbetrieb Straßebau will extend the right-hander trail by 700 metres in the area between Hammer Straße and the exit Weseler Straße next Tuesday and Wednesday (16/17 August).
Car drivers can then download directly from Hammer Street to the right.
The great advantage: the traffic divides more early on, thus improving the overall flow on the much-powered section of the Bundesstraße 51.
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU fraction in the district representing Münster-West.
The car driver's suspension on the feeder is particularly nervous between 17 and 19 o'clock.
The workdays extend from the back to the bridge above the Albersloher trail and sometimes beyond.
Reason is the needle tube on the B 51 just before the departure Wesler Straße.
From here traffic is linked only one-way through the motorway bridge.
The second track had to be rebuilt about a quarter of a year ago.
The reason: Static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer had the necessary load capacity, in particular to take on two-way heavy load transport.
How long this narrow pass and the associated working daily stock will last cannot be said by the competent country undertaking.
However, there are years to expect: because the bridge has an official rest-use period until 2034.
For the extension of the legal debenture, the country undertaking has deliberately selected the weaker time during the school holidays because of disabilities.
The traffic will be carried by one-way on Tuesday and on Wednesday at the construction site.
Intercultural journey: Cultural offers for schools
The international class of the forest school visited the play “The Invisible House”
The Nima's Association and the Young Theatre are now planning a music project.
The Nima Association enables young people with migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The \"Class International\" of the Waldschule Kinderhaus has visited an idea of the award-winning piece \"The Invisible House\" of the Young Theatre Münster.
In the context of the \"Intercultural journey\" initiated by Nima's Association, 19 students from eleven to 15 attended the production in the Small House.
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which has set itself the goal of cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee backgrounds, offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster within the framework of this project.
Most of the class's young people came to Münster from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria between September 2015 and March 2016, and spoke little German.
Thanks to choreographies, the scenic images and video animations, they were able to follow the course of action anyway, according to the press release of the Young Theatre Münster.
The Nima's Association, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Spalachel, and the Young Theatre will work together in the coming season as part of a musical theatre project.
From October to December, young people with and without escape and migration background between 14 and 20 years of age will be able to attend professional courses in the areas of singing, dancing, acting and music.
Offers for children and families in the field of theatre and theatrical language communication are in planning.
The project \"Intercultural journey\" continues.
In view of the increased numbers of refugees, the association expects many classes to participate.
Rain instead of star snaps: hope for weather improvement
The weather has taken into account the star-nupping guckers in southwest Germany during the night to Friday - but there is still hope.
The night had been ill suited for watching the sky spectacle due to clouds and rain, said the Chairman of the Welzheim Observatory, Hans-Ulrich Keller, on Friday morning.
Our hope is on the night to Saturday.
The weather should be good, then we'll see a lot of stars in the sky.
The starships are Persians, which at 216,000 kilometers per hour are one of the fastest storks.
They have their names because they seem to come from the constellation Perseus, which rises in the northeast.
Restful Night: Tips for Sleep Disorders
In the evening you walk around forever, at night you lie awake for hours, and in the morning you can't think of sleep before the alarm clock.
That's all but relaxing.
After all, you have such problems in good society: According to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than 10 percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently rather than not relaxing.
How do sleep problems or sleep disorders express themselves?
There are several forms of sleep disturbance, and there can be multiple causes for them, emphasised Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the board of directors of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.
However, what is commonly understood below is insomnia, i.e. insomnia and sleep disturbance.
Just sleeping through feels a lot of people as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board of directors in the German Medical Association with practice in the Lower Saxon Varel.
What's behind sleep disturbances?
The causes of sleep disturbance are complex.
In the meantime, organic, mental or behavioral factors, as well as medications, may be present.
The sleep disorder is not uncommon to the expression of another disease.
“Very early awakening is especially common in depression, says Weeß.
And it may be that different factors are interrelated.
For example, if you have a tape disc incident, you may lie bad, wake up every two to three hours, and begin to grapple with everyday problems and care, give you an example.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
From when should you be treated with sleep disorders to the doctor?
If you are not sleeping well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and are impaired by day, you should go to the doctor, advise you.
The impairment may look quite different: one is beaten down, tired, unsleeping, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical complaints such as stomach or headaches.
In order to alleviate sleep disturbance, it is important to find out their causes.
Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or medication - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and not more than two weeks.
There is little left for sleep physicians in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the Interdisciplinary Sleep Medicine Center of Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.
Therefore, in the case of sleep problems, one should first turn to the home doctor, advise Weeß.
It can be explained with studies whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who should go to the sleeping lab, and what happens there?
For example, in case of snorkels with breath triggers, in sickly day fatigue, in sleep wanderers or if you do not find the cause of a sleep disorder, Fietze explains.
You don't actually have to prepare for the investigation.
You should spend the day normally.
“Please don’t sleep at noon,” says Fietze.
After wiring, you go to bed at his normal time.
In addition to the electrodes on the body, you wear a nose goggle, a chest belt and a feeler on your finger.
In addition, a camera on the ceiling records the sleeping persons.
How can stakeholders handle the problems?
There are quite a lot of plugs that can be used for better sleep.
Weeß counts on: Regular sleep and uptime, not too long in bed, not sleeping on the day, not going to sleep, avoiding alcohol and not looking at the clock at night - then you start to count immediately, and that is completely unsatisfied.
What the jungle camp has to do with missing medals in swimming
The former German swimmer Markus Deibler has expressed himself via Facebook to disappoint the DSV team at Olympis.
In December 2014, he had won gold for the first time at the World Championships in Doha, while at the same time setting up his first world record.
Now the former DSV-Athlet Markus Deibler, via Facebook, has protected himself from his critical ex-team colleagues.
“In a country where an Olympicsman receives 20,000€ premium and a bunker waged 150,000€, nobody should wonder about missing medals,” wrote the 26-year-old on his Facebook page at night.
The support system in swimming was bad, but the doping controls were very good.
We cannot compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look so closely at the subject of doping or even operate it.
“I do not say that controls should be suspended here,” he continued.
If he wanted to start a comeback, Deibler would have been notified nine months before his first launch of the National Anti-Doping Agency of Germany (NADA).
That's the same way you should keep it with countries.
\"If a certain time before WM/OS cannot be controlled by independent controllers of WADA/FINA, it must not take part, the election-Hamburger, who is now operating an ice part.
Airport: Bands of luggage thieves arrested
Professional thief at Düsseldorf Airport
On Thursday two women and two men aged 50 to 61 were arrested by the Düsseldorf police.
The suspects had committed several pocket and luggage thefts as gangs.
At 21.30 a.m., civil servants in the area of Düsseldorf Airport recognized a band that was known to the police from past thefts.
The two women and two men had committed several offences since the middle of July this year and had been involved in the community, working part-time and especially professional activities.
The specialists of the 34 Criminal Commissioners can prove four acts to the thieves who have entered Germany to commit crimes.
They had totaled more than 15,000 euros.
Old buildings, a couple of linden trees, in between still a remnant headstone patch: the Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not work at first glance, but the police are one of the \"dangerous places\" of the city.
If you walk along the road from east to west, you pass playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and a bio shop.
Someone has sprayed the facade of a grey house, ugly.
Opposite a Lidl, which will soon be demolished, is already being built: by 2017 a house with high windows and 133 new rentals will be built here.
However, articles about this “tearsome part of the city - as the competent real estate company Friedrichshain calls it - are primarily depicted in the last few weeks with burning cars.
The reason is the house with number 94: Once it was occupied, the residents now have rental contracts, but on the ground floor rooms are still occupied and are used for events.
Since the beginning of the year, in particular, the Berlin internal senator Henkel had repeatedly called for a hard action by the police against the project, called the area “No-Go zone” for police officers and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.
On 22 June, after the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, had been cleared with 300 police officers, the police patrolled for three weeks, according to official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three crew cars on site, locked parts of the street, and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94.
Meanwhile, construction workers on behalf of the unknown houseowners renovated the rooms.
On July 13 a Berlin administrative court decided that the premises had been illegal, and a day later, police and construction workers withdrew under the cheer of sympathisers and residents.
On this summer afternoon the street is peaceful: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others entertain themselves in the form of Späti.
A primary school and kindergarten are located close to the house projects.
Left-wing violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in the Kiez since 1999, and Jana*, who is raising three children, are particularly upset by the police presence.
With the residents of the home projects, they share the concern about increasing rents and gentrification.
It doesn't sound like a tick that mostly wanted police protection from vandalizing links.
The grave, which the Berlin internal senator and the police are opening between houseowners and their neighbours, does not exist.
Friedrichshain in eastern Berlin was actually a traditional working district, which today also has a low average income and high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city.
Also house crews and the residential projects born from them have long been among the cuisine: in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer Street near the Riga.
While the Mainzers had been cleared in a regular street battle under great police orders, many of the projects in the Rigan were legalized and are still partly inhabited by the people they occupied 26 years ago.
At the same time, in recent years, the district has become increasingly magnets for tourists and voters from all over the world: with them, residents from GDR times and former houseowners are sharing their choices.
This also makes it noticeable for rents, which have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009.
Many of the new buildings in the Riga are being attacked as symbols for this development: one recognizes them on inserted disks or freshly painted facades that have been coated with colour bags.
No other road has been mentioned so often this year along with the words “left-wing autonomous violence”.
One reason why not all neighbors view this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as bodily injury, according to statistics, are almost exclusively directed against police officers.
Most of the crimes involve damage to the property, which tends to meet the new buildings and newly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived for 17 years in a rental house next to the disputed 94, uncertainty cannot be said.
As for acts of violence, it is deplorable: the people in the 94 are their neighbors, who have certainly not been.
Even the famous burning cars would no longer exist right in the Riga.
For the architect studied, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: “Here you help each other, live together on the road and get more of each other than elsewhere,
New builder was deliberately pulled into Riga's street - and stayed.
That is why it was so important to her that the residents came back to her street: from the police, the politics and the media, all of which suddenly claimed the deputity over the district in July.
But in the eyes of residents such as Neugebauer, the road is still being taken away from them: thanks to faceless new buildings in former building gaps, which push the old inhabitants away.
“These are, in the end, real estates that are not interesting to many here - people who aren’t so well - are more likely to live here.
“I absolutely cannot approve of violence and destruction.
But what if you never listen to someone?
There is frustration on all sides, including police and residents.
Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for those who are angry about color bombs: The house projects and the left scene were part of the Kizez.
Those who move should be aware of it - just as someone who moves into a pub neighborhood can complain badly about noise there.

Urbach: Annika Deushle is a new refugee commissioner
Annika Deushle is the contact person in terms of integration and organizer.
She is also a local social worker.
Since July, Annika Deushle has been the refugee commissioner for Urbach.
The social educator supports the management team around Achim Grockenberger.
She sees herself as a contact person for all actors: refugees, working group refugee aid, administration, authorities and anyone else.
Regine Kunde from the working group indicates that the honorary authorities are more than grateful that Deushle is now there, the egg-laying wool milk sauce, which has a problem above all.
For example, some - less scoffing than the many desired areas of responsibility - had meant that the administration wanted to issue the office.
An administrative faculty was sought with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long experience in the field of social work, just an egg milk sauce.
But administrative work is not their central area, says Annika Deushle.
Above all, it is about organizing, working with people on site and behind scenes as well as networking.
The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.
It has a 50-percent position for three years.
“It was high time,” says Regine Kunde, “that Annika Deushle is supporting honorary and principal actors.
There are major and minor problems, organisational, human and understanding problems.
Soon new containers are on the Wasenstraße
It has been a serious problem for some time to find housing for the connecting refugees who have been recognized.
The municipalities are responsible for the connection.
They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented homes.
The cost of building, renting or renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the municipalities themselves.
The responsibility changes from Landratamt to Commune and Jobcenter.
Problem: There are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been very difficult for some time.
In fact, the administration does not find private housing.
To date, it has not been possible to operate on private homes, according to Deushle.
Therefore, common dwellings must be satisfied as it is so beautiful.
So new containers will soon be set up in the Wasenstraße.
But only housing is not done.
Perspective is the keyword, Regine Kunde and Annika Deushle agree.
In addition to a permanent residence, there are internships, training places, school places, one-euro jobs and emergency activities for refugees and migrants who need to be found or established.
“More places would be good,” Regine Kunde reports.
Many work in the courtyard or help housemasters, do non-profit work - and this motivates and very well, as Annika Deushle reports.
She hopes that the work for the community will have a positive external effect.
This is not employment therapy.
But activity doesn't just mean work.
The day needs a solid structure, say Deushle and customer.
People had to develop a sense of belonging.
So it needs offers such as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.
Professional courses are rare.
So this is where administration and honorary services start.
It is central that refugees get the feeling that they are wanted and welcome in Germany.
The long duration of the proceedings was a problem.
They have to explain to the refugees that it just takes time and they can easily bridge the time, for example with language courses.
Anyone who somehow develops the feeling that he cannot help anyone in Urbach, should not work and be useless, he will never integrate.
The clear majority is motivated.
But there are also problems, says customer honestly, “people who don’t do anything at all, therefore the work of Deushle and customer is always to motivate others.
All of this was already a \"mammoth task\"
A difficult question: Do the two, after the recent events, fear radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?
“No, Regine Kunde clearly says, “what some might call naive, a residual risk could and would not exclude it.
But the helpers are aware already.
These incidents were also the subject of refugees.
They would have the fear that the attackers would bring them into full convocation.
\"They want to show that they have nothing to do with it, says Regine Kunde.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
So principal and honorary officials on site and in the region must look out for activities.
They always have in the background that a new blow of refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.
Does Germany need an upper limit?
This question is clearly answered, the policy is appalling.
Actually, it's unfair to put her helpers on the spot.
“We haven’t arrived in Urbach yet, where we’re going to go,” says Annika Deuschle.
No new refugees, that would relax the situation.
Regine Kunde also makes it clear that the Urbacher are already in a position to reasonably integrate the previous people.
These are currently about 100 people, mostly young men.
But if people are in need, they need help, both women agree.
The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.
Schorndorf: Einbracher mit Hebschraubersucht
The police helicopter flew several areas for about an hour - unsuccessfully.
