The “steel needle” is a trip anatp in water because of the surface tendency.
The 'Surface Tension' occurs when the 'water molecules' from the top of the water 'attract' to themselves are 'attracted' to the 'air molecules' above them.

The 'blade' is set on a 'ice skate' of the present day with 'double edge' and a hole in the middle of the 'edge', and these two 'edges' gently grab the ice, even when turned.
Because under the 'blade' it is a 'curve', when 'blade' turns slightly to one side, 'edge' is still tied to ice and turned.
If the 'skate' turns to the right, the 'skater' turns to the right, and the 'skates' turns to the left, and the 'skater' turns to the left.
Back at the energy level, other sources of light had to be removed.
This will be the case when the small particle (particle) of light called a “photon ” is sold
The signs refer to the process as ''stimulated emission of radiation'' because light causes the 'atoms' to change to produce the 'emission' of a 'photon' of light, and light is a kind of 'radiation'.
The other image shows the 'atoms' removing the 'photon', and the truer 'photon' is smaller than the one contained in the image.
The 'photons' are smaller than the forces that cause the 'atoms'!
While working hundreds of hours, the “filament ” in the bulb is cooked and the ball’s light is not working.
We need to change the bulb (bulb), which implies that we need to be careful when changing the globe.
First, the 'switch' of this light has to be turned off or disconnected (disconnected) 'cable'.
This is because electric electricity continues to run into the socket where the ball (bulb) has a metal metal handle and this can give you a big 'electric shock' if you touch the inside of the socket or the metal part of the ball while it is still attached to the socket.

If you stood on the ground of the 'law', your problem would be smaller than your situation on Earth.
A man who weighs 200 pounds (90kg) on Earth will weigh about 36 pounds (16kg) above the 'lo', so 'gravity' will draw you to a smaller point.
The Sun does not have a 'crust' like the earth where you can stand, all of it being gases (gas), fire, and plasma.

About three thousand years later, in 1610, an 'astronomer' of Italu Galileo Galilei used a 'telescope' to see Venus as it had its 'phases', just as the moon had.

After France’s war ended, Germany was about to seize Britain’s island.
Germany gave the attack 'code-name' to most of the British Army’s large weapons lost when they left Dunkirk.

Things that are not good for the zoom lenses are like 'focla complexity' and the number of 'lens elements' where they need a 'range of focal lengths, which is equal to the number of 'prime lenses'.
This was no longer a problem, for the “lens ” team produced high - pitched standles in their production process.
This enables the zoom lenses to produce a well - arranged, well - arranged, and well - arranged photo with a 'lens' with a 'fixed focal length'.
Another disadvantage with the zoom lenses is the 'maximum aperture' (spit) of the 'lens'.
This makes it difficult to use the unexpensive zoom lens in places where there is 'low-light' instead of 'flash'.
