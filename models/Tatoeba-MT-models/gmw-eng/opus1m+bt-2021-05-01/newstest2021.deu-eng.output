Mammary: Corona mass infection: 174 harvest helpers infected
After a Corona mass infection on a large vegetable farm in the Lower Bavaria Mamming, almost 500 people are under quarantine and are no longer allowed to leave the farm.
A security service is monitoring the exit ban.
A total of 174 harvesters were tested positively on the Corona pathogen Sars-CoV-2 during the series investigation, as reported by the Landratamt Dingolfing-Landau on Saturday evening.
\"To avoid further spread, unfortunately, we have to take this step to protect the population,\" said Landrat Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Previously, seven employees had already been infected in the company - this was the cause of the series test.
The farm is a large vegetable farm, which builds strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and red beets - but the cucumbers only for inlay glasses.
Mamming is a rural community with 3300 inhabitants not far from Dingolfing with its large BMW plant.
Bumeder appealed to the citizens to keep quiet: \"Our information is a closed circle of people,
In the courtyard infected were separated from non-infected employees, the terrain is now surrounded by a barrier fence.
Greens and SPDs gave the state government co-responsibility.
The two opposition factions accused Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet of neglecting the control of accommodation of seasonal workers.
“This can be bitter when such local infectious events are taking place and regional lockdowns have to be arranged,” said Jürgen Mistol, the parliamentary director of the Greens.
This is very similar to the SPD: “We have already called for a special control programme for farms with harvest helpers after the Corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof-Schlachthof in mid-May.
\"The hygiene conditions at the workplace and the living conditions must be closely monitored from our point of view.
Obviously, this has not happened.
The outbreak had come, with notice.

Report: Seehofer insists on longer stock data storage
Stock data storage is currently suspended.
According to a media report, however, Federal Minister Horst Seehofer calls for an extension of the storage period.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer (CSU) calls for an extended storage of stock data, rather than the planned ten weeks for half a year.
As the \"Image on Sunday\" reports, Seehofer Minister of Justice Christine Lambrecht (SPD) asked for a rapid legislative change in a letter.
Seehofer therefore intends to reinforce the measures taken against child abuse.
He considered it useful to make “advanced adjustments to the law already in force,” quoted in the paper from the letter.
Currently, stock data storage is suspended.
A decision by the ECJ is expected.
Seehofer, however, wants the changes before, so that they can be applied immediately after a possible positive judgment, says the report.
A spokesman from the Ministry of Justice said to the newspaper that it could only be reasonably examined whether there would be a need for legal adjustments if the courts had decided.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer, together with the interior ministers of the countries, had already declared itself for a stock data storage in June.
NBA: Strip Club Ears for Clippers Star Lou Williams
Excited in the NBA!
Lou Williams (33), Los Angeles Clippers basketball professional, is supposed to have left the tournament quarter in Disney World in Orlando/Florida with permission for a funeral.
According to U.S. media reports, he attended the \"Magic City\" strip club in Atlanta in the evening.
Williams, who is supposed to have admitted the visit according to ESPN statements, is back in Isloation, is tested daily for Covid-19.
His reason for visiting: Chicken Wings.
In February last year, as he is called in the NBA, \"Sweet Lou\" has already expressed his love for exactly these Wings.
The American wrote: “Magic City and Blue Flame (another strip club in Atlanta, Anm. d. R.) have the best Wings in the city,
NBA Insider Shams Charania announced on Sunday at Twitter that the NBA has ordered Williams to have a ten-day quarantine.

Soder speaks out after mass infection to the Corona layer
Munich - Minister of Health Melanie Huml (CSU) has already announced a food sive for large farms on Sunday.
The press conference will be on our homepage live.
The case in Mamming in the district of Dingolfing-Landau has upset authorities and politics.
Almost 500 harvesters from several countries are currently working at the large vegetable farm, and over a third have been infected with the Corona pathogen.
The farm is now under quarantine and is locked with a fence.
No one is allowed to leave the grounds, food is delivered.
The authorities now offer free Corona tests to the well over 3300 inhabitants of the municipality.
Since the harvesters had little contact with the local population, the Landratamt has so far assumed that the infections did not spread beyond the farm.
“Court of conscience: confession of the alleged pen of fire by Nantes
“My client has shown himself cooperatively,” the lawyer Quentin Chabert told the newspaper.
The defendant added: “He deeply regrets the deeds, the confession was a liberation for him,
His mandate was “possessed of conscience and greatly taken away from the extent of destruction, ”
According to the prosecutor, in the event of a conviction, the man would be sentenced to ten years in prison and a fine of 150,000 euros.
The Gothic St. Peter's and Paul's Cathedral in Nantes had been severely damaged during a fire at night on Saturday past week.
The fire broke out in three distant places in the church.
Laboratory investigations hardened the suspicion of fire foundation.
The suspect who was now imprisoned had already been arrested a few hours after the fire.
He was released after one day.
The man worked as a volunteer for the Diocese of Nantes and was responsible for the closure of the cathedral on the eve of the fire.
Since there was no trace of violent invasion into the church, he quickly got into the field of view of the investigators.
Discuss the abolition of the 50+1 rule
The former DFB President Reinhard Grindel recommended that we consider the abolition of the 50+1 rule.
\"German football should at least discuss setting conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates complete facts - said Grindel of the \"Image on Sunday\"
He said: \"The 50+1 rules, however, do not work for associations that can become dangerous at the earliest Bayern and Dortmund: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, the debate does not revolve around whether it is not necessary to facilitate associations that wish to break into this phalanx to involve investors,
However, he has doubts as to whether there is a willingness in the German Football League to allow majority participations which are prohibited in the Bundesliga by the 50+1 rule.
\"It remains a legal risk to move investment fences in a European single market to the economic location of Bundesliga, said Grindel.
The former DFB chief sees the danger that “the attempts to ensure more competitive balance in the Bundesliga will only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but will not lead to more tension in the championship.”
Even an equal distribution of TV money will not have a decisive effect.
“The FC Bayern makes sales of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund of 500 million and RB Leipzig of 300 million.
So the differences are enormous among the first three clubs.
The other 15 associations have an average household of 130 million - the 58-year-old explained.
With a view to the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
“The truth is that there were people who noticed this mistake and went through the press instead of addressing me on it,” said Grindel about the adoption of an expensive clock that had led to his resignation in April 2019.
“That has been very busy to me in my life, ” he said.
He had received the gift of around 11,000 euros from a Ukrainian official.
“I have committed a compliance violation, and it was right to draw the consequences from it,” said Grindel.
\"With the ominous watch present, I am completely transparent and unscrupulous.
Many in the DFB knew about it,
He never \"made a helm out of the gift\" assured the 58-year-old.
\"This may be called naive, in any case this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption,

Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: Historical costumes despite Corona
Although the large sauce was missing in the spa town, visitors and performers enjoyed the Rakoczy flair of the alternative program.
It was unusual for visitors, performers and organizers: the Rakoczy weekend without a Rakoczy festival.
But, even though the large party miles in the city center were missing, the mass of people and program highlights such as Saale were burning, Rakoczy Ball or fortuit, many of the Corona-compliant alternative programs were at their expense.
“I think we have managed to spread Rakoczy flair,” says Kurdirectorin Sylvie Thormann.
The guests would have accepted it well.
In principle, one returns to the beginnings of the Rakoczy festival, when the historical ones were in the focus of the festival alone.
Pleasant atmosphere
Vesna Konhäuser has been visiting Rakoczy-Fest Bad Kissingen with her husband for more than 25 years.
So also this time in the Corona year.
The couple have made it comfortable at the Luitpold casino, observe the historians during the flangeing and listen to Cuban live music at the Spielbank restaurant.
“I find it very pleasant too,” says Konhäuser.
They miss the masses of people who otherwise belong to Rakoczy.
For this, however, she lacks the usual program highlights, especially Saale burns on Friday evening, as well as the historic festival and the final fireworks on Sunday evening.
\"That's a shame.
The weather would have been great this year, she thinks.
Rakoczy riding tournament to take place again
For the performers of the historical Kurgäste, the alternative program meant some more work.
About for Christina Gold, who works in a normal year at the fort and can be seen there on the carriage of the spa garden café.
This year she was on foot in the city on Sundays and Sundays in costumes.
“That’s even more urgent, otherwise we’ll have it easier,” she says.
The Reiterverein had less to do, even if individual riders were on the road in the park.
“We hope that the Reiterquadrille will be allowed to take place again next year,” says President Ulrike Waldhofen.
She announced that after several years of break in 2021, a Rakoczy riding tournament will take place again.

Frankfurt/Main - The seven-time World Champion Tony Martin can imagine continuing his cycling career.
“I’m just setting the conditions with the team, how and in what form it could go on,” said the 35-year-old of the “Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung”

Argentina rejects counter-offering of creditors
The new demands could not be met, the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Buenos Aires announced on Saturday.
\"This would not only be irresponsible, but also unfair, it was stated in an opinion.
\"During 50 percent of Argentina's children live in poverty, we cannot increase the short-term gains of our creditors,
The debt of the second largest economy in South America is no longer sustainable under the current conditions.
Therefore, Argentina calls on its private creditors to give up some of their claims of approximately $66 billion (about EUR 59 billion).
If there is no agreement, the country threatens the state plea again.
It would be the ninth loss of payment in Argentine history.
Finally, the creditors demanded higher interest rates on government bonds and changes to some contractual clauses.
However, the Argentine government is holding its last offer and is not ready for any further concessions.
Argentina faces a serious financial and economic crisis.
The inflation rate was more than 50 percent.
For the current year, experts expect a decline in economic power by around ten percent.
At the end of May, Argentina had failed to meet interest rates of US$503 million and had thus fallen into a limited loss of payment.
Professional arrival - private not yet
“It’s running super-gut - this conclusion Dr. Stefanie Kramer draws after her first days in the Notariat in Eggenfelden.
In the end, everything went very quickly: in mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she will follow Lutz Feller in the Eggenfelden Notariatsstelle.
Six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the doctorate lawyer took up work, and the normal day business has been on full tours for a long time.
“In private, however, I still have to arrive,” she explains in a conversation with the Rottaler Anzeiger and laughs.
Of course, the short advance period has not been enough to completely shift the food point from Regensburg to Eggenfelden, reports the native Dingolfinger.
She is currently looking for a suitable apartment or a house in the city with her husband, who is in Regensburg as a judge in the Landgericht.
At least her husband has been able to apply for parental leave in the short term to ensure the care of the two daughters (31⁄2 and 11⁄2 years old).
In order not to have to commute from Regensburg every day, she sometimes also has an overnight stay with her parents in Dingolfing, explains the 39-year-old.
Growing up in the neighborhood, the city of Eggenfelden has, of course, long been a term.
When visiting on-site with her family in the past few months, she recently noted: “Eggenfelden is a really beautiful small town,” she said.
All the more they were pleased that they had made the race in the selection process around the free spot.
Her home country, Niederbayern, also plays a central role in Dr. Stefanie Kramer's professional career: After the law degree in Passau, she completed her scholarship and the second state examination in Regensburg.
After several stations as notarassessorin, among others in Rehau and Hof in Oberfranken, Babenhausen im Unterallgäu and Regensburg - at this time she also attended the doctorate in Labour Law in 2012 as a notary in Rotthalmünster in the district of Passau.
In 2016 she went to parenthood, and eventually she moved to Regensburg.
Since then, she has taken over representation services in various notarial offices.
When the post had been written out in Eggenfelden for the near retirement of Lutz Feller, they saw the right time for full professional re-entry, explains the 39-year-old.
The team of her predecessor, who will be taking over the holiday representation at the Notariatsstelle, has completely taken over Dr. Stefanie Kramer - and immediately has a praise for the firm’s team: “It’s running super good.”
The fact that she can rely on recorded processes makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming relocation of the private food point.
She has already contacted a local facility in terms of kindergarten and cripples.
And if everything works as desired, she hopes to be able to follow her hobby here as soon as possible - and get to know the most beautiful jogging lines of the Rottal.

“If many companies are not good and 6.8 million people are in short work alone in Germany, then the need for entertainment is limited,” Cramer explained.
The Dortmund marketing chief praised the BVB pros for their salary share loss to help overcome the crisis: “Of course, the players know that their loss of salary has a different effect than if we put on short work 100 people working in merchandising.”
Mince wonders: Early start to life with a few hundred grams
Almost heavier than a packerl butter, just once three tablespoons of blood in his entire body: that was Gabriel when he was born - he weighed exactly 273 grams.
The Bub is one of about 400 mornings that are cared for annually at the Graz Children's Hospital.
A quarter of them weigh less than 1,500 grams, a few - like Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael - are extremely lightweight with not even one kilogram of birth weight.
They are born so small and so early that neither lungs, nor intestines, nor muscles are fully trained.
Their skin is sometimes so tender that they could hurt the electrodes of an ECG.
And they are so tiny that they sometimes wear dolls and specially made mini-windles for them.
But not so small that they would not be in voice - and like - dirty Berndt Urlesberger.

Kalbitz-Rauswurf from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of \"Few leaf\"
From the point of view of the FDP, Andreas Kalbitz's exclusion from the AfD is only a “fee sheet” and does not change anything about the character of the party.
“The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the right extremes in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the tip of the iceberg of radicals in the AfD - said the FDP domestic politician Benjamin Strasser of the news agency dpa in Berlin.
On Saturday in Stuttgart after several hours of negotiations, the Bundesschiedsgericht of AfD confirmed the exclusion of Kalbitz, which the Federal Board of Directors had formally decided in May.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AfD Group at the Brandenburg Landtag.
\"If the AfD were really about removing right-wing extremists consistently from their party, officials such as Björn Höcke and his supporters would have been excluded for a long time, said Strasser.
\"However, there is no political will in the AfD because right-wing extremism is now part of the party,
Similarly, CSU Secretary General Markus Blume said: “And Andreas Kalbitz is now left out, doesn’t say anything and doesn’t change anything, he said to the “world on Sunday”
“In contrast, it speaks volumes of how many French supporters still have a right-wing extractor in the middle of the AfD,
Flower assumes that the AfD will land again under five percent in elections.
\"The days of AfD in the parliaments are counted,
Kalbitz was one of the spokespersons of the officially dissolved, winged, around Thuringia's AfD country and group chairman Björn Höcke; the constitutional protection of the river as a \"secured right-wing extremist endeavor\".
In May, the Federal Board of AfD threw Kalbitz out of the party.
As a reason, he stated that Kalbitz had not indicated a previous membership in the now forbidden right-wing extremes, \"Home faithful German Youth\" (HDJ) and the Republicans.
Kalbitz contests membership in the HDJ.
Even the chairman of the left-wing group at the Brandenburg Landtag, Sebastian Walter, stressed that the decision of the Bundesschiedsgericht did not change the character of the AfD: “The Wolf ate only Kreide.
The AfD remains an extreme right party, whether with or without Kalbitz,
Neither the Federal Party nor the right wing will be weakened by this decision.
“The maneuver of the Meuthen-Trouppe is visible.
One wants to escape further observation through constitutional protection and try to get through under the radar - said Walter.
“The AfD won’t get rid of the spirits she called.
The decision in Kalbitz case was commented by the Brandenburger SPD Secretary General Erik Stohn.
\"This is where the AfD Association and the Group have held to the right of its leader to this day,
The legal debate on the membership of Kalbitz in the AfD will continue.
He announced on Saturday that he would now take civil action against the decision of the Bundesschiedsgericht.
North Sea wind farms supply well 21 percent more electricity
The wind power plants on the German North Sea fed electricity into the grid during the first six months of the year 11.51 terawatt hours.
This is well over 21 percent more than during the same period of the previous year, the network operator Tennet reported in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of the North Sea power to mainland and the transmission through the German electricity grid.
The wind turbines on the Baltic Sea, which are not part of Tennet's network area, fed another 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
Overall, the wind current from the North and Baltic Seas comes to 13,73 TWh, compared to 11,64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The wind harvest at sea thus accounts for almost 19 percent of the total wind current in Germany, which is about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms ensure higher production capacity
In addition to wind conditions, the increased contribution of offshore wind energy results from higher production capacities, as new wind farms have gone to the grid over the past 12 months.
If the 1270 wind power plants in the North Sea were all running at the same time with full power, they could generate 6.7 gigawatts of electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient, according to Tennet at 7.1 gigawatt.
By 2030, it is expected to rise to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea.
“In Germany and the Netherlands, we are investing EUR 20 billion in the expansion of offshore network connections by then,” said Tennet Managing Director Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, wind farms are also unable to expand their capacity at sea, but reach about 40 percent.
The previous record day this year is January 2nd, when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea windwheels produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, equivalent to three to four nuclear power plants.
This could provide electricity for almost seven million households.
Kunst-Skirmish - an exhibition by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold in the gallery of the Gmünder Kunstverein.
This was almost a small anniversary celebration to 130.
Birthday of the Gmünder Kunstverein: The opening of the exhibition “Skirmish” with works by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold blew the usual framework after the Corona break.
Much more art friends than usual followed the dialogue between the artist and the chairman of the Kunstverein, Professor Dr. Klaus Ripper.
The musical equivalent supplied the band \"Defenders of the Universe\" on the southern Kornhausplatz.
On the north side of the gallery was the association “Sandtogether”
Freital: Windbergfest cancelled because of Corona
The windberg festival does not take place this year.
The city of Freital has cancelled the three-day celebration planned in September.
In other years, more than 30,000 people attended this city festival.
\"We have certainly not made this decision easy, and, knowing how difficult it is for the stakeholders to be able to do so until the last minute, Supreme Mayor Uwe Rumberg (partyless).
“But ultimately, we are responsible for the health of many thousands of people as organizers,
For if tens of thousands had flowed to the fortress and the fortress, minimum distances, hygiene regulations and contact tracking could not have been complied with in accordance with the current Corona Protection Regulation.
Or the restrictions would have been so strong that there would not have been much left of a popular festival.
In addition, the organisational and monitoring effort would disproportionately increase by a multiple.
Rumberg died next year.
Then the city of Freital celebrates its 100th anniversary, among other things, with the Winterbergfest from 7 to 9 May 2021 and the day of Saxony from 10 to 12 September 2021.
Dressur-Olympiasieger Werth in Achleiten not to beat
Achleiten - The six-time Olympic champion Isabell Werth was the most outstanding rider at the Dressur Tournament in the Austrian Achleiten.
The 51-year-old from Rheinberg came to four victories on weekends.
After she had won a Grand Prix for the opening with Weihegold and Quantaz, she was also in the Grand Prix Special on Sunday and not to beat in the short.
On Sunday, at the 15-year-old Stute Weihegold, Werth was clearly opposed by Austrian Victoria Max-Theurer on Abegglen.
Also in the short time, the German was on Saturday on Quantaz clearly before her 34-year-old student Victoria Max-Theurer.
Werth's winner horse Quantaz belongs to Max-Theurer.
The most successful dressage rider in the world is to establish the ten-year stallion in the Grand Prix.
For Quantaz it was the first short ever.
At the first tournament in Achleiten three weeks ago, Werth had won all the important four tests.
The last of the three international tournaments is scheduled for 14 to 16 August.
In the future, more air traffic jams in Worms
The Worms University continues to the airstrip: The DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung (DFS) is setting up a professorship for Air Traffic Management.
A corresponding contract between the university and the DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was initially concluded for three years and started in 2021.
With the professorship there is the possibility to allow the start of the studies not only in the summer, but also in the winter semester.
This allows twice as many students to be trained as before.
At the same time, the capacities are equally taxed both in the university and at the DFS's Air Safety Academy.
The DFS will advise the university in setting up and occupying the professorship.
Represented at the University since 2019
Since the summer semester 2019, the first students are in the Air Traffic Management course as part of their training for flight traffic training at Worms University.
Nine students started this year.
So far, the experiences of the DFS are very positive, the performances of the students are excellent.
The combination of study and lottery training contributes significantly to further increasing the attractiveness of the lottery profession.
\"In these times, we do not find economic support easy.
However, we are firmly expecting air traffic to recover and to grow again in the long term.
In order to be able to fulfill our statutory mandate in the future, we need highly qualified staff, says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, Chairman of the DFS at the signing of the contract.
\"For the DFS, the Foundation's professorship is a forward-looking investment that will provide air traffic controllers with a broad, cross-border knowledge base in the long term.
We therefore continue the good cooperation with the university and at the same time strengthen our attractiveness as an employer,
Professor Jens Hermsdorf, President of Worms University, also underlines this: “The Foundation's professorship forms an important bridge between science and economics.
With it, we would like to associate with the existing cooperation with the DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practical partner for the dual Bachelor's degree program Air Traffic Management -
For the University of Worms, the confidence of German aviation security was also a motivation and commitment to further expand their teaching and research skills in the future fields of aviation.
In use for tomorrow's flight slots, the university with its first foundation professorship for a dual course of study could set very special highlights and innovative priorities for its students.
Dr. Denis Alt, Secretary of State at the Ministry of Science, Training and Culture, emphasises: \"The University of Worms has a unique position in Rhineland-Palatinate with its emphasis on air transport.
The signing of the cooperation agreement today strengthens the profile of the university,
Rescue helicopter lands on the A 45
Around 30 minutes, the A 45 motorway was completely closed on Saturday afternoon towards Aschaffenburg, since after a traffic accident the rescue helicopters were in operation.
A 76-year-old drove straight ahead with a Ford at 12.40 p.m. at the exit Alzenau-Mitte in the curve and landed at the guiding board.
The impact triggered the front airbags, the driver suffered slight injuries in the face and had to be brought to a hospital for treatment.
The injuries of the 72-year-old co-driver were provided by the notary and the patient flew to a hospital following the rescue helicopter.
At present, however, the police assume that there is no risk of life.
The damaged vehicle, which caused damage of approximately 2000 euros, had to be dragged off.
Heil wants to check other industries after meat industry
The Corona Crisis again brought the conditions to light in parts of the meat industry.
Law-enforcement is about to occur.
But are they right - and will they stay with it?
Federal Minister of Labour Hubertus Heil (SPD) also intends to review other industries in accordance with the now planned strict rules against abuses in the meat industry.
“We will look at our industry for industry and then take appropriate measures for the respective industry if necessary,” said the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany's employer has already warned against restricting work contracts in general.
After the massive Corona outbreak at the Fleischreisen Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Federal Cabinet will decide on this Wednesday a law of healing.
Large slaughterers are no longer allowed to use foreign personnel in slaughtering, dismantling and meat processing.
This is to prohibit the use of work contracts and temporary workers there.
Employer President Ingo Kramer said to the dpa: \"Finger away from a general restriction on work contracts and workers' leave if one does not want to completely detonate the economy\"
Work contracts, for example, are the basis for their value added to customers for large areas of craftsmanship, construction industry and plant construction.
\"The failures of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument,
Heil assured: \"My goal is not to ban work contracts anywhere in the German economy\"
Work contracts are meaningful.
\"If an industrial plant is commissioned by a craftsman to build a safety plant, this is a very normal working contract,
The German meat industry holds a ban on work contracts and loan work only in its industry for a constitutionally unconstitutional.
It is not clear why, when porting and packaging cheeses, other labour law should apply in the future than for sausages, it says in an opinion on the bill, as reported by the \"New Osnabrücker Zeitung\" (Samstag).
In the event of a ban, the consumer price would therefore rise by 10 to 20 percent per kilo and product.
Many Eastern European workers from work contract companies worked 16 hours a day in the industry according to the results of a review of the NRW Labour Protection Administration.
They often had no break.
Pay was retained for protective equipment or rent.
It was also found that the situation in the accommodation of employees was often miserable.
Heil said that in 2017 a relatively sharp law had entered into force for the meat industry.
However, through “trick-rich constructions” these had been bypassed.
“Now, it’s essential to clean up,
The politician announced: \"The Labour Protection Act, which we intend to adopt at the end of July in the Cabinet, also includes measures not only concerning the meat industry, such as higher testing rates for occupational protection or clear criteria for Community accommodation,
The draft of the dpa includes amendments to the law on the safeguarding of workers' rights in the meat sector and to the Act on the Protection of Labour.
Brandenburg's Minister for Consumer Protection Ursula Nonnemacher (Green) considers more intensive controls necessary.
“I wish we could do even more checks in many areas of oversight: food controls, animal protection, everything possible, for example animal transport,” said nunnemacher on Sunday in the RBB broadcast “Brandenburg up-to-date”
However, more personnel were also needed for more control.
Three dead at the crash of ultralight aircraft in Germany
When an ultra-light aircraft crashed into a multi-family house in Wesel in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, three people died, according to the police.
A child was slightly injured.
Two more people had been injured in the accident, said a spokesperson from the Wesel county council.
A parachute was found at the accident site, the police say.
The \"Rheinische Post\" reported in appeal to eyewitnesses that before the crash, the plane had crashed with a hot air balloon.
The house is a one- or two-family house.
More details were not first known.
Space of Frankfurt Opera Square is peaceful
A week after the outpourings in Frankfurt, the premises of the Opera Square were also peaceful at night on Sunday.
Finally, a dozen people remained in the place, but left him at 1:00 a.m. before the end of the lockout.
The police have been working with numerous officials since the early evening, a major police call was seen throughout the city area.
For the first time this weekend, from midnight, there was a ban on participation for the opera court, on which it had come to Krawallen a week ago.
Police had been attacked with bottles out of the crowd of celebraters.
At least five officials were injured, several police vehicles were damaged after police entrances.
The night to Saturday was also quiet.
Car overruns: Young woman seriously injured in accident on Bundesstraße 83 near Hofgeismar
In an accident between Schöneberg and Humme, a 21-year-old suffered serious injuries on Sunday at 1.25 p.m.
She was taken to Kassel Hospital.
With thermal imaging cameras, the firefighter sought potential drivers.
According to the police on the Bundesstraße 83, the woman was on her way towards her home town of Humme, when her car came off the highway from previously unexplained, and was overcrowded several times.
In order to save the injured, the firefighter had to cut the roof of the car free.
Since it was unclear whether anyone was still in the vehicle, the adjacent cornfield was searched from the rotary conductor with a thermal camera.
The Drohnenstaffel from Warburg, who also works with thermal imaging cameras, has also been ordered to search for persons.
However, the employing forces did not find anyone between the high corn plants.
The seriously injured person was brought to the Kasseler Klinikum by means of the rescue car.
Almost 50 forces of the Hofgeismar, Humme and Schöneberg firefighters were on site.
The federal road was closed for two hours because of the accident.
Juventus Turin Master in Italy
Turin - After a redeeming goal of Cristiano Ronaldo, record champion Juventus Turin has secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in series.
The team around the five-time world footballer made the total 36th Skudetto of the club history with a 2:0 (1:0) on Sunday evening in the home game against Sampdoria Genoa perfect.
Ronaldo met at 1:0 before the half-time.
With 83 points, Turin, who was without the last long injured ex-national player Sami Khedira, was unable to push two days before the end of the series A from one place to the next.
The second table of Inter Milan is seven points.
Juventus was harmless despite optical superiority in the first half of the day, then Ronaldo met with the last action after a release.
The 35-year-old Miralem Pjanic used a flat shot (45.+7) from the penalty limit.
Ronaldo was also involved in 2:0 against the more offensive guests, after he shot Federico Bernardeschi (67.).
Thus, the glamourless but crucial success was ensured.
The foulelfmeter shot at the latte in the 89th minute should only Ronaldo himself have sewn properly with a view to the Torjäger rating.
“It is complicated to stay mentally and physically at ball height for 90 minutes.
The games are strange, and the momentum changes very easily - said coach Maurizio Sarri after 1:2 at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Especially the spiritual exhaustion of his players was great, said the Juve-Coach.
Because of the defeat, the Turiners had not yet perfected the championship.
At the end, Juve had due to the competitors' weakness, which was calming down at the top of the table.
The Sarri team had only five victories in the eleven games before the game on Sunday.
Whether Ronaldo will still be a goalkeeper's king is questionable.
During the Portuguese Superstar, the former Dortmunder Ciro Immobile reached 31 goals after his three-pack at 5:1 (1:1) of the table-four Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona already has 34 hits on his account - as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to FC Bayern's winning title.
The record in Italy holds the current Juve-Profi Gonzalo Higuaín.
The Argentinian won 36 goals for the SSC Naples in the 2015/2016 season.
In August, the next title chance is waiting for the Italian football “Old Dame”.
Juventus is in the Eighth Final of the Champions League, but on August 7 against Olympique Lyon has to make a 0:1-Hinspielpleite bet to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
In the next K.o. round, Real Madrid or Manchester City would wait as an opponent.
Baden-Württemberg: Over 250 illegal car races recorded
Stuttgart - Allen threatened punishments and court rulings for spite of this, drivers continue to give gas when there are countless illegal races on the Baden-Württemberg streets: Last year and the first four months of this year, police in the southwest have already registered more than 250 illegal car races.
There are no comparable values for the previous years, but the breeders are increasingly working for the judicial authorities.In 2018, a total of 155 investigation procedures were conducted in the state prosecutorships between Konstanz and Mannheim due to illegal races, a year later it was already 252 and in the current year until the beginning of June 151.
The race was less concerned with organized events, as the answer from the Ministry of the Interior to a request from the Landtag SPD.
In most cases, the drivers would have acted spontaneously against each other, or they would have taken the flight from the police - this is also shown as an illegal race.
In particular, German men between the ages of 18 and 60 were on the tax.
113 fines - 15 times imprisonment
Only in comparatively few cases are the breeders caught and also asked for cash: According to the Ministry of Interior, a total of 113 fines have been imposed since 2018 and 15 sentences of imprisonment have been issued.
However, there is no indication that the number of illegal car races actually increases.
Rather, due to the many tragic accidents and processes of past years, other drivers reacted more sensitively than before and showed more frequently, said a minister.
Especially popular with Rasern is the highway 8. Again and again, car drivers are braking out the traffic there to give themselves space and use the free route for a race.
Last August, a dozen riders near Kirchheim were caught under Teck, three months earlier, there were even 18 riders at the A8 at Mercklingen.
A81 is the most popular race route
On the A81 the police even recorded more races than on any other federal highway.
With a tempo limit, the lawn is tried to break down on the particularly affected section between snags and geisingen.
The mostly high-priced sports and luxury carouses often have Swiss characteristics, because the drivers deviate from the lawn to Germany due to the high penalties for fast driving and car racing in the neighbouring country.
For the SPD, the pace limit should not be reduced to a few routes: “With a general pace limit of 130 hours a mile we would create this problem on highways of the body,” says Martin Rivoir, the transport experts of the SPD Landtag Group.
“The inhibition threshold for lawns would be significantly higher if you are not supposed to be here and there legally with 200 hour kilometers and more on the road,
Rivoir is less concerned with education or image campaigns: “Those who so far go beyond all the rules and not only their own lives, but also the lives of other traffickers can hardly be reached with reason,
ADAC calls for greater police intervention
On the other hand, ADAC is not enough: “We assume that lawns are not deterred by the pace limits,” says Holger Bach, Head of Transport and the Environment at the ADAC Württemberg.
It calls for additional and even harder controls on the routes concerned.
Not rarely will the high-passenger force measure be more painful and serious: since January 2019 and until April 2020, three people have died in the races throughout the country, two of them uninvolved in a nocturnal crash in Stuttgart's city centre and one in Gerlingen.
In November, two young men were supposed to have delivered a car race.
One of the vehicles came down from the street, bragging against a garden wall and lying on the side, which died 18-year-old passenger.
21 more people have been injured in the races of the past two years.
In the opinion of Minister of Interior Thomas Strobl, however, sharper penalties are not necessary: \"Legal action is necessary to make illegal car racing harder, it is not seen - it is said in the paper of the Ministry of the Interior.

Ackermann sprints to victory on final stage at Sibiu Tour
Radprofi Pascal Ackermann fought his second day victory at the final stage of the 10th Sibiu Tour.
The 26-year-old Palatinate of the Bora-hansgrohe team went on the 109-mile-long section with its start and destination in Hermannstadt in mass print after he had already won a stage on Saturday.
The season wins were three and four for Ackermann.
In the overall ranking, his Austrian team companion Gregor Mühlberger continued.
The 26-year-old decided the mountaintime ride in the morning and thus took over the top of the class.
Only 104 drivers arrived at the final stage in the evening.
Not less than 18 starters had fallen victim to the time limit in the mountaintime.
“I’m really happy to start the season restart with a victory,” Ackermann explained after his success on Saturday.
“The sprint was really hectic,” said the 26-year-old.
300 meters in front of the target, he simply drew his sprint, and it also worked perfectly.
According to the rules of the World Association UCI, a Corona test was carried out six days before the start of the race for all race participants and their companions.
During the complete round trip, drivers and operators in isolated hygienic bubbles were separated from the organization team as well as from the media.
Viewers at start and target were not allowed.
Headquarters gave instructions for lay reanimation
Düsseldorf - Tragic accident on Sunday afternoon in Düsseldorf-Garath.
In a multifamily house, a child (4) was suddenly leblos in the water while bathing.
According to Fire Force, the emergency call arrived at 1 p.m. shortly before 1 p.m.
“A control unit immediately gave instructions for lay reanimation,” said a fire fighter to BILD.
The rescue forces on board took the revitalisation measures little later.
The child floating at risk of life was transported to the uniclinical during reanimation.
Why it failed is unclear.
The police routinely recorded the investigation of the accident.
The fire speaker said: \"We are going from a tragic accident in the apartment \"
Nuremberg: Unauthorised Tuning Meeting - Police intervene, 700 vehicles and about 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and temporarily over 1000 people participated in a “tuning meeting” Saturday night in the parking lot of a furniture house.
The police used their announcement to control such events more strongly.
A big tuning meeting was held on Saturday evening (July 25, 2020) in Nuremberg's southern city.
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to the Central France Police, an increased vehicle volume in the area of a large parking lot on Ingolstadt Street was detected at 22.30 a.m. by the Nuremberg Transport Police.
The police then carried out a wide range of vehicle checks.
It was not until recently that the police had announced that they wanted to step up their efforts against so-called autopossessors.
Illegal tuning meetings in Nuremberg: Only a small part of the “scene”
The officials were among the top 700 vehicles and about 1100 people, the police balances.
However, only a small proportion of those present were assigned to the ‘autoposer’ and ‘tuning scene’.
The majority of the relevant scene apparently followed the police's appeal.
On the basis of the on-site vehicles and persons, it was assumed that these were mostly spectacular.
In addition, the majority of the persons present were in the existing infection protection provisions, in particular the maintenance of minimum distance and the wearing of a mouth-nose protection.
The on-the-spot control measures were completed at 1:00.
In total, the officials found such structural changes in 10 vehicles that the operating permit was lost.
Four of these vehicles had to be secured.
No Car Racing
Illegal car races didn't exist.
\"The Central Franc Police Bureau will continue to monitor the situation and continue to carry out increased control measures, including in connection with the rise of the showmen,\" it said.
The News5 agency spoke to Jürgen Schrödinger of the company involved: “They have all the beautiful rims, which we must not scratch, so Schrödinger says.
Special bands would be used for this.
Also because the cars are wider, the company has to be careful not to make any damage.
\"The young people should finally keep their cars safe,
Number of work agency: 900 suspected cases of abuse in short-term work
Berlin - The Federal Agency for Labour (BA) is reporting around 900 suspect cases on abuse of short-workers' money, according to its own statement.
“This is extremely little in the case of more than 880,000 companies who have shown short-time work,” said Daniel Terzenbach, Executive Board responsible for operational business, the “Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung”
When, at the beginning of the Corona crisis, many companies suddenly requested short work, the BA had to react quickly.
Usually, the test lasted up to three weeks.
\"So much time was not available to us in this hot phase.
All the more precisely, we will look at the final accounts.
I'm sure there'll be some more.
We are not naïve and have a long breath,
Evidence of abuse often comes from the employees or trade unions concerned.
In addition, BA uses analysis software to detect abuse patterns.
According to Terzenbach, the BA prepares for a possible insolvency wave in autumn.
“Will there be significantly more insolvencies than in the previous year?
The assessments are disparaging, but we are waving our way into the case of the case and are already training our employees in the employment agencies for the processing of applications for insolvency money,
The figures were still inconspicuous, Terzenbach said.
World Heritage in Potsdam: Party dissolved in the New Garden
Potsdam - On Friday evening about 40 young people celebrated a party in the New Garden.
The collection was dissolved at 20.48 a.m. by the revitalists of the Prussian castles and gardens (SPSG) Foundation, the foundation informed on PNN request.
The young people would have left the park.
On Saturday evening, some youths would have played in the Neue Garten rugby.
The meadow had been cleared by Revierfahrer, said SPSG spokesman Frank Kallensee on Sunday.
Again and again, illegal celebrations in the parks
In the Parks of the Foundation there are a number of collections where the distance and hygiene rules of Covid-19 are not complied with.
At the end of June there was a celebration with about 300 people in Babelsberg Park, a week later about 150 people celebrated in the New Garden.
Even without corona regulation, the parks are closed when the darkness breaks.
The stocking on the meadows is prohibited according to park order, there are few exceptions.
The Foundation has long complained that visitors would leave more and more garbage behind and destroy protected biotopes.
In Berlin, illegal park parties have now reached a different dimension.
In the Hasenheide in the district of Neukölln, 5000 people celebrated an illegal Techno party at night on Sunday.
The event was dissolved by the police.
Austria: Mass tests after Corona outbreak in tourist location
With hundreds of tests, authorities have responded to a corona outbreak in the popular Upper Austrian tourist town of St. Wolfgang.
The number of confirmed cases increased to 48, as reported by the national authorities in Linz.
More than 100 results stood out in the evening.
As a result, many of the infected young trainees are in tourism companies, but at least one guest has been tested positively.
Residents, guests and tourism staff were asked to stay at their accommodations on Saturday evening.
The lock time was set at 23 o'clock.
“There are cancellations and cancellations there,” said Hans Wieser, the head of the Wolfgangsee Tourist Association, the dpa.
Also, some guests were arriving early.
St. Wolfgang is the most important tourist destination in Upper Austria, with more than 400,000 overnight stays last year.
In a normal season about a third of the guests are German.
On Friday the first infections had become publicly known.
On Saturday, the head of the District Authority, Alois Lanz, defended the behaviour of the trainees who had celebrated in several locales and who could have settled there.
“We all enjoyed doing this in our youth,” he said to the Ö1 radio station.
However, on Friday two bars were closed to prevent further infections.
The Tourism Association launched an information campaign to raise awareness of young employees for the dangers of Covid-19.
From Saturday onwards, hundreds of employees, holidaymakers and locals were tested.
In addition, all guests who were in St. Wolfgang from July 15th were contacted.
The outbreak awakens memories of the Austrian ski and party resort of Ischgl in Tyrol, which was a center of Corona spread throughout Europe during the early period of the pandemic.
In Austria, more than 1500 people are currently infected with the virus.
The focus of the new infections is Vienna and Upper Austria.
Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualified for Champions League
London (dpa) - The English football record champion Manchester United returns to the Champions League after a year of absence.
On the last day of the Premier League's game, the Red Devils secured the third table space through a 2:0 (0:0) success against Leicester City's direct competitor.
The Foxes must now be pleased with the Europe League because the FC Chelsea was still passing and qualified as a fourth for the royal class as well.
In the battle against the descent Aston was allowed to cheer Villa.
Manchester United was led by Bruno Fernandes (71st minute).
After a red card for Leicester City in the post-playing period Jesse Lingard (90.+8) got to the finish level.
Chelsea, in the Champions-League-Achtel-final opponent of FC Bayern, won against the Wolverhampton hikers thanks to Mason Mount (45.+1) and Olivier Giroud (45.+4) in parallel with 2:0 (2:0).
“This means a lot to me,” said coach Frank Lampard, who was in his first season as Chelsea Coach in the finals of the FA Cup against Arsenal.
From Chelsea's victory against Wolverhampton also benefited Tottenham Hotspur, who, with a lean 1:1 (1:0) at Crystal Palace, still passed by the Wolves and started as sixth in the Europa League.
Aston Villa decided on the distance with the FC Watford and the AFC Bournemouth for himself, but he had to sit down at West Ham United for a long time.
The late leadership of Jack Grealish (84th) seemed immediate andrej Jarmolenko (85th).
But the 1:1 (0:0) was sufficient because Watford lost at Arsenal at 2:3 (1:3).
The club, which scored three coaches in the season, will decline after five first league years.
Like Bournemouth, who could no longer save himself through a 3:1 (2:1) FC Everton.
In the end, a point was missing.
The FC Liverpool, which has been a master of English since the end of June, secured a club record with a 3:1 (1:1) victory at Newcastle United.
99 counters are the highest value the Reds have ever achieved in a football season.
Coach Jürgen Klopp and his team just barely missed the score record in English football.
The best brand holds Manchester City with 100 points in the 2017/18 season.
After the Newcastle leadership in the first minute Virgil van Dijk (38.), Divock Origi (59.) and Sadio Mané (89.) shot the party on Sunday for Liverpool.
“For this wonderful club it was an extraordinary season,” said Torschütze van Dijk after the game, “that should encourage us to defend the title.
It's gonna be hard.
In the end, the Premier League bosses should also be satisfied.
Because of the Coronavirus crisis, football was interrupted in England from 13 March to 17 June.
In the meantime, even premature demolition or extradition of the remaining games was discussed on neutral ground.
Finally, however, the season could be finished without any special events - but as in Germany without spectators in the stadiums.
Arrests and violence in demonstrations against Netanyahu
Protests in Israel against Head of State Netanyahus are becoming more and more violent.
During the night, violent conflicts arose.
On the night of Sunday in Jerusalem, the Israeli police were violently opposed to participants in a demonstration against the right-wing governor Benjamin Netanjahu.
Twelve people had been arrested for taking part in riots, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld told them.
The police, among other things, used waterlights to dissolve the rally.
A total of 6000 people gathered near Netanyahu's office after media reports on Saturday evenings.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanyahu's dealing with the Corona crisis.
The protesters beat drums, blew in horns, and called Netanjahu to resign.
Participants in an area demonstration supporting Netanjahu also reported the news page \"ynet\"
Many other places in Israel also demonstrated people, including in front of the private villa of the Head of Government in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
A man was arrested according to police records near Tel Aviv because it is suspected of having sprayed from a driving car Pfefferspray on demonstrators on the roadside.
Another man was arrested after a knife attack on a demonstrator in the south of the country.
The demonstrator was easily injured at the neck.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, there have recently been several demonstrations against Netanyahu.
The rallyes accompany the corruption process against the head of government.
Netanyahu was recently criticized for his handling of the Corona Crisis.
It is reserved, among other things, for fast lockers and a lack of preparation for a second corona wave.
The Corona crisis has seriously increased the country's economy.
The unemployment rate was more than 20 percent.
The number of new infections with the Coronavirus in Israel has recently risen to new record values.

Several rescue cars took them to a hospital in the vicinity.
North Korea locks down border city to Corona suspect
North Korea has so far seen a “shining success” in its own measures to defend the Coronavirus
Now the country reports on a suspect case for the first time.
Because of a first official Corona suspicion in the country, North Korea has completely shut down a big city for fear of disaster.
Despite the most severe epidemiological defense measures in the past six months, “the evil virus could have been dragged into the country,” the state media reported.
The emergency was imposed on the region around the border town of Kaesong.
Communist leadership called out the highest alarm level.
Should the suspect be confirmed, it would be the first official infection case with Sars-CoV-2 in the torn country.
North Korea had not yet registered a single infection, according to its own data, and described its defence measures as “shining success”.
The data were doubted abroad.
According to the reports, symptoms of disease were found in a “outlier” who, on 19 July, illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea.
Three years ago, the person moved to South Korea and now returned across the border.
There was at first no confirmation of the cross-border crossing within the four-kilometre wide and mostly still demented military buffer zone from South Korea.
However, according to reports from Yonhap National News Agency, South Korea's military saw the possibility of illegal border crossing to North Korea as high.
Some people were being examined.
According to North Korea's own information, on Saturday due to the suspicion, a urgency meeting of the Labour Party's political office, chaired by Powerman Kim Jong Un, was convened by North Korea.
The “dangerous situation in Kaesong could cause a deadly and destructive disaster”
Kim had already arranged on Friday as a preventive measure to \"block Kaesong completely and isolate each district and region from others\" it was further mentioned.
The data subject as well as all the people in Kaesong who had had contact with her had been placed under quarantine.
The central military commission of the party is therefore to investigate the \"outrun\" and the conduct of the responsible military unit, and to impose severe penalties, where appropriate.
According to estimates in Kaesong, some 300,000 people live.
Tension before the Council meeting: City-East and noise protection are still facing a large summer break for discussion
\"In addition to environmental issues, the members of the bodies will also vote on the construction plan for the major project of the Inner Town Development East - it is more incidental in the middle of the urban press release to the next municipal council meeting on Tuesday, 28 July, at 16.30 p.m. in the Grand Hall of CongressCentrums Pforzheim.
In particular, the evaluation of the eastern city is discussed controversially until the end.
The majority of them are hardly, last but not least in individual committees, depending on the presence of them.
An appeal from the economy (construction, real estate, trade and IT) that was developed out of citizenship and then by the administration and municipal council not now fail after almost ten years of preparation, criticised project opponents Reinhard Klein as an \"outside parliamentary opposition\" - \"anxiety-free\" -speculation - \"consumption-and-conscious false statements\"
“All of them think they know better,” says Klein, who has been the sole representative of Pforzheim’s mayor for the past year.
In fact, after reading the contracts in this position, he said: \"I know what I'm talking about,
The exit is cheaper for the city, the Technical Town Hall is opposed to statements by the city administration on grants, whose existence Small is convinced to renovate for 8,5 million euros.
The city will develop quite differently when forecasting from the economy in the town hall and from the advocates.
The city by its own strength and not an investor: this is its plan B. One day after Klein, the FDP/FW/UB/LED group, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
It also essentially includes the renovation of the Technical Town Hall, the opening of the Schloßberg, the renting of the ex-Thale for administrative areas and a smaller inner-city transformation in an ideal case with local carriers.
Environmental issues play a central role
In addition, environmental issues will play a central role.
For example, the Municipal Council will vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the Pforzheim population from health noise, caused by road traffic, including frequent pace reductions.
In a press release, the local transport club welcomes Germany's widespread introduction of tempo 30. However, the political leaders in the city are not innocent of the need to do so because they have only contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus noise by neglecting line bus traffic with diluted clocks and by little commitment to bike traffic, according to the VCD.
The Municipal Council also agrees on the participation of the city of Pforzheim/Enzkreis in the energy and climate protection agency.
In addition, the agenda for accession to the Climate Change Pact of the State of Baden-Württemberg, the re-establishment of parental contributions in urban childcare facilities and the application for inclusion in the Federal Smart City Fund.
Citizens are welcome, but Corona protection measures must be taken.
With a lot of delay Tim Zimmermann starts the new season
With almost half a year of delay, Tim Zimmermann will start his premiere season in the ADAC GT Masters on July 31.
Before the league of Supersportwagen can take up the regular operation, the first test rides started.
For Zimmermann, it was mainly about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3.
The Corona Crisis has long prevented Tim Zimmermann from embarking on his first service in the new Lamborghini Huracan of Grasser Racing.
This was now possible under special hygiene conditions.
The 23-year-old Langenargener turned his first rounds on the Lausitzring and was able to get used to his premiere in the GT3 car.
“There are a few things that are different from the Porsche from the previous season,” says Zimmermann.
“With the ABS, for example, you have to go into the curves differently.
But it really took a lot of fun,
He also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with which he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite having only 25 years of experience in GT sports, the Dutchman has been able to help his new teammate in many things.
“I am not a beginner in motorsport, but every new series also presents new challenges,” says Zimmermann.
“Steyen and I understand blindingly and we have also made enormous progress on the Lausitzring from session to session,
Right there - at the Lausitzring - the GT Masters will also play his first race.
From July 31 the 33 super sports cars will be raced through the Lausitz.
Zimmermann, who is one of 15 series newbies, knows the route.
In 2015, he was the last guest in the Motodrom.
“It worked fast and I had to get used to little on the track,” says Zimmermann, who is starting for the Friedrichshafen racing community Graf Zeppelin.
“The Lausitzring has many fast passages that you need to meet optimally to be fast,
How fast Zimmermann is then, that turns out to be in two weeks.
“The teams of course poker a little during the tests - he thinks.
“At last, however, we are very satisfied and look forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring,
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a densely pushed calendar.
Seven races are scheduled until early November.
Currently there is no viewers being allowed - but there is a prominent guest.
In mid-August on the Nürburgring, ex-Formel-1-Pilot Niko Hülkenberg will take over the GT steering wheel.
British Minister for Transport of quarantine decision caught cold
According to press reports, the decision of the British Government to place Spanish citizens under quarantine for two weeks after their return has caught the country's Minister of Transport cold.
According to this, Grant Shapps is currently on vacation in Spain, while his colleagues at home on Saturday decided to take the action.
Because of the increase in Corona numbers in Spain, the London Cabinet removed the country from the list of countries from which entry without quarantine charges is possible.
The new regulation will apply from today, Sunday, so that even after his return to quarantine will have to be done.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures on returnees.
But the rule applies to those who are just on the day of vacation, only from Saturday, 1 August, and have not been introduced overnight.
In Austria, by the way, Spain is still considered one of the \"safe countries\" for which no quarantine is needed in Austria.
“Many ministers may have previously known that there is a possibility that a quarantine will be imposed on Spanish holidaymakers,” said Labour deputy Diane Abbot.
“But obviously no one has made the effort to say Grant Shapp’s words,
Almost a month after the end of the Corona emergency in Spain and the end of the severe initial barrier, infection rates in the country rise again.
Virologists are primarily responsible for nightlife for the new spread.
Spain is one of the most popular holiday countries in Britain.
From unnecessary travel to the Spanish mainland, the British government currently advises that the Canary Islands and Balearic Islands are particularly popular among British holidaymakers.
To date, more than 272,000 infections with the novel Coronavirus and more than 28,000 deaths have been recorded in Spain.

Until the Munichers can deal with the final tournament and a training camp at the Algarve in advance, however, the eight-final duty against the FC Chelsea stands for the first time.
After 3:0 in the play in front of the Corona break, the Londoners in the home arena should not become the Bayern album room again in 2012 as in the lost finale dahoam.

After days of individual and small group training, the team is now trained for the Londoners, who are in contrast to the Flick ensemble in the game rhythm.
After that, the Munichers could face a quarter final against the FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi, in the semi-finals real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin are possible opponents.

Formula 1 needs a special rule to shorten its world champion
Since the number of continents required cannot be driven, the FIA must improvise in order to grant the World Cup title.
All the American races, however, were canceled.
Race calendar is becoming more and more concrete
The race calendar of the current Formula 1 season continues to take shape.
Three more race tracks were added during the week to the ten confirmed Grand Prix.
In October, the Nürburgring is to be run in Germany and in Portimão in Portugal.
On the first of November Lewis Hamilton and Co. fight for World Cup points on the Italian tradition race in Imola.
This will include the race calendar 2020 at current level 13 runs.
“We are pleased that we continue to make great progress in completing our plans for the 2020 season,” said Formula-1-Boss Chase Carey.
A total of 15 to 18 races in the king's class of motorsport will be completed during this extraordinary season.
Formula 1 wants to complete its season in Asia.
The final race calendar will be fixed and published in the coming weeks.
Prior to the officially announced race in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi in December, media reports could still take place in Vietnam and Malaysia at the end of November.
Regulation requires racing on three continents
The formula 1 regulation requires at least races on three continents for the award of the World Championship.
Even if, as currently planned, only two continents will be driven, there should be a world champion.
With the help of a special rule, the FIA intends to award the title, under appeal to exceptional circumstances, because of the Coronavirus pandemic.
The traditional start of the season in Australia in March had to be canceled in the short term due to the beginning of the Corona Crisis.
A return to the continent this year is not an issue.
In addition, Formula 1 will not be in America this year.
Absage is critical in Brazil
Due to the tense Corona situation, the races in Canada, the USA, Mexico and Brazil will not take place.
“We look forward to being with them again in the next season,” said Carey.
The rejection of the American race was particularly critical in Brazil: “The rejection was not surprising for us, but we cannot accept the reasons for it,” said Tamas Rohonyi, promoter of the Grand Prix in São Paulo.
Thus, the number of infections in the São Paulo area was significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
The concerns of some teams not wanting to drive in Brazil would also not justify absage.
The security measures required were prepared.
Greta Thunberg: evil look against Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her encounter with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest in the well-known Latnight show by Stephen Colbert via video switch and told her in the interview what she had in her head during her encounter with Donald Trump.
Klimatkivistin Greta Thunberg was the guest of a popular U.S.-Latenight show by video switch.
She told me, among other things, about her struggle against the powerful in the world.
The teenager also talked about her famous \"bout look\" at her encounter with Donald Trump.
New York City - In the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has been drawing attention to her tireless commitment to the Fridays For Future movement.
Now she spoke about her plans in the future and her encounter with US President Donald Trump at the UN Climate Summit last year.
Latnight Moderator Stephen Colbert welcomed the 17-year-old Thunberg on Tuesday in your broadcast and conducted a longer interview with the Schwedin.
She talked not only about her struggle against climate change, but also about her conflict with the world's powerful.
“There are some things that surprised me - she meant.
“How far people go to steer the focus away from the climate crisis has shaken them.
“All from organized hate campaigns to threats, just because a group of children go on the road,” she experienced.
Heads of state and leading politicians who ridiculed or even tried to silence them in social media, she finds “satisfying” as she shows the reactions, since they have no other answer to them,
It was particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was addressed to a well-known scene in which she threw a bitter look behind U.S. President Trump.
At the 2019 UN Climate Summit in New York, for which the Actvistin sailed across the Atlantic, its impressive view was captured by the cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
From the short clip came a GIF, i.e. an animated image, which eventually became one of the most commonly used images for trump opponents.
But what did the 17-year-old at that moment think about the U.S. President?
In reply to Stephen Colbert’s question, which was relatively open, she answered in a short and dry manner: “To be honest, I don’t think that needs any further explanation.
The experienced satiriker Colbert did not count with the ready-to-beat answer and was briefly laughing out of the picture.
With her “how do you”-Red on the principles of climate protection, she kept many in mind at the climate conference.

Fleetwood-Mac co-founder Peter Green died
His life was like a roller coaster: after a rapid climb with Fleetwood Mac it went steep downhill and then slowly uphill again.
Now the bluesrock guitarist Peter Green died at the age of 73.
Genial guitarist, drug junkie, cult trailer: The co-founder of the band Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
He died peacefully at the age of 73, and on Saturday he told family members in an official opinion that another opinion would be announced for the next few days.
Top musicians like Peter Frampton appreciated Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional response of a “monumental loss” for all former and current members of the band Fleetwood Mac.
The drummer Fleetwood and the guitarist Green had founded the now longest legendary band in London in 1967, until today his dreamy instrumental hit Albatross is unforgettable.
The life of the musician, The End Of The Game, was equal to a roller coaster ride.
With Fleetwood Mac Green experienced a rapid rise - the band celebrated their greatest successes but then without him.
There should have been a dispute, among other things, because Green wanted to donate all the Group's profits for beneficial purposes.
He began to appear in wide robes and with great crucifix.
Mental problems should also have played a role.
Green left the band in 1970 three years after it was founded.
A social decline followed.
The bluesrock guitarist suffered from drug abuse and schizophrenia, as biographers reported.
Green was treated in psychiatry for a long time.
During much of the 1970s, the musician disappeared from the picture area.
He is supposed to live on the street for a while, when cemetery gardeners worked and spent a long time in an Israeli kibbutz.
Green was born in 1946 as the son of a Jewish working family in the London district of Bethnal Green.
As early as he was young, he was enthusiastic about U.S. blues musicians such as B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
At the age of eleven, he learned the first guitar grips.
At the age of 15 the teenager began playing professional guitar and got five years later the chance to be on stage as lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Loaners.
He was later hired as a substitute for his idol Eric Clapton with the Bluesbreakers.
In the middle of the blues boom, Green founded Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967 together with his bluesbreakers colleagues Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The song Albatross composed by Green gave the group the first number 1 hit in the winter of 1968/69 and catapulted them at the top of the British music scene.
But the rapid rise soon showed its shadow sides: Green did not get the media drum, his experiments with the drug LSD became more and more extreme.
He later commented on the life between music and addiction in an interview: “The worst thing that happened to me in my life is the drugs - the best thing was to land a number 1 hit -
By the end of the decade, Green was surprisingly successful in 1979 with an album inspired by religious themes.
Fleetwood Mac then swim without him in new formation on a success wave.
Her 1977 album \"Rumours\" sold more than 40 million times worldwide.
