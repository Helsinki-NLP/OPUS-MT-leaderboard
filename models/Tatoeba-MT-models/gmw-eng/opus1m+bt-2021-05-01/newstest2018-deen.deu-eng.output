Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
An error-making institution where young people are expected to meet today.
A pit chapel, where the S-Bahn tunnel is now dug.
Small gardeners manage the very basics of farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories on days.
It's annoying if maps aren't up-to-date.
This is known to anyone who had to get upset because the Auto-Navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.
The historical maps of the digital Bayern Atlas, an offer of the Geoportal Bayern of the State Government, are anything but current - but very revealing.
Especially when you compare them with current online maps.
Then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed since the 19th century in the distribution area of Munich Mercury.
The digital Bayern Atlas is a flicking carpet that you don't see as such.
In the large overview map, more detailed maps, so-called Urposition Sheets, were worked out for cities and communities.
According to the Bayerische Vermeinßungsverwaltung between 1810 and 1864, they emerged from the first measurement of Bavaria.
Your client: Napoleon.
The French army leader had occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographical recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.
Even though the French troops finally withdrew with the peace of Lunéville on 9 February 1801: it was the present neighbors who created the idea of a surface-covering Bayern card.
Elector Max IV. Joseph continued to advance the project, founded the Topographical Bureau, and thus the Bayerische Vermeinßamtsverwaltung.
The Urpositionsblatt for Munich dates back to 1856 and can be found, like all others, on the website of the Bavarian Landesbibliothek.
The comparison of early/now is the most impressive example of the state capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is subsendling, which appears in the map of 1856 still relatively isolated.
Sendling was incorporated 21 years after the map was created, i.e. 1877, as Municher Stadtlicht.
Today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.
The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the present-day Plinganserstraße, which was first named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.
Where the West Park is today, you see nothing but fields - at first glance: a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears when zooming in: hand-written pieces from the so-called \"copy\" from which the basic tax was derived.
Small parcels no longer occupy farmers there - but small gardeners of the plant, land in the sun,
A large green area is distinguished north of Untersendling.
The Theresienwiese, since 1810 scene of the Oktoberfest, was in fact still a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert.
On the other side of the Isar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the Urpositionsblatt, in the area of the present-day district of Au-Haidhausen, you can read not only the street name \"am Gasteig\" or the height \"on the vents\" - but also in large letters \"Irren Anstalt\"
Yes, here on Auerfeldstraße you once locked people in with delusions.
There, 1858/59 the Munich Kreis-Irrenanstalt was created at the Auer Luften.
From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Godden led the institution - that psychiatrist, who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.
“He was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the chain of so-called errors.
He has also forbidden the staff to use violence against the inmates - says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum Haidhausen, who has worked for an exhibition on the establishment.
For 280 patients there was first room, and later it was extended to 500 places.
At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the county centre in Haar 1905.
Since 2006, the Isar-Amper-Clinikum München-East, one of Germany's largest psychiatrys, has been located there.
On the area of the former Anstalt, young people now meet in the Munich Salesianum.
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with training companies.
West lies the football court of TSV Munich East, eastern residential houses from the 1980s.
In 2015, the Children's House (Casa Don Bosco) was built in an architectural view of the original construction of the Irrenanstalt, which had been destroyed in the Second World War in the case of bomb attacks.
The Marienplatz was named \"Haupt Platz\" around 1856, the Kaufingerstraße was called \"Kaufinger Gasse\"
A decisive change in the Second World War also took place in the heart of Munich.
The bombs of the Allies pulled many holes into the city center in December 1944.
A big one remained - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business houses and a medieval burial chapel once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the preliminary work was carried out and on 5 April 2017 the spats were held for the second S-Bahn tramway.
With the slider, the old Munich card can be compared to the aerial image of today - and the hole at the Marienhof can be filled.
Civil Rights Group publishes travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Colours has issued a warning to coloured people who travel to Missouri due to the discriminatory policies and racist attacks of the state.
“The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is due to enter into force until 28 August 2017, calls on African-American travelers, visitors and Missouri to pay special attention to travel through the State and to be extremely cautious, since a number of questionable racial-based incidents have recently occurred throughout and are noted here in the Group’s opinion.
A recently passed law of Missouri that makes it harder for people to win discrimination complaints, as well as the law enforcement authorities of the state that disproportionately target minorities, prompted the group to issue the travel warning, said the NAACP.
“They have violations of civil rights that happen to people.
They're being stopped because of their skin color, they're being beaten up or killed, said the president of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.
“We hear complaints at such a frequency that we haven’t heard yet,
It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States.
The group cited incidents such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no petrol left during the state's journey and was arrested by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime.
The Council also notes a recently published report by the Office of the Attorney General of Missouri showing that black car drivers in the state are being stopped 75 percent more often than white ones.
“The recommendation is that people are aware and that their families, friends and employees are informed about what might happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
“People need to be prepared to bring cash or let their relatives know that they are traveling through the state,
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime report program, which graded the state in terms of the number of such injuries on the 16th rank of the country.
Travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states had passed immigration laws that required local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for violations of immigration, which, according to ACLU, will contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Weidezaun project is elementary
The Fischerbach Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue next year.
The CDU-Bundestag delegates Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac have provided a picture on site.
At the Rechtgrabenhof of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fischerbach CDU local association met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two Members.
Markus Schwendemann initially provided insights into his farm, where he farmed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, provided 40 dairy cows and also many young animals, and accommodated in five apartments.
The \"black forest milk\" is for him the alternativeless marketing route for the milk of his cows, according to Schwendemann.
On the table of holiday guests come exclusively regional.
Since he is also BLHV Chairman of Fischerbach, he described the Weidezaun project as \"elementally important\"
I can't make a profit on such steep areas.
The grassland area provides a lot of work, much had to be done with the motorsense.
\"We have to fight with the conditions and the topography here, stressed Schwendemann.
In 2003, he took over parental employment and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if he did not operate organically.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear: \"The municipality has recognized the importance of the Weidezaun project and is happy about the leader's promotion\"
At the cost of EUR 3000 to 4000 per hectare farmers would have to be supported.
It is hoped that this will allow the reforestation of the areas to be pulled out for a long time.
“The biggest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and are thinking about how to continue their business,” said the mayor.
Farmers are often criticized for promoting them
A total of 25 parcels of eleven participants were fenced over the pasture fence promotion in 2013.
The opening area thus amounts to 40 hectares, which may not be forested until at least 2023.
Of the total costs of 71 500 euros, half was funded via leader, a quarter carried the municipality of Fischerbach.
Thus, the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of pasture fence.
“The great advantage is the longevity of the fences,” Schwendemann explained.
Kordula Kovac stressed: \"You are doing a really good job, without farmers and peasants it is not going to be \"
Peter Weiß also stated: \"The best food is produced here -
The Baden-Württemberg Landschaftspflegeleitungs Directive (LPR) enables the promotion of pasture fences by the state.
The aim is to keep the Black Forest open.
The condition is the presence of a funding backdrop designated by the LPR.
In addition, the fenced area must not be lubricable (over 35 percent slope) and must therefore be threatened by the reforestation.
For the Fischenbacher Weidezaun project 2018, the application is currently being made by eight participants with 24 parcels, who want to build almost 16 kilometres of fence.
The opening area corresponds to 35 hectares and the calculated cost is more than 112 000 euros.
Is nothing more sacred?
Now the White House of Trump takes the statue of freedom
The surest sign of a regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
The Americans appreciate these as well as any other - therefore the carefully staged Sturz Saddam Hussein at Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN about the president's proposals for a drastic restriction on legal immigration with the status of freedom.
To stay fair, Miller did not attack the statue himself.
A horde of boat owners and Liberty Imitators would have licked him if he had done it.
But he attacked their meaning, and in particular the meaning attributed to it when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was added in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, its basis.
When Miller Acosta lamented: “I don’t want to go into a complete thing about history here, but the statue of freedom is ... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem to which you refer, which was added later and is not part of the original statue of freedom,
Miller is really right, but as he himself formulated it, it's not really about history.
It is about the contemporary response to the uproaring words of Lazarus, the only one in which a state invites not only any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: “Your tired, your poor, / your distressed masses, who long to breathe freely, / the wretched waste of your rich coasts,
There was never a time when the “eleventh waste ” was better seen on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Trump's USA are not welcome.
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate: it is indeed a conflict around the meaning of America.
Lazarus, and her friends, who tried to place their words at the base after their death, knew very well that they were doing a high-political action.
The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicanism by making it the female embodiment of freedom in a used classical picture.
Lazarus changed this meaning: In her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a very different name: Mother of the exiles.
The connection of the poem to the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people of the right wing wanted to change this for a long time.
The great scream of Rush Limbaugh, a type of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the statue of freedom is not an invitation to anyone, but rather an early neoconservative, which brings the American flame to the surrounding world: “Lady Liberty is advancing.
It is intended to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not supposed to illuminate the way to the United States,
Very unusual, Limbaugh has hit something here.
The importance of the statue is quite a question of the point of view of perception.
The great fancy act of Lazarus was to see them as seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible voyages on the decks of ships.
It is really about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and an opportunity to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and of welcome which they must hear.
And, of course, that's not the perspective Miller and Trump ever want to acknowledge.
Their torch shall not light up the way, but shall ignite the hatred whose only source of power is the hate.
World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two shots belonged to the team of Great Britain
The director of the United Kingdom athletics, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent in the World Championship Framework will make a massive contribution to the team,
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that \"something special is developing in Scotland\" and that the United Kingdom's athletics must learn something from it.
“We welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will continue it until we find it out,” said Black.
“I’m talking to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they’ve done.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they did.
British athletics: it has something to do with what they did.
And also with the guy on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant,
Several of the Scottish athletes are medalists, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will take the 5,000 m route against Sir Mo Farah, while Eilidh Doyle was elected team captain by the team.
\"Eilidh is quite humble.
Her captain's rescue was incredible, says Black.
“A number of athletes, no matter whether they were Scottish or wherever they lived or trained, went out of the room and felt very proud and very motivated.
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh brought naturally were great,
The Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will join the 400m hurdles at their fifth World Championships, says that it is \"unbelievable\" that 16 shots are in the British team.
Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which was reached in 1983 and 2015.
The Muir Central Runway leads on this road and last year has drawn up five British and two European records.
It will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 metres, is another shot to watch after a great season, which included victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first World Championships when the only other shot in the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says that she is “extremely proud” of the fact that many of her countrymen are not only part of the team, but in some cases also at the medals and at the finals.
“The special thing about being a team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team, so it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and elected me makes it a very special thing for me,” she added.
“I am obviously very proud of all the shots that belong to the team.
It only shows how far we have come.
And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb podies.
What about my speech as a captain?
Yeah, I think she was fine.
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation since we have a home-world championship.
So it is really important to rely on this home support and benefit from being back in the Olympia Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it'll just be such a great atmosphere out there,
Blocking critics via Facebook: Don't use a public office if you can't sign up for voters
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for the newspapers to beat him for everything, from internal politics to his political principles.
He limped at criticism, sure.
But he didn't silence his critics.
For in 1783, Washington said: “Free speech can be taken away - and, dumb and mute, we are led to slaughter like sheep,
This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work on being more like Washington.
Hogan's employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union therefore sued him at the beginning of this week.
The governor's staff dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with \"Na, and\" .
“It’s just Facebook, ” many people said.
But it's important.
And it's especially important if it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state, which is surprisingly popular.
He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.
Hogan is not a reactionary hothead.
He has shown a firm hand in leading his state and strict adherence to the principles.
He was also very skillful at using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and playfully debut his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.
Therefore, blocking people who come to the side of the governor - which is a public forum that is called official and by employees paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokesman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.
But it's too easy to use the picture of trolls or spammers or hateful people swinging online.
The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are only real people who talk to their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, not a troll.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Right-wing lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hassle-filled, but she asked about hate crimes.
“I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other current news - she wrote in the comment section of the news broadcast “The Post”
\"I also do not appreciate this idea, if a number of people take a position on the same subject, then they are disregarded by some rather than a so-called collective effort and are not recognized as a large group of affected citizens,
What the governor's employees called a \"concentrated spam attack\" would probably be called \"presage\".
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in earlier times if you had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical guiding articles or arrest and silence demonstrators.
But that's exactly what's happening digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for defaming Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is sued by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia.
The chairman of Loudoun County's Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
At the time of Washington, the time of affordable Portos had a similar effect to the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers responded to his leadership.
And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms such as \"Juricola\" \"Valerius\" \"Belisarius\" and \"Portius\" wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.
Petitions, which criticized his position on the Treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with Great Britain, overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected from the George Washington Project's online papers.
But he didn't silence her.
Freedom of speech, disagreement and discourse are the basis of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club
The former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for domestic comfort in the next three days, as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian will host the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Nordire, which ran next to the Archerfield left to the final round last year before losing Paul Eales, is associated with the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of the club founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
“I saw how the Renaissance club was built, and we see how it achieved its fame with this event,” Rafferty said.
“The players will see this course from his best side, he is in a great condition.
Jerry did a great job when he laid down that place.
He is a zealous advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great display window for this course,
The Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, although in his 32-year career he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour.
“That really feels special,” said Southport’s home-made player.
“I couldn’t defend the Extremadura Open, since it was taken out of the program in the year after I won it.
Coming back to this part of the world is magical.
It is a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories from last year come back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate,
Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50th birthday earlier this year, returns to action on home floor.
This event will be its first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
“It always means a little bit more when you play at home,” Orr said, the man from Helensburgh.
“You want to do it well, but you also feel this extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing it again, and I played a solid golf.
I am glad about how far it has gone,
With the Trio on the field are the former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and the Senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and the former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six shots in the field, the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The entrance is free of charge, the parking lot costs £5 per car with a passenger and £10 per car with two or more occupants.
All proceeds go to Prostate Cancer UK.
Less lung cancer by passive smoking
Over the past two decades, fewer and fewer people have died of lung cancer due to passive smoking.
Scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) will study this result.
“Our estimates suggest that 167 lung cancer deaths are due to passive smoking per year,” said study director Heiko Becher.
In comparison, he started his own study on this topic from 1994 onwards.
At that time there were 400 other lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking per year in Germany.
The new investigation is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
House connections are very complex
The construction works on Villinger Straße are in full swing and there are some things in time, according to the head of the Bauhof Fred Heinze.
In the area of household connections, the situation is more complicated than expected, as a lot is hidden in the underground, which is not included in the plans.
The traffic, which repeatedly hinders construction work, represents a major problem for the company Stumpp.
“The car driver’s ignorance of red lights and lockers is already enormous,” says Heinze.
The road was blocked and only the line buses were entitled to pass.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from Stumpp have been working on the bridge for weeks.
“The hot days were very strenuous.
But fortunately, we were supplied with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt, who told Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and death in the Indonesian Gold Country
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
She rarely even uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai regency in the restless Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually places a sweet potato - locally called \"nota\" - directly in the fireplace.
After half an hour, the chilled tube is removed and swallowed with stiff, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also carries out her daily work, e.g. washing clothes with dry water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a roofless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, no fields were assigned to her.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, late work can be dangerous: most village men are unemployed, and many drink heavily, and there are the soldiers here.
“No one dares to walk around in the village after 5 o’clock,” she says.
It is a rare insight into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was admitted in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were to vote in front of the crew by a public hand survey.
An existing movement that led to independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, which maintains control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers from it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, and the independent part of Papua New Guinea covered the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is öde. The trip includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire and then a 5-hour drive away by car.
There is no public transport.
The town with about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and well-bleached roofs, which have been transformed into different yellow-brown tones by rust.
Only very few Indonesians have made their journey here, let alone journalists and virtually no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Pago Papuans worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
“We weren’t used to wearing these clothes,” says Degei, pointing to her lively, hand-woven turban, her dark shirt and her bright skirt.
“In the early days, we had only leaves on our bodies,
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia's gold country.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grassberg, owned by Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is located just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province in the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015 alone, Freeport has reduced the value of $3.1 billion in gold and copper.
Papua also has wood resources worth an estimated $78 billion.
These riches, however, are a source of misery for Papua, which ensures that Indonesia's powerful military preserves an excruciating presence.
A 2005 study in the New York Times reported that between 1998 and 2004, Freeport paid local military personnel and units almost $20 million, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden gans and are treated mercilessly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua's tribal highlands in the 1970s were committed in accordance with the Asia Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful demonstrators last year.
“We will lose everything,” says a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, in which reports on atrocities of the previous year, such as illegal executions and torture, rape and electric beatings are particularly popular after another report, and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
“It is difficult to count the number of victims, as incidents happen every week,” says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have intensified as Papua's resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but demographic development changes as Muslim economic migrants come from the population-rich islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese warning candies sell fried chicken and gado-gado, a mixed vegetable served with peanut sauce.
Local people are fighting to keep up with this.
“The migrants started selling chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua,” explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to the provincial capital Jayapura.
“It has cost the local Papua - the Mama-Mama [women] of Papua - its market
In 2014, Indonesian President Joko Widodo, known as Jokowi, promised to address the inequalities and violations of law in Papua.
The former carpenter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Paniai, on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But in Papua little has changed, and today the locals feel cheated.
“Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored,” you say.
In fact, Paniai only suffered a deep point two months after Jokovis inauguration in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas songs in front of a campfire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle.
The frightened children told them to turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers took action on their sound and later returned with four soldiers, said local Pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had drunk hunted and beat the group with their rifles, said victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
A child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly that he fell into the coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered in a football court in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice.
They wore ceremonial hunting arches and performed the Waita dance - running in circle and initiating a bird song - of Papua's May Pago tribe.
Some demonstrators began to drag stones on police and military posts.
When the mood was heated, a command was sent to the soldiers via an internal radio: “If the masses resist more than three times, they shoot them dead,” says an official TIME document, which was not released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, head of the Kego Koto quarter of Enarotali, saw the threatening danger and called for rest and demanded the crowd to return home.
No one was listening in the mood.
“When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist - he said TIME on the veranda of his colorfully painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but says the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
“It was overcrowded, many shots were fired, he added.
The local man Alfius Youw was met three times, his cousin, who was a witness of the shootings.
“I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was it,” said Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, only bears a name that is dark in the mood of TIME.
\"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him,
The chief inspector of the Papua Police, Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers only wanted to \"safe\" their station because they were being attacked.
“We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us,” said the spokesman of the Papua Police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, in 2015.
\"It's about life and death,
According to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many others injured.
The news of the killings only came 'filtered' to Jakarta the following day.
In Jayapura, Jokowi gave a passionate speech for three weeks, expressing sympathy for the families of the victims and vowing to address the historic abuses in Papua.
“I want this case to be solved immediately, so that it will not happen in the future,” he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was setting up an extrajudicial mechanism to settle historical human rights violations.
But the excuses started almost immediately.
“Most injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 90s and early 2000s.
The point is that we have committed ourselves to addressing these violations, but there are processes that need to go through - he said.
Then Wiranto withdrew when he spoke to TIME on June 5 in Jakarta and said he has no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, he said, \"everything will be regulated by law.\"
Wiranto, who accused the UN of crimes against humanity, who demanded more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor's bloodless independence vote of 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations had already been committed in Papua, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims accepted such allegations with grim incredulity.
“I’ve been interviewed four times over the last three years, but no progress has been made,” says Yohanes.
\"I am tired,
He says he still lives in fear years later.
“I’m afraid,” he says.
“I’m afraid of being arrested by the military, I’m afraid of being shot.”
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims.
“After burying the bodies, the military looked for me, ” he says.
The shootings didn't stop.
On Tuesday the Indonesian police shot villagers in Paniais neighborhood Deiyai.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction firm who refused to bring an unconscious man to the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, the 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who was drowned when fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
Opened villagers protested in front of the company's location office.
The police said the villagers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) started shooting at the crowd and killed one.
“We’re so panicked, we’re afraid there’ll be revenge,” says 29-year-old Domingu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured people were quickly delivered here, said TIME.
“I have been hiding in my house for two days,
The Deiyai Parliament has called on the officers involved to be accountable and to withdraw the police's mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai was always a troublemaker for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the dissatisfaction of the tribal members of May, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the \"Free Papua Movement\" (OPM), the rebel army, which claims to defend the rights of Papua by attacking sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and taken arbitrarily into custody in recent years, under the pretext of securing national sovereignty.
Some never show up again.
Paniai is known among the people in Papua as \"a tragic, forgotten place\".
Poverty strengthens dissatisfaction.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is just as out of reach.
The people here build everything they eat: mostly nota and fruit and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the task of women who can work four or five fields of sweet potatoes each.
They retain the bulk of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
In the course of time, economic inequalities have grown between the local Papua and the new migrants who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new flight routes to the airport Nabire.
The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and more prosperous migrants.
Papua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to run their own businesses competitively.
“The young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money here - says John Gobai, Chairman of the Family Council of Paniai.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua.
In addition, restrictions on reporting remain the focus of international media.
At the beginning of the year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua because of lack of coordination with related institutions, although they were given the rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokovis election campaign to abolish the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development have not been realized.
“There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia’s most restless eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa refusal and a black list,” he said in a statement.
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the \"different and widespread injuries\" in Papua including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
The spokesman of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the Group's allegations and said to journalists in Jakarta: \"In Indonesia there is still a democratic system, and there is free media, so it is difficult to hide the evidence of human rights cases,
People on the ground want more foreign governments to take note of this.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on 4 May, locals broke their silence and, according to a source that also wanted to participate in the meeting, \"We want freedom\" to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but Papua say they probably won't vote again for Yokowi.
“Jokowi is a person with good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shots,” says Gobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military, are in poor education and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai people, like others Papua, view their voice for Jokowi as a “gull” he must repay.
“They don’t need money, they just want justice,” he says.
Despite the threats and intimidations, families of the Paniai gunmen issued a last symbolic act of spite: the body of a victim was buried on a site exactly opposite the police and military station.
They know that they may never be given justice, but at least they do not let the responsible forget their crimes.
“A member of our family was killed,” says Yacobus with a lowered head.
“What else can we do?”
Fire capture the 'torch' skyscraper of Dubai for the second time
A fire was found on Friday in one of the tallest residential towers in the world in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 79-storey building 337 metres high.
It is the second fire that goes through the high house in just two years, which is by chance called the torch tower.
The building was evacuated, injuries were not reported, and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
“We have slept and we have risen at the fire alarm and at the scream of the people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get from the 50th floor down, a resident who gave his name as George, Reuters, told us.
Dubai's civil protection authorities said that the firefighting units were extinguishing the fire at 4 p.m. local time (00.00 GMT) and cooling the building.
The government said they worked on providing accommodation for the affected.
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas by high-rise houses around the world.
An investigation by the management of the torch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage came from the clothing, outer clothing for decoration or insulation.
In the UK, the police said they believed that the system of records for isolation and disguise on the London Grenfell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in June where about 80 people died.
No Davis Cup Reform: Next Best-of-five
The President of the International Tennis Association (ITF) passed with his great Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly.
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for this sport was to play Davis Cup singles only on two winnings, but also not supported by the necessary two-thirds majority.
The five-sat classics, although often very long, are therefore very appreciated, remain in the traditional application.
63.54 percent of the member countries voted for the reform, so ITF President David Haggerty's goal was only barely missed.
“We respect this decision, but are disappointed that our member nations have not adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historical competitions - said Haggerty.
One will continue to work on improving applications.
Not only has the vote been put to the vote after many objections, but the proposal has already been made to bring the final to a neutral place.
New since 2018 are only comparatively smaller details: In the following year, the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the host right in the first round.
In order to reduce the costs for the organisers, requirements in training places, etc., will be facilitated and players will have to complete fewer official media appointments before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 out of 5 U.S. travelers brings prohibited items to the plane, finds out a survey
A survey of flight passengers revealed that more than 20 percent deliberately or unconsciously smuggled objects past the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration, including at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft while accidentally carrying banned knives or other objects with blades.
Less than 1 percent claimed that they had been lately discovered to have been mistakenly travelling with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people - conducted by a jet charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travelers were more likely to disregard the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they had knowingly tried to fly with something forbidden by the TSA, 19,7 percent were millennials compared to less than 15 percent who were members of Generation X.
The most common items that were deliberately passed by TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 percent admitted to knowingly carrying articles with blades through the safety control, while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought prohibited drugs to the plane.
The company said it asked travelers all over the country to find out how many accidental smuggling products had been brought by airport security and how many had deliberately done it.
It is no surprise that the people who carry the earliest smuggling goods - knowingly or ignorantly - through safety were those who fly the most frequently.
However, the company points out that the TSA Directives are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure what liquids they can take or how much of them.
It is therefore no surprise that the largest quantity of liquids seized by the TSA are prohibited.
For a time, people thought the TSA could view books as smuggling.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn't matter: Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel Order
Elon Musk, Elon Musk's Elektro-Tausendsassa, likes to announce the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla model 3.
To date, he has concluded that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the ever-triumphal figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla-Chief Elon Musk has for the first time betrayed another, less shiny figure in the announcement of the recent quarterly balance sheet: that of cancellations in the new mass market model 3.
In recent months Musk has often bought more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose delivery is just beginning.
Musk now boasts: 63,000 of the 518,000 pre-orders have already been withdrawn.
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are just non-binding reservations.
In case of cancellation, Tesla will pay the 1000 euros (in the US $1,000 and in the UK $1,000) “reservation payment - completely back.
Currently, 455,000 such non-binding reservations are being filed, and Musk entered a telephone conference with analysts.
However, the Tesla Chief does not believe that the cancellation of around twelve percent of all orders could become a problem.
His argument: The challenge of ambitious growth goals lies not with demand, but on the production side.
Last year Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018 it is expected - all models taken together - to be 500,000, 2020 one million.
The demand for this is obviously there.
According to Musk, there are currently 1800 reservations per day.
Those who today order a “Model 3” may expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive his brand new, never in practice tested production roads without major interruptions with maximum utilization.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
However, if there are more delays, then the non-bindingness of the reservations could become the problem for Tesla.
Because then, the company cannot prevent unsatisfied customers from running out of the crowd.
EPA Chief Pruitt withdraws due to the delay of the Obama Era rules to reduce emissions
One day after he had been sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Authority, took back his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions of smog causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved itself to be more responsive to the needs of the state environmental authorities than previous administrations.
He did not mention the action brought against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appeal.
It is about a time limit for states on 1 October to comply with the 2015 standards for near-ground ozone.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would delay compliance by one year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and avoid interference in local decisions or hinder economic growth,
Pruitt, who had been an attorney for Oklahoma before his appointment by President Donald Trump, was for a long time a reliable opponent of stricter environmental protection regulations.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly gone to block or delay regulations that resist the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels.
The sudden return from Wednesday is the latest legal backlash for the Pruitts regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a Federal Court of Appeal in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator had exceeded his authority when he attempted to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama administration that required oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that his turnaround at Ozonestandards would simply reinforce the EPO's willingness to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards.
\"Under previous administrations, the EPO has often failed to comply with the deadlines for implementation and then waits to be accused by groups of activists and others, and agreed to set the deadline for implementation, said Pruitt, who sued the EPO more than a dozen times in his previous job.
“We do not believe in a regulation by court proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the law and the authority it gives us,
Nevertheless, the EPO’s opinion stated that Pruitt will eventually use its “authority for delay and all other legally available authorisations” to ensure that the rules are based on “a sound policy and the best available information”,
The Republicans in Congress urge for a more comprehensive recast of ozone regulations.
A draft legislation approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that the EPO had sued this week, said that the group intended to maintain legal pressure.
\"The return of the EPO - in our complaints - is an important benefit for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the over 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities, said Schneiderman.
New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.
Soil ozone occurs when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people and each year contribute to thousands of premature deaths.
Representatives of public health and environmentalists rejoiced over Pruitt's surprising change of course.
“It’s disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the person responsible for protecting the air we breathe,” said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
\"We must continue to fight against the ideological crusade of the Trump government, to offer ourselves to environmental polluters and their particular interests,
Tumling celebrates 750 years St. Hilarius Church
750 years of St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen will be invited to a serenade at 16.30 a.m. on Sunday, July 16.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village, the historic St. Hilarius facility is a popular place to stay.
Visitors to the sixth Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the place have made the friends and promoters of Tumlings their concern.
Walter Martini emphasises: \"It is a uniquely permeable small-scale,
In 1267, the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in the Württemberg's document book: Count Hermann von Sulz sold \"the mountain with the parish church on Tumlingen and the Votgei, to Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 marks silver.
According to the document, on the Tumlinger Berg, besides the former parish church, there was also a ruling court to which the church or patronage belonged and not vice versa.
So people lived there too.
As the description of the city of Freudenstadt in 1858 shows, in addition to the Lower Village and the Upper Village, which can be seen today in the townscape of Tumlingen, the \"Berg\" was the third, the dominant center of the village.
Old maps from around 1600 support these historical events.
The right of patronation came from the early medieval church law.
A lord, who built a church, equipped it and occupied it with a pastor, remained the owner of this church and could also inherit it.
This was linked to the right to use a pastor or propose a new pastor to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The larger of the two collapsed on Christmas 1673.
The newly purchased bell was first staged in 1692 but later had to be released in 1942 in the Second World War.
In the 30-year-old war (1616 to 1648), the windows were struck and the bell ropes stolen.
The roof was empty.
In 1796 French troops camped near the church.
They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.
The remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius-Friedhof also served as a last resort for the dead from hearsayers.
In 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the Hilarius Church was demolished.
Only the church tower was left standing.
On the New Year's night of 1834, a storm split the church tower and half collapsed.
In order to prevent an accident, the tower was destroyed.
Only the tower that still exists today remained as a witness to the 750-year-old history of the church.
Today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem care for the Hilarius plant as successor to Dieter Dockhorn.
As organizers, the friends and sponsors of Tumlingen will invite to St. Hilariukapelle for the sixth serenade on Sunday, 16 July.
It is designed by the combo of the Kepler Gymnasium Freudenstadt and by the words of Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Mr. Hartmut Romann spoke the concluding word.
The programme starts at 4.30 p.m.
Inmission is from 15.30 p.m.
For the sound of the Serenade, there is a drink in front of the cemetery.
“Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest, the organisers exhibit the fantastic view.
The Serenade takes place only in dry weather.
The organizers hope for many supporters to maintain the historic St. Hilarius facility, which is of importance to tumling and hearing aids.
The friends and promoters of Tumlingen feel particularly committed to home care, as Serenade organizer Walter Martini affirms.
Association wants to check approval of windwheels
“Boisheim defends itself - does not see a legal condition for construction and has therefore turned to the Land Council.
The association “Boisheim defends itself” has asked Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw its permit for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheim net.
She was illegal.
The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016, no wind turbines could have been approved in the Boisheimer Nette, since at the time in Viersen only a wind power concentration zone existed at the city border at Schwalmtal.
Within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible, but at the same time the concentration zone results in an exclusion of wind energy use for the remaining urban area.
Such zones are intended to prevent a “sparing” of the landscape.
Although the city of Viersen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette a few days earlier by amending the land use plan - but the district government had not approved Düsseldorf because of a formal error.
\"With the lack of planning requirements, the approval decision issued is still illegal and therefore withdrawn, said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of \"Boisheim\"
Current state of affairs: Before the summer break, the City Council has again decided the wind concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette; a permit from the district government is still pending.
Recognising: \"This is why, at this point, the granting of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is excluded from planning legislation\"
The circle confirms the receipt of the call.
“The corresponding letters have been received at the Viersen district for the past week,” said one speaker.
The circle takes it for the occasion to re-examine the matter.
However, they are not likely to cause the procedure to stop.
With regard to ongoing proceedings at the administrative court, the circle on Thursday did not want to comment on the argumentation of the association “Boisheim is resisting.
NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, plans on an area on the Boisheimer Nette the construction of four 200-metre-high windwheels.
Last year, the company, where the city of Foursen is centrally involved, had concluded lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land.
With the creation of the four wind turbines, electricity needs will be able to be covered by around 11 400 households - which corresponds to about one-fifth of the electricity needs of all the four-seen households.
The NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros.
Last summer, the Viersen City Council gave green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Linnich Windpark near Aachen and a participation in a wind energy plant in the district of Heinsberg.
Car and tractor crash: woman dies in a terrible accident
A terrible traffic accident took place on Friday morning at L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Kreis).
A woman was fatally injured.
Two more people were injured easily.
The state road remained blocked for hours.
According to police information, a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich accompanied her car with her 53-year-old mother, L 333, towards Bogel.
Planning City and Dealers Home Shopping Weekends
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are expected to rediscover the shopping in the city center in September.
The commercial association and the city administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to lure the residents into the city center for shopping.
As the chairman of the commercial association, Christian König, announced, the \"home shopping\" weekend is intended to raise customers' awareness about the offers their own city offers away from the usual supermarket goods.
Therefore, a market is planned with regional suppliers, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, local companies should present themselves with their training places.
In addition, the shops of the city centre are to invite you to the “Mitternacht shopping”.
The action was aimed not only at residents of the city and the surrounding region.
In preparation are advertising spots in radio, an internet video and printed bags pointing to the action weekend, according to Christian König.
City administration and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Industry and Commerce.
The commercial association and the city go into another stage of the project, attractive city center,
These include new offers such as the first “Activ Day” at the Fountain Festival and the sale of the Sunday, talks with all the commercials and hosts in order to move them to active participation.
Also attractive offers for Saturday and the absence of parking fees on this day are part of the concept.
In addition, customer potentials should be re-opened or re-opened.
These include Kurgäst and tourists.
But also many locals would have lost sight of the city center when shopping.
In the end, everyone would have to help to revive the city center - up to renters, the businesses of the whole city and associations.
With a network, it was appropriate to overcome the lethargy that had partially widened, King had said in spring.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK Center in Mühlhausen, announced that five Thuringian cities were participating in the third home shopping day in Germany.
In addition to Bad Langensalta, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The day should be a step forward for the appreciation of local trade and its importance for the common good of our cities.
The action under the leadership of the IHK and with many partners also made it clear that each citizen could influence his or her immediate environment with his or her buying behaviour.
Two dead and several injured after explosion at U.S. school
During construction work a gas explosion occurred in the school building.
New people were injured.
In a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Minneapolis, two people were killed and nine others injured, some of them seriously.
According to the firefighter, on Wednesday (local time) another defendant was in critical condition.
A human being died when part of a school building collapsed during the explosion.
An initially missingster was later also buried dead.
The dead were school employees.
As an accident, the authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline.
During the holiday season, only a few people stayed in the building of the Minnehaha Academy.
Trump pressured Mexico to pay the border wall after leaked transcripts of telephone calls
Transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post.
On January 27th, Trump called in a phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop publicly saying that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The U.S. President insulted him because he had publicly looted the wall. According to reports, he said to him: \"You can't say that to the press,
Trump launched his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the United States, and vowed to let Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that a trade for the United States would take over refugees who migrated to Australia, i.e., \"mixed\" and \"dummy,\" and that the existence on the trade which Obama's government had taught him would make him look like a \"dep\" after he had proposed a ban on the relocation of refugees into the United States.
Mr. Trump ended the call after he had told Mr. Turnbull, \"that's the most unpleasant call for the whole day.\"
Moores Ford Massacre: Activists perform racist lynchact as a call for justice again
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe, Georgia, and slammed on Moore's Ford bridge.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver who could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns emerged to block its way.
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a needle strap suit - took a long train on his cigar and looked through the windscreen.
The inmates were floating in fear.
\"We want this n----r Roger--brushed the man.
\"Get him out of the car,
Screaming tears the silence when a young black man was torn from the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which was played on July 22, is only a rendition.
But when a sling is thrown around the neck of “Roger,” almost everyone in the audience gets very real sighs.
Since 2005, civil rights officers have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to look after the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with murder.
“It is really incomprehensible that no single person was arrested in all these years - although we see them in our communities, although we know who they are - said Tyrone Brooks, who helps in organizing the succession.
“It’s a dirty spot on a story, but it’s a burden to our souls.”
Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman of the state of Georgia and a life-long citizen lawyer.
For him, the rendition serves as a dramatic call to act and represents an annual reminder of the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
“We want prosecution, we want termination, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we need to get justice,” he said.
“We cannot come to healing and reconciliation until we get justice”
A court physician lays a bedcloth on the body of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford-Lynchen on 27 July 1946.
According to FBI records received by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching process.
But no one has ever been charged.
Although suspects have remained on the free foot for decades, citizen lawyers say that the double motivation for Lynch's actions throughout the city has always been known: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a decision by the Supreme Court allowed black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time in the summer pre-election campaign.
About the same time as the election, according to FBI, Black Farmer Roger Malcom, a white landowner, Barnett Hester, fell down during a battle - allegedly because of a woman.
Brooks said that the rumor was in the city that Hester slept with Malcom's wife Dorothy and that the baby she carried did not come from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to free Malcom from prison, according to the FBI.
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey to prison.
But when they left the prison and approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a Lynchmob surrounded the car.
“As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders,” concluded an FBI report.
“It is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local prosecution, which not only involved in the murders, eliminated evidence and confused the identity of witnesses,
Brooks still formulates it pregnancies.
“It was a right-wing massacre,” he said.
“They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: “If you register and if you vote, this will happen to you here”
For almost a decade, Cassandra Greene led the annual review of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murder.
Their portrayal is vivid, catchy and is grounded in a kind of deep racism, many of which want to believe that it no longer exists in America.
It's hard to watch, and even harder to look away, but Greene said that's the point.
“We don’t want to talk about the lynching, because we’re confronted with its uglyness in all of us,” she said.
“But I can’t build a relationship with you if you don’t want to listen to me or if you don’t want to hear what I’ve been through,”
The samples for this year's production began in June, and on the first day, almost 30 actors - a dozen whites and the rest of the blacks - pushed themselves into a room and listened when Greene started a well-played overview of the piece.
Wade Marbaugh is Greenes Co-director here.
He has played the role of chief clan member for years, but he said the role will never be simpler.
“I feel dirty because I’m not that way,” Marbaugh said.
“But I think it’s very important to keep this story alive because we don’t want to return at these times,”
On the other side of the room, the actors Darius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, tried their lines.
The play begins with Malcom, who yells at Hester and upsets him, angry that he has slept with his wife Dorothy.
“I said, n --- he, disappear from my property.”
Rascona returns the fire.
There's a break.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) breaks out in laughter.
Greene laughs loudest.
“What? ” asked Rascona.
He's alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
“No,” Greene said, still kicking.
\"I just don't think that white people said 'n --- he'\"
“But, one of the other black performers whizzed.
“You just have to meet the hard ‘R.’
And right there the energy in the room shifts, a feeling of the comradeship replaces the discomfort.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four killed people.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Rascona says the N-word, he says it sharp and with emphasis.
Absolutely no one is laughing.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There are screams, shots and then silence.
A woman clothed with a wedding dress stands over the body of the actors and carries out Billie Holidays' sad praise “Strong Fruit”.
Your voice breaks at every second word.
About a hundred meters behind, a group of about four dozen spectators wipes sweat and tears out their eyes.
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white.
A couple traveled from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many just coming down the street.
They have experienced Georgia's pressing moisture for almost eight hours when Brooks leads them on a pilgrimage to the graveyards of the Malcoms and Dorseys.
Up to this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, when you are standing on the same country where the Lynch murders took place, the air feels scorched.
When the last notes of the song sound out, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the body name.
Children hook up at their heads, register the fake blood and the silent body and whisper together.
“They’re not really dead, ” murmurs a little boy, as if to remind him.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it's over.
The actors threw the Lynch rope away and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh, the man in suit who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona embraces two of his fellow players and then breaks into her arms weeping together, the emotional load of the performance finally breaks through with him.
“It’s okay, one of the women whispers.
“We know that is not in your heart.
You did this for one reason,
Later, the audience joins the actors for dinner.
At a table, a white couple from Atlanta chatted about the rendition with a black couple they just met.
Denise Duplinski fought to find words that left the performance feeling behind.
“It is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and who do it because they look like you - she said.
“What really matters to me, makes me believe that Lynchen is still going on,” she added, “now it’s just called police shooting,
In the same room, Tyrone Brooks Hof holds his table, eats and remembers the civil rights.
He said he's already started planning the performance next year.
“The rendition is inspiring in a certain way, for it describes the horror of what we have endured, but it is also a moment of learning,” he said.
“It’s true that if we don’t learn from it, it can happen again.
Who does not study his own story, who does not know his own story, is condemned to repeat it,
“Götterdämmerung - reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
In the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, director Frank Castorf also puts on a colourful-frivolous setting in front of gigantic, six-storey scenes.
The turning stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) shows an optional shaky street corner with the Berlin Wall Rest and Dönerbude, a \"plaste and Elaste\" logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange.
Before that, an open Mercedes-Oldtimer parked in which the Rhine daughters pose as rockergirls, or alternatively an isetta.
Stacked oil barrels are reminiscent of Castorf's leitmotiv - money, power, and greed - which pulls through his “ringing” stage.
The three Rhine daughters - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize as well as in the \"Rheingold\" wonderfully.
Kess seduced them Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), torn a body into the trunk in Hollywood manner and gave the Krawallo clique.
Stephen Milling sings the wonderful fine hag that surrounds the aura of a heavyweight boxer.
Brutal the scene when he beat Siegfried.
Later, Gunther (Mark's oak) must also believe in it.
The audience thanks it to the ensemble with strong applause.
Foster, Milling, Vinke and Dirigent Janowski, who modestly bows their hands to the Merkel-Raute, are celebrated in a stormy atmosphere.
There is great chance for the festival orchestra, which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in low leisure clothes.
The performance of Frank Castorf and his management team was expected with tension.
If he had to pass a valid pipe concert in 2013, five years later there was great cheer in which the single “Buh” call went down.
Chief of Festival Katharina Wagner may have been pleased about this.
“It was noted that the audience had grown up with the “ring” in some way, she had just said before the performance of the dpa.
The audience not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but it also grew an understanding of its viewpoint.
I'm going to have a positive summary.
Max Mügen works as a volunteer
They work in several places in their volunteer year.
Where anywhere?
Quantity: Usually in Steinfurt on the furniture market, once a week I help out here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
And I've already worked at school in an open all day.
How are your experiences with this?
Quantity: It's a beautiful, wide spectrum that I see here.
I have to deal with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
You are now 26 years old, so a late professional volunteer.
How's that coming?
Quantity: I made Abitur.
And then a civil engineering degree, let's say, quit successfully.
I realized for myself that it is the wrong thing for me and I want to do something else to work with people.
And then I asked myself what you're doing.
Make a social year, there is an insight, there you can see how it is on the spot, in the focus maybe also, really.
And was it?
Quantity: I have collected great impressions.
I will start my studies in social affairs in the winter semester.
I'm going to study dual, probably do a social worker training at Herne Youth Office and study in Hamm at the professional college.
Is it not unusual to have several different places of use during the volunteer service?
Quantity: Yes, it is very variable.
It's probably always about where to make his FSJ.
One can do it from old age to youth work - in all possible facets of social work.
It was very varied with me.
I was also part of the OGS, so in the afternoon care.
For me, that was exactly what irritated me.
I could see my own strengths and see how it really goes off.
Unlike civil engineering?
Quantity: Well, this isn't about calculating statics.
You always have other people shape head, each with a completely different story behind you.
Whether a refugee, whether a youth who has been taken out of the family - one must always take it individually.
Very interesting.
And you didn't have any touch fears?
Quantity: I'm not the guy for that.
It's an area that gives you a lot.
A lot of love, a lot of kindness.
There are also negative moments, but that's what life is like.
Pearson shortens another 3,000 jobs and shortens the dividend to revive the business
The British Education Group Pearson said on Friday that it would reduce another 3,000 jobs and cut their intermediate dividends by 72 percent, as another restructuring programme would be launched to overcome the pressure with which the company was confronted.
In addition to its previous restructuring, which Director General John Fallon announced mainly for the end of 2018 and early 2019, it has lost 4,000 jobs.
Pearson announced in May in a third cost reduction program a plan to reduce costs by another $300 million ($394 million) to revive a business that was hit by the rapid step towards digital learning.
The company, which had sold its stake in Penguin Random House to Bertelsmann last month, said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged after it reached an increase of 1 percent to 2.05 billion pounds in the first half of the year.
Kabul's convoy attack: killing Nato soldier in suicide attack
A suicide attacker has attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killed one of Nato's soldiers, and injured several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and one interpreter had been injured, and a statement from Nato told them.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians also died during the incident in the Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the last violence that hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat.
On Monday a suicide killer killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
The Nato opinion says that the explosion took place on Thursday evening when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a \"proposed explosive\"
The statement states that all the injured are in a stable state and are treated in the U.S. military hospital on Bagram airfield.
Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major concern for NATO troops in nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, some 20% of them in the capital city.
At the end of July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mostly Shiite district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had carried out this attack.
On 31 May, a massive bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the country's most deadly militant attack, since the US-led troops pushed the Taliban out of power in 2001.
The violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, as U.S. President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of US troops supporting military and police in the country.
Correspondents say that the suicide attacks in Kabul have also caused a crisis of public trust in the government, its policies and, in particular, in the reputation of President Ahraf Ghani in recent weeks.
EPO returns decision to delay the smog rule in accordance with complaints
The U.S. Environmental Protection Authority has repealed a decision to delay a government regulation of Obama, according to which states are obliged to curb smog-caused emissions, which took place a day after 15 states sued the agency for the step.
The EPO announced late on Wednesday the decision to move forward the so-called ‘Ozone Policy 2015’ and said that it showed the Agency's commitment to working with states.
“We believe in the dialogue with and from the fact that we are responding to our state partners,” said EPO CEO Scott Pruitt in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the EPO’s intention to measure ozone emissions in a part of the country in order to determine where cuts must be made to comply with stricter air quality standards by one year until October 2018.
A group of 15 major democratic states, together with the District of Colombia, filed a complaint on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal.
The government of President Donald Trump has tried to reverse a wide range of environmental burdens imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that Trump says will stimulate economic growth.
However, efforts have triggered the setback of democrats and nature conservation groups, which are concerned about the effects of greater emissions on public health.
The EPO website says that breathing air containing ozone can reduce lung function and enhance breathing symptoms, such as asthma.
Municipal Council wants Community space
In the end, the decision was clear: In the case of two votes against, the Municipal Council of Flurn-Winzeln decides to set up a community space in the future senior residence.
Before the discussion there is an important information: The purchase contract for the missing part of the property is signed, says Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
Although it will still take until the area of the church is in the municipality, there is now no longer any planning obstacle to the project to be voted by a private investor.
There is a debate on a Community area for this purpose.
One of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community.
On the ground floor, he would provide a living area - around 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total area of 70 square meters for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the Council of the Community propose that such a community space should not be provided as a meeting place only for the residents of the community who live on a senior basis, but openly into the community.
As an example, the word of the “Strickcafé” made the round.
The decision already taken last autumn by the provision of funding for the current budget will be made possible by means of funding.
The building is located in the refurbishment area.
The establishment of a Community area would, according to Tjaden, be eligible with 60 percent of 30 percent.
In order to signal to the investor that one does not want to push a button between the legs in this respect, the proposal provides that both saddle - which is due to environmental construction - and pull roof - which would reduce traffic height and make construction economical.
Needless to say, not only Wilfried Sohmer, is this addition.
If it helps, he will pass the board unanimously.
It is not so easy for the Community area.
Daniela Ruf refers to the many private buildings with which one does not move forward in such a way that one now lends himself to the community space out of the window, she says: “I’m hard to do with it,”
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely in favour of the Community area - but absolutely against municipal participation.
It sees a hidden subsidy to already assets or even foreign investors.
This is not the case, because with the acquisition of the area, there is no grant, but a genuine, marketable counterpart, in the event of doubt, is the contradiction.
Staiger's request to split the proposal accordingly is supported by three.
For example, two votes against remain in the original programme, which Stefan Haller summarises: \"If we take the decision in this way, we are making a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure\"
Collision with car: Radler is thrown on the road
When crossing the road, an 82-year-old cyclist was caught by a car in Garath on Wednesday and seriously injured.
As the police told us, the 82-year-old Langenfelder had been on his bike on the road of the Black Road from the direction of Hilden at 12.20 p.m.
The senior wanted to cross the highway at the height of the street Am Buchholzer Busch.
A car driver driving in the same direction gave him priority.
As the longfields drove on the road, however, it apparently did not pay attention to counter-trafficking.
He joined a car that controlled a 66-year-old Hildener.
The man was thrown to the street.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to a hospital with a rescue truck.
FC Bayern Munich must refrain from David Alaba and Thiago when supercup against Borussia Dortmund
The supercup takes place without it: David Alaba has to allow the game to be sucked against Dortmund.
With personnel care, FC Bayern travels to Dortmund for the first mandatory game of the new season.
Seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Supercup against the Cup winner.
The personnel care at the German football record champion Bayern Munich will be increasing before the supercup on Saturday (20.30 p.m./ZDF and Eurosport) at Pokalsie Borussia Dortmund.
Trainer Carlo Ancelotti must also refrain from David Alaba in the duel with the BVB.
This was confirmed by the Italians on Friday.
The Municher Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat are also missing.
For the five defeats in the past six test games, Ancelotti has been responsible for the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team.
“We know that we are not in the best physical condition,” said Ancelotti, adding: “The most important point is the balance in the team.
She wasn't good last time,
The 58-year-old, however, believes in a performance increase in the first official game of the season.
“Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities.
The team is ready.
We want to play intelligently - said Ancelotti, who expects a \"severe, intense game\".
The duel of the two German football heavyweights pulls the fans into their wings.
The party is sold out with 81.360 spectators, the German football league (DFL) announced on Friday.
Wandering from star to star in the resin
In the resin, the first \"star path\" is to be created throughout the country.
This is planned by the St. Andreasberg Association.
A planetary path has existed in Göttingen - since 2003.
A “star path” meets the need for information from many visitors to resins, said it.
He linked nature, science, movement and sporting performance.
The members want to create tables along the planned route and to inform them about stars and constellations.
In a first phase until 2018, the association plans \"good-to-reach installations in five to six locations\" in the upper heart.
Inquiries came St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohgeiß and Sieber.
The information on the tables is to be supplemented via the Internet.
Therefore, a good mobile network reception plays a role in the choice of location.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later, the star path train should be extended by train.
“On the star path, the viewers learn a lot of valuable information about, for example, the physics of each star,” said the association.
In addition, they learned why stars have different colors or why a star is lighter than another, although it is much farther away.
It also tells us in which constellation there is a chosen star and when to see it best.
Since 2014, the club has been operating the highest-level Observatory North Germany in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg.
The site in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany, according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation.
Often you can see clearly from there the Milky Way and even the Andromeda Galaxy with a naked eye.
Since 2003, the Planetarium Göttingen Funding Association has had something similar to the planned starry path in the Uni-City.
Starting in front of Gebhard's Hotel in Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planet's path leads with its steles up to the Hainberg and the Observatory, as well as an extraterrestrial location in Diemarden (equals) with the planet Sedna.
The steels with the individual planets - including the Pluto degraded to the dwarf planet at the endpoint - are set exactly in distance and scale from one to two billion.
The earth shrinks to a sphere of 6.5 millimetres in diameter, while the sun, at least 75 metres away, measures 70 centimeters.
The entire distance of the planet's path is about four kilometres.
While the light from sun to Pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour until the stele with Pluto.
So pedestrians are faster than the light in the world.
The march to the next fix star, however, would take another half a year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be in a collision course to stage the most exciting box fight in the near future under 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the unbeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion who went down the hallway to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization Super-Federweight Champion.
After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision on the former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on showtime, both fighters are members of the top five pounds-for-pound list.
Garcia stretched her right hand and said, \"How are you, Champion?
I wish you good luck,
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday evening at 19 o'clock on ESPN.
When the couple posted for photos, Lomachenko manager Egi's climate noted that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the “perfect order of magnitude. ”
“I’m a former spring weight,” Garcia recalled.
“I went up for Broner [on 140 pounds], but I’m not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to get down to lightweight.
And he has to move on lighters [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That's what the fans demand.
Let's give them that,
Lomachenko agreed.
\"Boxes need this struggle\"
Climate asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy that Lomachenko has to fight with a 135-pound debut this year to reconcile a date with Garcia next summer (37-0, 30 knockouts) which also has an interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title fight in the forum on 23 September.
“This fight could take place in Pay-per-view mode because all fans asked for it,” Garcia said and later openly expressed herself to fight with the network that offers the best financial package.
We're the best.
No other names can generate this kind of attention.
Whenever they are ready ... \"
Garcia said he appreciated Lomachenko as \"a huge fighter\" and he may be participating in his Saturday campaign.
But Lomachenko stopped at the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thinks he's seeing the three-fighting champion from Riverside \"very slowly, I'm sorry Mikey ... you wanted the co-out \"
Garcia said the focus was to show impact strength, then boxing.
Both said they could feel the momentum that was building up for their own struggle.
“This is the battle that must be carried out.
No other battle creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I'm more than happy to work on it, Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: “I was waiting for the top fighters, and that’s Mikey.
It'll be a great fight,
Four casualties by tyre pitcher
In the case of an accident on the A7, four people were injured in part on Thursday afternoon.
After first information, the driver of a Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle at 4.30 p.m. just before the market wide connection point probably after a tyre pitcher.
The car slid to the right into the bush, where it was overlaid and then left on the roof in the green strip.
The four inmates - two adults and two children - were partially seriously injured during the accident.
During the first care of the injured by the rescue service, the A7 was locked to the north for about an hour, and then traffic on the left lane could be passed at the accident site.
Fortunas Hoffmann: \"Three chain works better\"
After 2:2 Andre Hoffmann hopes to start the season against Braunschweig that the optimization of the resistance formation will bring points in Aue.
With the first season game Andre Hoffmann was satisfied, with the result too, there would not have been the two opponents at 2:2 against Braunschweig.
“These were two counter gates too much, and we have to be even better careful in Aue,” says Fortuna Düsseldorf’s defence player.
In the Erzgebirge, the tributary chain is also to be further optimized.
And a gate after an escape, the fortunes don't want to catch up anymore.
\"For the future, it will be the case that no one is standing next to Michael (Rensing) on the line,
Hoffmann is convinced that his team works better after the experience in preparation with the tributary chain than with the four chain.
“I still don’t know how we’re going to act in Aue,” says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his point, “because we have players who can build well in the three-way chain on the semi-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Nico Gießelmann, Hoffmann said.
\"Presentation is, however, that we harmonise even better and that we do not make so many mistakes in the construction\"
Of course, Hoffmann also drives to Aue to win the game.
“But if you can talk about a failed start after a disagreement, you don’t know.
Performance could be quite okay, Hoffmann said.
“But if we can stand on Sunday with four points and concentrate on the pool, we will certainly be able to talk about a good start to the season,”
His coach didn't want to know about it.
“I only judge the start of the season after six to eight days of play,” said Friedhelm Funkel, who doesn’t want to talk about an advantage over Aue, just because the game of Sachsen in Heidenheim had to be interrupted prematurely because of a storm.
“Now they can almost start the season with a home game,” Funkel and Hoffmann said, “that the players from Aue might even be a little fresher, since they don’t have a heavy and complete game like Fortune against an ascent favorite in the bone.
“But they don’t know 100 percent where they are currently standing,” says Fortuna’s internal defender.
Although the guests from the Rhineland go to the meeting at the final (almost) stadium of Aue as an easy favorite on Sunday.
“That we remove them just because we have the right to be among the first six is blundering,” says Funkel, whose balance is quite positive in the case of only one defeat against au from nine games.
“There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that has to be beaten from the front,” Fortuna’s chief coach explains.
\"To make such a statement would be arrogant and exaggerating,
And so Funkel doesn't want to see his players on Sunday.
New results of Swedish asylum age assessment tests published
The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which were subjected to a new method of medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 percent of the tested individuals are older than 18 years of age. But not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Department of Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedizinalverket) has begun to carry out the tests last year.
During the asylum procedure, they should make the assessment of age more accurate after the Swedish Migration Authority (Migration Chain) has been criticized for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minors.
To date, Migration Verket has sent 6,880 cases to be tested and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were assessed as 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was \"possibly 18 years old or older\".
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person is “possibly under 18 years of age”
The tests shall only be carried out in cases where the person's age is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been steady over the past few months.
“We don’t see a big difference in statistics over the past few months, the figures are quite constant,” he said in The Local magazine.
The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged as over 18 years of age does not necessarily mean that the applicant has lied about his age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases that \"proposed that the person examined was 18 years of age or older,
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, she found that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she was 18 years old this year.
The method of medical age assessment in which X-rays are made of wisdom teeth and MRI recordings of knee joints, which are then analysed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticized in some areas.
A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute whose work involves assessing the biological maturity of people to see whether they went through puberty sooner or later than usual.
“I had reason to think about it, and I don’t think the type of measurement should be used.
The biological age to be assessed in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say it for sure, we shouldn't do as if we could, he said the Metro newspaper.
Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, however, defended the accuracy of the tests: “In general, you can say that the risk of wrongly judging a child as an adult is low.
The greatest risk is that if the person is just under 18, in this case this is about 10 percent,
Fully in the plan
The work on the three bridges of Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well.
On Wednesday a seven-tonne concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
“We are very good at the time, it’s running super - says Reinhold Leicht, construction manager at the Department of Roads and Transport in the Government Bureau of Freiburg.
In April the work began simultaneously on all three necessary bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.
The construction is planned for October and it is easy to be sure that the timetable is respected.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads through the Trombach.
It is a concrete arch bridge that is coated with red buntsandstein and has a total length of 4,80 meters.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has now come into the years.
In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated.
The other two bridges cross the Lauterbach.
They are built from red buntsandstein.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve or 10.60 meters long.
The bridge at the village entrance of Lauterbach has now received a 1.30 meters wide and seven tons heavy so-called bridge cap on the north side on Wednesday morning.
This is a edge attachment, which is also used as an operating route.
On the southern part of the bridge a 2.20 meters wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday.
Then the pedestrian route should go on.
The special thing is that these are finished parts, a patent of Schramberger company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already fitted with the patented bridge caps.
Special fingertip feeling has required the laying of lines through the building in Lauterbach.
Because there is also a fiber optic cable to which many companies are connected.
The residents were informed of the project in advance of the work by Handzettel.
In addition, fish and crabs had to be fished at first.
For the bridges between the Bauhof building and the collector towards Schramberg, the traffic is regulated by a traffic jam.
For construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbach village entrance, the street in the area of the bridge is completely blocked at the height of the hotels - Tannenhof - and -Sieben Linden.
The cost of the three bridge renovations totals 700 000 euros.
The whole country is financed.
AfD in Gerolstein: Bunter Protest at German potato salad
It doesn't happen so often that parties pull a strand, but when it comes to the alternative for Germany (AfD), it comes together, which is otherwise difficult to put under a hat.
The parties (CDU, SPD, Green, FDP, FWG, Left) represented in the Kreistag Volcanoeifel are part of a broad alliance, which shows a peaceful flag this day, because the AfD in the Gerolstein Stadthalle Rondell invites to the according to poster \"great campaign start\".
And well-known names start - like Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland forms the top duo for the Bundestag election on September 24th, and the deputy Federal Chairman Beatrix of Storch.
But those who are on site hours before the event begins do not want to listen to the AfD learners, but demonstrate.
The motto \"The Eifel Stays Colorful\"
Originally, the city picnic was planned under the motto \"All at a table\" on the well square, but now takes place on the parking lot below the roundell - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the city hall.
A colorful picture that's there.
And what Christa Karoli, President of the Forums A world and one of the relevant organizers, really rejoices: \"Toll how many people have come together here,
There is music and plenty of food, including a \"UrGerman potato salad, which also the AfD could eat easily - says the woman who brought it with him.
The police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein, it shows presence especially at the train station, which is only a few meters from the venues.
How did the AfD actually come to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes of the AfD Vulkaneifel reported that he had tried such an event and received the award.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had first inquired in Dun, but there was a rejection because there were not enough parking spaces because of the already built Laurentiuskirmes.
So now the Rondell, Hompes is glad that \"we can have such a beautiful event here\"
Looking at the event on the Rondell square, he says: “This is the good right of the people, the main thing, it remains peaceful,
This is also true: At around 20 o'clock, a band provides entertainment in the city hall, several speakers, including the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD chairman Uwe Junge.
In the hall are about 200 listeners waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election, Alice Weidel, and the deputy Federal President Beatrix of Storch to give their speeches.
Unchanged is the police presence, but so far the officials had a quiet evening.
A little more than an hour will take the AfD event, the guests in the courtyard will have a longer breath, but also there is announced to be cleaned up shortly after 21 o'clock.
The police can go off - no special incidents.
Trompete meets Posaun
A rehearsal with the Wolfacher Posaunist Frederic Belli is available in the series Haslacher Klosterkonzerte tomorrow, Sunday, at 20 o'clock in the monastery church.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov, he gives a concert under the motto \"Black Sea meets Black Forest, or \"Balkanfolklore\" encounters classical German training with roots in the blast music.
Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have solo positions in European top orchestras.
Petkov is a solo trumpeter at the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is the Soloposaunist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both combine the desire not only to cross borders on their instruments, but also to merge the boundaries of different genres.
This is how Johann Sebastian Bach, as in a new robe, Daniel Schnyder’s world music, combines with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece “Exchange Suite” of Jazzecho Award winner Nils Wogram, mixes with classical, jazz and free play into a fascinating overall work of art.
This core part of the programme was first launched this spring with huge success in Freiburg.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote it for the two musicians and more: The Haslach monastery church with its special acoustics is deliberately included in the concert.
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
“Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives.
But I want to try everything out - so Kristen Stewart is quite open about her bisexuality.
“When I bite in grilled cheese, I think, ‘Oh that was cool, what’s next?’
The most famous relationship of the Hollywood star was that of Robert Pattinson, who eventually became bitter.
Despite all this, the brunette actress assures the “Harper’s Bazaar magazine”: “I was in love with everyone I had dated.

The governor of West Virginia announces that he will change the party
. The Democratic Governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced that he would change the party on Thursday evening with President Trump.
Whether you like it or not, the Democrats removed from me - said Governor Justice.
\"Today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of thought ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia, I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor\"
The rally broke out in jubilation.
“I will change my registration to the Republicans tomorrow,” added Justice.
“As a coach, I would say it’s time to play another game,”
Mr. Trump promised a major announcement at the West Virginia rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice did not approve the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, according to Forbes, is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes finds that he owns coal mines in five states and has inherited a coal business from his father.
He's worth about $1.59 billion.
In the meantime, on Thursday evening, the Republican National Committee issued a statement stating: “The change of party by Governor Justice is another blow to a Democratic party that would rather hinder us than work to make our country great again,
“With only 15 governors and the control of the least legislative bodies in history, the announcement by Governor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is without leadership from top to bottom and is unable to find a positive, agreeing message,” said RNC Chairman Ronna McDaniel in a statement to CBS News.
Coe praises \"honorable\" Russian excuse for doping scandal
On Thursday, the world leader of athletics Sebastian Coe praised what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia for a doping scandal, but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be reintroduced into sport.
Russia's athletics chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the Athletics World Championships that the exile of his country from sport was correct and that he was determined to fight the doping.
He said he was sorry for \"all athletes who were taken away in competitions of gold and silver medals\"
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-funded doping in Russia.
“I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation,” said IAAF President Coe to the reporters.
“The entire Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation had recognized by itself that it had experienced some quite hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation was redesigned,
Coe said he was also \"rejoicing\" about Russia's acceptance of the criteria for its re-introduction.
“I think it was a very constructive day, and I think progress has been made, but Congress supports the Task Force’s recommendations that this is not the moment to reinstate Russia,” said Coe.
“We have to do everything in the next few months to normalize this situation.
The guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupt system - he added
Nineteen Russian athletes will join as neutral actors in the athletics World Championships, which begin on Friday in London, according to the strict IAAF criteria.
The head of the IAAF Task Force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still had to meet some of the criteria for resetting.
Drug testing is still insufficient and prohibited trainers are still free to act, he told reporters in London after a lecture at the IAAF Council.
Grief act for soldiers crashed in Mali
At a funeral in Fritzlar in northern Hessian, about 1000 people of the two had thought of being killed in a helicopter crash in Mali.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in Domstadt under high safety precautions.
On the still unexplained crash matter, Secretary of Defense Ursula of the Leyen (CDU) said nothing.
However, she described the pilots who had died as \"Könner of her profession\"
“We are sorry for the highest sacrifice they have made in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany,” she said.
The 33-year-old Major and 47-year-old Head of Staff from North Hessen were killed on Wednesday a week ago in West African Mali.
Their sores were transferred to Germany and taken to Fritzlar Cathedral St. Peter on Thursday, accompanied by a death watch of the Bundeswehr.
At noon only members of the church took part.
After that, the funeral began in the circle of the family, close friends, representatives of the federal army and politics.
These included Hesse's Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and General Inspector of the Volker Wieker Defense.
Mourning guests laid down roses, the members of the arm stood in arms on the sores.
In front of the church, Fritzlarer and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a screen.
Minister of Defense of the Leyen referred to the killed soldiers as \"highly decorated\" and entry experience.
The chief of staff has built the flight of the fighter helicopter Tiger in Fritzlar and has been one of the first six trained tiger pilots of his regiment.
Volker Bauersachs, commander of the Regiment, to which the soldiers belong, also said: “If this occupation could not reverse the crash, no one could have done so.
No doubt at the UN mission in Mali, Minister of the Leyen did not show: the use was dangerous.
But he was also of high importance, for a country from which we are only separated by two states, she said.
After the mourning celebration, the sores were brought out of the dome.
When and where they will be reimbursed, the Bundeswehr made no mention of it.
Prince Henrik doesn't want a grave next to his wife
The man of the Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
This was shared by the King's House on Thursday.
The Danish king couple is traditionally buried in the Cathedral Church of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard already produced a sarcophagus for the two.
The Queen agreed to her husband's decision, as further stated in the communication.
Where Prince Henrik is buried is still unclear.
However, he does not intend to be conscripted in his French homeland.
Prince Henrik had never made a helm out that he was not happy with his title.
After the enthronement of his wife Margrethe in 1972, he would have liked to be king.
In 2016, he retired and also placed the title \"Prinzmeahl\".
Since Henrik did not receive the title and function he wanted in Denmark, he did not regard himself as equivalent to his wife - nor did Lene Baleby, the chief spokesperson of the Danish royal house.
Where the last retirement place of the 83-year-old will finally be, it is still unclear.
However, he does not intend to be conscripted in his French homeland, but in Denmark.
He likes the country for which he has worked in the last 50 years.
The born Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French noble family, had met Margrethe in London in 1965.
At Themse he worked in the French Embassy.
While his later wife always enjoyed the sympathy of the people, Prince Henrik had a heavy standing with the Danes in his nearly 50-year regency.
In an autobiography, Henrik said about the first years in Denmark: “Only months after my arrival, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was fluffy, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk stock instead of knitting socks, lemon instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises that I smoked instead of Virginia-Tabak and that had the reputation to be the brand of socially critical intellectuals, I couldn't hope forbearance.
I was different.
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed of myself.
That was two of them,
Prime Minister Weil wants rapid reelection
CDU and FDP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is after the loss of the red-green majority of government for a rapid re-election of the day of the country, but he does not want to resign.
Because on Friday the Parliament voted for the resolution.
Previously, the surprising departure of a Greensman from her land-day group in Lower Saxony had plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the official date of the Landtag election, the red-green coalition in Hanover thus lost its close majority in Parliament to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The previous Greens' Deputies Elke Twesten justified its step with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in their constituency in Rotenburg (Wumme).
“I see my political future in the CDU,” she said on Friday in Hanover.
CDU Head of Group Björn Thümler wishes to recommend to his group that they be included.
Thus CDU and FDP together had 69 seats in the Lower Saxon Landtag, SPD and Green 68 seats.
So far, the relationship has been reversed.
The new day of land is regularly chosen on 14 January next year.
Thumler said that the red-green state government now had to decide whether it could continue to rule without a majority in this situation.
Stephan Weil considers it essential, however, that the day of the country decides its self-resolution as soon as possible.
The CDU Group is expected to decide on Tuesday on its further action.
The Land Constitution also provides for the possibility of the Landtag withdrawing confidence from the Prime Minister and choosing a successor.
\"Our Constitution offers several options.
These options need to be checked legally - said Tümler.
“You’ll be discussing all questions in peace if you’re legally reasonably scrutinized, ”
Tümler called Twesten's step \"but something kurios\"
The politician himself stressed: “I am not a traitor.
I feel very good,
She called herself a follower of Black Green.
The Greens called on the deputies to return their land-day mandate.
“Of course, we assume that she is returning her country day mandate, which she has received through the green list of countries, with immediate effect,” said the country’s chairmen Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner.
The Group Chairman of the Green Anja Piel said: \"We regret the decision of Every Twest extraordinary,
You have deliberately decided not to hold a debate in the group.
\"Even before the background that there were no substantive differences, we cannot understand this step,
SPD Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condemns the violation of the Lower Saxon Greens' representatives Every Twest to CDU as a betrayal.
“The behaviour of the former Green Members in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal of the electorate, but also betrayal of Red Green,” wrote the Federal Chief of Social Democrats on Friday on Facebook.
He supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to re-elect the day of the land.
The exit of Twesten costs the majority of Red Green in Lower Saxony.
The politician, \"in her hurt vanity and in her frustration, place her personal interests in the well-being of the country, criticised SPD Secretary General Hubertus Heil.
\"It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony is involved in this dirty intrigue and is trying to beat political capital from it,
Niedersachsen's CDU Group Chief Björn Thumler wants to recommend to his colleagues to include Every Twest in the CDU.
The head of the SPD in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, accused Twesten of falsifying the result of the 2013 Landtag election with personal career thinking.
The CDU was the strongest in front of the SPD back then, but SPD and Green had a thin majority of one voice in the country day.
Minister of Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from poisons, Mr Schmidt?
Germany discusses contaminated eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) is interviewed with the editorial network Germany (RND) speech and answer.
Mr Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamping.
At the consumer protection portal www.foodwarnung.de, the Federal States submit the latest information on the egg charges concerned.
The eggs concerned should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, after all we know at present, a health hazard is practically excluded.
Is Aldi now taking over the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the reconnaissance officer is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture?
Food monitoring is the task of the federal states.
Nevertheless, my house has shut down immediately and has been in close exchange with the authorities of the countries since Germany became aware of the concern.
All information and risk assessment can be obtained for consumers.
Trade, as well as manufacturers, has to ensure that the products sold are transportable and safe.
If the maximum residue content of 0.005mg/kg is exceeded in eggs, they are not able to be transported.
However, unladen eggs can be sold and consumed.
This time, the companies are not to blame.
Do production companies and consumers sit in the same boat?
According to current knowledge, production companies are not directly at fault.
Rather, they have to face economic damage due to suspected illegal practices of service companies.
As always, there is too little control in serious cases.
Is it only on staff or also on key competences?
It was just the official controls that uncovered the process.
However, the truth is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded 100 percent.
This is precisely why a consistent explanation of such events and the handing over to the prosecutors in cases where offences may occur are crucial.
I have already made it clear several times that I expect the responsible authorities to provide a complete explanation.
Is regular alarmism really necessary in food scandals?
Consumers have the right to obtain only safe and transportable food.
If an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly offended.
As a result of the money being spent, manufacturers, traders and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary.
In principle, it must be clear that the illegal use of the Fipronil insecticide in the holding of food-supplying animals is not acceptable and must be completed immediately.
This must be done consistently and with high pressure at all levels.
I expect all competent authorities to clarify the matter quickly and without delay.
How the financial rules of football affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered expenditure by European football clubs will not disturb Neymar's world record transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.
Some of the consequences will still come for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, because the leading organization that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial Fair Play rules launched by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG must at some point prove that Neymar's transfer was financed without major losses.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ($262 million) to buy the Brazilian out of its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG can certainly make the money loose so that Neymar can sign it and bring it into a galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team through the power-rich family of Qatar.
Associations are allowed to spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players, but must counter with legitimate sources of revenue that allow them to make the break-even point in their football-related business.
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA President in 2007.
The former French player believed that if banks or owners withdrew their support, associations that had committed huge debts in pursuit of success would be effectively cheated and risk ruining themselves.
In 2011, FFP shifted from concentration to the debt of the clubs to the monitoring of their losses.
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - a club with potential bought and then invested vigorously to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a harder matter.
During the current three-year FFP submission period, which runs until 2018, clubs can increase losses of 30 million euros.
And even though Platini has fallen from the presidency in Ignorance in 2015, his UEFA successor Alexander Ceferin continues to work to deter excessive spending.
“FFP is certainly not dead and we’re going to reinforce the rules for the future,” Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP at UEFA, said to The Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG has paid Neymar's buy-out clause in a package, it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the sum of discharges for the next five years can be designated to amount to 44.4 million euros at the end of the year.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 the PSG, along with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, has met with the most severe sanctions.
The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (at that time 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the 2014/15 Champions League season remain limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to cross-list their financial supervision by flagging up their revenue from companies associated with the owners of a club.
While a Qatari company might sponsor the PSG if the value of the sponsorship exceeded the standard market rates, UEFA would not consider this a legitimate income.
That was precisely what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of the PSA sponsorship was blown up by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It has been reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come from payments made by the organization committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have argued that Neymar will become World Cup ambassadors and that such a maneuver could be easy for UEFA regulatory authorities to find out.
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more careful to observe any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymar's transfer, said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.
They spoke to The Associated Press under the condition of anonymity, since they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG 2015/16 has achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with sales of 542.4 million euros.
Accounts for the last financial year have yet to be published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandise and jersey sales.
The association assumes that after signing sales will increase by at least 30 percent.
The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players going, and she tried to prevent Neymar's withdrawal by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP.
“It’s a clear case of financial doping with the club and the state,” said the president of the La Liga, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar’s ultimate ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose association is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that finances an association.
“It’s the consequence of ownership and this has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the last 15 years,” Wenger said on Thursday.
“As soon as a country owns an association, everything is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect the financial fairplay because you can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a big actor to represent a country,
Swiss is looking for a new Schoggilieferant
In recent years Chocolate Frey Bord chocolate has been manufactured for the Swiss.
Now there is a possible end to the cooperation: the airline is re-signing the order.
Swiss spokesman Meike Fuhlrott confirmed on request of the news agency sda a corresponding report of the newspaper “Northwestern Switzerland” on Friday.
According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control.
“We are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolate Frey,” said the speaker.
Around 17 million small red-white packed schoggi plates spread to 14 grams per year the flight attendants before landing to passengers.
The Swiss didn't want to give any information about the costs.
Industry insiders estimate the volume of orders according to “Northwestern Switzerland - to 1.5 to 2 million francs - the Migros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around one billion francs.
But more important is the advertising effect: for a shoggi manufacturer it is a prestigious order.
How many applicants there are at the new tender, the Swiss does not want to betray.
However, only Swiss manufacturers come into question.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolate Frey wants to try to renew the contract beyond the spring of 2018.
For the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion.
The Swiss team of chocolates has been distributing their flights since 2006.
Before the Swiss signed a contract with Migro's daughter, Barry Callebau had delivered the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hug.
The possibility to place the logo introduced Swiss two and a half years ago with the start of cooperation with Chocolate Frey.
The airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-distance flights, customers of the First Class are spoiled with delicacies by the Confiserie Sprüngli, in the Business Class wet passengers Schoggi by Lindt and in the Economy Class Schoggi by Chocolate Frey.
Swiss Schoggi also distributes from Chocolate Frey on the short line, both in business and in the Economy Class.
Athletics - Discuss Olympics Robert Harting reaches WM finale
The three-time world champion fights for a medal at the finale on Saturday.
His brother Christoph, Olympiasieger of 2016, had failed in the national World Cup distinction and could only look at the discus competition from the Tribune.
The Polish title defender Piotr Malachowski, who was 65.13 metres wide, also qualified for the final battle.
Nostalgia enters the niches of \"Wet Hot American Summer\" and \"Comrade Detective\"
This replay of history is also nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80s, for the 90s-green era (as the thinkers David Wain and Michael Showalter turned the Sketch comedy \"The State\" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went to bigger things.
As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-capable era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time would be scarce.
“First Day of Camp” worked surprisingly well, not only because of its absurd humor (it contained an original story for a talking box of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By grasping the core of the gag - actors of middle age play horny children who grow - they still created the inability to win back the last part of the joke.
‘Ten Years Later’ with its adults now playing adults is less emotionally rooted and its parody goes more according to the Gießkanne Principle, including a riff on the 90s’ Stalker films such as ‘The Hand That Rocks the Cradle’, ‘The Hand That Swivels the Wedge’
At one point, a character bursts through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and a series of other things from 1991,
Many of the central stories are the same.
The lovable Coop (Mr. Showalter), now Roman author, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) still has not lost his virginity.
And there's another crazy and evil plot in which Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) is involved, which is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good impression by Michael Ian Black).
As always, the excursions are the best part of the franchise.
It is especially fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillon's lower lipbar of \"Singles\", whose former Big Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old cracker.
These are the moments of random madness that this franchise could heat up as a kind of recurring “Seven Up” series until it reaches what I accept as its logical conclusion: “Be Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later, its last scene will show the band how it will visit the film premiere of “Wet Hot American Summer”.
“Comrade Detective - on Amazon now reminds us of another kind of nostalgia: the revitalisation of the Cold War by “The Americans” of the film “Atomic Blonde” and even of “GLOW” with its East-West Ringfighting Iconography.
The comedy with Rhys Thomas, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, as director, indicates to be a TV series found: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles - a harshly spoken Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici whose dialogues are synchronized by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some beautiful gags to watch (the police spend time watching chess on TV, as Americans might do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - ensures a decent game 'Find out the voice'.
But “Comrade Detective” is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer who wears a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single one.
In six long episodes, it moves there, and comedy is not fast or frequent enough.
“Comrade Detective - who was edited to a lesser length, could better deliver his agitprop satire, as Gregor and Iosef would visit the American Embassy again and again, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who are devouring a bunch of Hamburgers.
The message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything for food for a living.
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: we do it even with our own younger history and with the hairy.
Battle against drug mafia in the country
The police succeeded in a blow against the Italian Mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Schwarzwald-Baar-Kreis, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the prosecutorship Konstanz announced on Friday.
15 defendants between the ages of 25 and 77 were arrested and orders were issued against them.
In addition, officials secured larger quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros.
Two people were arrested in the same case in Italy.
There were German arrest warrants against the two suspects of Italy.
The two are therefore likely to be delivered to Germany.
The action involved Italian and Bavarian investigators.
In total, over 300 police officers were employed.
Members of the Mafia are accused of organised drug crime, violent violence, attempted murder, robbery and extortion.
As of summer 2016, the prosecutor's office has determined Konstanz against organised drug trafficking in the South German area.
Between the prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo there was a regular exchange and the investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
Therefore, on Wednesday morning, the big effort was accompanied by four officials from Palermo.
In the course of the investigation, Italian nationals were particularly concerned with Italian Mafia.
Also an incident on May 27 in Hüfingen, where several shots were fired in a restaurant early in the morning, should go to the account of the band.
How to complain large gaps in foreign register
“Data from citizens who should not appear there”: According to a report, the Foreign Registry in Germany has significant shortcomings.
This led to partial grave misdecisions in asylum proceedings.
According to a media report, the Federal Government Refugee Management Officer Frank-Jürgen Weis has drawn attention to large gaps in the Ausländerzentrum Register.
Deficiencies in the data registered there could lead to “partially gravitating wrong decisions” in asylum proceedings and deportations, warned in an analysis provided by the “Süddeutsche Zeitung”.
According to the register, 10 million people with foreign nationality are recorded, including about 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data is therefore managed by about 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
Because the data had not been adequately maintained, the data quality in parts had not been good so far.
Data from 1921 were found in individual cases, \"of people who have long since ceased to live, or of citizens who have become German citizens and should not actually appear in the register\"
“Faulty data input can significantly slow back processes,” the report continues.
EU citizens were also included in the exit statistics, which would not have to leave at all.
Such false assignments led, however, to a distorted debate on how to deal with out-of-the-way agents, it is therefore in the analysis.
Meanwhile, the Federal Government has apparently begun sending refugee families back to Italy with under 16-year-old children when they arrived.
This is reflected in an internal paper from the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the \"New Osnabrücker Zeitung\"
According to the paper, the BAMF has carried out such procedures, with the exception of infants and younger children, to Italy since 1 June 2017, \"
Since the end of 2014, this was practically impossible, the newspaper referred to the difficult situation on the spot.
Under the Dublin Agreement, refugees are responsible for the EU state they first reach.
If one migrant continues to travel to another EU country, this State can send him back to the country of entry.
On the basis of this, the Office now writes: \"In the meantime, the inclusion capacity for families with underage children in Italy has increased significantly,
Italy has provided guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (EGMR) considered these commitments sufficient.
Other EU countries would also send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement.
In the Bundestag, Ulla Jelpke, spokesperson for domestic politics, criticized this decision: “Families with children are threatening human rights-free admission conditions and endangering child welfare because of the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system,
Second best result obtained
A total of 220 litres of blood of individuals living in Oberrichenbach, the blood donation service has already been made available to other people.
At least the twelve citizens awarded on Friday.
All ahead of Jürgen Greule, who now shared 50 litres of blood with his now 100 donations.
Traditionally, in the meeting of the Council of Communities, the municipality deserves the repeated willingness to donate blood.
“It’s ingenious how our body is designed for this and we’ll show respect to the donors who provide their blood for strangers, yet useless to it,” said Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
“A single blood donation helps several people,” explained the head of the German Red Cross (DRK), Holger Maisenbacher, because the preserves are broken down into their components.
That's how three people could benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported the actions carried out in the spring in Oberrichenbach.
“This year, we achieved the second best result with 114 donors,” said the DRK preparation manager.
Obviously, the change to the theater house led to higher attendances a few years ago.
Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were already among the multiple donors and were awarded 50 blood donations each.
In half that many book Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Prummer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter spent ten times each 500 milliliters each.
The Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to later announce that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weakening of inflation have dampened speculation about an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue as it keeps the interest rates on family income in the midst of a rising pressure.
The policy-makers of the Monetary Committee (MPC) of the Bank voted by 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.25%, with fewer members reaching an increase this month, as poor economic growth has weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6% and warned that the pressure on household income would continue, with inflation expected to rise to almost 3% in autumn.
But it signaled that in the coming years, interest rates would be needed to curb the inflation of Brexit and said that credit costs might have to rise more than expected in financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw some of the mammoth economic package that was published a year ago after Brexit.
It will require time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from next February, although it has been said that it is now expected to make 15 billion pounds more available within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling.
Minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the Bank said: “In the central forecast of the MPC, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term, as the pressure on real household income continues to burden consumption,
On interest rates, she reiterated that “a certain streamlining of monetary policy would be necessary for the cooling of inflation and a slightly greater extent than the markets would expect.
Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another one in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that increases would be made gradually, and limited.
The Bank's below-corrected growth forecasts for this and next year are compared to the 1.9% and 1.7% predicted in May.
It has maintained its growth forecast at 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell against the dollar and the euro after these news.
The pound fell by 0.5% to $1.31 and fell by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision does not change after the recent disappointing growth figures have reduced the rising expectations for an increase in interest rates and GDP has risen from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3% in the second quarter.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will recover slightly after the bank by the end of the year.
The recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and low wage increases, as the deterioration would be worse first before it would improve.
She added that in the next few years monetary policy cannot \"stop the loss of income\" but added that wages will recover “in a significant way” by the end of their three-year forecast.
The economy is also boosted by the rising demand for British goods, which is due to the weak pounds, which will compensate for some of the lower consumption expenditure.
The decision comes one year after the reduction of interest rates to 0.25% last August following the shocking EU vote which caused the fall of the pound.
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years to achieve the prices and the economy fully.
Before the Bank's last judgment on interest rates, the call for an increase in interest rates increased as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policy-makers calling for an increase of 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell from 2.9 % last month in June to 2.6 %, although the bank said that this was expected and that it would attract them again in the coming months.
The Bank said that the overrun in relation to its 2 % target was \"very\" attributed to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “In view of the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market is expected to become more competitive as the creditors are keenly looking for business and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those who run out of the existing deals and conclude the new mortgages, and many with free of charge options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular,
NHS (The National Health Service) is to prescribe controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
From September onwards, patients will be given access to a \"transformative\" HIV prevention treatment after a battle before the High Court against the funding of the drug in the NHS.
NHS England announced that a pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) taken prior to sexual intercourse can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by about 86 percent is now delivered by the health service over a first three-year study for an estimated 10,000 people.
He declared himself ready to finance the process after the Court of Appeal confirmed last year a judgment of the Supreme Court, according to which the NHS had the power to pay for PrEP despite the claim that local authorities should finance it.
The check train announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England Chief Simon Stevens as a \"important new intervention\" while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described this as an \"deciding moment\".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to enable the registration of people, and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a sequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in infected people.
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means that just enough medication is available in a person's body to prevent HIV infection.
Such medications can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and persons with HIV-positive partners who have not been treated successfully.
In clinics, appropriate participants are identified that agree to the study, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People living in England who are registered with a family doctor may also register to participate in their local participating sexual clinic.
The programme will be £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week after an international competitive procurement.
The study aims to assess the overall potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on how it is used, recorded and implemented on a large scale.
Stevens said: “This great new intervention should complement and overcome the wide - reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in the progress that has continued for more than three decades in addressing one of mankind’s greatest health challenges,
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: “This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, when targeted at needy and vulnerable people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September onwards, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and is not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement,
Ian Green, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Terrence Higgins Trust, said: “The priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk of HIV is left behind.
Now that the PrEP test medicine has been acquired, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people,
Sharon Hodgson, Minister of Shadow Health, said: “The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delay and delay in implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and ending the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect individuals who are HIV infected and that it will contribute to the end of the spread of HIV in society'.
Living the Great Life: Intermediate and smart designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a generous home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, reduced himself in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court Apartment.
It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is evidence of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.
“I used to live in a much larger room with my ex in Knightsbridge,” Joanne says.
“I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer this day,
Since the first visit, the 1,000 square feet apartment has been completely overlaid.
Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage room and an intermediate floor to make optimal use of the spacious ceiling height.
“I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
That was my request - she says.
To this end she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed from Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms over each other, so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor where you could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the requirement.
“The steelwork is quite complicated,” he explains.
“We had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked over each other without having to bump.
It was not just about building a simple platform, but building the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below,
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms at full height above each other - with much extra drama.
For the intermediate floor, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius overlooks the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.
At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to make it work longer.
In the kitchen the mirror feels like a window in another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units provide space for all cutlery and glasses by Joanne.
Through the perception of a glamorous room, the beauty of the living room can lock the kitchen if it is not used.
Cracked kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.
“A bit of engineering went into that,” explains Erfan of the steel-strengthened, furnished MDF door.
“It’s counterweighted, so when you push the door up, it slips very easily,”
Thanks to the clever use of room and storage room, Joanne was able to win an additional 16 m2, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
“At the end of the day, you’ll sell the floor area - or as your property is estimated - says Erfan.
‘In a rudimentary form, a real estate broker will enter and carry out a calculation based on the size of the ground,
Here they have managed to expand the floor surface and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.
“The materials are the things that touch you and therefore help you create an emotional bond in a home,” says Erfan.
“You don’t fall in love with the electrical plugs in the walls.
These are important, but they don't play with your heart,
It shows that an apartment can turn into something very amazing by good design and increased square meter number of something by default.
In fact, like Joanne, you might decide not to leave them.
Brothers fight for a $500 million real estate empire
Two brothers are in a dispute over one of Victoria's largest real estate empire worth over $500 million after her Italian family founded the dynasty.
The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors away from his younger brother Paul. This has brought him to the Supreme Court to explain how their property and business assets are to be divided.
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a sharp debate on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother Anna, the brothers own 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the family bought a business in Smith Street, Collingwood in 1973.
There the Westco Jeans family founded and grew into a chain of 160 retail shops.
It was sold for $85 million in 1999.
This money was invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburb.
After an agreement with her deceased father, Colin, described by Paul as a “main operator and the dominant personality, has about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul has about one third of the company's assets.
A court act states that this means that Colin owns property worth 316 million dollars and Paul worth 176 million dollars.
The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.
“The splits proposed by Colin left him with what I thought was the best objects,” he wrote in a first Affidavit in 2015.
The first hearing of the Supreme Court took place last Friday after several failed hearings.
The brothers now also fight for control of the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims, excluded him.
Colin argues that this is not true, but proposes Paul to administer some possessions incompetently.
In an early Affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
“My Italian heritage suggests that the family is the most important priority,” he wrote.
The costs rise in the case, with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and lawyers held by both sides.
Ms. De Lutis and her late husband, Luigi, were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicate food shops from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used the security to buy the Collingwood property, in which Colin opened the family's first Jeansladen.
Colin says that he started Westco there when he was “in my last years of high school when Paul was a small child (about 10 years old).”
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, were hoping to pass on their property to their sons.
“Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court,” she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis Group, where Colin claims that Mark was paid 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars on leaving the company.
According to Paul, both Luke and Mark, \"the terms of their financial separation have become bitter,
Colin has remained very much behind, although he was a former AFL board member and after a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire, he was the best friend of the television star.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin replied by texting, saying, \"I really can't say much, because the case is before the courts.
“It’s very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and draw our family name through the courts,” he wrote.
In mid-2016 Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he was trying to meet his brother's demands.
“Our father wouldn’t have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current dispute,” he said, adding that he was always hoping for a solution.
On Friday, this hope seemed to be over.
“Our case will be resolved by the courts in the near future,” Colin wrote.
Trump's new Chief of Staff plans to restrict the President's media abstinence.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he'll be the first.
Politico reports that the new head of staff of the White House plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including news media reports, in the hope of keeping the head on a more uniform course.
Here's a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:
\"When John F. Kelly, the new head of staff of the White House, met with executives on his first working day, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House, which he wanted to repair: bad information that got into the hands of the President.
Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he received good information -
Kelly's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump's relationship with television is far behind us for decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his TV advertising is still strong.
\"If candidate Trump was upset with unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of places to convince, said former electoral adviser Sam Nunberg to Politico in February.
Politicos Tara Palmeri at the time wrote that “the key to keeping Trump’s Twitter habit under control, according to six former election officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant praise award,
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit was ever \"under control\" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don't know to others - that Trump's tweets without their interventions would have included even more fertilizer.
We will probably never learn anything about the tweets that Trump did not send.
If his employees managed to keep him away from trouble several times, then their efforts paid off.
But no one has been able to prevent Trump from causing controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, constantly try to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump with material that may promote their views of the world.
Politico, all concerned with this story, reported in May on the preference of the consultants to provide the President with questionable information for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
“Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press cuts, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he can find out where they come from.
That was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocator Charles C. Johnson, who accused Deputy Stabschefin Katie Walsh of being “the source behind a heap of leaks” in the White House.
Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter because of Shikans or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that in the past he expressed false accusations and rescinded them.
Trump read the article and began to question employees about Walsh,
Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff, Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, have tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork that Trump receives,
How did that work?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his consultants are still striving for influence.
These unchangeable factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Most-infected criminals receive mail from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the community is asked for assistance and hoped for.
In this summer (virtual) postcards were sent to dangerous criminals on the run by the police throughout Europe.
Since the addresses of the sought-after criminals are not known by nature, indications from the population are expected and prayed.
Europol reported on Friday the action that follows the winter ‘EU Most Wanted’ Advent Calendar.
Experience has shown that many refugees hide from holiday destinations, it was called Europol.
21 postcards have been compiled for sought-after criminals from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016 there has been the website www.eumostwanted, more than 2.5 million times it has been viewed.
36 of the online searches could so far be arrested, at least eleven of them due to references after publication on the website.
Travelers negotiate a grave and return to the 'Millionaires series'
Some of the most prosperous houseowners of the West Midlands are once again standing with some determined travelers on the foot of war, who have negotiated a grave drawn by the municipality to demand a field back in front of their mansions.
Travelers have parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a prosperous road of Solihull, which is called the \"Millionaires series\".
They brought horses, babies and an army of transporters with them only after they were thrown out in May, but without being deterred by a tomb dug out by the Council to prevent their incidents.
The tactful group found a gap in the defense systems and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way.
Angry residents have threatened the Council of Solihull, who said that it is useless to deal with the problem,
An anonymous resident said: “They moved there on Monday evening after being sent by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones on the passersby.
The Council must be forced into action by shame to implement it, as it was useless in dealing with the problem.
Travelers were there in May, were moved and are back now.
More arrived last night, probably today even more,
She added: “The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with this by holding long lessons to protect its parks.
I live on the Streetsbrook Road and I'm not happy to continue paying my municipal tax if the Council can't even stop this,
A resident who did not want to be mentioned said: “It’s ridiculous, we just saw the last round of these travelers just to be plundered by another round.
The figures have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the park area,
A spokesman from the Solihull Council said: “We are aware of an unauthorised camp in the country beyond the Streetsbrook Road and are working with Solihull’s police. We are taking the necessary legal steps to move on as quickly as possible.
To support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many people as possible report an anti-social or criminal behavior to the police by calling 101.
This contributes to creating a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case,
From Birkenhof will be Waldhotel Luise
From the former Hotel Birkenhof the Waldhotel Luise becomes.
The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year.
These are good news for the city.
With the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Betriebgesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014, around 30,000 nights per year were lost at the time and also revenue from the tourist tax.
In autumn 2014, in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees coming to the county, the hotel building was offered to the Landratamt as a gathering accommodation, resulting in controversial discussions.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a construction plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not incontrovertible at that time in the Council of Communities.
But especially Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel's location and spoke of serious stakeholders at the house at the time.
He should be right.
The Luisenhotels Group with managing director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a home of the three-star plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
The former Hotel Birkenhof has been in front of the entrance for a long time, and when you enter the house, it will be clear how extensive renovation work will be carried out.
The floors were torn out, ceilings partially dismantled, old baths removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single building.
There's still a lot to do by March.
“It’s actually a beautiful hotel,” Thomas Scherer says in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large walkable showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are built.
Everything was to become \"beautiful citizens\" later, as Thomas Scherer expressed himself.
\"We want to make a piece of jewelry out of it,
Swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room are among the facilities.
You don't want to position yourself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already at an elevated downtown level, Scherer emphasizes.
The Waldhotel Luise, with its about 60 rooms, wants to build itself wide, continues to explain Scherer.
Both individual holidaymakers, groups or business people should feel comfortable at the hotel.
He has already conducted talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause, says Schererer.
The city's ideas were similar to those of the hotel group.
\"We are on the same line,
After the level of investment is asked, Thomas Scherer does not want to determine himself exactly.
Just under a million euros, he reckons.
The exterior systems are also brought to the front, which is already clearly visible.
A large terrace is built in an courtyard, which will be accessible from the restaurant, which is public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: \"Friend City is a good market\"
Russia case: U.S. Special Inspector uses Grand Jury
According to a report by the U.S. President Donald Trump, Sondermittler Robert Mueller is supposed to have used a so-called Grand Jury in the Russian affair.
In the past few weeks, the board has taken up the work, and the \"Wall Street Journal\" has called on people familiar with the matter.
The newspaper rated the step as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigations.
The CNN transmitter reported that there were already first calls from the board in connection with a meeting between Trump's oldest son and a Russian lawyer.
U.S. secret services have long accused Kremlin of having been specifically involved in the 2016 presidential election campaign.
Mueller examines whether there were agreements between Trump's electoral team and Moscow.
The focus of the investigations is on several men who acted in the election campaign as consultants of the Republicans.
According to reports, Mueller also took over more and more Trump's private and business environment.
The \"Washington Post\" wrote a few weeks ago that the special investigator Trump had personally moved to the centre and investigated the allegation that the president might have been disabled in the course of the affair.
The main task of Grand Juries is to examine available evidence in possible crimes and to decide whether to raise charges.
Grand Juries are therefore also called charge chambers.
Most of the time, they are switched on when they are major and controversial cases.
The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.
The board may also be called on by the prosecutor in order to invite persons to take an oath.
According to the CNN transmitter, pre-charges have already been issued, which revolve around the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
Those involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement, as stated in the report.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump's adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his then-elector Paul Manafort were also present during the conversation.
On Thursday night in the U.S. television, legal experts said that the establishment showed that Mueller was not shy of his work and that he wanted to act quickly if necessary.
However, it would not necessarily have to be said that the Grand Jury would be put to the end to decide on the investigation of an indictment.
Nevertheless, the establishment of the board was the start of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause for concern for President Trump.
In the midst of the new revelations, the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portray Russia's affairs as a campaign of his political opponents.
“Russia history is a total invention,” Trump said.
The issue gives Democrats an opportunity to \"feel good because they have nothing else they can talk about\"
His special advisor Ty Cobb explained in an opinion that he knew nothing about the establishment of a Grand Jury.
But these also usually worked in secret, he emphasized.
The White House endorsed any measures that would speed up the work of the special investigator in a ‘fair’ way.
The former FBI chief James Comey said three times that it was not against the president.
There is no reason to assume that something has changed about this was further mentioned in the statement.
But Mueller had only been deployed after Trump fired Comey.
Because of this outrage, accusations against Trump had become loud, he wanted to hinder the justice.
Comey said in June before a Senate committee that Trump had asked him to stop the investigation against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The President is under great pressure because of the investigation.
After the presentation of US media, the White House collected material against the special investigator and his employees.
This triggered speculation as to whether Trump wanted to dismiss Mueller.
Unlike an independent special investigator of Congress, such as in the Watergate affair for later resigned President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the wishes of the President by the Ministry of Justice.
However, several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.
Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators introduced legislation on Thursday, after which the special investigator could no longer be so easily dismissed.
Antarctica: Giant iceberg drives in Antarctica
In the West Antarctica a gigantic iceberg of the nearly seven times the size of Berlin has resolved from the shelf ice.
This was shared by the Bremerhaven Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.
The colossus, which is over a billion tons heavy and 5800 square kilometers [5800 sq km], is now driving north and will probably take two, three years to melt.
It is 175 kilometres long and a width of up to 50 kilometers one of the largest ice giants that researchers have recorded over the past three decades.
A danger for people does not come from him.
The extent to which climate change has played a role in the breaking down of the iceberg is unclear according to researchers.
However, for about 30 years there has been a series of unusual collapses of ice shells in the region, the US Research Centre for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) writes in a factual background.
Many researchers believe that this could be related to global warming.
The colossus, which had now been discontinued, had so far been part of the Larsen C shellfish.
Shelfeis swims on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
As a result, it continues to grow in the sea and regularly breaks down.
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic peninsula.
North of this shelf ice was disturbed by the balance of waxes and demolition a few years ago.
A complete shelf ice fell there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There is a lot to say that the Larsen-C shell is also in danger, because the front edge has never been as far behind as it is currently.
In addition, the ice plate is under tension and can decay if a piece breaks off at a key point.
The melting of Schelf ice and iceberg does not increase the sea level, as it swims on the water and pushes ice as much water as it results after melting itself.
However, the loss of the shelf ice causes the glaciers to flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before.
This could perhaps increase sea level, but only to a small extent, writes the British research project on the observation of Antarctica (Midas).
The Larsen-C shellfish is the fourth largest shelf ice in Antarctica, according to AWI data with almost 50,000 square kilometers.
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.
There, it breaks down regularly.
“Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position,” said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University.
“This is the farthest withdrawal since the beginning of the records,” he also confirmed.
Among scientists, his colleague Adrian Luckman said: “Our models say it will be less stable, ” he said.
But this development will take decades.
Even though these researchers do not reduce the drop of this giant iceberg to climate change, many of the Antarctic peninsula ice shelfs have collapsed over the past decades.
This long zipple of Antarctica extends towards South America.
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey research program, the Antarctic Peninsula ice area has decreased by 28,000 square kilometers since the 1950s.
The increase in temperature has contributed to the decrease.
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed around three degrees over the past 50 years, counting on the areas where the temperature is fastest growing.
CDU wants home fare on staff
As it becomes more and more difficult to occupy free jobs, the CDU calls for exit from the employers' association to become more attractive.
It was not until shortly before the summer break that the county day won 41 new places in the administration.
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now 17 trainees have their first working day behind them.
The teaching sites in the circle are apparently very desirable.
Some 620 applications were made for the places to be awarded this year.
However, the circle still lacks staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks.
At present there are still 50 unoccupied places in the district of Mettmann.
Among other things, doctors and engineers are sought, as well as forces of general administration.
The CDU now wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG on the circuit day and address the lack of skilled staff in the administration.
The administration should develop a concept of staffing and personnel development according to the wishes of the parties.
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs of professionals, but to counteract future-oriented potential shortages, it says.
The overall approach should be oriented inwardly and outwardly, show concrete measures for cross-country beginners and include training opportunities, demand CDU, FDP and UWG.
That sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle has to deal with staff problems that you didn't know before.
Other cities attract good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
The talk is about a right of rule to apply to public employers,
In addition, a high number of employees are excluded from the service due to sickness or age.
So the maximum time to act is that no more places remain unoccupied.
But Klaus-Dieter Völker, head of the group of the CDU, goes beyond the common application with his party.
He recently made a fantastic surprise in the county day when he publicly questioned the personnel cost cover and surprised the other parties.
People want to check out all options that allow for withdrawal from the municipal employers' association.
\"If we do not come here to a satisfactory solution in the short term, the county administration should seek a domestic tariff with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county towns - so peoples.
In this way, the CDU tries to pay employees and officials better than it actually provides for the public service classification.
The salaries are currently precisely prescribed, there are increases or more money only if one changes to a higher level, which is oriented towards working years.
But the responsibilities of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up where employees were concerned about the provisions of the new Prostitute Protection Act.
Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and County Director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too few staff.
Italy strengthens the tone towards NGO migrants rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs that if they do not adhere to new rules for their operations, they must not continue to do so.
“If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work,” said Minister of the Interior Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.
Minnitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat from the German aid organization 'Youth Rettet' because their team had effectively cooperated with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The relief organization, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to make a detailed statement to the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
“For us, salvation of human life remains our top priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment,” said the organization in an opinion on social media.
“We can only assess all the charges raised at present after we have collected all the information and can assess the situation,
The Italian authorities had monitored the boat of 'Youth Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.
It is assumed that his crew will be taking submarine migrants on board, which will be delivered to them directly by human dealers, and that the smugglers will be able to take off so that the ships can be reused.
At least such a meeting was allegedly held only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the file of the prosecutor, whose content was published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected to be outlawed by the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other motives.
Under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must have, in particular, an Italian police officer on board who oversees their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue efforts have so far agreed to adhere to the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable, as they would not bring “essential changes or disabilities” to their rescue actions.
Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Laureate Organization of Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti now said that in recent weeks the number of migrants arriving after the rescue measures in Italy has declined significantly, suggesting that efforts to strengthen Libyan Coast Guard and cooperate with local mayors have been successful.
“In the last few days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel,” said the Minister.
He announced plans for further discussions with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Rises and Trials
Neun Weilermer Biker, the \"Berliner Austernposten\" and two guest riders met in Wachenheim in the North Palatinate to enjoy quadruples and sights for four days.
Three friendly guides were available for this.
The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour took place at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.
It followed points of view, partly on towers, from which one could look far above the plaza forest and the pre-laid plains.
In the meantime there were always longer increases for which long trials rewarded.
On the second day, Bad Dürkheim went to Saline and to the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.
Again, the prospecting point reached a point of view, linked by “flowing - Trials and moderate increases.
On the last two days, many height meters were again indicated.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and entrance huts brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim the bikers breathe in the open air inhaler healing Sole.
Neustadt was also managed.
After 173 kilometers and almost 4,500 metres of altitude, the group had met the Pälzer Wald from its best side - sporty and cultural.
Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga is equipped for e-sports
Do the sports stars sit in front of computer consoles in the future, instead of struggling with wind and weather over the stadium terrace?
Fact is: E-sport has long become a serious industry, becoming a lucrative business - large stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gags included.
This has also been recognized by the first federal leagues, which are increasingly engaged in this area.
In 2015 the VfL Wolfsburg began, followed by FC Schalke 04 and lastly by VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sport department in mid-July and took two pros for FIFA 17 computer game.
“We hope to inspire entirely new young target groups for the VfB,” says Jochen Röttgermann, Executive Board.
He is sure, \"that there are still several associations on this train\"
The next weekend, the World Football Association in London organises the first “Interactive Club World Cup” in which the gamers of different clubs compete.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven have qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sport.
The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players.
“The real football has to deal especially with the 14 to 30-year-olds that the young people go to the stadium in the future,” says the 52-year-old.
And: The associations tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asian ones.
With prominent E-Sportlers under contract, one could be more often present on these markets online than just sending the Bundesliga team to Asia once a year.
What exactly is it about?
In E-Sport, computer games such as \"League Of Legends\", \"Dota 2\" \"Counter Strike\" or \"FIFA\" are fought at competition level.
Longtime, as in normal sport, leagues have also established where professionals compete against each other.
And at the 2022 Asian Games, E-Sport is already part of the official program.
But is it even a real sport?
For many, the idea is certainly necessary.
Ingo Froböse has also long dealt with the question.
For the professor at the German Sports University in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sports - e.g. increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
It also required cognitive skills, technical and tactical understanding and rapid reaction ability.
Professional gamers should not only exercise at the console, but also train their body and pay attention to the diet.
\"The fit player is a good player\"
But Froböse also sees problems: \"Doping is becoming more and more a topic\"
Controls were difficult to perform in online games, and in the scene the structures of classical sports were missing.
The scientist has a positive impact on the high integrative effect of e-sport.
The players are on the go internationally, which is like a large global family, there are no intercultural barriers.
A study of company consulting Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth for E-Sport.
As a result, EUR 50 million had been implemented in Germany in 2016, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and large tournaments.
In three years the turnover will be 130 million.
Against the nearly 2.4 billion euros of the Bundesliga football league, this is not so much.
However, the e-sport “no longer far away from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey“ is written by the Deloitte consultants.
Internationally, many countries are already on the move.
Large markets are Asia and the USA, where ex-basket ball players Shaquille O`Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez participate in the US team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSports betting provider uniques.
There is also a lot to do in Europe.
In a Norwegian school, E-Sport has been introduced as a teaching subject, says Froböse.
In the Netherlands and in France, the First League Associations, according to Dutt, are now obliged to set up an e-sports department.
“In the European comparison, Germany is lagging behind,” explains Röttgermann.
Only to fall into nostalgia, and to explain the old times, is no longer enough.
It is about preserving the tradition of the association, but at the same time aligning the company with the modern market.
“We live in a digitized world,” Dutt says.
“It cannot be held that only football remains everything as it was always,”
Gift-Eier ade - The egg alternatives to cooking and baking
Almost all federal countries are now affected by the scandal of poisoned eggs.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord have responded and have removed all eggs from the sale throughout Germany.
Only eggs are to be taken into the shelves, which are evidenced to contain no fipronile.
Michelle Carter convicted of the texts that pushed Conrad Roy to commit suicide
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend to commit suicide through texts and calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her sentence behind grids and five years on trial.
Carter was sentenced to death in June of Conrad Roy, who died on 13 July 2014.
Roy’s father said at the hearing on Thursday: “My family is uncomfortable.
My son was my best friend,
Carter was allowed to remain free until he was called.
She had been confronted with a 20-year-old fine, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy were suffering from a mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and a creamy blouse, Carter stood there with tears in his eyes, with folded hands, and facing down, when she was condemned.
“Your actions killed Conrad Roy,” the prosecutor told the court.
“She ended his life to make her own better.
She took no responsibility, she said.
“She has shown no repentance,” she said.
But Carter's lawyer said that it was a \"fearful circumstance which she was completely disappointed\"
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said that he did not find out that her age or maturity or even her mental illness had a significant impact on her actions,
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother Lynn Roy saying that there is no day I didn't mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything. I try to be there for his sisters despite all my pains that we will have for eternity - it means there.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said that she would be “followed” by the knowledge that she would never take part in her brother's wedding or be an aunt for his children.
“Not having this only person with whom I have been together every day since my birth is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life,” she said.
The case seems to put a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case drew national attention after Carter's text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life.
“Get up, jump from a building, first yourself, I don’t know, there’s a lot of ways - she said in several news that she sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote: “You have to do Conrad and everything you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy.
Judge Moniz said Carter was seeking attention through Roy's death and ordered that they should benefit from the case by any press.
The case has shared the legal opinion.
Among the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was sentenced to death in Italy in 2007, before being released two years ago.
Ms. Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times: “Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison.
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from the new mini-Lahm of FC Bayern
That Joshua Kimmich was allowed to run as captain at the Audi Cup is no coincidence.
The FC Bayern believed that the Confed Cup winner was a big season - extra motivation doesn't hurt there.
Something else in his place in the cabin saw Joshua Kimmich immediately, even though the extra garment was very, very small.
But since far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup, of course, there was no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer to see, he made the tie assigned to him to hold his arm.
“The coach didn’t announce it,” said the confed cup winner after his first operation as a Bayern captain.
Well, the stand could have run better than the 0:2 against the SSC Naples.
But the sign of the coach could be similar to Kimmich's.
Not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal had been selected as a game leader in the C-Elf from youth players, debutants and pros who had just arrived on vacation.
Sugar is best distributed to those to whom you trust a lot that you want to keep in a mood.
Therefore, those who have been chosen to enter the heritage of Lahm can only use a small extra motivation well.
Kimmich confirmed: “That’s what you want as a player: take responsibility,” he said.
On Wednesday the 22-year-old flew over the field as a mini lamb.
Right back, that's his position now, the white tie on the arm did you else.
And at all, Kimmich worked in this initial formation like the one who can best take the rower into his hand.
He gave instructions, tried to direct the uninformed troops.
He had a look for the whole, while many others were busy with himself.
Vidal by overplaying his lack of fitness (had hardly worked); Renato Sanches by exposing the devil to the performances of the Asia trip (also worked only as a condition); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Sulle by not striking negatively in their first appearance in the Bayern jersey.
That worked very well.
Süle ran alongside Kimmich, Rudy in front of the defence, both of them acting sovereign.
The famously occupied Napoli storm has often been difficult, and Süle has also tried to be successful in the game building a few times.
His colleague Rudy admitted, though, that the result was \"not the way we expected it to be\"
But he also showed good performance at the debut.
Game shift, tempo change: \"I was also picked up for this style\"
How unusual this Bayern world is for the new entrants, we saw after the party.
Rudy, for example, did not give one or two interviews in the catacombs, but determined six or seven.
Kimmich adopted a few concise statements in the back of his new fellow players.
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle: “I’ve already noticed what's going on here.
At Bayern you just have to win every game,
After all, he doesn't have to teach the new one anymore.
Alaba motivated ÖFB women
David Alaba believes in the success of our OFB ladies
Austria's best-known footballer reported on Twitter just before the game and the ÖFB ladies wanted everything good.
The Bayern-Legionary is almost a clubmate of ÖFB-Captain Schnaderbeck, and with our ladies it's fair.
The Tweet of the Austrian footballer of the year and Champions League winner should be a special motivation injection.
The famous Bayern-Dusel might also need our ladies well.
Company satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate Minister: Wissing's Business Praises Tempo
The relationship between the country and the regional economy was often inconvenient, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhineland-Palatinate.
This is evident after more than a year when the new Minister for Economic Affairs Volker Knowing (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region speak on T V's question of a change in economic policy - and at the same time, the old minister teases.
Frank Natus, Chairman of the Association of Trier Enterprises (VTU), says: \"Wissing takes on the wishes of the economy, which Lemke has blocked all of them,
Natus sees the biggest turning point in infrastructure policy: The gap between Kelberg and Adenau is now very high in the country's list of priorities.
Even this year, the Ministry hopes to establish a plan by 2021.
A role in the country's plans is also played by the western revolution Trier, which is at the forefront of the federal roadmap.
The aim was to take the route into operation in December 2020, says Ministry spokesman Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees it as a guide to supporting regional but internationally competitive enterprises.
The Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK) Trier, as suggested by Wissing, aims at a Rhineland-Palatinate label for wine in order to increase sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of German wine exports that have been falling for ten years.
In addition, Knowing has an open ear for people who want to set up their own company, the IHK praises.
The Chamber of Crafts Trier sees in the new Master Bonus an additional incentive for young trainees, says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.
A premium of 1000 Euros is provided for the master test and 2500 Euros if graduates are self-employed within ten years of master training.
However, the homework list for the country remains long.
For the planned road construction to be quick to create facts, at the same time, the country lacks the necessary personnel, says Jan Glockauer, head of the IHK Trier.
From 56 new engineers who want to set up knowledge in the country's business mobility, only 29 jobs have so far been occupied.
The IHK calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices.
CDU Group Vice-President Christian Baldauf refers to calculations by the Court of Auditors, the country invests more than 20 million euros in the receipt of national roads than proposed in 2017 and 2018.
Frank Natus also expects a concept of the country as it wants to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region.
It is also worth noting that the previous broadband expansion in the country has been underway.
In 2016, regional companies only rated the network supply in an IHK survey with Note 3.4.
They complain about growing internet connections and breakdowns.
Ex-Economy Minister Eveline Lemke, on the other hand, is currently out of politics and is still in charge of the wind power company Pro Wind.
The Green Group left Lemke for April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where after four months she had already returned to the field because of disagreements.
Audi to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter-reaction
One day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would offer to update the software into more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said that the company believed that \"there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions, and was concerned with banning or restricting diesel vehicles to European cities, including Munich, where BMW is based.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the company as a recall.
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules on carbon dioxide emissions.
But the nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogenic and can cause asthma.
The cost of car manufacturers to install systems to neutralise exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of chopping the powerful car companies and of ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid the failure of Volkswagen, which could regulate the use of so-called shut-off devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car has been tested but go back under normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several Volkswagen employees were charged, while others were investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month the former director of thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be brought before court in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen, after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe, and an application focused on the United States was extended.
The involvement of Audi in the investigation could seriously burden Volkswagen: The luxury automobile manufacturer contributes disproportionately to the profit of Volkswagen.
This message has the river on Saturday at the Isar
The city wants to protect the Isar.
So that the Isar visitors can join us, on the morning of Saturday a river passes through Munich, which has a special message.
When it gets to the Isar on Saturday, it will see a large river between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke.
And that's not a usual river, with Isar tourists.
Unless the building department wants to clarify.
On the river you can see a large information transparent.
It shows a garbage dump.
The start to a public campaign to appeal to the Isar visitors.
With the motto “Wahre Liebe is ...” the understanding for the Isar is intended to sharpen as a protective wild river.
Last summer the river flowed across the Isar and also this year there were further actions and measures to achieve a respectful and environmentally conscious behaviour.
Mordillos Knollennasen and laughing at the suffering
Mordillo was at times one of the most widely published cartoon characters, the knollennases of his figures are his trademark.
Even with 85, the Argentine still draws and works on a film.
His message: laugh, “for there is too much suffering in the world,
Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4, 1932 as a Spanish immigrant in Buenos Aires.
In the first years as an artist, he beat himself up as a signer of lucky cards, which frustrated him.
“The happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job, ” he once said.
After stations in Lima, New York and Paris, he managed to break through at the end of the 1960s: with the release of his cartoons in “Paris Match” and then also in the “Star” and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
Again and again, the artist was inspired by cities.
Large round Mordillo figures twinkle in drawings with the sliding tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.
In the early morning, according to his own information, he is still sitting on the drawing table today, working almost ten hours a day.
About calendars, puzzles, books for big and small, t-shirts, plushs and watches, its drolly figures continue to be widely spread worldwide.
For six years he has also been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his figures.
The main character in the film \"Crazy Island\" is a giraffe - Mordillo's most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousand-footer as its opponent.
For the first time, his figures speak in the 3D film, which will come to the cinema screen in 2019.
“I don’t know exactly what they’re going to say, it’s strange to me,” says Mordillo.
The script is not written by him.
That is why it relies rather on the TV series, which, like its original drawings, is produced without words.
Lavender from Provence Threatened by Climate Change
He has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change.
The lavender is declining due to the conditions of drought and insects transmitted by disease, which causes great headaches for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, expert at CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence, said: “The lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years, which has brought much less rain in spring and much more in autumn.
This has an impact on Lavender's lifetime.
There is also a small cicada, a microbacterium that transmits dwarf cicadas, and in very dry weather there are many of them,
And there's a lot on the game.
lavender oil not only attracts holidayers, it is also very sought after for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: “Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil,
The solutions considered include better water distribution and slowing the evaporation from the ground, but also spraying the plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and developing varieties more resistant to drought.
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön celebrates its 1200th anniversary.
This Saturday and Sunday are a festival of the Middle Ages.
Krämer, Zünfte, Dealer, Vagant or a Landsknechtslag are to be experienced in the city centre these days.
The murder of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico
The employees of the weekly Riodoce usually meet on Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the State of Sinaloa through organized crime, corrupt officials and unstoppable drug wars.
But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They were informed that it is important to change their routines.
Two high-level journalists discuss what feels more secure: they should take their children to the office, which was the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a board on the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
You ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and abdominal sensations are sufficient.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the government or cartel salary list, a catalog of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.
There is no peace of mind of violence, and while the bodies are being hoarded throughout the country, there are more and more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 have been under federal protection after attacks and threats, and until now there have been at least seven dead in seven states this year.
Among the latter is her editor and her inspirator of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
“The biggest mistake is to live and be a journalist in Mexico,” Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs.
His absence is deeply felt, although his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word \"Justice\" depends on the facade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts showing his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panama hat.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, trauma, nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special state attorneyship was established in 2010 to handle the cases of journalists, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, only two criminal proceedings were initiated.
As with most thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organized crime each year, journalists' murderers are rarely brought to trial.
At Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are insolent and although the terrain is even more treacherous.
Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little benefit, says Ibarra.
“It’s very stupid to waste my time in this workshop,” he says.
“As long as we don’t know the reason, we’re all distrusting “
On the morning of May 15th, Valdez left the Riodoce newspaper office in the capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. He was forced out of his car and was shot at 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which is translated by \"Twelfth River\".
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left behind a woman and two grown children.
Rumours tend to fly around freely in Culiac.
But there is virtually nothing but silence about Valdez.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and delivery to the United States in January, Sinaloa had become one of the country's bloodiest battlegrounds, as rival groups are fighting here to fill the vacuum.
It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the road or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-storey mausoleas for drug kings who are bigger than many houses for the living.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of “rest” when only one cartel has control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States.
Despite and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is guilty of failing to protect his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings contributed to the murder.
First, in February there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival antitrust factions in the war with Guzman's sons.
This publication may have irritated the sons, suspected gang members bought every copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper skioske.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to establish Riodoce and sold $50.
In Sinaloa, “it was impossible to run journalism without hitting the drug problem,” said Bojorquez.
In time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved to be able to publish hard-working investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.
Eight years after the creation of Riodoce, she received the prestigious \"Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize\" for reporting in Latin America.
In the same year Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for His Courage in the Persecution of Mexican Drug History, wherever she led her.
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid.
“I want to live on,” he said at the time of the CPJ award.
In an interview with Rompeviento-TV last October, he said that drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a way of life.
“You have to take on the task that applies to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dummy.
I don't want to be asked: \"What did you do in the face of so many dead people ... why didn't you tell me what was going on?\"
The Riodoce team miss Valdez, the fun bird who could fast like a port worker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They relied on his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love for routine his destruction?
His death has also forced her to question her own assumptions about how best to do her work and stay alive.
“You don’t like it if you’re dealing with their wives, their children, their clean businesses, their secret start and runways, to move drugs.
“These things were not allowed,” Bojorquez said.
The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-responsibility.
Trust his own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The trouble is, said Riodoce Andres Villaral's editor, that \"Touch is a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happened with Javier --
The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as not in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a toxic mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the space where the employees of Riodoce met for safety training, no cell phones were suddenly allowed. Days earlier, spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two policemen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.
They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a middle-class quarter of Culiacan.
Half in the bar, some of the reporters asked whether these officers belonged to the 50 percent of the police, which the governor himself described as untrustworthy.
It has been months since the reporters went to the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are de facto under control.
For this week's issue, Riodoce has looked at three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of the former well-known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposé to the state expenditure that focused on the governor's hometown.
And there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiac, a block away from the prosecutor's office, who carried out a kidnapping.
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was given when it became time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated almost the whole century all political levels.
Recently, several PRI governors were accused of corruption because of high-ranking cases.
Villaral asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this local, including one in which a son of \"El Chapo\" Guzman escaped a military robbery.
Only a few months earlier, readers had considered Valdez's column as the best informed source of kidnapping.
“We used to know what happened,” said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname ‘El Flaco’ because of its slim body position.
“Now all channels of communication with our sources have been broken,
Valdez's office was turned into a storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists because the employees became something they would never have expected of themselves: activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez snapped a few signs and went to a demonstration the next morning because of another journalist's office.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed, in the western state of Michoacan.
A burned body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is its.
Throughout the country, journalists have become louder by writing down “SOS Press” on roads and buildings in organized protests.
On that day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and is trying to gather international support for justice in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day after Valdez was murdered, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying out journalists and killing them because they said the truth.
She has since asked for the government to divide her again because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were of organized crimes, government officials and an indifferent society.
In his last book, Narco Journalism, he wrote that reporters were killed not only by drug gangs but also by the orders of politicians and security forces who were under cover with organized crime.
The media guard group, Articulo 19, has allocated more than half of the attacks to journalists of police and officials last year.
“You die in Mexico because they want you to shut your mouth,” Ramirez said.
Obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect.
No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found along with a note that was allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: \"Here I am because of my reports\"
A computer keyboard and headphones were next to their separate head.
Some branches have chosen to close like El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue to do as did El Manana of Nuevo Laredo after the murder of her director in 2004.
In 2010 the Diario de Ciudad Juarez was publicly addressed to the drug cartel with a guide article on the title page with the title “What do you want from us”
Some journalists have fled from their home states or even from the country.
It's a painful decision.
It is hard to find work in exile, and they are still watching the streets and looking for dangers.
And sometimes they are hunted, as it appears to the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz.
For those who stay back and continue the work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that the drug trafficking scares him.
“Mexico goes to hell, and that’s why I became a reporter,” he said.
At midnight last Friday, when the last issue had already ended, the editors of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer when at once all their phones began to sum up.
A series of shootings with band rivals and security forces near the town of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war escalated further, as promised by a series of Cartel messages in the region.
From the edge of the board, they have published the news on the website of Riodoce via mobile phone.
The title page had to be changed the next day.
Sirenn lifted up nearby - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez took a look at the police officers who kept watch to see if they were ready.
If they were afraid at all, they wouldn't show it.
Under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible to the entire Sinaloa, the employees of Riodoce followed his tracks.
“How can you just think of closing it,” Bojorquez said, “when the same day Javier was murdered, the practitioner asked me to send it to the street for reporting,
Dinosaurs used tarnishing to wipe out their enemies
At first glance it looks like a statue, though a frightening one.
Researchers have now found that the first findings of the incredible Nashorn of a Canadian miners were so well received that experts described it as “Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs”.
It was so well preserved that they even found that his shuffling skin was of reddish brown - and they said she had something of an \"unruly past\".
The report in the journal \"Current Biology\" described him as \"the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found and one of the best dinosaur copies in the world\"
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaurs, which lived in the middle of the creed period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredibly well-preserved state has surprised researchers who describe it as “actually remarkable”
According to National Geographic reports, the armored plant eater is the best preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.
He met something that the surrounding rock failed to seem in place and decided to look more closely.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years detecting the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg).
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
“If you are just blinding a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it has slept,” said the chief author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is seen.
“It will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur copies - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs -
Researchers have found that this plant freshener, although covered with armor and similar to a changing tank, was probably threatened by meat-fried dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white tart to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counter-damaging, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed him to mix better in his environment and to escape his enemies, experts say, which suggests that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old creature from the Nodosaurs family made headlines for the first time in May and can now be seen at the Royal Tyrrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Boraleopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours carefully discovering it.
The amazing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of sheds and armors about his body.
They discovered the counterestimation, a widespread method of defense in the animal kingdom, which means that the creature's tip was darker than its underside.
Although the counterestimation is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Boraleopelta far exceeds that of today's living animals.
It indicates that the dinosaur was hunted with sufficient pressure by meat-free dinosaurs that evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals that use the counter-scattering - think of deer, zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, which signals that this nodosaurier was exposed to a real struggle for survival.
“Strong predatory behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the time of the creed must have been,” Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to examine the animal for indications of his life, including his preserved intestinal contents, to find out what it ate as his last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, got into a river and was driven out to the sea, where he sank on his back to the sea floor.
At that time Alberta was as warm as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much farther inland than they are today.
“This nodosaurier is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved skin, but also remains preserved in three dimensions and retains the original shape of the animal,” Brown said.
“The result is that today the animal looks almost the same as in the early time of the creed.
You don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. If you just had a little eyelid with your eyes, you could almost believe that he's sleeping,
The time of the creed was a time when huge theropods, meat - bearing dinosaurs, standing on two legs, crossed the earth.
Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his frightening ancestors.
This includes the Acrocantosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons heavy monster.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Boreopelta was sank and mumified in mud after the death of the sea.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is complete from the snout to the hip.
On average, the creatures were about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch long peaks, which ranged from its shoulders.
The researchers believe that the armored plant eater was swam through western Canada until a flooded river flowed into the open sea.
But the dinosaur's underwater burial kept his armor in exquisite detail.
The stoned remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still cover hollow-prige armor plates along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as rare as a profit in lottery.
The more I see it, the more confusing it becomes.
Hidden remains of the skin still cover the hollow-primed armor plates that carry the skull of the animal.
His right forefoot lies on his side, his five fingers are spread upwards.
I can count the scales on his sole'.
In the thunderstorm: mass carambolage on A8: Many injured
Heavy accident on Thursday night on the A8: Nearly 30 vehicles are engaged in a mass-carambol situation.
There are numerous injured, kilometres long traffic jams - and Gaffer.
On the motorway Stuttgart-München (A8) about 20 people were injured on the late Thursday afternoon at a mass carambol site.
According to the police's first information, at 5 p.m. between the Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen connections (Aichach-Friedberg County) during a thunderstorm, almost 30 vehicles, including probably trucks, were interlocked.
The exact number of injured persons did not exist at first.
It dealt with mild to moderate injuries, said a police spokesman.
A major ban on rescue vehicles was at the accident site.
The A8 was completely blocked in the direction of Munich.
In the direction of Munich a ten-kilometer-long backstair was formed.
As reported by an AZ reporter, there were massive handicaps on the counter-road - by numerous gaffers.
The firefighter noted the characteristics of the vehicle lights, which are now subject to sensitive penalties.
Shortly after 18:45 a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dating.
There had been a collision between a car carrier and a car.
A rescue helicopter was on its way to the accident site.
Deutsche Bahn: Group tests \"Comfort Check-in\"
It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once: nothing without sitting in the train and sleeping.
Or you're deep down in his work and just have a brilliant thought.
And then, pufff.
Come the sheepman and wake up an onslaught or tear the passenger from the middle of the workflow.
Ticket control.
But the times of interruptions are soon over.
The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the powerless ticket control.
You simply confirm by cell phone that you take your place and thereby devalue the ticket.
Currently, a test operation runs on two routes.
“Come on to the offer, we extend it.
It will then be expected to be available on many more long-distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year - said a rail spokesperson.
“Comfort check-in” calls the train the ticket evaluation without a shepherd.
However, in order to be able to use them, some conditions must be met: a smartphone or tablet is needed.
And you must have booked an online ticket - which anyway does most passengers.
You also have to buy the DB Navigator app, which is the most convenient way to book tickets anyway.
And last but not least, you need a seat reservation.
Because the \"comfort check-in\" works like this: you get into the train, call its ticket under \"My Tickets\".
In the case of test customers, a button for electronic depreciation will appear.
The train attendants get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y.
If the passenger arrives at Y place at the ticket checker, he knows that there is a passenger with already devalued online ticket.
So you can continue to sleep, continue working, keep silent.
The “check-in” has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn is to use the passengers.
“If you want to travel without a ticket control by our train crew, just check in on the DB Navigator yourself.
This allows passengers to make their travel time more personal on the train, says Michael Peterson, Marketing Board of DB Distance Transport.
Second Plus: \"And our employees have more time than today to respond to the individual customer's needs\"
Those who travel often know that, in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket controls are among the biggest troubles.
Because often you have all the documents you need to delineate online tickets yourself, but in any case one of the fellow travelers does not have all the documents you need.
Either the credit card or the ID card or any other document you need to present is missing.
The following are endless discussions between train attendant and passenger, which leads to poor mood in the compartment or large room and delays in controlling your own ticket and will end up taking the time to take care of other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.
And this is only on the links ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.
Other train numbers on the same route are not yet fully accessible.
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: “Whose Streets”
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core.
Only one day after she arrived in New York City, she was born in St. Louis on the bed of an airbnb apartment which she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stuttered about a post by someone from high school.
“The police have just killed an 18-year-old child, and it is still on the road,” it said.
Confused that no one else on their feed had posted the information, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @TheePharaoh was constantly retweeted on their timeline.
The rapper from the area of St. Louis was to tweet the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo., live.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.
“That’s wild,” Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new for her and her community.
She put her phone off to return to Tweets later in the evening about people on the Canfield Drive.
There were photos of the police band and people screaming, and of a man who claimed to be Brown's father, who carried a sign stating: \"Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son,
She observed a live feed where a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a calling dog.
In another video, she said, another policeman secured his rifle and shouted: “I will kill you... animals all,
“This is not usual,” Ferrell recalled.
“This is not the kind of murder that we have become accustomed to and which we can typically call “
At that moment I felt gunpowder.
I was angry and crying,
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 2 p.m., she took her six-year-old daughter out of her father's house and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the theme of a new documentary, \"Whose Streets\", in cinemas from the 11th century onwards.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance, which consists of people living in the community and filling the streets to ask for answers.
When Ferrell went to Ferguson with her daughter, who wore a flower dress and a suitable crown, they discussed a conversation that they had countless times before that morning \"about the black experience and the black state\".
“You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in, she remembered what she said.
“We’re going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn’t right.
I couldn't take her with me - said Ferrell later.
“What has happened today is a climax of what happened in the past.
She needs to know and see it and be raised in it.
It must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also know the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we must do to become free to free ourselves.
Even though I am lucky to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience any eclatant racism, she is no different from the next black woman-child.
I have the feeling that I would show her a bad service to keep her away from it,
The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was on the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority that became a camp area when the activists waited for the possible non-indictment of Officer Darren Wilson.
There Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who had lunch.
They prepared bags and helped pass them on to demonstrators.
Slowly, a new kind of activism for Ferrell began to take shape.
“My activism changed completely after August 9,” she said and noticed that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food equality and health inequalities in black communities.
“I had no experience in organizing.
It's all come,
Weeks later Ferrell met during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors.
Folayan said that she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar only wanted to \"document\" what happened.
A question came to mind by Ferrell: “If you want to document or try to find a story that you can take advantage of,
This skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often by whites, in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience.
As Folayan recently said in an interview: “We had heard that people born and raised in Ferguson did not center their voices and we wanted to do it differently,”
Folayan had already cooperated with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field who is known for his activism around death tract inmates.
Ferrell brought the project closer to the project, along with six other locals following the team of Whose Streets in the years following Brown's shooting.
“This documentary isn’t someone who speaks for us or talks to us. We’re talking,” Davis said.
“This was the main thing for me, as these people are portrayed, because that’s how I’m going to be portrayed.”
The aim was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement was not a Messiah leader, but a community that comes together - Folayan - she proved herself to be the most open-minded participant in the film.
As a result, documents from Whose Streets show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life as she falls in love and marries her wife.
“I felt like naked,” Ferrell said, laughing when she saw the finished product for the first time.
\"But I understood that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people,
Furthermore, Ferrell's story repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives-Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement, who, following the killing of the black teen Trayvon Martin in 2012, marked the film \"BlacklivesMatter\" in social media, identified themselves as gay.
\"Black, gay women in leadership positions wore the movement in total, said Ferrell, \"and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black, gay women must bear the main burden of everything,
Folayan agreed, noting that “the movement is really held up by black women and many black women,”
However, it insists that \"this is not an affirmative type of action, at which Ferrell has been selected as the heart of the film because of her identity.
“She was the person who raised this energy,” she said.
“It’s no coincidence, although it was at the front, because in a life at these intersections as a black, gay woman there is so much on the game.
You can feel their energy through the screen,
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have disappeared for a long time, but the racial links between the municipality and the police continue to exist.
Ferrell is on trial for 21⁄2 years due to the blocking of a motorway during a demonstration.
She describes the social atmosphere of the area, which she calls her home: “A chaos.”
Nevertheless, she clings to a song and feels this memory committed, since three years ago she went to the street in Ferguson.
“It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose - except our chains -
From “Traum” to “Graßenwahn”: TV readers discuss bit gallery
The bit gallery moves people, although it is not yet built.
But the idea of a shopping mall on the south of the pedestrian zone splits the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.
Cold hardly leaves the subject one.
The topic will also be discussed on our Facebook page \"Volksfreund Bitburg\".
While the one to the bit gallery says, \"That would be a dream (Anja Becker) or \"That would be really great\" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: \"Don't smoke a man\" (Siggi Betzen) or simply: \"Größenwahn\" (Lars Scholz).
While the proponents build on the fact that a gallery attracts more customers into the city, which also benefits the rest of the business, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will then bleed out.
In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the plot on which the farmer's market hall is located, where 13 direct marketers offer their products.
This will end at the start of the construction work.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Beda Square with the possibility of sitting outside.
Simone Zimmer: “We have been shopping in the Farm Market Hall almost weekly for many years.
Basically our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the country women always very much like again.
We have also discovered the mackerel for us.
We would wish that during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.
There is also this in other cities.
The small market hall in Frankfurt is especially interesting:
Gerd Densing: “Whether direct marketers live in a market hall in the gallery, the amount of rent will rise.
However, it may not be very low in the new project,
Eva Kilic: “Where to shop in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I find this superfluous.
There's enough of that in our city already.
You can see how many store shops are empty here - some for months and years.
However, since there is not even a proper weekly market here, it is all the more important that at least the market hall is preserved.
In any case, the product offered there is fresh, mostly directly offered by the producer and is priced above.
As you can see, shops in a shopping mall are only rented by larger companies, because the rents there are often not portable for a retailer.
Damage, special transactions are almost gone and what is left of them is likely to disappear,
Wolf Fandel: “A shopping mall with a market hall doesn’t match for me.
And the gallery doesn't fit into Bitburg.
Above all: Where should the farm market hall go during construction time?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run, if the bit gallery is actually coming.
Or it can already be done by the Spenst Bit Gallery to drive all stores out of Bitburg,
George Marquet: \"It just won't work.
And a shopping center that stands empty doesn't need anyone either.
In my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farmer market instead of this gallery.
But for a farmer's market hall, thanks to the crazy many - as I find - senseless construction projects in Bitburg no longer place.
When the farmer's market hall is broken, a piece of culture disappears again,
A suitable similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces can be seen - white, black and brown, which are almost unnoticed - hanging on cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheek-tupfers and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where the former intelligence analyst had committed a 35-year prison sentence after making it public as secret diplomatic reports about the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, which was opened on August 2, is called A Becoming Resemblance (a suitable similarity).
She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a trans-wife and pioneering dissident whose condemnation of Barack Obama was transformed when he had only three days in his office.
Dewey-Hagborg, through the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted from Manning, has created 30 portraits of how someone with this genomic data might look, has a sharp, though somewhat intellectual comment not only on the formality of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also creates identity.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward, but has spoken openly about identifying as a woman since her puberty, was convicted of 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.
As a result of the prison, her picture was suppressed, so much so that there was only one single photo - a grainy, black and white selfie, in which Manning apparently sits unwell on a driver's seat and carries a platinum-bloated wig - with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
In it, the artist produced portraits of aliens from forensic artifacts such as cigarette dust and gum by extracting the DNA from waste to produce an image of what these people might look like.
That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.
“They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a sort of portrait to accompany this article,” said Dewey-Hagborg in a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't visit at that time and she couldn't be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal letter friends, who over the course of two years exchanged several letters.
They even created a comic-suppressed images illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, who predicted a future in which President Chelsea's judgment would be transformed and she would be able to see the exhibition personally.
The fact that after a few days of publication of the book, Obama would demand Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy meeting.
There is also now something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump is leading a war against informants from the government camp and against Transgender troops to find new, second-hand ways to continue flamming the rigid divisions that he should actually fix.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that \"things happen for a certain reason\"
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for an end to automatic splitting, the basis of which was gender, race, sexuality and culture, with her oversized signature (which is in her family name with a heart).
On the opposite wall is its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandth of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotide according to the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist) how surprisingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.
“What people will hopefully take with it is that our genome does not care who we are and how open genetic data are to interpretation and how subjective they are,” said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, is also visible.
\"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so these are 30 of these stories\"
The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in its own space, is a page from the comic novelle mentioned above.
She shows Manning how she appears with a free speech phone in her hand from the disciplinary barracks of the United States like King-Kong.
“If they calm your speech, they won,” it says.
“So never shut your mouth “
“It came directly from a letter she wrote to me,” said the artist from Philadelphia.
“I still get geese skin when I talk about it “
Manning has not personally seen the exhibition - as predicted in the comic book - but if she should do so, then she will be welcomed by the masks in the middle of the room, by her own genomic simulacs, which join together like hordes of protesters.
This was also targeted, like everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5 - 2, Mannings stature), where their genetic haplo groups with pencil were written.
“In the past, I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd of people,” Dewey-Hagborg said about the portraits.
“I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that was forming with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind her liberation.”
Professor of Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University looking for killing
A nationwide human hunt is in progress for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University who is sought suspects after a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago had suffered fatal injuries.
On Monday, for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) arrest warrants for murders for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau were issued, as shown by the files of Cook County's court.
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stings.
A Community warning system published by the Chicago Police Authority states that the body was discovered on July 27th.
Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead at the place of the incident, and detectives were investigating the stings as murder while the police were actively looking for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice President of University Relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem was now on leave and was excluded from entering Northwestern University campus.
“This is now a criminal case examined by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University cooperates in this investigation,” Cubbage said.
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesperson from the University and Somerville College said in an email statement that “we are in contact with the police in the UK and ready to help the U.S. intelligence authorities in any conceivable way,
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to stand up.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he strongly demanded the suspects to stand up to the authorities.
“The police have an idea of their place of residence, and our efforts to locate them are strengthening,” Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities help to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious tip that said something happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
“We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship,” Guglielmi said.
The Grand Plaza management team published a statement to the residents: “The police are currently working on the time axis and background of the victim and are exploring a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident,
\"We will complete the WADA roadmap in the near future - the Russian Vice Premier Mutko
The Russian vice-premier Vitaly Mutko said that it will not take long for the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) to be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
“At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, RUSADA has been given the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this respect, said Mutko on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA Roadmap to comply with the code, which described the criteria for re-establishment of RUSADA and was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutko, he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia.
“All has been announced, everything is being implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future, he added.
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by WADA by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren into alleged state-funded dopings in Russian sport.
As to the matter, Mutko said: “We are conducting the investigation because our anti-doping system has failed.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no state programs, and we won't admit anything that doesn't exist,
Mutko's words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian anti-doping commission.
In conversation with the Russian sales agency RSport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov added problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but added: “We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one has proposed to accept this report unconditionally - added Smirnov.
In November 2015, in the course of the Doping scandal, RUSADA was excluded from carrying out doping checks in Russia.
However, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After a visit to Moscow's headquarters in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli said that RUSADA is moving in the right direction to be used again.
Aldi sells no eggs before
This was shared by the groups of companies.
It was a purely cautious measure, and no health impact could be caused, as stated in the Communication.
From now on, only eggs should be delivered to Aldi, which have been proven to have been tested negatively for fipronil-containing anti-lutics.

The start-ups that will help your company not become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the luck of your e-commerce start-up with your employees, but the surveys didn't work.
Answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - fraudulent.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.
“There was simply never consistency and objectivity,” said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Society Madison Reed.
She called people from outside for help.
A new breed of Human Resources Start-ups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it allows companies to conduct surveys, address specific groups and demographic groups, provide employee anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass C-suite managers and directly turn to the Board of Directors.
“They now have tools like Strava and Fitbit to track their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company,” said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.
In addition to the snap surveys and surveys by certain teams, it offers a heat card from the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers show low consent results - so that you can re-examination why.
Companies come to realize that you have to stay at the top of the workplace culture to avoid becoming the next Uber involved in scandals since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment where those who spoke were punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could have more than $118.7 billion worth in 2020, according to the financial engineering website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, the company helps to prevent and recognize bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity beginning this year in the middle of the Uber trap in miscredit.
Convercent has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently signed up as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customised pulse- - surveys, collect confidential responses in real time, and view the heat maps of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And if the Chief Manager is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.
“The Court of Public Opinion has recorded the regulators,” said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convercent.
When a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves unethically, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, employee fluctuation and complaints, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.
Earlier, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or e-mail for the company headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidation and inconvenient experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees.
Now, as the company uses Convercent, problems previously hidden by executives sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practices - can be identified and addressed more quickly.
“I can get closer to this holistic 360-degree vision in the experience with employment,” said Vitrano, who is managing the Risk Management Group of Ruby Tuesday.
\"And we protect our shareholders from employment disputes,
Companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002, after the accounting company Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took the “social media to come to their right” that companies realized that you couldn’t prevent their dirty laundry from going online.
“Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy, ” he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and charge companies with recurring fees for using their products.
It is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in financing in February from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, thus raising all capital to $47 million.
Glitzern secured $10 million in November of Bessemer Venture Partners and brought his entire funding to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising given the networked nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than ever before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only operations.
The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you are giving your time to a company with a positive mission.
“If people are happy to be in a company, feel that their votes are heard, and that the work you do is worthwhile, then they feel more committed to making this company successful,” said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, who uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies run well. Companies run well when employees are involved and committed.
If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and the use of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.
The data on employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture is important.
But the data is useless if the managers of a company do not take action.
In fact, if a company asks employees for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.
And if change doesn't come quickly enough, or not at all, this can breed disappointments and demotivate employees.
“If you’re asking for 4,000 suggestions, you’ll have to be ready to have 4,000 conversations,” said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International, who has seen companies that rely too much on collecting data.
\"Because if you don't follow, employees will ask themselves, \"Did you really hear me?
Is that what you care about?
And who you don't care about, why should I? \"
Madison Reed, who is now conducting monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem about Glint is reported, he said.
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, she was able to reorganise several teams within the company through the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, and to add a communication training to address the problems.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company always receives new insights about the employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this will lead to a better binding of workers in a sector known for high turnovers.
“If you’re not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you’ll lose people,” said Vitrano.
“And if you lose people, you lose customers too.
And if you lose customers, then you will lose companies.
The NCAA eliminates two-day practices and makes a long day for the browns
It is about 23 a.m. when a lot of UCLA football players are entertained on one side of the team's new practice fields on campus.
Some have pulled out their tricotober parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.
For a good part of the team, these idle minutes represent a lunch break.
Players enrolled in the summer courses will return to the Wasserman Football Center after the three-hour exercise, before returning to the Wasserman Football Center the next morning at 6:30 a.m.
“This is a real treadmill for the boys for the next three days,” said Bruins trainer Jim Mora shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the load of players, and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday.
Therefore, the first three UCLA trainings should start at 19:15 in order to meet the players' already fully packed schedules.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the browns postponed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras performed six games in Westwood.
They are scheduled to hold 18 exercises during August. 20 before the formal game preparations for their launch against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said that he supported the rule change of NCAA, even if they added a further point to the players' busy routes.
“We put this huge burden on her for three or four days, and it’s very challenging,” Mora said.
“And they just pushed it through, they just prick themselves, they’re great people.
I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time, it'll be really great.
The UCLA will end its practices as soon as the camp is completed, which, in view of the clear lines of its fields of visibility, will be a adjacent parking space and the adjacent Luskin Center, a hotel of the elevated class, which has already been thrown with footballs, which will be a protective net behind a torpeast, not a lightweight task.
Brown players are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora admitted that there might be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season.
“We’ll use our security,” Mora said.
“This is a real problem, and it’s not far fetched to think that people are renting a room there and then setting themselves up there to record an exercise.
If you have the video tape of an exercise, it's a pretty good business.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces in parking lot 8.
We'll do the best we can with what we have.
That's why I don't worry too much.
We've got a plan,
Facebook wants to intensify fact checking in the fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false messages to third party fact reviewers and then display their results under the original post, said the world's largest online social network on Thursday. It is one of its efforts to combat so-called fake news.
The company said in an opinion on its website that it will start using updated machine learning methods to recognize possible false messages and send them to facts reviewers that may show results of the facts review from the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, many of which believe that they have also influenced the 2016 US presidential elections.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with French voters being flooded with false stories in the run-up to the presidential elections in May, and Germany is supporting a plan to punish social media networks if they are unable to eliminate hateful postings as before the elections there in September.
On Thursday, in a separate statement in German, Facebook said that a test of the new facts review will be launched in the USA, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In addition to the knowledge that stories of fact reviewers of third parties are being challenged, people want more context to make sound decisions about what they are reading and sharing,” said Sara Su, Product Manager for Facebook news in a blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature of the related article and will work on other changes to its news feed to reduce false messages.
Creating a Comic Roman: A Castle in the History of England
In his recent past, the little Scotey Castle was seen in a Squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotey has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophairy Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.
“I find it so beautiful to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years,” he laments.
\"What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand,
'A Castle in England' spans the time from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward and documents the families that lived in Scotney. Each story was illustrated by another, emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: he wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpected emotional.
“I only reacted to the thumb print on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for Jacobins,” he says.
“This is his thumbprint!
And letters always smell after smoke, because at that time a fire was lit because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect, as if it were itself.
Oh, I love Archive,
For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months, \"To be honest: I've overvalued my greetings a little, it seems all too nice to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian New Castle, searching the archives, and studying the many treasures and curiosity of the castle, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and bottles that had spent centuries in the grave.
He walked through the site and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscapers, gardeners and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he drank \"Whiskey and started to write \"
The intimate history of Scotey is relatively unknown, as the National Trust was not given full access until 2006 when the last Erbin, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees only began to take care of the archive, which he described as \"hundreds of years in which aristocrats said \"Oh, throw it on the rooftop\".
Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps representing who owned what: “One could think that land conflicts would be boring, says Rhodes, “but there was a birch to which two families fought.
Boys, let's go all the way,
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history on a broader basis, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.
“There is a record of a riot that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled ‘Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex’, says Rhodes.
“The peasant uprising started in this area and I thought that a rebellion was a good start.
Perhaps the two are connected,
Other stories are rooted firmly in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit father, which the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggling Arthur Darrell from the 18th century is depicted, who staged his own funeral by filling a scar with stones (a discovery made only years later when his scar was excavated).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family of Scotney: “The gentlemen seemed to be pretty gaunters, making debts again and again and again, spending money on things they couldn’t afford.
Other generations of Darrell men resolved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well-looking boys, with a talent to bet on,
After the end of his engagement in the castle Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences
He left behind a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki, the site of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has since been restored by nature.
But Scotey has a special place for him.
“I was sad to go back,” he says.
It was like, \"Oh, now I have to get done with the damn life again\"
Campaign started: Over 300 years old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf hidden
With the hideout of the 301-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf, the city of Bad Honnef launched its campaign on Friday to introduce a new roof mark (round show of Thursday).
Until Thursday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan secret.
At the end of August there will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth as a highlight of the campaign.
“To be nice to us.
Or, ask the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorf Chapel.
“We don’t really think that (of course!) - write them on their website accessible yesterday.
“But we use this measure to gain your attention.
And to make it clear that some things are better than they seem.
Basically, we are firmly convinced that as Bad Honnefer citizens we know very well about the beauty and attractiveness of our city,
The action involves more than \"only\" a logo and a slogan, it goes on to say.
\"It is necessary to formulate a single promise, one that gives the city a distinctive single position feature,
Finally, it is in competition with other municipalities.
A medium five-digit amount can cost the town of Bad Honnef its new roof mark and the campaign.
Military Reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's Fear of the Army
Every year at the beginning of August, Ankara of the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises on retirements and transports in the officer's body.
So is this week.
At first glance a normal process.
But nothing is routine with the Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt.
The meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff, as it was earlier, but in the office of the Prime Minister.
Under the chairmanship of the Head of Government, the five vice-premiers and the Minister for Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs participated now.
This made the civilians in the YAS in excess.
The government attracts the birds in the military.
Chief General Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the army, the air forces and the navy were suspended.
Since the failed coup, Chief of State Erdogan has fired 169 of 326 generals and admirals.
Over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged links to the movement of the exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, who sees Erdogan as a wire puller of the coup attempt.
486 persons who were to be directly involved in the coup trial have been negotiated in Ankara since this week.
As early as the day after the coup, Erdogan had called the overthrow attempt \"God's Gift\" because he gave him the opportunity to completely clean up the armed forces,
But does Erdogan really have the army in hand?
At the end of February, the newspaper \"Hürriyet\" published an article entitled \"Inconvenient in the Military Headquarters\"
In the general staff there were concerns because of an increasing \"Islamization\" of the army, which, among other things, manifested itself in the lifting of the head towel ban for soldiers, the newspaper wrote.
In any case, the large-scale cleaning of the army and the security forces continues.
In mid-July Erdogan had further 7395 state servants fired by decree, including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers.
It seemed as if Erdogan had tamed the military.
The generals were considered earlier than the actual lords of the country.
Three times, they relied on their role as guardians of the world's state order.
After his election in 2002, Erdogan pushed back the power of the military step-by-step, not least calling on the European Union's reform regulations.
Former officers say that Erdogan aims to advance an Islamization of the armed forces.
In the magazine “Vocal Europe,” a non-mentioned officer, who sought asylum after the coup for fear of persecution abroad, warned that the Turkish army would be in a few years of “full extremists and Salafists”.
If this were to happen, such a development could not keep the nato cold.
Nevertheless, in the alliance there is doubt as to the commitment of the Turkish army after the cleansings.
The management structures and operational skills are \"weakened\" say Nato diplomats.
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, said President Donald Trump, quoted by the media.
It intends to reduce legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining visas for a temporary employment permit and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The draft law is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress.
\"This law will reduce poverty, increase wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers and will do so by changing the way that citizens from other countries are issued Green Cards,
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy, said Trump, quoted by the American media.
Ministry wants to renovate route for raceway shuttle
Over the past few months, there has always been a struggle over the future of the raceway shuttle - now it should go very quickly.
Even before the end of the year, the sea route on which the tourist railway is heading will be built.
In order to secure the future of the race climb shuttle in the long term, construction work on the track should begin this year, according to the Ministry of Transport.
\"With the decision to continue ordering and renovating the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the country is aware of this important link to tourism, especially for tourism, said Transport State Secretary Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.
The cost of repairing the route was approximately 2.5 million euros.
Of this sum, the country took 75 percent.
The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle is to be ordered by the country in the future, is currently being finalised, said Sühl.
The Ministry and the South Thuringia Railway as operators already agree on the technical details.
“This is why the roadmap, the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated,” said Sühl.
The planned contract between the Ministry and the Railway Company will be concluded for 11 years.
This is to order the racesteig shuttle on December 2017 regularly.
The racesteig shuttle is a popular link between the Ilmenau and Rennensteig railway stations, especially for tourists.
In the past few months, in the course of a pilot operation, it has been tested whether the route will be used by enough many people to order it regularly in the future.
The route is also highly structural in parts.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should worry
Just when you thought it couldn't be any more crazy in 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming.
Yeah, actually.
Sex robots are a big thing right now.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, an emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must begin to take their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the chest wart and the type of fingernail.
“People make fun of them, but companies deliver a lot of them, and we’ll see them much more often,” said Mr. Sharkey in publishing his new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also adjust his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the chest warts to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it becomes even more disturbing, as many robots have the “personalities” that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicone skin.
For example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there are the Roxxxy Gold Sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as \"Frigid Farrah\" who convey the impression of shyness and \"Wild Wendy\" with an \"adventure\" personality.
“Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as adapted to your personality as possible, soars the website of True Companion.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
Over the course of the day, she also has her moods - like real people!
It can be tired, fixed on conversation or it can be “in mood”
There are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subjugating female traits, the plays on rape, when one steps towards frigid (here: resisting) Farrah, worry one most.
On his website, True Companion compared Roxxxy to a vibrator, but for men.
“If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can’t men have roxxxy,” it says on the website.
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just hold another sex toy.
Their emergence and increasing refinements point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a withdrawal from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional allowance.
Of course, most men will not keep sex robots, and while the FRR notes their increasing popularity, they will remain provisionally at the edge of consumer culture.
But what is sucked out of the margin zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time in which we live.
And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission to do so.
There is a certain overlap, however, that these highly developed sex robots appear in a time when the rights of women are threatened worldwide, in which there is a president in the White House who has threatened to have women sexually assaulted.
The most frightening aspect of the television series 'The Handmaid's Tale' ('The Report of the Magd') is not the graphic images, the veiled body and the outcast eyes, but how realistic this vision works.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment this does not feel like a great leap.
The goal behind these sex robots is to create a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as possible technically (even with pornstar proportions).
Their builders want them to feel humanly that they imitate the movement of a real body.
But, brought to the point, when it comes to their “personalities,” the robots do not represent real women.
They cannot separate from their companion or simply leave.
They have no mediation or background history, nothing that suggests independence or anything that might disturb the imagination of total submission.
In other words, they are fallen slaves.
Or to express it in the 2017 speech: Servicegirl
Trump's great performance?
He makes Mitt Romney the embodiment of common sense
It has become a binding feature of the Trump era that the political divisions that polarized the U.S. electorate have also split families in small format.
Around Christmas and harvest thanks, there were newspapers in the United States with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump choosing relatives.
We're all allegedly tightening ourselves up to let our filter bubbles burst.
Less noticed is the power of Trumps to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has been working with the Republicans in our family for a long time, has visited me this week in New York.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, anyone she knows, including the Republican relationship with whom she fought for decades for politics, is suddenly and quite strange on the same side.
This is certainly a good thing for the dining table, but it seems to me in a further context that this also entails considerable risks.
The left was strengthened by Trump, but the deteriorating effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we speak of \"normalization\" and Trump, we are referring to the horrific possibility that one day his little girls will no longer throw us away.
There is, however, an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump normalises Republicans of the right wing, who suddenly appear to be understanding of reason at once compared to his standards.
Today, I find myself struck by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's urcomic version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax statement looked) - both of which, compared to Trump, actually occurred to one as a very mild offence.
When Trump goes, the next candidate of Republicans only needs to be mentally healthy in order to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin was in town, we brought our children to the Karussell in Central Park, the largest of the New York Park Department's carousel, and the best three dollars that you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are enormously large, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are clumsy and the animals twist to look at their own shoulders with fear - extremely dark and the climbing music conveys this in a strange way.
So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings become old, the skylines become too familiar to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city will not meet the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I am still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss Cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but rather a major roundabout in northern London.
However, the Central Park Karussell is still a strange magical experience, since there are two two-year-olds here, an 11-year-old and two women in the 40s, all of whom have a great time.
If I could have evaluated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately nobody asked for it.
On the other hand, this week in a department store, I was forced to evaluate my \"experience\" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card.
In the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same thing, plus the option to balance the rating with a 15% drink fee - this to buy something over the shop table.
This not only slows down what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where there is no need.
The poor woman in the department store stood apologizingly bordering, while I was tired of making the experience of reaching her my credit card with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius, who is suffering from chest pain from the prison, is transferred to the hospital
Pistorius has for the second time left the prison for a hospital visit.
Last year he was hospitalized for the treatment of cuts at his wrists, which he reported to the prison authorities after a case in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal by the prosecutors against a first death sentence.
He killed Steinkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by shooting her on her several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he considered his girlfriend to be a nocturnal intruder who hid himself in the cabin.
The prosecutors have announced their intention to bring this time against the six-year prison sentence of Pistorus Appel, of which they say she is too careful.
The National Criminal Enforcement Authority said that it would object to the Supreme Court of South Africa and that the opposition could be heard this year.
Pistorius is at risk that his punishment will be increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
When Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg
As the last of the Blumberger schools, the fourth graders from pens and eppenhofs were released into the holidays and into the secondary schools.
Three of the graduate students will go to high school in the future, four to real school.
On Tuesday evening, head of school Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and public representatives of the Biesental Bürgerhaus in Epfenhofen.
As a symbol of school dismissal, the 29 students of the four classes led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder chose a young eagle who grew up in the chickenyard, but then is released into freedom.
For this purpose, the Müngere Schar performed a musical with the title \"The eagle in the chickenyard\"
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg, and had it hatched from his chickens.
Instead of a chicken chick, a small eagle came out.
But the hope of making a chicken out of him collapsed, the eagle spread out its wings on a high mountain and disappeared.
After that, classes three and four showed a chicken dance in the Yvonne Frank study.
The hens danced with the young goggles that carried cylinders to the bet.
The eagle stands for integration, said headmaster Angelika Sitte.
The young animal was different from the other young (cooks), but belonged to it.
But he will never be like a chicken.
His determination was to be free.
She wanted every fourth grader to feel accepted in his new school.
Thank you to the colleagues, former head of school Michael Müller, who is always at school and the parents.
The chick season was over, and class teacher Sophia Schumacher explained.
She dismissed her students after two years of teaching only very reluctantly because it was a really great time.
Finally, they have been able to rely on the fourth graders.
To conclude, all students had a song of summer time and vacation time sounded.
The children had great joy in this.
Eight first graders have already been registered for the new school year.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were imprisoned for illegal campsites in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quoted by TV, informed.
On the morning of August 1st, a group of illegal people were arrested in Sithonia, including the two Bulgarians.
The same day they were released while an investigation is currently under way.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have strengthened control of the free camp and impose considerable fines on anyone who is found to remain in a place that is not intended for this purpose.
Controls will continue throughout the season.
The Ministry said the court can impose a fine.
Software update for diesel vehicles: what the affected people now need to know
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do diesel drivers have to participate in the action?
The main questions and answers at a glance.
At the Diesel Summit BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the exhaust gas behaviour of Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 cars.
Euro-4 diesels or worse are excluded.
Anja Smetanin from the ACE Auto Club Europe provides estimates:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.
“The pre-compulsory updates apply only to vehicles that have foam software,” says Anja Smetanin.
Its retrofitting has been arranged by the Federal Office of Power (KBA).
How and from when are customers informed about updates?
Manufacturers have announced a rapid implementation in the next few months, but have not yet mentioned a precise date.
Daimler has notified to write to each person concerned.
If an inspection is due anyway, this will be done within the framework of it.
How long should the reforms total?
“It’s hard to say,” says Smetanine.
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as on the political pressure.
\"For we have seen that the car manufacturers have not acted voluntarily on the environmental issue so far \"
How long will the update take?
The upgrade itself could take only three to four hours at the workshop.
Timer could be getting an appointment.
What do drivers who do not drive BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW group do?
The ACE advises you to wait.
It is likely that foreign manufacturers would be looking after it, according to Smetanine.
Is there now a massive price decline of Euro-4 cars?
The ACE fears this.
But in regions where driving bans are threatening.
In rural areas there are so far no loss of value for older diesels.
The ACE advises you to wait for a sale.
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first prize ceremony under President Trump promises to become political.
One of the prize winners doesn't want to come - from protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the coveted awards of the renowned Kennedy Center.
This year, as the cultural institution announced on Thursday, singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) as well as choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95) are among the honoured.
Awards will be handed over at the beginning of December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will organise a reception and join his wife, Melania, in the ceremony.
The winner Lear, announced with progressive TV series, had already announced his refusal to participate in the Gala.
The New York Times he said: \"This Presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even withdrawing the funds - and that burdens me\"
The 59-year-old Estefan stressed that she would use the conversation with Trump to clarify her point of view.
The Kennedy Center, named after former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital.
Former winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city worth living
Roland Wacker, Haslach's city builder, will retire next year.
The place is already written out - suitable applicants are rare, however.
For 31 years Wacker has been a city builder.
And the work still gives him great fun, as he does in the press interview.
He reports on varied but demanding tasks waiting for his successor.
At the same time, he wonders that so far no application has fulfilled the requirement profile.
The city is looking for an architect or a construction engineer at the closest possible time.
Thus - taking into account the regular termination deadlines - should still be enough time for a resumption.
Since Haslach acts as the lower civil rights authority for the administrative community, the applicant must submit corresponding conclusions.
For this function the city definitely wants to retain.
If they could no longer fill out, citizens would have to go to Offenburg for consultation.
But close to citizens, the city and itself are important, says Wacker, who reports a good operating climate and good mood between authority and citizens.
In more than 30 years in office, some important projects have accumulated, looking back on Wacker with pride.
“We make the city worth living,” he is sure about the construction office and its employees.
But also in the future, varied projects will be on the agenda: the transformation of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofenparkplatz are about to take place.
The kinzig bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed, and the stadiums are still the subject.
The latter alone is estimated to be worth around 1.5 million euros, if we do it properly.
“All in all, great tasks are waiting for my successor.
The work here is fun,
The designer is there for a city builder of great play space.
With Haslach's own farm and gardening, it is possible to respond to a lot of flexibility.
“You can move a lot, so Wacker says, and the design of the green plants is often praised by citizens and visitors.
Since the old town as an ensemble is subject to monument protection, it is important to “have an eye for what fits in - when new buildings are approved, the separate town builder emphasizes.
In any event, the city builder bears high responsibility.
He's a builder, \"in the end everything runs over my table\"
With support and coordination, he can count on long-term employees: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been with us for ten years, Manfred Schöner (Tiefbau) for 15 years.
Also, that his successor remains long, Wacker wishes: “We’re looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place.
Because continuity is not only important for a good operating climate, but also for the further design of the city.
If Roland Wacker wants to inherit, he should be able to present a completed degree as a graduate engineer or bachelor in architecture and have good expertise in the areas of construction planning and construction planning law.
The City Building Office is under construction and construction, construction guidance, land acquisition, administration of the urban properties, urban farm with Bauhof and urban gardening and the Lower Civil Rights Authority including monument protection.
Bicycle thrown on lines: South railway track locked
According to the police, the previously unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railroad crossing in the area of Leobener Straße (B116) on the lines.
These were so severely damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.
The investigators leave from two male perpetrators and have been searching for them since the night.
Near the crime scene, a pink-red scooter and a bicycle driver had been observed by witnesses.
“This goes far beyond a noise-bumping strike,” said ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch to the APA.
The person or the perpetrators would have put themselves at great risk and also threatened train traffic.
In addition to the damage to the lok and the plant as well as the lag minutes and the cost of rail replacement traffic, the railway customers could still pay to the perpetrators.
Overall, the speaker said that the sum was significant.
The damage was remedied on Friday afternoon, and rail traffic on the southern railway line could be carried without disabilities.
Nearly ten passenger trains had fallen off Friday morning, two of which involved long-distance transport.
Freight trains did not fail, but they did have delay.
According to ÖBB spokesperson Christoph Posch, approximately 200 meters of overhead lines had to be exchanged.
Isolators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help alleviate IBD (inflammatory intestinal disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory intestinal diseases.
The incurable condition, which affects around 1.3 million in the United States and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and bleeding, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
While victims are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.
The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells patrol in the intestines to ensure that harmful microbes hidden in the food do not penetrate the body.
Cells capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation, an inflammatory intestinal disease may result.
In experiments it was found that a type of tolerance promoting immune cell occurs in mice carrying a certain bacterium in their tissues.
And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of cells.
Professor Colonna said: “We have a link between a bacterial type - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiom, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells,
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promote more tolerant, less inflammatory intestinal environments when the same system also works in humans.
The postdoctoral doctor Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a type of immune cell that promoted tolerance when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same strain, but which was kept separate, did not.
She suspected that the difference had to do with the intestinal microbiomes of mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the stomach intestinal tract.
The mice' intestines were sequenced DNA and six bacterial species were found that were present in the mice with the immune cells but were missing from the mice without them.
Mice were raised in a sterile environment, so that they lacked an intestinal microbiom and did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.
To understand how the bacteria affect the immune system, researchers L. reuteri grew in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the fluid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells that were isolated from the mice.
The immune cells developed into tolerance-promoting cells.
When the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indol-3-milchic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the lining of the mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our stomach intestinal tracts.
It is not known whether tryptophan side products from L. reuteri develop cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory intestinal disease.
She said: “The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, as these cells control inflammations on the inner surface of the intestines.
Potentially, high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an extension of this population,
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United has committed a “genie” with Nemanja Matic
At Manchester United, Nemanja Matic signed a “Genie”, believing Jose Mourinho, after the midfielder had his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
The 40 million pounds signature of Chelsea began with a 2:1 victory in Dublin, the last pre-season game, before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid began on Tuesday, and impressed in the holder role when people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched forward to popularity.
However, Matic had been excluded from the Blues' preparatory Asia tour and had only 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted he had to improve before the Premier League season began.
“He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football - said Mourinho.
“We will help him to be ready sooner than later,
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started in Aviva Stadium, when Mourinho formed his start-XI for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more new commitments, but he insisted that the club had already done a “fantastic job” of fulfilling three of its four priority new commitments.
“Three out of four, I thank the club for that,” he added.
“I’ll be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they’ve given themselves great effort,
Boeing - malt - Dreamliner in the sky
The U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner in the sky.
The pilots flew from Seattle in Washington State, but the drawing began in Marquette, Michigan State, and moved in the form of a dreamliner across the United States, which is several thousand kilometers.
The action lasted 18 hours and a minute.
On the radar screens was the shape of a dreamliner.
The whole thing was a endurance test for new engines.
Boeing had previously made such advertising.
Thus the number \"787\" and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky.
New depth for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem
How the wind turns: When Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD chief, Social Democratic Prime Ministers always looked at Berlin with some concern.
Only no sturgeon from the party headquarters, only no counterwind from the League - was the main wish of the electorate.
Since Martin Schulz led the party, this has changed fundamentally.
Since then, the staff from the Willy-Brandt House have been observing the events in the SPD-governed state capitals with increasing horror.
What Schulz got from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach with counterwind.
It was low tides.
And one by one.
After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the Federal CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of SPD and Greens.
“This shows more: Red-Green simply cannot rule reliably,” said CDU Secretary General Peter Tauber to the German editorial network RND.
The surprising outpouring of a Greens delegation, the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) has plunged into a serious crisis.
Five months before the Landtag election, his red-green coalition thus lost its one-piece majority to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The Grünen-Bundesmant Michael Kellner has asked the abtrivial Saxon Grünen-Amandator Elke Twesten to resign her mandate.
Passing over to the CDU means a clear distortion of the voter's will.
Each Twest must immediately give back its mandate - the Federal Managing Director and Electoral Leader of the Greens told the editorial network Germany (RND).
“That must not be true at all,” a SPD election fighter sighs, as on Friday morning the new Hiobs Message reaches the headquarters of the party.
Stephan Weil, SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, is present to the CDU without a majority of its own government after the Green MPs have passed.
It is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of major and minor crises in SPD country associations.
And no one knows what's next.
The miser began with the unexpected significant defeat at the Saarland election in March.
A blue eye, no more, calmed down the comrades at the time.
After the elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything would be different.
It was then - and everything was getting worse.
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to the Taumeln, the Dusseldorf-Pleite hit the party smoothly.
In the weeks that followed, the comrades got up.
Then, when they had just created new courage, the G-20 summit of Hamburg came.
And with him came the next low.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD landowner, lost his Nimbus on that weekend because he was in the Elbphilharmonie while his city burned.
And because in the post-crisis communication, he made pretty much everything wrong that can be done wrong.
Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
So now also Stephan Weil.
Because of the VW exhaust affair and its role in the Supervisory Board, the Dutch Prime Minister has been in criticism for a long time.
My survey values were added.
Despite this, or perhaps just because of it, Weil has been trying more and more to put accents in the bundle in the past few weeks.
The efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin did not remain hidden by comrades in the vicinity of Martin Schulz.
They let him be granted, since they promised themselves a stabilization of the party.
Now the exact opposite could occur.
Because of this, there is no blame on the party internal twist of the Lower Saxon Greens.
And Schulz didn't.
Meanwhile, the comrades strive to keep their own ranks closed.
Its anger is directed at the Greens, and here, in particular, it is the abject Parliamentary Twesten.
\"It is unbearable and democratically damaging, as Mrs Twesten puts her own career interests about the interests of all others,” says Matthias Miersch, head of the party links in the SPD Bundestag Group, the editorial network Germany (RND).
Mrs Twesten has been elected to Parliament not because of her person as a direct candidate but because of the country list of the Lower Saxon Greens, the Lower Saxon MEP continues.
The logical consequence would be that she gives back her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD-Bundestag Group, complains of an \"undemocratic maneuver\"
\"The voter's wish four years ago was clear: the people made Stephan Weil the Prime Minister - says Oppermann, who leads the Lower Saxon SPD as the top candidate in the Bundestag election, the RND.
“Now, the personal career thinking of a future CDU member distorts the election result,” Oppermann continued.
He called for clarification of the background.
I want to know if there has been more or if there have been any further commitments from the CDU Lower Saxony.
Funding funds for local core III
If you want to clean your house in the years to come, you can soon get support from the country.
On Wednesday, Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG informed urban development in Receptions.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler once again gave a look back on what had happened.
Since 1991 there have been renovation areas in Reception.
At that time, from 1991 to 2004, the State of Baden-Württemberg took over two more thirds of the funding.
In the remedial zone II from 2005 to 2016, the grant was still 60 percent.
For Schindler, the previous renovations are a success project - it is important to promote internal development as well, and not just to open up new construction areas.
On 4 April, an information was received from the Government Bureau of Karlsruhe that there would be a remedial area III.
The funding amounted to 833 333 euros, of which 500 000 were from the country, the rest of the municipality received.
How does a renovation site now develop?
You will, as Schindler continues, examine where the \"real old\" houses are.
But it also played a role in whether there was interest in the planned area at all.
Where appropriate, the territorial boundaries could also shift again.
STEG met Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening.
Keller presented the contents of the German-country programme \"Social City\" in which the renovations would then be carried out.
The core of the programme is the revitalisation of inner cities, improving living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out in relation to objects, i.e. per plot.
The remedial area would then finally be defined as a statute.
The period of authorisation for the funding shall run from 1 January 2017 to 30 April 2026.
However, until September this year, the inventory would only be carried out, in the context of which the parties involved in the renovation area will be given a questionnaire to fill out.
In November or December, the Statute decision is to be made as far as possible so that the restorations can begin next year.
Pietzschmann subsequently stated that each municipality had to carry out the said pre-examinations.
It is about evaluating the urban faults and deciding when to be renovated and to what extent.
A remedial note will then be entered in the basic book for the respective property.
Pietzschmann himself will come to conceptions and take a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel stressed that a key success factor for the project was the participation of the stakeholders.
That is why there will be questionnaires that will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled out until the end of the summer holiday.
The yellow questionnaire is the \"building and land arch\" in which, among other things, the building condition and the renovation plans are concerned.
In the grey questionnaire, the \"household and apartment building\" can be given information about the size, division and inhabitants of a residential area.
The blue operating arc must only be filled out when operating in the building business premises.
However, it should be noted that Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding.
Furthermore, new construction measures are not eligible.
Schindler emphasised that the distribution of funding works according to the \"wind dog\" principle - who comes first, measures first.
No funding could be reserved for later
Finally, photos of the project “Placeskern II” were shown in order to make the person in attendance feel comfortable.
British inventor sets himself a microchip to come in the house and car with a hand movement
A British inventor is the first in the country to be equipped with a microchip so that he can open his door, enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology by its company BioTeq.
He joined Dr. Geoff Watson, a consulting Anaesthesist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards.
The technology resembles a cat and dog implanted microchip and lasts only 30 seconds.
Mr. Northam's company also wants to change the locks on houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip, everything for a surcharge of £ 300 per castle.
The married father of one has now built both at home and at his BMW Z4 technology, which starts when his hand is on the wheel.
The advertising costs of the White House cost the taxpayer thousands
The White House's decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers up to $24,000 according to the information provided by the military to the TIME magazine.
The green and white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and executive officers of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states.
The helicopter made in Connecticut was exhibited alongside a yacht from Maine, a Wisconsin fire car and a Mississippi forklift.
The White House Military Office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.
“I just wanted you to be aware of this because it’s such an unusual event with high visibility,” wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event to his superior, Deputy Marine Commander for Aviation.
The message showed that on July 17th, the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn in the morning for the event at 3 p.m., and stayed until the lawn was cleared between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. this evening.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House was to be delayed, a second team would be required for the return flight due to the limitation of service hours.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event, while the unit's security staff remained on the ground during the time at the plane.
The records provided by the TIME did not clearly indicate whether a second flight crew was required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state ownership for political purposes.
Datasets indicate that HMX-1 asked whether the event could violate the determination.
“A question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case,” the commander wrote.
“Kills as if you were locked - the deputy commander replied.
The event “Made in America” was described by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But also official events have political overtones.
At the event, the President gave a impetus to the reform of health reform, which was underway in the Senate, and he promoted efforts to curb government regulations.
The use of the aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, for politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are obliged to use them for the trip.
But demanding their use only for a photo-OP is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February when, in the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, the president made taxi services, and his Twitter account is full of news that complains about the use of the president plane by its predecessor.
“The White House is thrilled by the show “Made In America” that shows products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials,” said White House Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews often carry out training flights around Washington and the South Lawn in order to set off the President of the White House with precise centimeter sets.
When Trump was at the G20 Summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 conducted 58 exercises landings in the White House.
The flight for the “Made in America” event was part of the training requirement of the flight crew for the month, said an official.
Helicopter units also flew for 11 hours this day for “non-presidency support missions”
The White House said that the taxpayers took charge of none of the other requisites presented at the event.
A spokesperson from Sikorsky said that the company had not been involved in exhibiting the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not maintain budget records for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to the hourly tariffs of the US Department of Defense for the financial year 2017, the DoD refund rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
Records of the unit recorded the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico, Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual costs of operating the helicopter are far below this rate.
\"The cost of taxpayers on the basis of the estimates for the refund rates is highly misleading, said Walters.
“These estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual appropriations,
According to a 2015 RAND study, the refund rates for DoD do not include staff costs, but take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and contract closure.
At this time, the former press spokesperson of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
“The idea is to present this week things that are made in America - said Spicer.
“And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut state are very proud of their contribution to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands of people, are dependent on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.
It is, of course, appropriate to highlight this,
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver's seat of a fire car.
In the White House Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and shaved with the media about his own fleet of company products.
\"I know Sikorsky very well - said the President, \"I have three of them\"
TC BW Nose Before Knife Task
Top rider of the Second Tennis Bundesliga arrives at the third-table search villager SV.
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will be arriving in Kiel at the table third search villager SV tomorrow from 11 a.m. on.
Despite five parties still making the most of the balance, the top rider of the Second Tennis Bundesliga has gained the sense of reality.
Team leader Marius Zay at least has respect for the opponent.
“This is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation.
I find the team very good on the back positions,
For class and stability at the search villager SV, imports from the high north are mainly concerned.
\"The Danes and Finns can even refer to operations in the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in the double, says Zay with a view of Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
“As always, it’s going to be hard for us.
There you also need a good portion of happiness,
The Neuss team for the trip to the high north stands practically.
His debut for blue-white could give Maxime Janvier.
At the moment, in the Italian Biella, the Challenger Tournament does not make it to the Bundesliga party, and Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic) is the first player to play in the tournament in Czech Liberec.
The previously unconquered Chilene Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was still at the ball at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel yesterday with the White Bus Andrei Vasilevski.
However, he should be in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both Netherlands) and Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two victories last Sunday against the club at Alster, Máté Valkusz could also return to the team.
If it wasn't for the 18-year-old Hungary, who was still the number one of the junior world rankings in January 2016, someone from the trainer staff around Marius Zay will fill the frame.
How America can harm OMV
Really fortunate, Donald Trump did not act when on Wednesday evening he put his signature under the law to aggravate the sanctions against Russia.
“In his capacity to pass the law, the Congress packed in a few “constitutional unconstitutional regulations,” he etched.
The reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected, and even Brussels was ashamed of the US advance.
After all, the draft is designed to punish European companies that help Russians build gas pipelines in the EU.
Since then, investors of the domestic OMV, together with other European companies, have been worried about the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea line Nord Stream 2.
The threat is huge.
However, it was too early for an estimate of the consequences, according to the official statement of the oil company.
In fact, Donald Trump himself would have to bring the sanctions to life by executive order.
Twelve weapons are at his disposal.
\"The press\" has looked at which the Group could defend and which could really hurt him.
Narcos season 3 Trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel is placed in the center of Netflix's hit series
Despite the second season of Narcos, which Pablo Escobar's killer reveals, Netflix's series is far from over.
The three and four seasons were already confirmed by the streaming service, the first received their first trailer and showed the latest evils of the show.
With the third season, the DEA has directed its attention to the richest organisation of the world’s drug trafficking: the Cali cartel.
Guided by four powerful ducks, they operate, like a Fortune 500 company, only with more state bribes and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.
In the newly published trailer Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the type that American and Colombian law enforcement authorities invite to support the war against drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will begin on September 1.
Back Roll: The city provides 46 kitchen aids
The city organizes the Kita lunch table itself again.
With fixed contacts for the children and an assignment to the team.
The clock is turned back in the urban children's day-care facilities.
On 1 September, the city of Krefeld takes over the food supply in the urban children's day facilities (Kitas) again in its own direction.
For Sonja Pommeranz, Deputy Head of the Youth Assistance Department, this is a good news: “We all have been very pleased”
It is still cooked outside the house: a caterer takes over this task and delivers fresh boiled chilled.
The city operates in the Krefeld area 46 daycare centers, in 44 children get a warm meal at lunchtime.
In the past kita year, 2800 children each sat at the tables, and the need grew steadily.
“In the meantime not only children who are cared for for 45 hours of the week are eating lunch in the Kita, explains Pommeranz.
“The offer also applies in the 35-hour care if children stay until 14 o’clock”
46 part-time workers have kitchen services from September 1st: they heat the delivered foods, add them to salad, raw food and fruit, port the meal individually, give out the food, clean off, rinse and clean the kitchen.
“The employees are firmly assigned to a kita,” says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two-group and seven-group facilities - decides over the hours.
“The kitchen helpers are now firmly part of the Kita team - says Pommeranz satisfied.
“This way they are much stronger and it is easier for kitaconductors to implement educational concepts “
Because it is also about: healthy diet and cooking lessons.
\"The children should help prepare the food,
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is sensible.
For the children, too.
“They have a well-known force in the Kita, a person who is familiar to them, and not constantly changing people,”
This continuity is important for the children.
The cleaning of the kita rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen forces - will be done by special cleaning staff in the future.
In addition to improving the quality of the kitchen performance, this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen services - also has the charm, which it has shown itself to be the most economical in comparison with the cost of self-driving and other services for the city, says the Press Office.
And that, although 46 part-time forces are re-set.
“But these hours are not so heavy for about 750 people in the education area,” says Sonja Pommeranz.
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women, says the UN
Elections can only be representative if all the members of the society, including women, play a role, said the head of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, United Nations Head of Mission, said that hundreds of women will be able to attend the Council elections in the provinces. Three women are candidates for the role of Vice-President and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
“The role of women cannot be overestimated,” he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and are involved in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghan elections for the Provincial Council and presidential elections take place on 5 April.
The Taliban has published threats against an electoral process that coincides with the transition from international combat actions to a consultative role.

Men try to rob 13-year-old girl
Two young men aged 19 and 23 should have tried to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to police information, the men addressed the 13-year-olds who stayed with friends on Kolpingstraße at 2.55 p.m. because they wanted to phone the girl's cell phone.
The 13-year-old refused the request and continued with her friends.
Then one of the perpetrators tried to grab the girl's cell phone and necklace, which was a mistake.
Without prey, the duo fled.
The two young men were later arrested by the police.
The investigation is ongoing.
GMB concerns about investments in the McVitie factory in Glasgow
A trade union wants to be sure of the long-term commitment to production at its plant in Glasgow with managers of the Biskuit manufacturer McVitie.
GMB Scotland said that the company was silent about the future of investments at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work in the factory, which, in addition to other products, produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea Kekse.
McVities owner Pladis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years.
He added that employees and union representatives would, first of all, experience if their activities changed.
In a letter to the company's branch manager, GMB called on Scotland McVitie's to \"remember that funding for the modernization of production lines would not be driven forward\"
GMB senior organizer Drew Duffy said: “The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the General Site Manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross is deeply affecting our members.
Generations of families have worked here and the labour force has concentrated heavily on the local community and the vast Glasgow area, an important pillar of decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage.
Therefore, under the perspective of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the background of Brexit, the rising cost of living and the chronic decline in production, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently requires a thriving production presence at McVitie,
A spokesperson from Pladis said: “The branch manager at Tollcross only received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday, and the company will respond directly to it, as we appreciate the continuous commitment of employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross, where some questions were discussed openly.
We discussed with the employees that we, like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, constantly review our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - in order to remain competitive.
She added: “In recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our Tollcross site, especially in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognize the heritage of Tollcross as a production site. If our operations change at the site, employees and their union representatives will be the first to know this,
Did the PSG warn Barcelona three years ago of Neymar?
The side of La Liga may regret her interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not fail in her persecution of Neymar after she has made an offer of £189 million to trigger his release clause, but have they warned Barcelona three years ago before the world record incident?
The sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer, because the Ligue 1 club is willing to break the world record by more than double the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for 89 million pounds last season.
After the end, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the world’s top paying professional athlete. PSG offers wages of over 500,000 GBP per week.
Barcelona is angry by the way Neymar has forced his way out, although a source near the Catalan Board insists that the club has always given its best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned three years ago by the PSG President about this prospect?
When Manchester City expressed interest in the signing of Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for any club who wanted to sign one of the best players in PSG.
“I’m not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we’ll be in opposition to them, we’ll contact their players,” said Al-Khelaifi.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they try to make one of our players sign in, this will have consequences,
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, with the Spanish club expressing interest in the PSG midfielder Marco Verratti at the beginning of this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the international from Italy to depart under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its prices for Neymar.
Roller wrapped and damaged
On the night from Friday to Saturday, an unknown perpetrator deliberately threw a scooter in the Königsfelder Straße before the estate number 30 and thus caused damage to the car's clothing of more than 200 euros.
Police Schramberg, phone 07422/27 01-0, asks for information.
For an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Reade, the police are looking for witnesses.
Because a car hit him on his trail, the driver had to deviate from a VW tour and touched the guideboard.
On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum, with his VW, was on the B 215 from Stolzenau, heading towards Reade.
In the area of the local conversion of Stolzenau, a car arrived at him on his trail, so that he had to move to the right.
In doing so, the touran driver touched the guiding board.
In the car, there was damage to things.
The driver of the approaching car, a Mercedes Benz, had picked up a truck and continued his ride without worrying about traffic accidents.
According to the accident offender, it may be good that the Mercedes driver had not noticed the accident at all.
The police now ask witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the polluter vehicle to contact the Commissioner in Stolzenau under Tel. 05761 / 92060.
Interview: \"Domspatzen report relieves Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger\"
The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the abuse cases relieves Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger.
This means author and historian Michael Hesemann.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen further provides for discussion.
Christian Weisnder, spokesperson of the reform movement “We are Church” after publication to the German Press Agency, expected by the former Regensburger Bishop and today’s Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller and by the Domkapelmaster Georg Ratzinger, 93-year-old brother of the emeritus Benedict XVI, an apology.
It would be very useful to see the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret over their own omissions or their wrong assessment of the procedures at that time.
The Vatican newspaper Osservatore Romano, on the other hand, criticised the fact that the reporting of violence in the Domspatzen was measured by two measures.
Regarding the raids in Regensburg, no one doubted that there were “sinous and shameful acts” that would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the author Lucetta Scarafia, historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics Committee, was strikingly the “degree medial manipulation”.
“The custom of describing the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of the daily experience and prepares public opinion to consider it normal,” writes Scarafvia.
Princess Gloria von Thurn and Taxis also said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: “You like to go to the church and this is a found breakfast,
In addition, she pointed out that in her youth, \"slaughter had been a very normal educational means, \"to be finished with dirty children, as I was one,
They found it unfair to apply today's standards to earlier decades because the world has changed.
In connection with the reports on abuse cases, Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.
Fully wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who with Ratzinger wrote the memory band \"My brother of the Pope\" (translated in 12 languages).
“I have to protect Georg Ratzinger,” says Hesemann, “because all this had nothing to do with him, he values the results of the final report.
What exactly is in the 440-page report submitted by the lawyer Ulrich Weber, who was responsible for informing the Diocese of Regensburg?
A total of 547 Regensburger domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the early 1990s, with high plausibility, victims of assaults, 67 domspatzen.
In the final report, Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994, says: “In summary, it can be said that in many cases, in many cases, physical and mental violence was applied by Domkapelmeister R.
Especially in the case of high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more severe.
Nevertheless, unlike many other accusers, it appears that many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even associated positive memories with him despite violence,
In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal in the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger dismisses his opinion.
Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the “accidents of violence training in defence officers at the Regensburger Domspatzen” gives a contradictory picture of Domkapelmeister Georg Ratzinger.
On the one hand, many students highlight his \"humanity\".
On the other hand, he also appears as a choleric and perfectionist, who became the most popular when a domspatz made musical no top performance.
How do you value this final report as his biographer?
Michael Hesemann: If you make the effort and read the entire 440-page report from the front to the back, you have to wonder why the name Georg Ratzinger is actually there.
He is just eight pages dedicated to him and is clearly free from any suspicions of co-examination or co-knowledge in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
Violent excesses at pre-school also took place outside its sphere of action.
In any case, one may object to having learned about it too late or to have not taken the initial interpretations seriously enough.
The Domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was felt by virtually all the respondents as - so literally - \"resolution\" - \"heaven\" and \"better world\".
The broad majority of his students, Georg Ratzinger, also presents a very excellent witness, describing him as a “warming, “loved,”“competent,” and “competent” as an extremely kind teacher, who regularly provided the boys with cakes, cookies and candy and was always surrounded by grapes of children.
Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which has already led to riots.
Not only did he bang with chairs and throw the keyband on the ground, but he also deeply regretted and apologized for the fact that he was very angry with the hair or ears.
However, it must be said that in the 1960s and 1970s, such education methods were widespread among parents as with teachers.
Do you still know such methods of breeding?
Of course, I think each of us was born before 1968.
I have also experienced this in a secular school, a state high school.
Compared with what is actually about in this report, namely the terrible sexual abuse and the violence at pre-school, these are, of course, Bagatelle's.
There, it is already asked whether it is not more to do with his fame and his role as brother of Benedict XVI that many media have just crashed upon him.
Many, who never understood him, are still working diligently in the Bavarian Pope.
But the truth is, Georg Ratzinger is relieved in every way!
Much has been reported in the media in connection with the report on abuse among the Regensburger Domspatzen.
Is Georg Ratzinger in the final report also being burdened with any involvement or co-knowledge with regard to sexual abuse?
Michael Hesemann: Very clearly no.
None of the 67 victims of sexual assault claim to have entrusted themselves to the master of the Cathedral.
Not even the parents were consecrated.
“I never trusted to talk to my father or my mother about it,” said one concerned deputy to the others, “It was very embarrassing to me.
The real problem with revealing sexual abuse was that most victims were silent.
If they did not even trust parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir leader, who would have been a professional colleague of the perpetrators.
How do the Domspatzen students evaluate Ratzinger's role in the abuse cases?
Michael Hesemann: A surveyed student put it this way: “As regards sexual abuse ... I see no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective perpetrators.
I think it ... is also absurd to assume that it is calculated that ... bows have opened more intrusive or more clearly or even more clearly than to their parents, board leaders, trust teachers, etc.
That you talk to him about sex ... - inexplicable -
Thus, the report comes to the clear conclusion: \"In the course of the investigation, students and/or their environment could not be confirmed;
As for sexual abuse, therefore, Georg Ratzinger is free from any co-knowledge.
So neither can he be accused of not having prevented or admonished him.
Therefore, there is no reason to link his good name with these contradictory crimes, as it has unfortunately happened in some cases.
In the media, a lot of 'waltexzessen' was read at the Regensburger Domspatzen.
The former master of the Domkapel Georg Ratzinger is referred to in the report \"Wegschauen\".
Did he have to live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: This is the big problem that in reporting everything was mixed and mixed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.
But that, in turn, is an abuse of the report.
There is a clean separation: between the preschool and the gymnasium of domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violence, as well as, we say, other accusations.
In addition, the report deals with incidents from the time since 1945, that is also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not choir leader of the Domspatzen.
The whole terrible pedagogy, the cases in which boys were regularly harassed and painted by sadistic teachers, and among which they were absolute, occurred all at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions must have prevailed.
But there was nothing to do with the master of Domkapel Georg Ratzinger, for he only got to face the boys when they were already on the Domspatzengymnasium.
On this, as the most important witnesses emphasize, the subject was ‘pre-school’ tabu.
One was only happy to have escaped you and enjoyed so much better treatment and for many even \"paradiesian\" conditions.
What else was on the Domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: There was discipline, but no sadistic violence.
And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, where the report concludes that \"many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even associated positive memories with him despite violence\"
So, at most, the blame remains to be seen away.
But despite all the efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was told of the conditions in preschool.
The first time in 1970/71, when he was just starting to establish himself, and from the procedures at a school where he was not acting and responsible, (so the witness) wanted to hear nothing, and then again around 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger shut his ears in front of the conditions?
Michael Hesemann: No, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduces.
In doing so, he points out that \"the pre-school practice continues to include the criminal punishment\"
In view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent entry.
Of course, this was at a time when legal clarity existed, when criminal punishments had long been prohibited in Bavaria.
Before that, they happened in a legal gray zone, as each of us probably still knows.
It was also difficult for him to estimate where the persons concerned might have been overpowered or dramatized and where the permissible limit had really been exceeded.
But you can't say he always looked away.
That's just not true.
It was not until 1980 that the fine was officially abolished at schools in Bavaria.
Prince Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's educational standards to the time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians are talking about the “falling trick of anachronism,” thus the danger of assessing past moral standards today.
That's where the prince is right.
But this does not apply, of course, to sexual abuse, which at all times was repugnant, nor to what was committed in preschool to counter-responsibility and violence to innocent children's souls, which goes far beyond what was common back then.
That's all terrible, and I'm glad it's finally worked out.
But at the same time I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection, because all that had nothing to do with him.
His means of discipline and punishment, i.e. to draw ears and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was then prohibited, he also kept strict watch on it.
What picture of his Regensburger time has Georg Ratzinger made in the discussions with you for the book \"My Brother of the Pope?\"
Did the subject of criminal punishment come up?
Michael Hesemann: Well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, i.e. Pope Benedict XVI, who tells of his perspective, then the domspatzen played only a side role.
Even so, I don't know he's leading a strict regiment there.
But this must also be said: without this perfectionism, without the demand of essential discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world rank from the previously known Regensburger Domspatzen, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and his musical tradition, who went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With cookies and bonbons alone, you don't make a big singer and you're in front of every success, no matter what area, but always discipline, passion, and self-conquering.
As what kind of person did you experience Georg Ratzinger in the discussions about her book?
Michael Hesemann: Through the work on the book and beyond, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and always experienced him as a wonderful, humorous, groundy, deeply believing and hearty person, from whom one cannot imagine that he could only do something to a fly.
I regularly get along with how many former domspatzen still doms today, 23 years after his retirement, keep in regular contact with him, visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family.
So those who do not forgive him until today that he was once strict with them are clearly in the minority.
Most domspatzens today are grateful to him for enriching their lives and bringing them closer to the world of music.
And that he was always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but he was also a loving respect person to whom they still look up today and which they worship.
And ask, once again, it is clear that everything that is suggested to him is educational methods that were on the agenda at that time.
We can be glad we've overcome this time for a long time.
But it is most unfair to make a man, just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother, to make a media sin-bock.
There is only too obvious the evil intent behind it.
For the report, which has just been published, relieves him.
Now, without the outside Bavaria and perhaps even Germany, a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merit would not be able to let anyone know the Regensburgers domspatzen at last in peace.
