The product cost under 20 Euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of the goods....
I'm #PRS_ORG# Great and therefore it's not a problem for me.
Just need a number or instruction what I should add to the package so that it can be tracked by you as a return.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs 179€.
I think that's really very annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and re-order it for the better price or is there another way of credit?
I also think that children should not be expected to take on a parent role for their little siblings.
However, I think it is also good for big siblings to take care of the little ones.
Let's take a brief look, help a little, bring a bottle, etc.
So they learn responsibility, help in the family and are involved.
As long as she can still be a child herself, I don't see a problem.
If your K1 is working alone for a short time and it's OK for him, that's good.
You can best judge for yourself whether this is suitable for your children.
It's not like he's going to develop K2 and accompany him in bed for hours.
It is probably questionable in purely legal terms.
So maybe the psychologist's statement also comes.
If something were actually to happen like a fire, collapse, earthquakes, alien invasion etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1, to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to take is of course your discretion ;)
Please help me find the title of a book again!
I remember reading a crime / thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the whole action but I don't want the title partout anymore maybe someone knows here...
The story was of fear and therapy.
At the beginning of the story, an animal-career commits suicide by pouring himself over with food and going to his predatory cats.
The case is taken over by a Commissioner, who, after a brief investigation at his therapists, operates a clinic where he treats anxiety patients.
The Commissioner has a little niece who also has a fear (for fire) and lands with this therapist.
There is more suicide and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is assigned to go and document the place of suicide and put the photos on the internet before each suicide.
In any case, it turns out that this therapist operates a kind of underground therapy group where the patient is planted a chip that suppresses an anxiety center in the brain and ultimately puts the patients in the extreme of their anxiety.
(a woman jumps out of the window another rides with the intention of death)
This fear is described in the book as “the fight. ”
In the end there is a big showdown in the clinic that had to do with a fire.
This is the rough action I am quite sure that the book was originally written by a French author/author.
If this action is known to anyone or anyone could even tell me the title of the book, I would be very pleased.
Oh, I don't have the password available for Wlan.
You need to contact my husband first.
But that can take a while.
What steps do I have to take after that?
Is it also possible to get the price difference returned ?
Child, 4 j., splitter under the thumbnail

Very hard to grasp.
It didn't work and hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No more chance.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
By combining digital decoder and sound module on a circuit board, we reach dimensions of only 30mm x15.5mm and can thus be installed in almost any loks of track widths H0 and 0.
LokSound 5 decoders are offered with all common interfaces and always come with an 11x15mm large sugar cube speaker next to sound capsule kit.
Like all family members, LokSound5 is a real multi-protocol decoder.
It dominates the DCC data format as well as Motorola®, Selectrix® and M4.
In DCC format, 14 to 128 driving steps are as natural as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus®, decoders are fully automatic at an appropriate digital centre.
It controls all DCC programming modes and, thanks to RailCom®, the CV values can be read out on the main slide with suitable centrals.
For centrals that only the 1-255 CVs can program there exist auxiliary registers.
Motorola® users benefit from up to 28 driving steps at 255 addresses.
Three additional Motorola® addresses allow the release of 16 functions.
A built-in programming mode also makes reprogramming possible with the venerable Control Unit 6021.
The M4 protocol allows automatic registration to mfx® compatible centrals.
The LokSound 5 decoder recognizes the Märklin® brake lines as well as ZiMO® HLU brake commands or the Lenz® ABC System.
Braking with DCC brake blocks or with DCC voltage is also possible.
In addition, it also stops at a Selectrix® brake diode.
An ABC commuting machine enables automatic commuting between two stations.
The LokSound 5 decoder can be used on analog DC and DC channels.

Because of Omikron: Johnson wants to advance refresh vaccination
New Omikron cases are always concerned with politics and science in the UK.
By New Year, therefore, all qualifying adults in England are expected to receive a vaccination offer.
London - UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to progress even faster in the Corona update vaccinations due to rapid rising Omicron numbers than has so far been sought.
Every adult in England should be given the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said on Sunday evening in a pre-recorded video message to his countrymen.
Until now, the target date was at the end of January.
The British Government will also provide additional support to speed up vaccination campaigns in the parts of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
In view of the Omikron variant, one faces an emergency, which is why there is an urgent need to strengthen the protection of vaccines, Johnson said.
The good news was that the level of protection could be increased again with a third dose of vaccination.
“Let’s boost you now,” Johnson said.
On Sunday 1239 other Omikron cases were registered in the UK, thus increasing the total number to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, the rise was 65 percent. dpa

I'm for everyone to imagine using pronouns
I got rid of an application.
Today the invitation came to a conversation by mail.
I want to reply to the e-mail.
But unfortunately, the name is not a \"Peter\" but a somewhat more complicated name.
I gambled him and depending on where he/she has a cultural background, it's either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write the email now.
Can anyone help me, please?
** I'm a foreigner and I don't want any officials to step over my feet.
Conclusion: everyone should imagine using pronouns.
Have a total of 5 books on it.
4 of them.
Only the one I bought today doesn't go
Obviously, the chair had an unsuspecting lack of sales.
How can such an upholstery damage occur after 9 months?
First tried on the #PRS_ORG#.
But it's been working for about a year.
No more 14 days.
So I always bought the last books through the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and wanted to buy 8.
However, there was no more.
Now they are available again and I would like you to add 2 chairs to the order and charge this to me.
[CW] The feeling if I can't help.
Content warning: I will write something more detail here about domestic violence.
I just have to write something about the soul.
I (21) come into contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence more frequently for professional reasons.
A topic that really takes hold of me and unfortunately is far too frequent that many victims can't help or think we can't help them.
I realize that we can't do everything and it's not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than I can do in such situations.
I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in conversation under four eyes, with the perpetrator far beyond sight and hearing, I cannot reach all.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear of revenge, fear of leaving the usual social environment, fear of the children getting out of it.
What I always want to make it clear to everyone is partly very close to the tears themselves, all are worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't just have to take violence.
I often wish I could help in any case... I know I can't.
But this will never make it easier.
Please, always remember that you are worth living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
“Arcane - on Netflix: What is the sound of the series on “League of Legends”?

Basketball-Federal League: Derby Debacle of the MHP Giant Ludwigsburg at the Merlins Crailsheim
At least to Youngster Johannes Patrick was abandoned.
Again nothing: for the second time within not even three months the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick had said to the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim with a look back at the Pokal defeat at the beginning of October: \"We have some rage in the stomach,
But he did not lay down after the game - but again increased in view of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the basketball federal league.
But more than the naked result disappointed the way in which it appeared.
The three-way quota was just 13 percent, 4 hits (all by young Johannes Patrick) in saying and writing 31 attempts - still questions?
John Patrick replied: “We were simply not focused enough after the victory at Tenerife, and did not implement what we were training,
Just move the ball.
Another response was Sebastian Gleim's opponent: \"To win a horny game for the second time against Ludwigsburg, the happy coach said.
\"It felt like 10,000 people ago,
Only 750 visitors were allowed on Saturday in the Hohenlohe-Arena, but they were at their expense.
Not least because of BBL Topscorer T.J. Shorts, who marked 22 points and led the game of his team.
“The best game maker I’ve ever trained, Gleim still praised me.
While in Patrick's team themselves the performers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed on the whole line.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) the giants prevented a total debacle and arrived up to eight points after they had already returned 39:59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon came to twelve points.
Fortunately, much time to have is not left.
Already on Wednesday (19h) the giants receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, before then also in Ludwigsburg a maximum of 750 spectators.
we used to have a different address, but I changed it.
Yeah, I told you a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We have been informed by law again and have therefore written them again.
We originally told each other about half a year ago.
Once the egg is peeled: Max Raabe will be 59
He is able to inspire his audience with new interpretations of beaters from the 20s and 30s.
He is currently on the road with the program \"Good day, Good luck\" when he is allowed to appear.
In fact, Max Raabe wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But there's nothing out there.
The planned concert has been moved in May 2022 - \"in the public direction\" - to contain the Corona virus.
Others of his performances planned in the Advent era must first fall out as it is on the singer's website, which today becomes 59, and his musician (www.palast-orchester.de).
As of January, the artists will then want to recover their dates already in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on 12 December 1962 in the North Rhine-Westphalian Lünen, Max Raabe already sang a lot and liked to sing as a youth.
He studied opera singing in Berlin, and in 1986 he founded the palace orchestra together with fellow comilitons.
Since then, the baritone has established itself with its repertoire of beaters and Chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He was awarded many prizes.
His live album from the “MTV Unplugged” series (2019) reached the second place of the charts, just like his success album “For women, this is not a problem (2013).
He made it out of the niche into the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, the blond hair tightly combed back and focused on labels, Max Raabe is no longer out of the current German-speaking music landscape.
He has been on tour since 2020 with the program \"Good day, Good luck\". dpa

Federal Minister for Construction Klara Geywitz: No new apartment is created by decommissioning
The new Federal Minister for Construction Klara Geywitz (SPD) has expressed itself against the disqualification of large housing companies, as has been demanded in a popular decision in Berlin.
“With a decommissioning, no new apartment is created, it only changes the ownership structure - said Geywitz in an interview with the “day mirror” (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants security that their rent will remain affordable in the coming years.
By the way, a bunter mix from, for example, private landlords, cooperatives or residential companies is the best protection against monopoly formation.
In Berlin, the coalition from SPD, the Greens and the Left Party wants to set up an expert commission on how to deal with the outcome of the People's Decision.
However, if the situation does not relax, Geywitz's talks with the FDP in the Ampel coalition did not rule out further tightenings in the lease right.
The coalition agreement provides for a price brake up to 2029, a limitation of rent increases in tense housing markets and the extension of the rental mirror.
I will speak to the Minister of Justice to implement this as soon as possible.
However, if the rental market does not relax, “we will talk to our coalition partners about further steps,” stressed the SPD politician.

This is an absolute prudence.
At least 100 dead by tornadoes in Kentucky
In a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes have been pulled through the United States.
Only in Kentucky could be more than 100 dead to complain.
The pictures from there are reminiscent of a war zone.
During the night on Saturday, several tornadoes in the United States have caused serious devastation and possibly up to a hundred deaths.
The storms leave an approximately 320-kilometre-long sneeze of desolation, especially in the Member State of Kentucky.
After a visit to the disaster area, Governor Andy Beshear said everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - simply gone.
Parts of industrial facilities, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is possible at all.
He expects up to a hundred dead in the Member State of Kentucky alone, the official numbers rise hourly.
Hello, I just saw that she's been selling out Vitamin #NAME#.
That's very bad.
Is it still being produced?
Or was she taken out of the range?
Is there a way to order this vitamin in another country?
Until when do you report?
If the delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I must cancel the order !
I understand, only I can order the blanket now and deliver it to Germany which is in my shopping cart?
I had returned an artike or given up a return via the contact form and wanted to ask if this was coming or being edited since I had not yet received confirmation.
Firms pay vaccination premiums and change advertising claims
While the Federal Government continues to reject the proposals for a vaccination premium, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and are offering their employees money premiums for vaccination.
They are thus on a line with the social partners ÖGB and the Chamber of Commerce, which today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
The transformation of advertising slogans into vaccination calls - according to German example - is also intended to increase readiness to Corona vaccinations.
He's moved to a company over which he's been harassed.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It's been a year.
He obviously hasn't stuck in his old place, and he's been looking for something else.
You can do that too.
And that he didn't find you well back then: no matter what.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please accept the cancellation.
That will then be legally relevant.

Aid in the first own campaign
Boron to greet!
I'm just leading for a group of 4 friends the adventure about the grip pass and want to lead my heroes seamlessly into a campaign written for the players.
We play DSA 5.
The big bow is made, the evils and their motivations are written, the individual files are designed and now I am writing the entrance adventure and I already stutter at the first encounter about my own feet.
The premise is that the heroes should bring a ferry with grain from Gratenfels to a small village near the Thuran Sea.
There the further action should develop.
A few miles from the village, the hero is supposed to reveal a group of Goblins and lure them into a backyard.
I would like to give the players the opportunity to resolve the confrontation in various ways: convincing, acting, threatening, early detection of the danger, whatever happens to the players.
Group strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 with spears, 6 armed with bows and sabers
In case of non-notice, the Goblins are blazing up the heroes in a hollow path and, to each of three left and right, the arches are armed with fire, while two with spears are stopping the drive.
Should it come to battle and be subject to the heroes, I have two solutions
1. All the heroes are found and healed by the son of the village school, half-elf.
The carren's gone, of course.
2. Should a defeat be irrevocable, this half-elf with two of his servants will come to the aid of the hero in the battle.
The cart is still there, it's all great.
How do you hold Deus ex Machina of Solution 2?
Is the encounter entering the adventure too much?
The Goblins group will later play a crucial role, so it is not just cannon feed.
EDIT: Wow, I didn't expect so many answers, especially not with so many great suggestions and tips.
I'll guarantee you many of your ideas and I'll have more confidence in my narrative again.
I put the lamp apart again.
And put back together.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
That's why I'd like to send her back anyway.
If you can then let the backlights come, then I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#.

I'm nervous of Sky Sport F1
Hello, F1-Fans, over the season, the quality on the German Sky has fallen more and more, so I want to make a little air with this post.
First of all, today, in the middle of the F2 race, the transmission was discontinued in order to start the F1 preliminary reporting on time.
Although due to the delayed start and the start crash of the schedule was far behind the planning, one could still have shown the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision (!).
It appears, however, that for legal reasons, the F1 enjoys priority and therefore has to restrict everything else, so Sky DE probably didn't have any choice here.
Despite being stupid, especially since Sky UK has finished the race.
Despite this, a little praise: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes has well accompanied the difficult situation around the serious accident.
Then, in the F1 there was once again a lack of regular knowledge with the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that one may change the tires under a red flag.
Although this situation already existed in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both came to the conclusion that walking may change the tyres when there were corresponding radio speeches on this subject to Hamilton.
With Sky UK and RTL both commentators immediately knew that there was this possibility for distances.
I think such elementary rules should be known simply when commenting on the F1 at a pay TV station.
It is also not the first puzzle rate, which is now possible or prescribed according to rules, both simply have constant uncertainties in the subject of rules.
Generally, with the ordered comment style of roses, do not like it, but give it to the taste matter.
But I really like Heiko's water from RTL better.
In addition to this, permanent albers, both of which are simply unprofessional, come from Ralf Schumacher's (even unsuspecting) reporter Peter Hardenacke or “UuuuHD,” like the purchase of coffee.
Especially the latter brings a lot of unrest into the comment that he does not seem to take it seriously.
Not least, advertising simply takes over at Sky, in the run-out, Sky is the only channel that goes into advertising as you can listen to F1TV because only the German track has to come out without comment right after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do.
These two stations also do less advertising in the trainings than Sky, and that as a free TV station.
Although you have to praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, that alone doesn't make me look beyond the disadvantages.
The remaining program of Sky Sport F1 is also very expensive and full of repetitions.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-speaking broadcaster to transmit the F1.
Unionically, RTL makes a better job up to advertising in the four races they are still allowed to broadcast.
In any case, the grandiose F1 season is much less fun than would be possible with a reasonable transmitter.
I'd be interested in your opinion.
To the here: #PRS_ORG# pencil lamp, brass and multicolor glass x 1
Hello, I have an item that should be delivered last week and is still not delivered.
I contacted the chat twice and nothing so far.
The First Lady told me that it will be sent on Monday, the second Lady told me yesterday that she will check and send an email and she never answered.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of these has already suffered a defect after a relatively short period of time (the fabric has a hole in the front part of the chair).
I'm asking for support.
Fan pumps are ideal for providing an aquarium with oxygen in addition.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via airlifter.
This series is offered in 3 versions of us.
At the end of the offer, look at the table.
There you can see the services in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, you can operate whole plants with them.
If you own a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outputs are suitable for connecting multiple outflows.
The MK series has one, two or four outputs, depending on the model fan pump, but also offer itself to put an accent in the aquarium, e.g. with an air curtain (find us in the shop) or with a decor that transforms the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasure flock, mussel or similar.
The MK series has a special soundproofed design and thus provides low operating noise.
The installation is very simple.
The fan pump is connected by means of an air hose 4/6 mm to an austromer etc....and it can already begin.
The fan pump should be equal or higher than the water level and applied outside.
If the fan pump is sitting deeper than the water level, you should put a backslash valve in between.
Simply cut the air hose and put the valve in between.
This would prevent once water would run backwards that the water would run out of the pool through the pump...
Should the fan pump be applied outdoors, you should, like other air pumps, be covered and protected from moisture
The pumps of the MK series are pure power packs that consume little energy
Even if we specify the processing time of 3 days here in ebay, the packages are packed daily and the packages are also picked up daily here.
It's all right on the road, it's going very fast.
We only want to prevent a little, so that no one is in agreement, just because it took a little longer.
It would be so, not everyone has understanding for all the employees who also work in the forwarding industry...of course, no corona here.
Please don't judge badly just because the delivery is delayed, which is exclusively to the parcel services.
Of course, one likes to skim over these services, even if we say at the moment...they're fucking hard on it.
This is also very different regionally.
Don't hurt anyone, stay healthy and we all hope that there will be better times again.
how long does it take to order the yellow with and without armrest?
Can the legs be ordered in the light?
Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and moderator to the world
The daughter of the first American in All, a TV moderator and four other passengers made a short trip to space.
They were transported on Saturday by the rocket system New Shepard, the company Blue Origin by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The launch and landing of the ten-minute flight took place in the west of the U.S. state of Texas.
Under radiant blue sky, Bezos personally received the freshly-cut astronauts after their return.
“Welcome back,” Bezos said, dressed in a blue space suit when he opened the lukewarm to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members and employees from Blue Origin, the six passengers climbed out gradually and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they traveled ten minutes and 13 seconds and reached a height of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 Nasa astronaut, flew into the All Alan Shepard (1923-1998), named the rocket system of Blue Origin, and the 50-year-old TV moderator Michael Strahan were honorary guests of the company who had paid for their tickets to other four passengers: Space Engineer Dylan Taylor, Investor Evan Dick, Technology Entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
How much they paid for their ticket did not share Blue Origin.
After the short flight, Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father's mission.
He worked hard at his efforts and had to do everything himself.
She was just so involved, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed enthusiasm.
He would love to return to the world again, said the moderator.
New Shepard flies up to 100 kilometers altitude
The \"New Shepard\" rocket system is largely automated.
The capsule separated from the rocket during the flight reached a height of about 100 kilometers above the ground, sometimes with difficulty before the reusable object was re-launched by large parachutes.
The International Aviation Association and many other experts view 100 kilometres across the globe as a border to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third manned all-out of Blue Origin: At the first time in July, Amazon founder Bezos was himself on board, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
In October the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world famous with his role as “Captain Kirk” in “Star Trek”, was also the former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries and the deputy head of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of advancing business with space tourism largely without scientific research interests for the good of mankind and without regard to climate.

Someone who works in biochemistry or has studied biochemistry
I am currently studying biochemistry in the first semester and actually find the subject quite exciting and also in the laboratory I am not disturbed (have already had the inorganic chemistry internship behind me).
Of course, I was also informed before studying professional prospects, but at the time I wanted to study and become a doctor.
At the moment, however, I have doubts, especially the prospects for employment.
On the one hand (studycheck etc) one hears always super career opportunities and the profession is totally sought, on the other hand one hears again and again from unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid places.
That's why I would really be interested:
1) As what are you currently working?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/maintainment?
3) What did you study/What training did you do?
4) Would you do the whole thing again?
Thank you for your answers!
I am currently really insecure and may consider discontinuing my studies in 2022 and making an education as a specialist informer.
If you have experience there, they also like to write :)
Extra stress before holidays & holidays weekends
This topic came up to me last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax.
That's why it's a pussy now.
Not only before large holidays, like Christmas holidays, there is great stress in our operation.
As it seems, there is the even before holidays plus bridge days.
It was this: Last week, Marie was a Ascension called by us in Switzerland, \"Auffahrt\" (Auffahrt) (Auffahrt).
On Friday, the most important people and businesses make a bridge day, which is therefore semi-official.
So last week there was a long 4 day weekend in the house.
So, what went on last week?
Everywhere stress.
According to e-mails, which would necessarily have to be issued before departure, order here order there, everything *unconditional* before the long weekend.
Because... because?
Because \"the next week then\" sounds like so much time and that must not be?
Or because people want to do all the serious things in a shortened week as much as they do in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but I was also very upset.
What is this self-sacrifice about holidays?
What else do we have holidays if we can't really enjoy them?!
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all quite independent of it.
My question is simple: are we just like this, the Swiss?
Is this our reformed-evangelical way?
Or do you know that in the north?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian home - but has no gifts yet.
“The beautiful, even if there should be no snow in Erfurt, you simply drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest,” said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will agree to the feast by baking and basting with her son.
“I love that,” Catterfeld said.
But until these days, they still have a lot to do: “For the first time, I don’t have any gifts yet, I finally have to get started.”
NECTON-Bio supports the smooth running of the mice and feeder re-formation.
NECTON-Bio contains all vital vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 μg biotin/kg.
NECTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny feather.
The majority of poultry damage caused by birds is exclusively due to nutritional defects.
Since the feeder consists of protein-containing substances, the formation of an impeccable feather dress is a particularly rich and balanced protein nutrition of the bird.
For a functioning metabolism, daily food must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
A majority of animal losses occurring during mice are due to poor or unbalanced protein intake and/or insufficient supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NECTON-Bio, the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant feed is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
No other vitamin preparation should be administered during the use of NECTON-Bio.
NECTON-Bio is cold water soluble and can easily be administered via the drinking water or via the soft food.
Thank you very much, I found it.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work
DDR handicraft model Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, which was used in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare lok probably comes from the conversion proposal of the model railway ME Heft 11/1968, used with play traces and miscellaneous views photos, function well, The E 95 series is a heavy freight train electrolocomotive of the German Reichsbahn Society (DRG), which has been designed for the traction of heavy coal heel trains in the Schlesian network, as possible the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Hall (Saale) and we are able to operate
In 1924, the German Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft commissioned the AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that would be able to transport 2,200 tonne-coal trains and 530 tonne-person trains at 45 km/h on this route.
As a maximum speed, 65 km/h were required.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG determined the supply as 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with Tack bearing drive AEG with the supply of the mechanical part, the Siemens-sucking plants with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were supplied, which received the E 95 01-06 operating numbers.
All were defeated by the Second World War and subsequently found themselves in the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946 the locomotives came into the Soviet Union as repair goods.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
At the Dessau Reichsbahnenwärtungswerk, the reworking credibility of all six locomotives was established.
[4] The three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were developed in 1959, while the other machines were used as spare parts donors.
First, the E 04, E 44 and E 94 available in larger quantities were preferred.
It was only when the E 94 considered that the number of reprocessings could not be further increased that the E 95 moved into the focus of the reprocessing.
[4]The locomotives were first stationed in the Leipzig-Wahren railway plant.
They came to the railway station Halle P in 1960.
They were mostly used in their own roundabout plan in front of coal trains from the Geisstal towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
With increasing age, the complex control of the locomotives proved problematic.
So it was more often that gunshots remained stuck in switching operations.
Then, on this locomotive, the constant companion with hammer and wooden throat had to loosen the shooter during the ride.
Damage to the motors occurred more often and resulted in monata long failures at the locomotive.
[5] Since there were enough new locomotives in the late 1960s and a significant expansion of the electric plant was not planned at that time, the Reichsbahn was able to rely on old locomotives and most of the splitteries, so that the E 95 was out of service.
They added that the Deutsche Reichsbahn Elektrolokomotiven only wanted to occupy a single position, which would have caused a problem in train operation due to the above-mentioned difficulties with the machines and the vision conditions.
[5] After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were cancelled in mid- 1969, the E 95 01 was followed by the E 95 01, which was completed on 5 October 1970.
The proposed new name 255 001 has therefore never been used.
All locomotives were destroyed until E 95 02.
The E 95 02 was set up as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a soft heating plant at the main railway station Halle.
It took some time for those in charge to be convinced by the Reichsbahn that the E 95 was valuable as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the first external processing of the locomotive began with the aim of presenting it to a car show in the RAW Dessau.
[5] It has since belonged to the Verkehrsmuseum Dresden as a non-operable museum locomotive.
In 1986, the inner completion of the locomotive was carried out.
In the DB Museum Halle (Saale), the locomotive museum is maintained.
Since 1995, employees of the tradition community Bw Hall P have been working on the operational processing of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive could be presented for the first time at an exhibition in the Museums-Bw Arnstadt with new internal and external painting, checking the transformers and allowing five motors to operate.
-The locomotives were used until 1945 on the Schlesian mountain railway and the branching side tracks, where they proved themselves reliable due to their reliable drive and low maintenance effort.
In February 1945 the machines were relocated to Leipzig to the medium German network.
Main use area was initially Silesia
Handicraft model H0 in OVP, function well, it's optical rework at the lok in own work necessary, dusted, with game tracks, cellar smell !!!, very rare handicraft model, very small edition- possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging may contain labels and storage traces.
Yes the F-parts are it
I got a bed from you.
However, there were problems with a part.
The center bar is held by two feet..leads are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What are we doing now?
I can't build the bed.
The middle bar is held by two feet, unfortunately these are produced incorrectly.
The centre bar does not fit into the intended holder.
So I'm gonna get a new one.
When will they be sent away?
No flats.
These are, according to the assembly instructions, the right of the form, they were only too narrow
But that doesn't matter.
Mainly, they fulfil their purpose
They're not flat with me.
Could I get these?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem to you again?
House fire with two light injuries and high damage
Two people were easily injured in a fire in a house in Oberbayern.
In addition, an estimated damage occurred in the six-digit euro area, as reported by the police on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport to the adjacent residence in Kinsau (Landkreis Landsberg am Lech).
Two residents were reported to have been hospitalized on Sunday with light smoke poisoning.
The exact cause of the fire was not known at first, but the police did not go out of a deliberate fire.
The Cripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigations.
It's coming in a lot later.
And I have to pay again shipping costs
To discourage Fake News - Biontech CEO publishes Impf photo
Uğur ƿahin published a photo of his first vaccination at the beginning of 2021 on the social network, LinkedIn.
Biontech chief Uğur ƿahin had not yet publicly expressed himself about his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur published a photo showing his Corona vaccination.
The illness of a friend moved him to do so.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainzer company Biontech, Uğur Þahin, has published a photo showing how he receives vaccination against the Coronavirus.
In the social media, there was false information that I was supposedly not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I have received 3 doses of the Biontech Pfizer vaccine - I wrote on Friday in a post on the Network \"LinkedIn\"
“For several months I have been pushing friends to post a photo of me on which I am being vaccinated to counter this false rumor,
So far he has rejected this because the communication should not revolve around him himself.
But a call last week changed his opinion: “I was deeply saddened when I learned that an old school friend is fighting me for his life.
He fights a severe Covid-19 disease and hangs on a beater for three weeks.
The schoolfriend and his family were not vaccinated, continued writing.
He didn't ask about the reasons.
“The most common cause, however, seems to be anxiety often caused by misinformation and distrust,
Fear makes it difficult to deal with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
On the Internet, an interview with the Deutsche Welle circulates, where Uğur says he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as the Deutsche Welle itself explained.
“I’m not allowed to get the vaccine myself by law at the time,” said Iahin.
There was a prioritisation in Germany in the vaccination of the vaccine.
In the meantime prioritisation has long been lifted - and the Biontech chief has been able to intervene three times according to appropriate data.
Fire in recirculation plant: Tens of thousands of people without electricity
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the light went out on Friday evening: no more electricity and in many cases no heating.
A fire had paralysed a translucent station.
Tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg-Kreis in North Rhine-Westphalia have had to leave without electricity for about 24 hours after a fire with serious damage in a congested station.
On Friday evening, 41,000 residents in several municipalities were exposed to the lights.
The caretaker West network reported that on Saturday many emergency power plants had been in operation until the large-scale disruption could finally be completely fixed in the late evening.
Fire fighters and helpers from THW provided support in the municipalities.
The authorities offered care in schools and called for neighbourhood assistance.
The caregiver thanked the persons concerned for their patience and assistance.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We also thank the communities concerned, the circle, the firefighters and the THW for their tireless use, said the leader of the area of primary technology, Florian Witt, in a announcement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will still be needed for a few days, as the Western network mounters were able to only temporarily re-operate some lines at first, he explained.
A technical defect led to the fire according to company details.
Stream flows again
The fire erupted on Friday at 7.15 p.m. has, according to Westnetz, severely damaged parts of the 10,000 volt shell system in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid station.
There, elaborate cleaning and repair work is needed.
In parallel, a connection to a 30,000 volt voltage level had been established.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is restored.
Since Saturday at 6 p.m., over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again.
More 20,000 inhabitants of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually switched on from 21.30 p.m.
Since 23.15 p.m. the last electricity affected by the failure would have been also.
More than 80 mounts from the west network and partner companies were in use.
After building an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon, the authorities had also called for neighbourhood assistance.
\"It is important now that citizens in their neighborhood take care of elderly or single people and communicate to local fire-fighting equipment houses when help is needed, said Landrat Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
In the setting up and operation of emergency power stations, the residents of Altenheimen were mainly focused.
In addition, temporary care facilities have been established in schools according to authorities for those people who were not able to provide themselves or for those who need current-dependent medical equipment or who need medical care.

Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I can't move it together and therefore shorten it.
Can you help me?
Otherwise, I would have to send her back, since otherwise she's not suitable for the purpose.
I would be pleased about a feedback
Yes, that's really easier!
Then we'll do it like that!
Do you send me the return note by mail?
The repair is now complete.
I tried this before the chat.
However, before buying it, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Should I do that now?
I find such a low credit almost unharmed.
We do not agree to that.

Yes, we have made both s and use version 4.5...
could be that they've heard more often of problems
Did directly with my #PRS_ORG#, a book bought it also seems to be on it.
As soon as I want to open it comes the message, ups!
Could not open this document.

As far as I can recognize it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can they help me?
Chat connection is gone and now?
I have to work in between.
To make the colour order even and clean, you should clean the components with some soapy water of dust, fat and fingerprints, rinse them with clear water and dry them.
Before you bring the brush to the model for the first time with a new color, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the later visible inside of the components or on a yoghurt cup.
The first line on the component
Pull the brush evenly next to the stroke.
Light overlapping of the paint layers will later provide an even surface area.
Avoid rushing and wiping with the brush.
This creates unrealistically effective areas.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the bright colors.
The dark ones could shine through later.
Metal tones and metallic paints come to an end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, it can result in unpleasant metal locks if they mix with normal colors.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before you build them.
The models can be achieved by the decals and/or subtraction images.
From high-end signs on airplanes via ship's name up to fences and signs in car models: The Decals give the model the last cut.
Bring the decals in the correct order as long as the components are still well reached.
An aircraft cockpit can be maintained before it is built into the hull.
Even more important than the right tool such as scissors, pinsets and toothpicks are when living time, patience and a quiet hand.
Cut out each decal needed individually and put it right to you.
Decals are also called watership images because you briefly moisten their back with water until the carrier paper gets dark through the nose.
Then you just slide the picture a little bit from the paper and place the piece on the corresponding spot on the model (which you have moistened before).
While you hold the Decal on the model with a tool, you pull the carrier paper side by side.
Attention: Always check if the picture is sitting right before you slide it completely from the paper so that it doesn't stick to your finger, blink or even tear.
Suction excess water with a towel.
Attention not suitable for children under 3 years
I can only open a book briefly as soon as I look at something else then I no longer read the book and have to log out and log in and reload the book and search for the place to where I have read it.
I've already been communicating with you on Saturday.
Do I get this by email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp arrived at me in 3 single packages
Thank you anyway!
then I'll buy somewhere else once the money is back.
But do I get this back without a problem?
Child gain treatment in PKV / What is an ‘insurance case’?
Hello together,
we have been in children's wishes treatment some time now when it comes to accounting with the PKV, it suddenly crosses.
The series after:
We had applied for the children's wishes in advance at the PKV and received the commitment over 3 trials.
The trials were not restricted in any way (e.g. temporal framework, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to successful pregnancy and birth and was calculated with the PKV.
Some time later we tried to get a second child, and carried out 2 (failing) trials, but they still didn't count on the PKV.
We again requested the cost acquisition at the PKV and again received 3 further attempts.
After a few more trials (we performed more trials than promised, logically the most expensive ones with the PKV) we submitted the invoices to the PKV and got the bad surprise: instead of 5 trials (2+3) the PKV only wants to refund 3 trials.
The reason: With pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 trials of the first commitment expire.
The second child's wish was a new insurance case.
However, according to GTC, \"The insurance case begins treatment, it ends when treatment need no longer exists\"
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who is right here to refund the PKV (only 3 trials are reimbursed) or we (there are 5 attempts to reimburse)?
* Did the PKV have to point out to us in the pledges that with one birth the further attempts fail?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
The infertility (caused by closed ovaries) is not healed by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here gave your opinion.
Thank you so much for your help!
Can you let me know the three variants by email and tell me how I get them back best
All right.
We won't order anything from them anymore.
When they add the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (equal address), they obviously lost good customer.
They are happy to pass this on to their managers.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday the colleague told me that the refund was being made and now you tell me I have to send the thing back.
I can't do anything for the commode to get completely disturbed at me
Please see what the colleague wrote in the screenshot
There's clear and clear that the repayment has been made and I still haven't received any repayment via #PRS_ORG#
They can align their manager that they have now lost two regular customers.
My friend has also ordered various furniture for our apartment via his account.
We're not going to do that anymore.
No, the defect only occurred after a few months.
An office chair must maintain normal use.
Otherwise, they can't sell him as an office chair.
Regardless, the warranty shall apply for 24 months.
No, it is not possible for me to obtain another type of packaging.
I'm going to take off the closet and make it available to the transport company.
Hello, I have a question about your series from #PRS_ORG#
These products will be applied with additional stools to be purchased, but unfortunately we cannot find them with you.
Can they help?
Theme of the Week: The Best Low Budget Films
What a low-budget film is exactly, there is no general definition with exact budget limits.
The Wikipedia has the following to say:
>A **low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little to no foundation from a major film studio or private investor.
In the network you can find numerous lists of low-budget movies, such as e.g. on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know interesting representatives of this category?
What's that?
And what might you not like at all?
I am a very good customer of you, have already furnished 2 apartments complete with your furniture.
Would ask the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is it now also reliable?
Thank you very much.
With friendly greetings
There is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30min is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position... I'll give up soon, because it just doesn't work here.
Hello
‘Half victory - associated with Belarus with high costs for the EU
According to policy expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can announce a “half victory” in conflict with the Belarusian regime.
However, the costs were very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees to Belarus - border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU has not yet resolved the confrontation, explained the researcher of the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP).
This state of gravity - Belarus does not contribute very little, but the EU feels as a winner - probably goes on for a while.
Dealing with people at the border was not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong judged.
It is obvious that there is an increasing normalization of pushbacks by individual EU governments.
As the EU as a whole does not act decisively against it, it is at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development at the same time weakens cohesion in the Union.
\"It obviously cannot be enforced when a Member State heads to do its thing, as is the current situation in Poland, which does not even allow the EU Border Protection Agency Frontex to have access to the border.
Moreover, the EU paid a further price for its policy at the border with Belarus, says Bossong: A principle agreement on asylum policy would be made difficult, as the line “border protection, border protection and border protection” had been strengthened.
Renewed attempt at crossing the border
According to Poland's border protection, migrants have once again tried to reach Poland via Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested on Sunday at night and brought back to the border, said a spokesperson to the Authority on Sunday.
The Polish officials had been stoned by the migrants in the incident not far from the village of Czeremsza.
According to the information, a soldier was hit face to face and had to be supplied medically by a military doctor.
In total, the border guard registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months or have tried to do so.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko of having attracted power in Minsk with the prospect of entering the EU.
Polish and Lithuanian press reports are based on cross-sections.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that would bring migrants and refugees to land.
In addition, EU Commissioners traveled to the countries of origin of the people to stop departures there.
The most effective element of the EU response is pressure on airlines, says Bossong.
‘The EU has thrown its market power into the vanguard and has proved its determination to operate with tough bandages and extraterritorial sanctions,
Minsk must also take into account domestic costs.
The Belarusian society is probably not concerned that the security device regularly locks thousands of people across the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 finals
Max Verstappen, according to Mercedes, is supposed to have committed two rule breaks during the race.
Abu Dhabi - According to the controversial Formula 1 finale of Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has filed opposition.
The silver arrows are thought to be two line breaks in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to an alleged violation of Max's steps in the Red Bull during the last safety car phase, when he is supposed to have regularly overtaken.
A second opposition was filed against the valuation at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes-View, the protocol was not followed in accordance with the rules.
On the last round Lewis Hamilton had overtaken the Mercedes and had been rushed to his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase, in which the Dutch had taken over before he was driving.
I'll check it out.
I'll talk to the bank and report to you again
Thank you for the support

Füchsle, Ed Euromaus and many red and white balloons provided the perfect setting - so the park.
Since the beginning of the 90s, cooperation has existed between the Bundesligist and the leisure park located in Rust, 40 kilometres north of Freiburg.
At the first SC Freiburg Fantag in the Europa Park again showed how well the partnership fits.
Seeing radiant fans who have fun in the roller coaster together confirm this - says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
Why is the €#NUMBER# and not like originally 1699€ ?

But just because he says he's not an antisemitic doesn't mean that.
That's as if a kid says he's got nothing against foreigners.
Your i will not admit it both.
But Collegah constantly reproduces any anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself then you should just let it complete.
Yes, then you are no less serious than Colleague.
Those who seriously question evolution are simply completely gone.
For my sake, a God has set the whole thing in motion.
But as soon as you're creative, you'll have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and that science is just getting nonsense.
And that's what you're a science enemy and not to take seriously like Colleague
In order to get an optimal visual field, the lupe should be approached as close to the eye as possible.
The specially aplanetically-achromatic-designed lens system allows you to use the lupe to the edge zone with a practical marking and colour-free use.
Often, loops are marked with enlargement details.
However, these data only apply to precisely defined conditions which rarely meet the conditions of use.
In order to be able to use your lupe optimally, we ask you to note the instructions in the table “Technical data” (see instructions for use in the packaging).
On the lens surfaces of all optical devices, so also in the case of impact loops, light reflexes arise.
These reflections are significantly reduced by an antireflection coating.
In compliance with the optimum conditions of use - lupe close to the eye - mirrors on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
Further information can be found in the accompanying instructions for use (in German and English).

Tanning sale in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz women are looking for the Christmas trees
Mr. Frank Diers has already experienced such a curious situation during the tanning sale.
Once, a man should even have gone home without his partner, because both of them couldn't agree.
Each year, he plants well over 2000 pieces.
The 56-year-old has already experienced so much urious situation.
That's what the Christmas season always makes a bit fun, he says.
And that with the voucher?
Otherwise I'm gone as a customer?!
After all, I received a defective delivery and now paid the full price for it.
Then I'll evaluate it accordingly.
We do not need to discuss the better court here, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat, which is grilled on a spinning spoon.
So both of them have their names.
In German, an equivalent might be something like the \"dreher\" which doesn't sound so delicious by far.
Problems with glass fiber + Devolo DLan/Magic
We've had a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I now have problems building a stable Wifi network.
Previously I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which has received and sent 50 Mbits to a few failures.
The new fiber optic connection sends 500 Mbit to FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module, which is connected to FritzBox, also arrives.
However, on the other DLan module, which sends the Wifi, no longer arrives at the full 500, but the further I remove myself in the house with the module, the less comes on (so use a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. spaces away from the other module).
This means that the Internet with the new fiber optic connection is now on the first floor even slower than before (-~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
Although this was slightly better than the DLan, there were similarly large losses.
Could anyone explain to me why with glass fiber so much Internet speed is going to be \"lost\" over the power line?
And is LAN really the some solution?
It would be extremely expensive to put in the house LAN cable still.
I'm really desperate, which is why I created an account here.
That's why I'd be all the more happy about an answer.
When it's time to change the Giro account
Who would have thought that there would be rest with the girokonts for the first time, is being deceived.
While many banks have used the fall to confirm with all kinds of tricks from their customers the increases in fees of the past, the exemptions for negative interest rates continue to fall.
For example, the Deutsche Bank was considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she's half the free amount, and she's even quartered for the day's money.
In a first step, the border was reduced only for customers of the Group-Sparte Postbank - to 50,000 Euros at Giro and Investment Accounts and 25 000 Euros for daily cash accounts.
In the meantime, however, these lower exemptions apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as confirmed by a spokesperson on request.
And not only for new contracts, but also for \"newly made individual agreements with existing customers\"
The Commerzbank had already gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which is still valid, as well as to ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, which is especially popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the amount in two stages, initially to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
After all, more than 100 banks, according to the figures of the Internet portal Verivox, now have an amount of EUR 25,000 or less.
The Sparda-Bank Berlin has also arrived at EUR 25,000: however, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centres, which in the first instance have even received a right before the Landgericht Berlin against this regulation.
Now the banks are already discussing whether the institutions should possibly make provisions - in case the above instances also explain the negative interest rates in principle as inadmissible and many millions must be paid back to bank customers.

Jennifer Aniston employs a whole beauty army
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But their lives are like a mountain and valley ride.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was elected the most influential woman in the year by the U.S. magazine The Hollywood Reporter.
For them, who made 2021 with the \"Friends\" reunification and the continuation of their series \"The Morning Show\" Furore, this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers take care of their appearance.
After all, according to Aniston, they enjoy a chip a day (yes, read correctly: an EARTH chip from the bag).
That the hearts of the female and male fans fly together is actually a miracle.
Maybe because she's just bad luck - and still looking for great love.
And the baby wish deleted from the list.
Before, she was constantly asked when she became a mother.
That hurt her.
The people who asked me this have no idea what's going on with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
Keep hoping that success and glory will also make you happy.
Unworthy end of a career: Räikkunen has to give up
Kimi Räikkönen's farewell from Formula 1 was even quieter than thought.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old fin pulled out the gloves and wiped the sweat from the forehead.
That's it.
After a driving error and a slight contact with the band, Räikkönen had not even half of the race distance off his Alfa Romeo at the Grand Price of Abu Dhabi.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the \"Iceman\" who finished his career in the motorsport royal class.
His wife Minttu and the two children also traveled to the United Arab Emirates.
Räikkönen's greatest success was winning the 2007 World Championship in Ferrari.
He won 21 Grand Prix wins, started 18 times from the Pole and came to the podium 103 times. dpa
Friedrich gets 60th World Cup victory - Nolte wins in the Tweierbob - Sport
The brand of Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the Bobpilot.
“I’ve figured this out, I’d have to win nine and a half a season, then I could make it up to Cortina 2026,” said the double-olympiasieger of the BSC Oberbärenburg, who booked two successes in two days at the Winterberg races.
First he resisted the attack by Johannes Lochner on Saturday by five hundredths, in which he drove from rank three to one.
Then he changed something to the material setting and took a bigger lead on Sunday with 0.30 seconds.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Hall), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Hall) he set out in front of the British Brad Hall.
==References====External links==
“We went to greater risk today and were rewarded,” said Friedrich, who also won his 22nd victory in series.
The Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner, who is driving for Stuttgart, came to rank five this time after two places.
Christoph Haver from BC Bad Feilnbach landed in place of eight in the first race.
“If I knew what he was doing differently, I would do the same thing — say Lochner.
Nolte with home victory - podium for Jamanka
With the women, Laura Nolte won the third season victory in the Zweierbob on her home track.
After the first day in the Monobob it was only for the fourth place, she rose to World Cup victory on Sunday at the German triple success with anesthesiologist Deborah Levi.
Two-bob Olympics winner Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thuringia came to rank two with Germany's fastest sprinkler, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to her Olympia qualification, she booked the first podium site in this winter.
The Wiesbadener Kim Kalicki landed with Leonie Fiebig in place three.
For me it was supercool, first podium place in the world cup, I'm superhappy that Mariama takes me with her.
I'm super happy with the development.
There's still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay, said Burghardt, \"It's not just a push, but there's a lot to do, too.
Jamanka was a little angry at the not completely fault-free rides, but said: “It’s going in the right direction,”
I already had the blanket in my shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What am I supposed to do?
I just didn't receive it and therefore cannot resolve it, which is why I finally asked for it.
Through Corona I had quite a different problem last year and never time for it.
And now he said he was gone, which upsets me very much.
Look into the chat it was about the Asare seat.
I want to return it and then order it again, as it is just reduced :)
Why is shipping only started on 16.3.
It was nothing of such long delivery time on your website
No, it's only when I tap on it that an extra field comes with the message
Your colleague took it yesterday.
Why is this a problem today?
I also sent you pictures of the wrongly delivered words.
But we want the shelf module anyway, just a new undamaged
And don't cancel the entire order.
Just this day, just this week, just until XY...
Hello, great girls and girls and women,
I've got some things I just want to write and maybe the one or other is going like that...
I'm 24, got kPTBS, full-time student and dog emama - apart from not screaming my dog or going to kindergarten, he's actually 1 to 1 my child.
My friend (since 6J together) is sick, has taken an incineration 2nd grade on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see him and feel him, we have been kissing a lot and it was beautiful.
I helped him at the shower (because hand is in the band wg combustion).
It's cool on top and we're seeing less (1-2x week) at the moment, which makes me very much to create with my needs for affection and love.
My dog boy just got belly hurt, I cooked for him, and now he's in his pillow and relaxed a little after I was there with the heat lamp and ironing for him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and it's just gone for a month.
Now, too, housework is on us, which we naturally divide.
But even cooking is just a lot of work for me...
My PTBS disease is quite well adjusted, I am half well-therapyd and come right.
Not good, but I'm right and I'm almost symptom-free.
My university just demands a lot (for me), tomorrow at 15 am I have a written test for which I haven't done anything and then tomorrow anatomy hour for which I should at least prepare a little bit.
And next week I'll have an oral exam right on Tuesday, and what's coming is in my calendar and not in my head because there's no space left.
So my week goes like this: Only until tomorrow, then it's weekend.
But after that, the whole thing goes on?
Only until the birthday.
Only until the start of the holiday.
Just until weekend.
Just until...
And so it continues forever.
I think I'm just so stressed out that I need these spiritual points because otherwise I pack it down.
Somehow I feel guilty and \"chaotic\" but otherwise I don't...
Are you all like that?
Honestly, I'm infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
Really infinitely grateful, I can't do that at all in words.
Don't know if I would have survived my kptbs.
I think this also has some things to do with Mental Load of Women, and that's why I thought I'd be sure to find people with suffering here...
I definitely wish you another relaxing evening, the week is almost done!
I got my order today unfortunately the whole other color plus surface is scratched and table leg has print.
At the first delivery the color was exactly like on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we're going to change the table, I'll get some other color or how?
The cancellation email was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
Two more times.
But she wasn't confirmed.
Once something completely different: I found in school that many religious teachers do not believe in God and it is for them just another subject like math or Earth science.
For me, this was always a bit strange, perhaps even because I was raised a Christian and I always believed that way.
How are you doing?
You may also be able to tell about colleagues in work and study with different attitudes.
Basically I understand the difference between private and professional and it is sensible to separate.
There is also a curriculum, etc.
But just find it strange to have a physics teacher who does not believe in the theory of relativity.
What then leads one to want to teach religion if one does not believe it?
True culture or something?
Hope your question is not too private.
Can't change it or not?Do I like writing English that I understand well
It's been a long time, then I'd be off.
It's okay, thanks.
I'll wait a while until a feedback is received at the beginning of next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Video search help please
Hello, dear people,
I'm looking for a movie from my childhood (bin 24).
I think it has been a movie for young people.
In the film there are two time axes (or parallel worlds).
First, the modern (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the kingdom of the dead) (not quite sure).
Since I can't describe it any more in the real world there is a young woman.
And in the kingdom of the dead a young soldier (uniform similar to that of the soldiers from flight of the Caribbean).
For some reason the paths cross and an action arises.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the kingdom of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this kingdom to live for himself I mean.
The transition is, I believe, also the burial place of the soldier.
In the end, I believe both soldiers are fighting each other.
If that's what I'm saying, I'm grateful for every answer.
Our little one just slept on the belly from week 1.
Fast forward: still lives :D
Relax.
Such a child is a lot more than you think.
Make sure everything's right around, no bullets, more often go in and watch, but no minutes of surveillance.
That makes you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Axo and ours had no sleeping bag, but always a blanket.
Watch your child when it sleeps.
Does it turn the head to the side?
Can it build up from the belly?
Or is it directly in the mattress with the face facing forward?
That's what you can derive from whether everything's all right.
We all grew up and when my husband came to the world, it was zb gang and said that you put the kids on the belly to sleep.
In addition, we are already “Stammkunde” with you and have already bought many products
But then why do you only offer me 20EUR?
Hello, I wrote with a colleague of yours yesterday and so far no feedback.
It's about my wardrobe arrived last night (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC ID#).
The right drawer does not fit into the cabinet.
I ask you to contact me as soon as possible.
The cabinet is not to be used at the moment.
To make it clear.
RBTV promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be kept.
And I also had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It's just that the politics of this transmitter is now under all the sauce.
Almost every format is sponsored (also), but then at the same time go on a large bet tour.
It has been said that one is an \"independent\" Internet broadcaster.
Quote Arno: You don't want to be a running lit-foot column,
What are you doing now?
A 0815 advertiser who tries to bring his BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we still have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
Those of course apply to everyone except Simon and Etienne.
They may, of course, continue to insult the people.
A krogman to whom there is a complete lack of empathy and at the expense of the action with the looted rented rooms tries to make ashes.
How can you find it all right?
Great if you like it, I think it's terrible.
I'm asking for a call from Rueck, since my supplied wooden table was defectively sent.

Whether as a comforter at abdominal pain or just to cuddle, my little heat friend can be used in a variety of ways.
Kirschkern pillows are a traditional home remedy for beneficial heat applications, as cherry cores can absorb heat very well and return dosed.
The removable inner cushion can be easily heated in the microwave or in the oven.
The soft reference makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel secure, even if they are not so good.
The cherry core cushion with reference is suitable for use exclusively with the following applications:
Before heating the pillow, check for untypical odor, stock or fire stains and immediately dispose of it when available.
Please remove the inner cushion for heating from the reference before!
Heat in microwave at max. 300 watts for max. 2 minutes (note the microwave manufacturer!)
Immediately after heating, distribute the heat by shaking evenly in the pillow!
Then place the inner cushion in the reference.
In the first heaters, the surface can produce a slight moisture formation, but it disappears in repeated applications.
Keep in mind the mentioned heating instructions, as longer times or higher energy performance can cause damage (flammation and combustion risk!).
Before heating the pillow in the microwave, check that heating of grain products is allowed in the manufacturer's instructions.
After the warmed inner pillow has been returned to the reference, please check the temperature of the pillow for fitness for babies (max. 43 °C) on your arm's leg!
Do not use the pillow in acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverous diseases, circulatory problems, fresh haematoms, bleeding and open wounds as well as in people with reduced pain.
For existing skin, heart, veins, diabetes or tumor diseases and pregnancies, please contact a doctor before using.
Should seams open and loose cores exit, dispose of the product and the loose cores immediately and inaccessible to children.
If the product is used in babies under 1 year old, the child's temperature should be monitored regularly during use to exclude overheating!
All major incidents related to the product shall be reported to the manufacturer and the competent authority of the country in which the user is established.
The reference is removable and washable in the machine at 30 °C.
Please note the care symbols on the product!

Is the battery broken?
Last evening my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer loaded by my power supply.
I bought this again about 5 months ago, so should still work.
I thought power supply alone was enough to operate.
Misadvertisement, the battery is empty and the laptop is no longer starting despite plugged in power supply.
That's why I expanded the battery, but I don't do anything here either.
Do you have ideas?
A new battery is ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in network operation?
Is there something else broken?
Thank you for your help!
I want to deliver the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book this?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But don't know how high the seat area is....
Often on tour and still a lot of equipment?
No problem with Peak Design's Everyday V2 backpack!
20 litres of capacity also swallow larger photo equipment without problems, which can be safely stowed using the padded FlexFold parts.
And what else you need on everyday items remains well organized and separable from the photo equipment thanks to practical accesses in the individually configurable interior.
With the \"Update\" of the Everyday Line on version 2 (V2) the series is still presented in a new look.
The chic, minimalist design has it proverbially in itself - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack, yet also give it in seconds access to the photo equipment.
This works with two possibilities: Once conventionally via the lid valve, which can be closed with the MagLatch locking system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection, which has already proven itself at the Messenger Bags.
In this case there is a closure hook made of metal with matching anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has considered several “fillings”: there are 4 anchor beams, permanently destroyed, into which the closure hook can be inserted.
If the backpack is fully loaded, just take the top bar, it is rather empty, a deeper one.
The clasp and hooks are also magnetic.
In this way, the backpack can also be reliably closed without rushing the hook.
The second possibility also distinguishes the Everyday Backpack fundamentally from others, photo backpacks: In addition to the cover flap there is still a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the greatest disadvantage of conventional backpacks with access from above - you don't have to wave through the content anymore!
At the same time, this clever detail greatly increases the everyday fitness of the backpack: if you take not only your photo equipment, but also everyday items or luggage.
In Everyday Backpack you can individually configure the interior (more down) and thus store both of them easily separately - and access them independently through the two side openings.
You can also pull the backpack from the right side in front of the body, for example, to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while the everyday things stay safely in the left backpack half and don't come in between.
Comfortable, uncomplicated adjustable wear belts help with this.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is also made entirely of 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the contents remain dry even if it is to go to Scotland in autumn.
Unfortunately, I waited for the email of her support in vain.
#NAME# gave me an e-mail from confirmation yesterday for the assignment of
Contact was announced by the forwarding to pick up the wrongly delivered table.
I haven't received a message until now.
I ask for immediate settlement.
I am already writing with the third support staff, with no one I came further than the promise that I will receive an email as a confirmation.
This is the return of the wrongly delivered custom #NAME#
It's time to check when the cabinet could be delivered again?
Keeping him that way is not an option for me...
It works.
Many thanks for the help
Wish you a nice evening
hello, my order is #NUMBER#. when is the item delivered?
Order and payment was on 12.1.21.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than I ordered
Please call me.
If you extend the voucher to me, I'll give up a larger order, but after all, I've kept the damaged piece of furniture and not sent it back.
And that the past year was different from what I thought I couldn't understand and just couldn't resolve and clarify it on time.
But I do not accept the damage as a customer.
Rotinger brake discs are designed to appreciate the requirements of the dynamic driver, reliability and safety during braking even under difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are made of cast and then mechanically processed (boiled and cut).
All tuned discs are manufactured in short series according to individual technical characteristics, which are unique for certain discs and patterns.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing a special production program is created, which is aimed at the properties of the original assembly with the weighting of the disc.
The tuned discs thus produced ensure high comfort and brake effectiveness.
Additional openings created increase the efficiency of cooling of the disc, while cuttings improve cleaning of the brake discs and brake bolts.
Aesthetic properties of our tuned discs emphasize the character of each car by attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the west coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man at the southern fork of the American River discovered shining chunks in the water.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the novelty spread rapidly and replaced the so-called ‘California Gold Rush ’ from ’49.
Thousands came from a distance and made Coloma one of the fastest growing and thriving cities in the country.
Areas have been cut down, tents have been opened, and saloons and hotels have been created almost overnight.
Everyone wanted his share of the wealth of the country.
For many it was: “Coloma or Bust” (Coloma or Bankrott)!
In this game you are a pioneer who seeks wealth in the West and wants to make a name for himself.
You will look for gold, recruit workers, drive horses together and build companies.
You will also be given the opportunity to explore the surrounding river runs and adjacent areas.
You're not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to get over your pioneer colleagues so you don't have to sit down with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many ways to win.
You choose your actions at the same time, have to keep home with your resources and build a table, which works more and more for you (so-called \"Engine Building\")
The buildings on your table allow you to become more efficient, to receive additional actions or to apply rules to your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge plate, you can develop your individual style of playing with the help of fine adjustments.
Coloma plays over a period of three years from 1848 (the year in which the gold was discovered in Coloma), over 1849 (the year of California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year in which California gained official statehood).
One year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will secretly and simultaneously select a location on the game plan where they can perform actions.
Afterwards, their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers at the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it gets a lock!
This disables half of the site - which reduces the possible actions there.
Then players perform alternating actions, such as gaining resources, moving cars, creating tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening shops, and positioning gunmen.
When all the actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The awarder turns to a new location at the beginning of each round and changes the available actions.
This continues for so long until the pricer has moved five times, so every location has once covered and the year ends.
There is a shooting in which the players must defend Coloma from an assault of angry bandits.
If the players have contributed enough revolver heroes and the bandits are overly superior, they will receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they receive lower rewards or end up in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shooting, then the final score takes place.
The player with the most winning points wins!

“Why children are not tyrants - Doku, ARD Mediathek
CW mental violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentation has appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I've looked at it right away.
>The children's psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff likes to see a guest in talk shows and gives talks across Europe.
With his book \"Why Our Children Become Tyrans\" (2008), he triggered a violent educational debate.
Former patient: women and education rights now raise serious accusations against him.
Please be careful, the film is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
Our parents and others responsible must never, never, never! go to power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child space for its development and to raise the framework for the child as meaningful and as possible in the situation.
Brr, I'm still shaking.
Holetschek: Countries advise on the removal of testing obligations for three-fold vaccines
The health ministers of the countries want to decide at their next meeting on a nationwide removal of the testing obligation for three-fold vaccines.
\"We countries need quick clarity as to whether and from when and from when the test obligation can be met for three times, said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), Chairman of the Health Ministers Conference, the \"Image on Sunday\"
The removal of 2G plus for three-fold vaccines is “not only medically sensible, but also provides an additional vaccination incentive,” Holetschek said.
Federal Minister for Health Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised that he will make a proposal to the Health Ministers Conference on this matter as early as next Tuesday.
So I want to send the lamp back

Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very nice, but I can't see how high the seat area is.
Can you help me?

The most common thing is to listen to sounds/stems, less to see pictures and the rarest to perceive pain.
For this topic relevant: Kaiserschnitts are operations associated with an increased rate of awareness, as one avoids a very deep anesthesia for the protection of the child until the nebulous.
Previous episodes of Awareness should be mentioned during anesthesia.
Certain anaesthesia procedures such as total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Love everyone, this comment by me does describe Awareness correctly, however had** u/Nitemarex **per definition none.
I misread her comment.
But the chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the 20€ won't help us either.
These are statutory warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be to take back the defective chair.
In addition to the statutory obligation, this is also standard in the field of eCommerce.
Please check again if they at least take back the defective chair.
We sell the second chair then privately.
That's where we lose a lot of money.
I've already sent you a mail that you haven't answered.
Again the question.
The order and the invoice state that the goods will be delivered up to a room of my choice.
The forwarder is #NAME#.
I just called there.
I was told that they only deliver in front of the door - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I have to cancel the order, since I don't know any person who can carry me the heavy furniture on the first floor.
Will I not be called?
I had formulated a question
Theatre historian Günther Rühle died 97-year-old
He has profiled himself as a theatre critic and an intent.
Later he wrote a monumental theatre story.
Günther Rühle died on Friday at the age of 97.
There's the new book on the table, fresh in print: \"An old man gets older\"
The shocking diarium of a slow departure from the world led by the theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle until April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading comes the news that the author died.
The last sentence in the book says: \"I've been witnessing my life thanks here,
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common are European, standardized wooden pallets, which are mainly used as cargo carriers in the European area.
They are certified by the European Palette Association EPAL
According to statistics in Austria in 2020, over ten million pieces of pallets were produced in Austria.
The production value was about EUR 79 million.
How many pallets are imported to Austria each year is not collected
New York holds MLS championship for the first time
New York City FC won the title in Major League Soccer for the first time.
After 1:1 in the regular season against host Portland Timbers, the team from the Eastern Conference decided the final in the Elfmeter shooting with 4:2.
In the finale of the Eastern Conference, New York had fought against Philadelphia Union, the team of the German Kai Wagner.
Roulade Tips & Tricks
I had a lot of great tips for the perfect goulash here a week ago.
That was at Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery!
So thank you again for that :)
Now I have come to taste and want to cook to New Year's Eve for the first time roulade.
Tomorrow, I'm going to put on a cattle fund for it.
Do you have any tips for me?
Note: I have no oven, but only a large pot.
How's it going now?
What about the books or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English isn't that good anymore, but I'm going to do that.
IIt is about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was already informed by mail on 18.01. that the refund was made.
But to this day, the money didn't come in to me.
Would you please check there?
Where there are still Christmas breads in the room Lübeck
For many people, Gans or Ente are among the Christmas days like the Tannenbaum and the gifts.
You haven't got any poultry yet?
Now the time is running out.
We'll tell you where you got another Christmas bread in the Lübeck room.
The “drive - a tube end stage contributes significantly to the warmth and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controller, you can set the desired level and on the other hand the zero content of your sounds.
Furthermore, the amplifiers of the VT+ series offer a unique POWER LEVEL controller with which you can reduce the sound level without changing anything on the 'gain' and the distortion.
Further up, it already sounded that you can even make a power reserve smooth with the POWER LEVEL controller when it goes out loud.
Thanks to POWER LEVEL controller, the full potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphones can also be used as a line output.
The signal here is processed with a boxing simulation, so that when you use a headphones or direct recordings, you get an eminent \"acoustic\" sound impression.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX socket so that you can jam into your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate voice device.
Anyone who also donates to a VFS5 foottaster can also easily access the sounds by foot, turn the effect blocks on/off and the pace of the corresponding effects to be applied.
This is really essential for live use.
With its new power packages, VOX will take another step into the future!
But I've seen that in others.
Is it possible to send the lamp back to you?
Because it hangs too low over an dining table?
So I'd like to send her back.
Can you help me?
And the commode?
Do we get another update for the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, they've already been sitting on the #PRS_ORG# chairs
If I don't, I'd be satisfied with a leave or voucher.
I may find a buyer for the furniture.
Only more than 1,000 euros for goods I don't need then a little bit.
I just received my delivery and would have liked to know if screws were intended as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) to the intended hooks.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time has not paid off
Is there a premium customer status with you?
Iran sees progress in negotiations on nuclear agreements
In the negotiations on the revitalisation of the international nuclear agreement, progress is being made according to Iranian data.
“Both sides are about to turn to the topics to be on the agenda,” said Iran’s chief negotiator Ali Bagheri on Sunday of the Irna News Agency.
This was a \"positive and important development\" because at first there was no agreement on the subjects to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday the Vienna talks for the renewal of the agreement continued after just a week of interruption.
The negotiations include negotiators of Iran, Germany, Great Britain, China, France and Russia.
A U.S. delegation is also in place in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overholstered Saxony - Free State now Germany with highest Corona incidence
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence in Germany.
As the only federal country, the value is above the mark of 1000.
As the only federal country, Thuringia has been located at the Corona Incident on Sunday above the 1000 brand.
The Robert Koch Institute reported the seven-day figure with 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had always had the highest incidence across Germany, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had fallen slightly, but had also exceeded the value of 1000.
Within a day in Thuringia, 2242 new infections were reported with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 other deaths related to an infection.
200 severe covid-19 patients were treated intensively in hospitals on Sunday.
On weekends, there may be notice delays.
In addition, the health offices have been overloaded for weeks and are barely behind with the inclusion of new cases.
I understand.
Since delivery takes place in early March, it may be possible until then.
I have to print it and stick to the package and post it at the post office, that was right?
I don't have to click/determine anything here?
That's why I'm writing to you.
I would like to take over the return at my own expense.
8 euro Return fee is in my eyes a frivolity.
It's time for change
###MBundestag greets me, I am u/StratorDE in the Plenary Hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
#What's the post here for?
If you look at the activity in the past few months of the MBundestag, you can see one thing: It is non-existent.
We came into a winter bar and extended the summer hole to several months.
#Where's the problem?
Yeah, what's the matter with that?
For the most part, this should simply be related to dissatisfaction, as some things have gone wrong here and as we generally stand.
In recent days, the impression has increased that many really still have Bock on the MFederal Day.
#What we need to change
At this point, the community is asked about the MBundestag which wants to keep them alive.
The start came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in the last few days and has found one, simply said, sheer heaps.
After some writing down and rewriting, several people from the community have found themselves interested in rebuilding the project.
However, I would also like to call again on all to participate, only in this way can this project exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a discord server on which we can exchange each other and work out concrete things.
You can join the server via this link.
Objectives:
* How will the MBundestag work in the future?
* What existing orders need to be changed / modified / removed?
* How are we to appear to the outside in the future?
* How to apply for new members?
* How do we create a fair electoral system?
I'm pretty sure I forgot some things, but that's not bad, so we end up with the discord.
If you want and have time, get on the discord, work with us and let us decide democratically on the future.
I have ordered a lamp screen from you that is still delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/clumpy for that and not suitable for my taste.
For that I have already ordered a different suspension with you.
I put it together and then noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope this will be returned and I have a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have one more question: the day cover #PRS_ORG#, is it also in excess size, so in 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee that the faulty cabinet is picked up in time.
And I ask you now to make that happen.
I don't have an appropriate packaging, but as far as possible the cabinet will disassemble for the collection - they have to clear with #PRS_ORG# how this can work then.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me at any time by telephone to agree on a pick-up date.
Is there a guide for assembly?
How long would I have time to get these or decide to return?
How do you answer the question, why are you vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I like.
She herself has lived vegetarian for a while, but at the moment it is also quite rare to eat meat.
I myself was a vegetarian some years ago.
On the question of whether I always wanted to be vegan and vegetarianism was a planned intermediate, I answered honestly without much thought.
And though I thought for a long time that I would support the animal welfare as a vegetarian, I somehow reflected and understood that I was ultimately supporting animal torture.
So my decision to become vegan.
At the moment I had the impression that there was a lack of courage on her side, she then defended vegetarianism and meant that she knew where her flesh was coming from and that one would be reduced as a vegetarian animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer to \"plump\" was?
How do you answer the question?
Have the feeling that as a vegan you are quickly put into a corner and conflicts arise without you putting it on it.
It greets a harmoniously-loving vegan (;
It is clearly not an exception under § 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not remove you from the statutory requirements for remote deployment.
I am on the assigned date where #PRS_ORG# does not collect my returns on site.
Since I can't be on the spot because of a funeral, I'm sorry I can't change that.
Please allow me to assign an alternative pick-up date.
From 01.02.#NUMBER# I am constantly coming again.
Lahnsteiner Wehr für Wasserretung gewarnt: 45,000 Euro grant from the country
Recently, Rhineland-Palatinate Minister of Interior Roger Lewentz at the Lahnstein City Hall issued an award of EUR 45,000 for the new equipment car Water Rescue of the Voluntary Firehr Lahnstein to Mayor Peter Labonte.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, was EUR 135,000.
A good and important investment in security.
I am pleased that the country Rhineland-Palatinate supports us in this - says Lahnstein's mayor Peter Labonte.
The machine car is used by the diver staff Lahnstein, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Over and under water, they perform tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, we are constantly expecting increasing efforts: The boom of hotel shipping on Rhein and Mosel, as well as the increasing use of the Lahn as a recreational flow, contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% and then started the problems.
I can't open the book.
However, her recommendations have been followed, removed and the app reloaded NOTS has worked.
I am somewhat frustrated because the whole action has taken me a lot of time and now I hope for help.
Okay, that's it.
I would like to order 3 items from the collection of #PRS_ORG# to June.
Can I enter an appointment in the ordering process?

Thank you for putting the whole thing here, I also spent almost a decade in the civil service in a similar activity, we were also gunmen in the executive, and I don't want to go on that!
I always find the question of the right and the left very simplified.
In principle, however, one should say that, of course, the civil servant comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum rather than from the revolutionary left, that should actually be clear to everyone.
Of course, that even in the special uniform and gun carrier people should be drawn to the right of conservative magic, everyone should be aware that these people can, of course, deal hard with the lived reality, of course, because you have, of course, the average white, now many Germans with migrant background, women and also homosexuals (and that is why I don't mean the exaggerated feminine clichés, because in the executives there are rather fewer to none but quite normal men and women to whom one can't tell it to one) and I have to rely on these people, because in doubt they save your life or put it in for you.
But these marginal groups also represent even if for the first time it sounds funny to my experience of a conservative attitude, speak proudly of Germany and feel rather less drawn up by exaggerated left politics, even if this policy is supposed to be used for them, or if it means right to them, they simply want to be treated quite normally.
Back to the right, since, of course, police and armed forces are also a cross-section of society, you will also find extreme rights there, but they may openly say their opinion there or even openly avoid any state-threatening plans that are medially exaggerated and upset me as well.
Of course, police officers and soldiers who were often in foreign use often start to flatten out because of negative experiences and also say things that are controversial to politically incorrect.
It is also true that even right-wing people who engage in an active exchange of thoughts are likely to meet.
Nevertheless, what I think is well combated and also countered with political education and education!
Germany is so very internationally strangled and that is also good in my opinion that we could not afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks at all!
Yes, I don't understand, the other basket I ordered on the German side.
Why would this come from England?
When I ordered it, it wasn't sold out.
I ordered it in November.
But it has been confirmed to me so in your confirmation of the order
It is still about my order that is no longer available.
I chatted with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, you could still supply the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# Euro in black to Germany or this basket is available somewhere in Germany.
I always find you as a partner company.
But at the top of the edge of the wood part are two deep candles filled with something yellow

Ordinarily by child?
Hello, me (w32) has been working one thing for a long time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work, (be self-employed, very little leisure), but for my life I get worse than right to lead my household permanently clean and orderly.
There are always phases in which everything remains, and then and when it packs me and I space and put it.
But it's never actually like this, that someone could come to visit spontaneously.
My husband isn't any better either, it bothers me somewhere but most of the time, I just lose my household against work and disillusionment.
The kitchen is cleaned at the most regular since we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you managed to get more orderly with child?
We haven't worked on it yet, and I've been dealing with this issue for a long time.
Because for me I have no incentive, it just doesn't bother me so much, as long as no visit comes and, for example, always fresh clothes are there and the kitchen can be used.
Do you have a bigger incentive with your child or do you stay sloppy?
Look forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, and high-quality and anatomically pre-formed cut, offers a maximum of comfort, a perfect fit and thus allows an almost unlimited freedom of movement.
Pre-formation with special, further embossing on the joints for improved freedom of movement (in arms and knees)
For Focea Comfort 4, the area covered by the Flex System was more than doubled in Flex System 2 to further increase comfort.
Seamless stretch panels on the joints reduce friction (axles, arm and knee bends)
High quality pre-forms in the lower back area and in step ensure a tight, perfect seat.
Elaskin 8.8 Stretch panel in the longitudinal vertebral area increases flexibility around the back zipper and thus improves comfort, especially when bending and mounting the equipment on the surface.
The Free Flex zone around the shoulders and back is guaranteed increased flexibility in movements of the arms and back.
Fireskin is a heating, water repellent material with a special surface structure that offers a high degree of cooling protection.
Positioned on the chest, it brings heat to a sensitive area of the body.
Seamless, thin (-2 mm) seal on the face of the hood increases the comfort, sealability and durability (separate headgear)
Soft zone, located in the collar, improves the sealation with a finely adjustable wide adjustment through a flexible, gentle cladding seal that is not attached to the casket or to the seams
Double manskets with zipper on arm and foot joints combine an envelopeable inner mansket with a soft, boxed neoprene outer mansket
45° indentation at the closing of the inner cuffs for increased elasticity and loadability when dressing.
Long zipper on the neck with an elaskin reinforcement, for an anatomical cut with increased comfort at the overall without hood
Long G-Lock P back zipper (overall without hood) with metal sliders and integrated water dam system for improved sealing (beuchat patent)
Zippers on arms and legs
Neoprene reinforcements at all ends of the zippers to prevent zipping if excessive force is applied.
Neoprene panels bonded with outer and inner overlap
Edges of the outer manslets embossed for greater loadability
Edges of inner manskets carved for increased flexibility
The original Beuchat system was designed to fix the computer in its place, especially at deeper dives (the system is compatible with all common bracelet computers)
Careers in social work - as someone with a self-insecure personality disorder?
I have been training in the area of software development and have been learning for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I remember more and more that this profession is not the right thing for me, which is why I have been thinking for a long time about starting up again and studying social work.
The problem: I have a self-insecure (or anxiously avoidable) personality disorder (EVPS).
This roughly means that I don't have a feeling of self-worth and therefore am shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a professional level, but I find it very difficult to conduct casual conversations and I have been told more often that I am acting incomparably (although I think this has already become better).
Can I be a social worker like that?
I do not want to work as a streetworker or in the open youth meeting, but rather in, for example, search counseling or family assistance.
But I don't know if the concrete working day really is the way I imagine it is, and it's hard to find something on the internet.
The EVPS is already causing problems in my job (for me, emotionally), because every time I have something to do with my code, it's going to be the easiest thing to do, and it's hard for me to ask more experienced colleagues for help, \"I really need to know for myself what it's like to do, but I'm really going to stop him with my stupid questions from working--/\"he really has to think I'm going to be less-occupied, etc.).
I will probably have the problems in every profession, but I wanted to have mentioned it instead.
But you've already recovered the sofa?
Because there was no confirmation of this either.
I'm waiting for an appointment to pick up
What do you mean, give it back?
If I have downloaded a book on the #PRS_ORG#, the message your #PRS_ORG# does not authorize this book
Are there any problems?
I was in chat with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my cabinet.
The protein (protein) taken with the feed is broken down into the individual protein (amino acids) by the bird in its stomach intestinal tract and, from this, it builds up its own protein substances, which it also needs to feed.
The feeding of the nestling and the feeding of the vulture are extremely complex processes, and the overall organism of the animal is associated with a particularly high stress.
Please note that NECTON-Bio must not be administered during breeding, as it may otherwise cause disturbances in the breeding process.
Following this curative administration of NECTON-Bio, once again for daily vitamin supply with NECTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NECTON-MSA (mineral substance preparation).

1 g NECTON-Bio to 250 ml of water or 100 g of soft food.
It is only recommended to prepare as much drinking water/water feed as the bird consumes daily and to change water/food daily.
A scraped measuring spoon (inlined) corresponds to 1 g NECTON-bio.
In cases of severe feeding damage, the double or triple dose of NECTON bio may be given at first, until the approach to feeding re-formation is visible.
After that, the normal dose is achieved until the foetal retraining is fully completed.
Storage: NECTON-Bio should be stored dry without sun exposure, between 15° and 25°C.
Please excuse them, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair go broken after 9 months?
The guarantee claims in Germany are 24 months.
This is really very bad service.
Hello, I sent an e-mail on Monday to announce that my order has arrived damaged and images have been attached.
Did you receive this email?
Statement by a community employee in opposition to the Statute
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
On our property a walnut tree is to be liked.
So, case application made to the municipality.
An employee writes to me that the fall of fruit trees and thus also the walnut is not part of the set.
In the Statute, however, the walnut is explicitly indicated as a tree to be protected.
Can I rely on the employee's statement now or not?
On the one hand, I have to be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the wording is clear.
Thank you for your answers.
We understand that.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I did not receive a message
Well, I still have a sofo without use.
Could you offer me a discount or a voucher?
What was more expensive?
Yes, I think that is just the question whether I can pay in euro and let myself deliver the blanket to Germany.
Can you check that?
Rapid response: heavy traffic accidents in self
A major traffic accident recently occurred on St. 2179 between the junction site of Selb-Nord and Plößberg.
As the police's press alarm currently announced (14:03 p.m.), a car came into counter traffic while taking over.
There are injured people.
Ah okay, understand.
Well, then many thanks again that it was so easy!
Council and ideas on further professional life
For the first time in your life, Christmas!
My Christmas, unfortunately, is moderately good because my dear head is thinking about everything you can think of.
Before I pick up here .. in short: I need advice and the best of people who somehow know my situation - so of you.
I'm just going to make the ref as a crossover.
I originally studied something else and also worked there in an area (to stay at least a little anonymous, I don't call anything more precise here).
But the whole thing was too boring for me, and I looked at alternatives that could make me more fun.
At some point I landed at the teaching office and was sure that it is - even though the conditions are clearly more inflexible than in my previous profession, but that didn't matter to me.
I have now arrived at the third google other job invitations.
And it's only half a year around.
In my paintings before that, I always decided to continue and at least finish the ref, after which I can still swing around.
But I'm absolutely finished right now.
I had so little free time last month that I was completely exhausted.
Now are vacations, but there's still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the ref, I always thought I was stress resistant, but there was my weekend and my holiday evening.
I was free.
And the stress at work didn't matter in the moments.
Now the family celebration is too much stress for me myself.
And then there are these rigid structures that make me nervous.
Basically it is fun and from the outside viewed the Ref also runs well with regard to feedback and so on.
But I'm completely exhausted and wonder how much stress my body holds out before it closes completely - if he doesn't do it right now.
I wonder if I would like this to have the rest of my working life like this - especially if I read some contributions from you here - or if I shouldn't go back to the old area where I was valued, could take free time if I needed them, and found the work somehow boring, but was appropriately paid for and worked together in a team that didn't work as a single fighter as it is now most of the time.
But then I wonder if I have not arrived again in one year at the same place as I am now and is not satisfied.
You know, it's all kind of werre, but maybe you've come out as an outside counsel or ideas, like I'm out of this situation that I'm completely finished and almost at the smallest thought of crying about it.
I'm not going to make decisions that emotionally right now, which probably leads to nothing good.
But perhaps your views help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for me to get first.
Thank you for reading and apologise for the whimsical undertone of me.
I hope my situation has become at least a little clear.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series of VOX has been constantly developing, which has led, among other things, to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the \"Valve Reactor\" structure, with which the behaviour of a tube amplifier is perfectly re-trained.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we present a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely up-to-date in terms of sound.
Thanks to VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of the components and amp shells, the VTX amplifiers are waiting with an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
These amps also naturally contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because they simply get the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuit, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system from which the natural resonances are merely spruttering.
With the “Tone Room” software from VOX, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and the effects sound as you have always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology presented in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then to meet new sound requirements, which has again led to a performance shift of the VOX Valvetronix series in 2010 - with more dynamics as well as numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series was also designed in such a way that all guitarists will be found here in search of a maximum sound variety.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a bold sound, a nuanced playback of game dynamics and string strokes as well as a prompt speech.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers have discovered that the final stage primarily determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The Valve Reactor endurance of each VT+ amplifier, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, is a perfect behavior, subtle nuances and the sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic Loses at Clippers
The defeat series of Orlando Magic in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - to win the Los Angeles Clippers, however, it is not enough.
Despite 20 points by Franz Wagner and seven counters by his older brother Moritz, Magic lost 104:106 on Saturday at the Los Angeles Clippers.
The large main compartment is also customizable: with three individually spaced and foldable cladding parts it is designed to meet the needs of your photo equipment and is therefore suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-format mirror cameras.
Of course, what ultimately fits into the backpack depends on the size of the camera and the lenses.
A possible fitting would be a DSLR camera with a mounted lens, two to three alternate lenses and a flashing flash.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the different models of the Sony-a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 leave room for more lenses.
You can also store a lot of accessories.
And whoever has a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-Series) can use the backpack for his equipment and for photo-foreign things.
Drone pilots also make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, because the backpack provides enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcano eruption on La Palma: probably longest of history
In the nearly three months since the outbreak, the lava flows on the Canary Islands have caused great damage.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days in between, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the famous history of the Spanish Canary Islands since Sunday.
The eruption of Tehuya in 1585 with 84 days was considered to be the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
No reliable data are available on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still nameless volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has declined somewhat in recent days, but volcanologists still do not dare to predict when it could end.
The indicators indicate a slowing down.
The best news is that they are stable - said the President of the Island Council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, the state TV broadcaster RTVE.
Millions of damage
In the nearly three months since the outbreak, the over 1000 degree hot lava has destroyed almost 2900 homes and other buildings, as RTVE reported.
Nearly 1200 hectares were covered by a thick layer of lava.
This corresponds to almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7,000 residents had to be evacuated, the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
On the coast, cold lava created two new landscapes with a total size of about 50 hectares.
In particular, the important banana cultivation for the island, of which about half the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly, was affected and which was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, further areas severely affected, wrote the newspaper \"El País\"
Christmas and the Gifts
Christmas is on the doorstep, and especially the children will hardly be able to wait for the heavenly feast.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have been associated with the spiritual atmosphere and the crushing tension somewhat seductive in themselves.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still hold our increasingly divided society together.
It is all the more important to be aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which, according to French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss, has been a peace-building “social treaty of natural peoples,” has been the stark routine and can be filled with life in the context of this tradition.
How Nikolaus became a Christian child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants through whom Christmas days were closely associated with the gift.
Previously, gifts were handed over in one way or another on Nikolaus Day.
The background of this still popular practice is that Saint Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, secretly threw three women into her window one night to save them another life in sin.
From this unconventional form of giving, the custom popular in Germany was to fill the boots with gifts, especially the children.
Protestants are at odds with this custom because they reject mediators between God and men as “holy worship. ”
For these reasons, they protect themselves against the institution.
Martin Luther made the Christian child from Nikolaus and thus established a new tradition line.
The focus of the gift shifted to the Holy Evening.
However, since most Protestants no longer see such detailed questions so closely, it is only the least upset that the custom of Saint Nicholas, like Martinssingen's use of Martinssingen and Martin's conversion, is still an integral part of the pre-Christmas.
Today you can find in boots in front of the door and under the Christmas tree from socks to coveted luxury watches all that the heart desires.
Diversity of traditions in Christian countries
Sources show a tradition of giving since the 13th century on the day of Saint Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the Day of Gift shifted to Holy Evening.
In all Christian lands, however, there is a joyful cuddle about the question of who is now bringing the gifts to the children.
In Germany it depends on the respective region whether the Christian Child appears on the Holy Evening, or the Santa Claus, which is basically a type of Nikolaus, which in time has been assigned some particulars.
This includes, for example, its white noise bar, which has little in common with the rather strict Assyrian bar of the historical figure, its sleds drawn by pensioners and the preference of the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nikolaus remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain, the Holy Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana, who will have shown them the way to the Son of Jesus.
In Scandinavia, sometimes fables bring gifts, while in Russia it brought fathers' frost to some glory.
Here it is not reindeer, but three horses that pull its sled as troika.
In the Czech Republic, the mother country of the Reformation in the course of the Hussite Wars, the Christian Child is responsible for handing over the gifts.

Police shoot suspected bank robbers near the King's Palace
Near the Kensington Palace in London, an armed man was shot by the police on Saturday.
The police told us that callers had reported a man who was going to a bank with a gun and a bookmaker's business.
The man fled in a vehicle according to the authorities, which could be stopped by officials a little later.
The shots had fallen, and the man had been hit.
He was still declared dead at the crime scene.
The police didn't go from a terrorist background.
Several embassies are located in the area around the Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and the three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
Which one?

The decorative luminaire fits harmoniously into each beet, garden area or stone garden.
The lamp is simply set up and can be anchored with 2 earthy feet in the ground.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 Watt Solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Lighting time max. 10 hrs.
- The robust plastic can be used in the outdoor area all year round.
In the Hollywood spectacle it is mostly threatening objects from distant galaxies that glow internally colored.
On the other hand, »Smart Stone« is completely harmless: the sun alone ensures that this solar light shines fascinatingly - optionally in white or colored light (in at least six different shades of color).
The edgeless, amorphous design is consciously chosen: Like a naturally shaped large pebble, this modern light object is presented by day.
Its organic rounds fit in any natural environment - whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the stone beet.
He also makes himself good in the neighborhood of larger pebbles and findlings, where he knows to claim thanks to his size.
Great preliminary work can be saved: As a solar lamp, »Smart Stone« does not require either supply or batteries.
Set the \"lightstone\" at any day of the sun's apparent place.
Two co-supplied earth sprays ensure firm holding if necessary.
The matt-white plastic case itself is robust and weatherproof.
His solar module hides »Smart Stone« discreetly inside, together with its battery and two LEDs - one for white, the other for colored light.
The battery already charges when sunlight falls on the housing.
In the event of a break-in dusk, »Smart Stone« starts to shine on its own; in which color, you determine: Six attractive colours of light are available for your choice next to daylight.
The switch off also takes place automatically as soon as the battery load level is lowered to a specified minimum or it becomes bright again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle begins the next day from the front.
I've done that several times. It doesn't work.
Too bad, I would have liked to have ordered further from you, but if the voucher isn't charged to me, I'm not going to order it in principle.
If you think otherwise, you'll let me know.
Otherwise, this was the last contact today.

Pilling problem
Hello dear women's people,
I hope I do everything right here, after a year of reddit is actually my first post.
To my problem: I started taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had such incredibly bad pains during the period and shit PMS before the period.
Now I'd like to keep it back, because I have to take enough medication due to chronic diseases that I can't choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I've had a two-year break from 0 to 100 explosion-like pickles and these all over the world.
As far as the surface is concerned, but I've been quite burdened by this and I didn't feel well.
During the two years break, the whole thing never really normalized.
Maybe anyone has any tips to avoid this time.
Perfume-free and without gedöns is my cosmetics already, but maybe there's what someone can recommend to me.
Unfortunately, my wife doctor didn't take me so seriously and I'm still getting a skin doctor's appointment.
Many love thanks to everyone who has read through the novel!
Yes, the love of skin is such a new thing.
Had pre-bupertary bad neurodermitis, then a time rest, then large-scale knee fold and the acne theme.
Food I also tried everything possible in the course of chr. disease and hung on no sugar, milk and low-fat mixed food because otherwise nothing worked so well.
It can also be good that hormonally simply the worm is in, but if you like me to have a construction site anywhere you'd rather not go looking for anything else that's still going wrong.
I already had everything from her colleague semina o. ä.
Written and now I have lost the conversation and I don't know what was answered to my concerns.
I have to work in between and on the phone, and suddenly everything was gone...
What's there to check if the money was there, I'd have seen it
Please check my bank data, maybe there was something wrong
But there is it generally in large
because it is available in black size

110 kV Earth cable is being rebuilt in 2022
The permit for the installation of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is enforceable.
The government's plan-fixing decision of Lower Bavaria opens the way for construction to begin in 2022.
This was now shared by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The seven-kilometre-long ground cable will connect Tann's re-station in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable is connected near the village of Edermanning at Reut to a mast of the line.

Ref: Planning lessons (EC)
Hello, ladies and gentlemen,
I've been in the Ref since summer, teaching is fun, but I currently have big problems time-efficiently planning my teaching in the field of Earth Science.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well equipped, so I can basically only use the board, the school book and an OHP as a medium.
In school, I can also only copy s/w for free (which is annoying for earth science).
I just need a very long time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently making the topic of geofactors, and I am actually standing for each hour.
In principle, the methods always repeat themselves, but on the other hand, I also do not want to invest too much time for simple lessons (which I also need for UBs, etc.).
In planning, I always go from the learning goal (what I want to achieve) and then consider how I can build it (most of the time I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have).
We have the book Terra and with most tasks in the book I'm rather unhappy.
This is why the worksheets are also available.
Maybe I can get an Earth Science teacher on how to work time-efficiently with the book.
I'd be really happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from order #NUMBER#.
I've actually decided on a new one at #PRS_ORG#, but I'd be happy to make the return as soon as possible.
Trade fears about Christmas business because of the 2G regulation.
In most businesses only those who are vaccinated or cured are allowed to do so.
Trade considers this unnecessary and accuses sales breakdowns.
It also has a possible solution.
From the point of view of the German Trade Association (HDE), the 2G regulations are ruining the important Christmas business for retail trade.
In the case of transactions with articles of non-dayly need, sales would have to be broken down, criticised HDE head of business Stefan Genth.
According to a current survey by the HDE of 1100 dealers, more than 70 percent of the companies looked negatively at the remaining days of the year.
Many would have already written off the Christmas business.
“What should actually be the positive peak of the year is now often a hole without soil,” Genth said.
Thus, dealers with 2G access restrictions lost almost a third of their pre-crisis revenues in the past week.
Well, it's only in food retail as well as online.
The association called for consequences from dramatic development.
Purchasing with mask, distance and hygiene is a safe matter, said the chief manager.
“2G when shopping doesn’t bring us any further in the fight against the pandemic,” he stressed.
The current regulations deterred customers and required high personnel use.
It called for the approval of the bond scheme throughout the country.
After that, each customer only had to be checked on 2G (impacted or cured) once and had access to all stores with the obtained tape that day.
In addition, sampling controls should be sufficient in retail trade - as already in public transport at the 3G (impacted, cured or tested) rule.
The real estate company Deutsche Euroshop, specializing in shopping centers, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
Last but not least, the frequencies were close to 75 percent of the pre-Corona level, the turnovers being around 90 percent.
These figures will now fall safely in the middle of such important Christmas business - said CEO Wilhelm Wellner of the “Economy Week”
Due to the high human and administrative effort, the Center will try to find and approve solutions.
This included the so-called bond solution, in which visitors can, for example, provide their 2G ID at a central location in the center once and then - equipped with a bracelet similar to that in a club hotel - enter all the stores uninterruptedly - dpa
I recently ordered and delivered the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and on the frame is also a mistake that has been tried with a yellow filler to be cached.
It looks ugly.
I would like to return the mirror and have already packed and glued it back into the package.
How do I have to proceed for the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual-balance based on new flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high colour rendering.
The setting of the colour temperature and brightness of the lamp provides a modern microprocessor with exceptional possibilities.
In addition to adjusting brightness, there are two standard colour temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and store the colour temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in Flash memory.
A special feature of the controller, it is simple and intuitive.
The lamp creates a very light stream with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The beam angle of 120 degrees, with which you can illuminate large areas at relatively small distance is excellent.
By the way, even in reporting situations in small spaces or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It's a great tool to work on the movie set or in the studio.
The DMX512 controller, available at the option, allows remote control of the lamp in TV studios or when the lamp is mounted in hard-to-access locations.
At the back of the lamp is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a shining display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore, there is the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included)
User Memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
In order to perform the settings of the individual settings on the memory locations, one of the memory keys will simply be pressed and finished by pressing longer ones.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when turned off, so that when you turn on, the known situation is back up - Very practical in studio work when, for example, the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Working with battery one of the greatest strengths of DL3120 functionality is due to the possibility of operating with inexpensive NP-F batteries.
These are often already owned by photographers and camera men (and women) - so you can access existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set if the batteries have enough power - it is a battery tester with built-in - for each of the two battery compartments a value in the two display displays (the left battery top display, the right on the bottom display).
In addition, it is of course possible to supply the headlight continuously with electricity over the supplied power supply.
The construction of the headlight is very simple.
You have to attach a 16mm hole as a connection, so you can directly access your phototative.
The inclination should be reliably adjusted by fixing on both sides.
It has been observed that the mechanical components are extremely high-quality and therefore also designed for longevity and hard use.
In addition, a lower joint is included in the delivery range.
Great is that a bag is also included in the delivery.
So you can safely transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you might still want to buy without problems.
Shame, I've been given and she's too small :(
“Party that we wanted to miss”: Frankfurt celebrates touring comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes the last two times in series of victorious Hessen were supposedly on the way to the next Bundesliga valley.
But then the SGE turned on, shot at the frustration within a good hour over an adult season start of the soul and defeated Furios at 5:2. \"It is crazy what the boys have done today - cheered coach Oliver Glasner at DAZN and said a \"pauschal praise, to every single one who was involved.
At first, it looked like a new damper for the now on rank nine, still behind their expectations of Frankfurters.
Patrik Schick had led the Leverkuseners with 2:0.
What happened then impressed the SGE trainer as well.
“When the players returned and showed a fantastic performance, Glasner continued.
I am madly happy with the performance we have shown and of course with the result.
Even defense player Christopher Lenz, who had been on the scene for the first time since the fourth day of the game and his overcome muscle injury, stressed the morality of his teammates.
“I think our mentality is incredibly great,” said the 27-year-old and was delighted with a glance at the result especially for the spectators.
That was the party we wanted to miss today.
However, Glasner wants to keep the focus in mind for the upcoming tasks, but he also sees himself well positioned with regard to the staff situation.
It is extraordinary that we all have players fit in December that all players are physically in a top constitution.
It is top work in our medical department, but also the players live highly professionally.
Now one wants to go “step-by-step and remain modest - and carry out the tasks up to the annual change - at this level -
Next on Wednesday, during the course of the English week, there will be an outplay at Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30 p.m., Sky) on the program.
Grade I get the mail that my package comes back to you due to an error on my part.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and let it redirect, no chance.
Can it be sent back to me right away or do I have to wait until the money is returned and give up the order again?
I'd say, unfortunately, that I'm not going to order again because it's been a long time.
Have they ever been on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Damper for handball women before quarter finals against Spain
After the humiliation against Denmark, Germany's handball women shone with hanging heads and empty views of the parquet.
At 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers, the DHB election took place in the quarter-final and has now to run against host Spain.
“We were far too anxious and had too much respect for the opponent,” said Federal coach Henk Groener.
We must act differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8:2 points as second behind the Danes (10:0).
It's a shame we couldn't take the flow.
This was a bad game by everyone we have to delete - said Captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for entry into the semi-finals, against the 2019 World Cups, a significant increase will have to be made next Tuesday, in order to keep the delicate dream of the first medal alive since 2007.
Best German caster in the duel with the three-time Olympics Denmark was backroom player Alina Griesels with six goals.
“We simply weren’t there - neither in the attack, nor in the defence - Xenia Smits had a backroom player and asked: “We need to look forward quickly now,”
From front to back not at height
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team with the pontiff was not up to date.
Mistakes and technical flaws in the attack and gaps in the defence were responsible for a fast 0:4 backlog after seven minutes.
Only Torfrau Dinah Eckerle was immediately at operating temperature and prevented with some parade slumbers.
The first goal was achieved by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Griesels successfully completed a rapid counter-attack.
However, this was not the expected initial ignition.
Against the aggressive coverage of the Danes, the German women could hardly sit in the scene - and if so, they mostly failed at the strong Althea Reinhardt in the gate of the Scandinavians.
For example, at 3:10, after 20 minutes, the game was run early, especially when backroom player Mia Zschocke saw red due to a hard foul on her opponent.
In the quarter final, however, she is allowed to participate again.
It was only during the final phase of the first half of the season that the DHB selection was a bit better in the game and at least five goals were reached until the break.
The anyway rather quiet hope of a pick-up chase after the change was already after seven minutes at 9:19.
Again, the Greeners sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-trained opponent, who is one of the medal candidates at the final round.
As a result, the German team was no longer able to get up to a performance increase and went as a clear loser from the parquet.
DACH Advent Calendar Day 6: Family traditions in Christmas
As part of the Reddit Advent calendar, we have gathered the Nikolaus Day and take it for the occasion to dedicate ourselves to family traditions in the pre-Christmas, the Advent, Nikolaus, Christmas and Christmas holidays.
How was that home at the time?
How about your partner?
Will you pass on your traditions to your children?
What's best for the kids?
The boots?
Sweepbacks?
Decorating the tree?
Will music be done?
Is the Santa Claus, the Christian child, or is the gift from Grandma and Grandpa?
No matter what you do, everyone is going on and around Christmas trying to have it as nice as a family as possible.
Whether these are solid traditions, or even something else every year: tell us how it happened in your family!
Please send me some transaction number... or anything else that could help me.
Transfer confirmation... etc
I would like to send a voucher code
as with #PRS_ORG# gives vouchers
Is that what they're doing?
The title suggests that I am working as a vaccine in mobile vaccination teams in which (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is vaccinated in nursing homes.
Since these are soon largely finished, in part they will continue to be in vaccination centres for me.
I would like to answer questions without a time limit on the organizational and human aspects and also medical issues, unless they are related to a personal one (e.g., \"I take medication X, this is due to vaccination.\"
In my area of responsibility, the information for vaccination, the indication (person is entitled to vaccination according to Coronaimpfverordnung and no reasons to speak against it), medical documentation and, if necessary, emergency care for allergic reactions (I have never happened before).
The vaccination itself is delegable to qualified personnel, e.g. medical professionals.
In vaccination teams, however, we often do not have any, but \"only\" (for God's sake not a lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for the preparation of vaccines, but who cannot (do not?) perform vaccinations there, so that I carry out most of the vaccinations myself.
Heavy Hidlers Question: Amberger knows the solution
What please is a “huidler”?
This dialect word, sent by an Amberger, has been used in the BR television broadcast “We in Bavaria” for intense reflection.
But unlike many previous days, this time the term remained unresolved by the callers in the \"Host mi\" series.
No, it wasn't a man who's nervous.
And no one, either, who has to go fast,
That, people heard from the TV moderator, was completely wrong.
What the man from Amberg told the solution, and with that probably also in the case of many of the upper stakes, caused surprises.
“The Huidler - the spectators learned, “is a lap with someone wiping out the oven”
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been interviewed by Bavarian television for years as an expert, confirmed this.
With the remark that this is a typical Upper Palatine term, derived somehow from the more well-known word of the word \"Holdern\"
What was closed with an educational gap - probably also with some of those who have lived in the Amberg area for a long time.
I can't buy books for two weeks.
After confirmation, the following error message always comes after the confirmation: ops - someß want wrong - try again later.
I have restarted the #PRS_ORG# gel#PRS_ORG#n, connected to the PC, synchronized and repaired.
Nothing helped.
The wheel- wheel- really so pan-proof?
This morning I woke up full of action, because I wanted to train at least a little in preparation for my bike tour in the next week.
Say, done and I drove off with my race bike I bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40kms were also really beautiful - but then what happened in such every city center (this time: thank you Krefeld!) was lurking.
Glass splitter on the line.
Zack, loud ticks and my back tires didn't want to join the rest of the track at all.
Since I had no real way to get my spare coat and spare hose due to the day of the week, I had to turn around with half the bad mood and take the first train home.
Then it wasn't that bad in the technical field, maybe it's better if I practice this with the tire change again before the bike tour.
Now I'm facing a question and I hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long route over several days in front of me, I would be extremely reluctant to get this problem more often.
Now it really wasn't bad, since the old tyres from the former owner (very nice old man, on the day I picked up the bike I came down the bike was cut 120km away!) and he had already described it as sub-optimal because he had been on roll with them for years.
But if I think that I have to make another change of tyre when driving after 80-90kms, then I think I'm really bad:D
Now I got into the conversation with an older man at the railway station who wondered why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tyres; they should be inflatable.
Now, of course, the whole thing sounds very tempting.
But are these really so uncappable?
I don't want to spend 40€/ripe now, just to be disappointed.
Next, I ask myself: I currently believe on the race bike 25x622.
They are also available (notably?) with the Marathon Plus tyres, but the bulk is even wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you give me a ride to other tyres in general?
The Schwalbe page seems to recommend my absolute! Layer knowledge rather the Durano DD?
Thank you in advance for the help and greetings!
Car slid against tree: driver fatally injured
The 53-year-old was hit on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten with his car for an unexplained cause against a Middle Island and then on the counter-road as the police told him.
There was a frontal collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The 53-year-old's car was then slid against a tree and the man put in the car.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old co-drivers were seriously injured in the accident and brought to nearby hospitals.

After the release of our new High End Broadband B 100-6 OHM, it was just a question of the time until our SOLO series would get young again.
SOLO 15 is called the new spokesling and visually reminds of the great examples with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, this design proposal includes a suitable designed foot directly to raise the speaker to the correct hearing position.
This has no influence on acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the circumstances at home.
The SOLO 15 principle is very well suited for people with a lower volume, but a particularly high level is to be achieved.
A 10 cm speaker is simply unable to produce almost unfiltered such a large sound pressure level.
However, this does not mean that SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, it is remarkably mature and very impressive and accurate for its size.
Tonal the SOLO 15 was matched with a slight high tone rise.
This is generally common in broadbands to optimize the too high frequencies of a much increasing bundle.
The SOLO 15 with very clear and fine sound convinces exactly in the hearing area.
Lightly rotated outwards, the high tone range can be reduced and thus the sound image more warmed.
Thanks to the point sound source, the placement of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is knife sharp and surprisingly precise.
The reference suspects extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM provide a fine dynamic that seeks its same.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but expands it in terms of resolution capacity and accuracy.
As with all our kits, it is recommended at the beginning to think about the final look of the speaker in order to plan appropriate changes during the construction process.
For example, if you want to fire the housings, the lowering of the speaker must be adjusted accordingly, as the furnier re-operates material.
After all the plates have been cut (e.g. in the construction market), you first have to drill an 8 mm hole into the floor plate at the appropriate point to be able to carry the cable through easily.
With the help of an upper mill, the speaker opens in the front so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be used later on.
Rearward this opening should be fitted with a 45° barrel to make the opening surface of the speaker chassis as large as possible inside.
The four screw points of the B 100 - 6 OHM get an interruption in the face, as shown in the picture \"Detail Phase\".
Afterwards you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
The back wall, cover, front and ground are then glued to these.
The three reinforcements should also be used and glued.
The reinforcements themselves can vary in material strength if needed, if, for example, one wants to take on finished performance from the construction market instead of producing them themselves from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second side is attached.
After that follow all the plates of the foot, i.e. the two sides, as well as the front.
The fitting of the openings of the bass reflex tube, as well as the connection clamp on the back wall, is facilitated by a suitable hole circle saw or forstner drill.
Then you use a round miller to round off all the edges of the actual box.
The top of the base can also be rounded.
The base is then glued firmly with the base of the housing and screwed with long wooden screws.
It follows the marking and pre-bore (2.5 mm drills) of the screw points of the speaker chassis and the connector clamp.
After the housing has been cleaned of wood dust (suction / blow-out), one starts laying the cable.
This is most easily achieved by the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back wall.
In doing so, you slide the entire and unshortened cable piece for pieces through the 8 mm drill in the foot to the terminal opening and leave it there about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the case, the cable is led to the speaker opening and also makes it hang out loosely there.
The frequency wave is then prepared and used.
The installation plan of the frequency wave, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be taken from the following document: Installation instructions Soft Solo 15.
When the frequency wave is installed and the connection terminal is screwed, the 8 mm cable opening is closed inside the box, which is not yet completely closed.
Through the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and with some skill, you can drop hot adhesives on the opening and lock them.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp you can check the seal accordingly.
Now the mutilation follows according to description.
The B 100 - 6 OHM is then connected and screwed with the corresponding screws.
The polarity plays an important role in this, so that the plus cable (marked cable) has to be soldered at the speaker's plus pole (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is shortened and inserted to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the pipe).
A mat of the damping material is cut into two parts and loosely distributed in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept free.
Can I give up an order now and have it delivered at the beginning of June?
> Hello and all,
> Finally, we can announce that we will be organizing the OSCAST again this year!
> Unfortunately, for known reasons, it is not possible for us to get more than four people into the studio, which means a higher planning effort and explains the short term nature of the announcement.
ABER: There will be at least three people per switch, so that we will track the Oscars in 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delay or other problems.
But hey, it's still pandemic - yet we'll give everything to accompany the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
> It will start at 0:30.
If you already have drinks cold, plan good food and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
