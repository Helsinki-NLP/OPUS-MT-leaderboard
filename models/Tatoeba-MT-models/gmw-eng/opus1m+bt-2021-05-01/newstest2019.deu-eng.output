DFB-Chief Grindel sees no basis for Özil-Comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for a return from Mesut Özil to the national team.
“This is a question that depends, of course, on one’s getting into the conversation, that one also talks to him about why he has apparently felt this one or another as it is stated in his statement,” said Grindel in the football podcast “Phrasenmäher” the “image newspaper.
Despite the debate over the photos of Özil with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regretted the resignation of the 92-fold national player Özil.
“I would have liked Mesut Özil to continue playing for Germany.
I also assumed that this would be the case until a certain point in time, said Grindel.
The 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team in July and also justified him by not defending Grindel against racist attacks during the World Cup.
The DFB chief reiterated his criticism of Özil that he was not ready for a conversation with German coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn't want to build any pressure, but he knew it from football so that if you leave a team or change a club, you talk to his coach about it, and I'm sorry that this conversation hasn't happened so far,
Linz: Garden cottage in Schrebergartensiedlung brannte
At 2.13 p.m., Linz's professional firearm was alarmed to a fire in the Angererhofweg.
Because a high-voltage line leads directly across the Schreberg species settlement, danger was in delay.
The professional firefighter sprang up and found the hut in full fire at the entrance.
The roof had to be practically removed to complete and fire sheltered to the absolute extent necessary.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut, he had put a battery to the store at lunchtime.
That might be the cause of the fire.
In any case, the charger according to firefighter was in the area of the greatest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire still needs to be determined - as well as the cause of the fire.
However, he is likely to be considerable, as the owner had many collectible items in his garden hut.
Angry mother resists: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on open street
What did Lindsay Lohan have to do with this extremely strange action?
She apparently wanted to extermine the children to a supposed refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, \"Herbie: Fully Loaded\" has even flown live, as it seems to a family in Moscow wants to escape the children.
This reports the U.S. portal \"TMZ\" and publishes a partial share of the stream.
Here you can see \"Kissed for Happiness\" with Lindsay Lohan
In the clip you can see Lohan getting out of a car and going to a homeless family that she wants as a refugee family from Syria.
When the family flees just before the actress, Lohan chases the parents and their children.
She accuses adults of engaging in child trafficking.
For all this, she doesn't provide evidence in the clip.
“The whole world sees this right now — Lohan is listening to the video as she continues to follow the family along the road.
She obviously tries to separate the children from her parents.
At some point, however, it seems to the apparently angry mother to be enough.
It looks like she's turning around and Lohan's missing an eardrum.
While tearing, the actress then exasperates how shocked she is - and she keeps her cheek.
What has moved Lohan to this action is now completely unclear.

The state of Macedonia will be called North Macedonia in the future and the population will vote on this Sunday - is it okay?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populists Bolsonaro.
\"Ele Nao\" means \"The Not\"\" is Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before the presidential election in Brazil, the mood was divided in the country.
Thousands went to the streets in several cities to protest against the right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.

His sharpest competitor is Fernando Haddad of the Left Workers Party.
Audi: “Dieselgate processing takes longer than planned
“The Diesel Task Force is still in existence,” said Development Officer Peter Mertens in the \"Automobile Week\" industry magazine
In December 2017, the imprisoned and retired Audi chief Rupert Stadler had announced that the task force will soon be dissolved.
\"In the first quarter of 2018, all motor/drive combinations were expected to be tested, he had said at that time.
Mertens now said: “At the beginning of July we reached an important stage goal in the processing of the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The task force was founded in September 2015 after the discovery of the diesel scandal at the Audi-Mutter Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the car builder has made “gravating organizational changes” so that such a scandal never occurs again.
On Friday the VW Supervisory Board had postponed a decision on Stadler's future and will continue to discuss this Tuesday.
The investigative authorities shall order the Audi Chief to have authorised the sale of diesel cars with false exhaust values after being informed of the exhaust frauds.
He knew about the manipulations or deliberately ignored them.
Currently, Bram Schot is head of the company as CEO of the Board of Directors.
Due to the change to the new WLTP exhaust and consumption testing standard, production failures occurred at Audi, Schot said the “Heilbronster Voting”
In principle, he sees a falling demand for limousines such as the Audi models A6, A7 and A8 produced in Neckarsulm.
“The segment in itself is difficult - he said.
Schot relies on electric mobility.
For the e-tron, the first Audi electric car, we already have 15,000 reservations.
Grindel strives to re-election - Lahm to go to the DFB Bureau
Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel, despite his criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair, wants to run for the office again next year as DFB President.
“I’m doing my job and trying to make them as good as I can,” said Grindel as a guest at ZDF’s “Current Sports Studio” early Sunday morning.
You always have to make a re-election, I will.
And then you have to check if the support is there.
The head of the association found it very interesting, in his own words, if, after the grant for the football EM 2024, he would not have ‘loust to cooperate in the future project’,
Since April 2016 Grindel has been head of the Association since the fall of Wolfgang Niersbach over the summer fairy tale.
In autumn 2016, he was elected for a first full term of three years.
The next vote will be taken at the DFB Bundestag on 27 September 2019.
The future EM Chief Organizer Philipp Lahm is to cooperate in the DFB Bureau, according to Grindel.
\"I would be pleased if my colleagues in the Bureau agreed that in this role he would also consult with the Bureau in the future and would, of course, be cordially invited to provide his experience on sporting matters,\" said Grindel.
In speculation whether Lahm could become his successor as DFB chief, he did not want to participate.
As a consequence of the affair around the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that in future a national player without a migration background should become integration ambassadors of the DFB.
Currently, this office is performing Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, the latter has family roots in Cameroon.
“If someone has a significant impact on society and football without a migratory background, and says, “the issue is important, we need to take care of it, that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our associations on the ground where integration needs to work,” said Grindel.
Take off properly with semi-clear scale
I've had a new toy for four weeks.
A scale that not only measures my weight, but also the amount of body fat.
It can also show muscle and bone mass.
The body mass index calculates the thing as well, but it is more for the sausage.
He doesn't say anything about whether I replaced fat with muscles.

Berlin - ALBA Berlin has been launched with a clear victory in the new season of the Basketball Bundesliga.
The Vice Master won the Science City Jena easily with 112:55 (52:31) and offered a convincing party over 40 minutes.
New entry Rokas Giedraitis was the top scorer of the dominant Berliners with 20 points.
The national player Johannes Thiemann (18Zähler) from Ludwigsburg also showed an appealing performance before 9113 spectators at his mandatory game debut.
Ex-master Brose Bamberg won the Mandatory Game debut of Trainer Ainars Bagatskis with 84:80 (39:37) at s.Oliver Würzburg.

A 26:1 run of the Baskets quickly provided clear conditions.
Erdoğan opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier on his three-day visit.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan called on the German government to deliver live followers of the Gülen movement in Germany and take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens - no matter where they live.
We will not allow sympathisers of the PKK or Gülen movement to shock our citizens and harm the German-Turkish friendship, he said.
For the opening of the Ditib mosque, the city centre of Cologne had been partially blocked.
Several thousand police officers were in action - among them also sharp-shadows.
The Islam Association of Ditib is critical because it is regarded as an extended arm of the Turkish government.
Global Citizen Festival: Music Against Poverty: Stars, Buhruphe and Horrorsecond
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have won a joint concert at the New York Central Park for more commitment in the fight against poverty and disease.
\"Rejoice wherever you can only - said Mendes at the festival at night to Sunday in front of 60.0000 spectators.
Thank you for coming here, that's a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with fringes and golden microphone.
I'm nervous, I'm sweating, but it's okay, because I'm here and ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and aid organizations were also on stage at the multi-hour spectacle.
In the meantime, however, there was a horror second when many spectators held the sound of a falling metal barrier for shots, got scared, and tried to escape.
In short, panic arose, people ran into each other.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, said the organizer Hugh Evans.
However, New York police and musician Chris Martin calmed people down from the stage.
“No one tries to hurt anyone,” Martin said.
You're all safe.
Tickets for the “Global Citizen Festival” concert were available free of charge on the Internet as every year.
Anyone who wanted to make an effort had to read and disseminate texts, photos and videos on the global struggle against poverty and disease on the Internet.
For the numerous musicians and actors there was joy and applause from the audience - Buhruffe on the other hand for Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
Although he spoke together with his democratic colleague Chris Coons on stage for more equality between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake had spoken out at the Justice Committee of the U.S. Senate for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a judge at the Supreme Court and thus had many women kicked off her head.
At least three women have filed abuse allegations up to attempted rape against Kavanaugh, which he rejects.
Flake called for an FBI investigation of the allegations, after confronting two women who had experienced sexual assaults themselves on the way to the committee meeting in an elevator.
“You can also come along with me in an elevator at any time,” said Flake at the concert in New York.
Freedom of the press: Federal Government defends the journalist's refusal
The government spokesman Steffen Seibert defended the robbery of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
In the chancellor's office, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription \"Freedom for Journalists\" and had gone into the first row.
The T-shirt, hadn't been the problem, Seibert said the picture on Sunday.
This was a disruption of the running of the press conference.
The journalist’s action created a strong unrest, which was unacceptable.
That is why he caused people's protectors to bring the man out.
Seibert said that it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellor's Office.
This applies entirely regardless of whether it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
Many journalists are in prison in Turkey.
Many of them are accused of espionage or support or membership in prohibited parties or the Fethullah Golden Movement.
The Turkish leadership makes the movement responsible for the failed coup on July 15, 2016.
Some of the accused journalists threaten several decades of imprisonment.
Foreign journalists are also not safe from the Turkish authorities: it was not until early September that Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested.
Finally, the cases of the imprisoned journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel had caused a lot of excitement.
Although they came free and were able to return to Germany, in Turkey they still have processes against the two.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
His fans usually know him so fresh and well-looking: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look at it twice: Yes, that's really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show “Inas Nacht” produced by the NDR is known for moist-frozen conversations at the library of Hamburg’s Hafenkneepe - Shellfish Posts.
Moderator Ina Müller, with her guests, attacks some beer, some wine, or even more high-percent drinks, in order to stimulate the mood and tongues.
Not a few vows also take courage for the obligatory singing inputs.
On Friday another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time, the actor Florian David Fitz is famous for films such as, men's hearts, 'terror', your judgment, or 'The coolest day'.
The Münchner's trip to the high north did not get well at all.
On Saturday he posted a selfie - his face is totally snug on it, the eyes only two small slits.
The bed-selfie shows a completely exhausted Florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick, he's only got a powerful cat.
To his fans, he posted some - probably not very serious - findings that he has now gained: “Line one: DO NOT go to Ina's night.
Rule two: Never drink the black sauce.
And syringe.
And the round egg liqueur, the Ina by half three, also leaves.
Alcohol consumption is indeed written in the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans immediately posted a few tips to fight the after-walking.
They ranged from instant broths, fish broths or - probably the most targeted - headache tablets.
Others simply enjoyed the sight of the normally attractive cinema star.
As Ina Müller has survived the night sitting, it is not yet known.
However, since it has been moderating TV fun at the Theke since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be clearly tried out...
To a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has to fight vandalism and unrat
The entrance to the 36-kilometer track in the Rotkäppchenland in Treysa is hard to find and miss.
Recipes against grazing vandalism are sought, but solutions hardly stand out.
Scherben, cigarette chickens, garbage and unrat, demolished garbage buckets and now dismantled signboards - this is how the entrance with a seating group to the cycle path on the Häße hill in Treysa has been presented since long ago.
For the object of the railway wheel path in the red-headed country a more than immeasurable view.
The topic employs members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt but also others for a long time, according to the cycling officer of the city Ulrich Wüstnhagen.
The problem had already been addressed in the cycling advisory board.
A solution is not yet available.
The proposals ranged from the installation of the seating group to the regular disposal of waste bins and cleaning of the areas at the entry point.
“I think the latter would be the commandment of the hour, regardless of possible further activities,” says desert decodenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that the topic has also been included in the local council.
Not only the garbage drives cyclists and residents around - the seating group is on weekends a regular meeting point to celebrate.
Not only is it often loud, in the case of the legends also destroyed: pussies torn from the earth, trashes demolished, signs snapped around, seating furniture mutilated.
Volunteers have already given up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
The actions, however, were only the proverbial drops on the hot stone.
They are angry that the roadside road road is a meeting point for the storage.
“As far as the entire cycle path is concerned, the Häße-Hügel is clearly the focus here,” confirms the cycling officer, who is now also taking care of the new bike station in Ziegenhain, which is being opened today.
“If she suffers the same fate, it’s going to be really expensive,” she says.
Another idea is a video surveillance on the hill: “Perhaps this makes the threshold considerably higher to get rid of commons.
However, this would suggest that a police strip will be over at a time.
Basically desert decodes wish for a development of the haze hill.
He had to be more attractive.
The frequence of the cycle path so far can be very satisfactory.
Tourist marketing is still expandable.
Our cycle path is very high compared to others in Germany - so the ADFC members.
As an extremely critical hazard point, ADFC member Susanne Klippert appreciates the situation in Ascheröder Straße in Treysa.
There's no abject track on the hare-hogs.
In the case of rain traffic, it can happen that cyclists have to wait in the middle of the road between both sides of the traffic flow, explaining it.
This is not a problem for sports drivers, but rather for older people and especially for children.
Music contest at the Kulturbahnhof: the “Kö von Hiltrup” and the lake
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and in cooperation.
D a song for Hiltrup, which is the appeal of Hiltrup, in the \"Music Contest for Large and Small, Young and Experienced Musicians\"
A contest “with eye-wax in the sympathetic Hiltruper family” as Karl Franke formulated.
In fact, it was soon a familial fellowship at coffee and cakes from the honorary offices of the Kulturbahnhof.
Seven formations took place, from the one-man band to the large ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Unzeit, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long-lived albatcher living in Hiltrup, the nine of the \"Hiltruper Star Colors\" three members and three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from Lummerland Kindergarten and finally Rike Weßling and the Blackties.
This contest, said district mayor Joachim Schmidt, was a novelty.
We haven't seen that in other parts of the city yet.
What was the connection between the texts?
In the villages, the Hiltruper lake and the market alley were particularly often mentioned.
Rolf Ihmig named the Allee in his slag-like song \"Kö von Hiltrup\"
The Kulturbahnhof was also honored.
It was always about the experience of one another in these places, especially at Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke inspired the short conversion breaks with short interviews with the interpreters or hints about their creation.
So it was learned from Humberg that he actually studied chemistry, but now also taught guitar.
The sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann knew Franke was on the program at a major event of BASF with Barclay James Harvest.
And Alvin Jasic put all sorts of things on Youtube.
“It’s not about winning,” Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper gastronomy.
There was something special for the favorites of the jury - so that others can hear their songs.
A whole CD can play Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untijd mit Tontechniker Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: the \"Lummerland-Rudel\" with its Hiltrup-Schlag, which impressed Franke especially with his musicality, and the \"Lummerland-Rudel\": \"a very beautiful performance\" with ten children and two educators on guitar and Cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone, the children also entered the finals again - and even without electronic support - sounded really good, as Franke said.
The jury was guided by originality of aspects, with reference to Hiltrup, the entrance of melody and recognition value.
The jury belonged to Gisbert Keller from the Westphalian School of Music, Andreas Klomfaß from the KvG high school and Oliver Ahlers from the Economic Association as well as Jan Kaven, Chairman of the District Offensive.
The district offensive had launched the event on the occasion of its ten-year existence.
She rated the event as a full success.
All were \"very satisfied\" and \"the atmosphere was good\" in the soon to be very full of cultural station.
The Word Game: \"Decrypto\" in the game test
The players form two teams opposite each other.
For each side there is a screen, including four cards with keywords, which you can only decipher - the old trick with the red slide - when you put them in.
This ensures that the opposite side can not read anything by mistake.
On the cards, for example, read from left to right: “1. Renaissance.
2. Window.
3. Dice.
4. Festiveness
These are the terms to be encrypted from now on.
For it is not to be guessed here, but codes.
A player per team alternately is the cipher.
He gets a code card, which might contain “3.4.2”
The term “decrypto” should not be used in terms behind the secret film, but its encryption codes.
His task in this case: - in this order and in this example - he is to describe the terms \"dice\" - \"feast\" and \"window\" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team as far as possible; because that wins the game if he succeeds twice to crack the code.
Thus, the cipher notes and reads aloud: \"Creating for the cubes, \"Lose\" as opposed to the feast; of course, there would be something like \"Party\" possible and \"Prag\" because he has been watching in the school and knows the window crash there.
That's how it goes round for round, team for team.
Although you do not know the terms of the opposite side - it can, however, be better combined with any indication that the cipher exists there.
Perhaps mysterious, but not too swirling should be the rewritings, otherwise it would be unnecessary to make it difficult for his team.
Unfortunately, the most cryptic of \"Decrypto\" is the rulebook.
The fellow players probably have to study it quite long and in detail until they can finally play.
The video on decrypto.info in the web makes it easier.
However, the first person to get rid of it will be fascinated by how much feeling there is in this invisible game.
Overall, however, “decrypto - not quite as conclusive as predecessors and genre primus - codenames - is also an agent's theme of playing less words, but much better to play in small groups.
And whoever is only about guessing and not about winning points, can also easily find a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows police Hitler greetings and harasss guests in the pub
A 48-year-old man employed the Kulmbach police inspection on the night from Saturday to Sunday equal double.
First he showed the Hitler greeting in the upper city of a passing police strip, then later he also appeared in the upper city in a pub when he harassed other guests.
After clearly alcoholicating the given seat reference by the police, he had to spend the night at the Kulmbach police inspection in the prison cell.
In the sober state, he must also be criminally responsible for the use of anti-constitutional registration marks.
Operational plant Pressig was home to the shed blocks
The railway station in Pressig was the turntable in the Frankenwald for decades.
In 1991, a piece of railroad history ended.
“When buffers were crashing at buffers, it was heard in a very busy manner,” recalls Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the railway station.
That's what no one was up to.
The brakes also quivered and the wagons cracked.
That was pure railroad.
Statements that are meaningful to Dinkel's home are pressing.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was such a place marked by the railroad.
Here was the starting point of the Steilrampen Bergstrecke to the north, which after an increase of about 220 metres had its tip in Steinbach am Wald.
In order to cope with this, earlier train and shed blocks were needed that had their home in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian Landtag approved the construction of a railway plant with 21 lokschuppen, apprenticeship workshop, driving and railway mastery.
“The heartpiece was the turning disc, which had a diameter of 18 meters after a remodeling in 1899,” says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, railway historians and 47 years of professional railways.
The BW (BW) Pressig (Bamberg) station, which was commissioned in 1968, also operated loks for the adjacent lines Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonenberg and Kronach - north-east.
On July 15, 1950, the \"Volksblatt\" reported a staff of 160 men; 13 steam and eight Elloks were then stationed in press.
The electrification of the line in 1939 already minimized the need for train and shed blocks.
From 1977 they were used only in freight trains.
Until 1991, at least 10 000 scales were ranked per month.
In 1982 parts of the plant were discontinued, in 1991 the rest of the plant was discontinued.
Heidrich: “It is regrettable that you have not considered a better use of the site, even in terms of freight transport,
Even at Pentecost 1989 the railway director Nuremberg celebrated a pompous station festival in Pressig for the anniversary of the \"50 Years of Electrification Nürnberg - Saalfeld\".
“There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here, ” recalls Georg Dinkel.
Get out later.
On 1 June 1991 the last 30 men were withdrawn, the ranking station Pressig was history.
“The rangers and hemmshoeers did the most difficult work in train transport,” recalls Dinkel.
Every mistake would have had fatal consequences.
Why the station has led Pressig-Rothenkirchen for the conversion of the hierarchy of the two places and many other historical and current images are here in the Franconian Plus article.
Kerber with opening success at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon winner Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegeund have reached the second round at the Tennis Tournament in Beijing as before Julia Görges.
Kerber won the China Open 6:2, 6:2 against the Frenchwoman Kristina Mladenovic.
The next opponent of the world rankings is either Julia Putinzewa from Kazakhstan or the Spanishman Carla Suárez Navarro.
She led 6:3, 4:2 against Darja Kassatkina, when the Russian who was set to number 13 gave up.
The Schwabin now gets to do with Anet Kontaveit from Estonia.
In the context of the series \"Art and enjoyment\" a special exhibition was opened on weekends in Mittelehrenbach.
With great relief, organizers and visitors registered the ideal weather was seen when the special Vernissage-Windspiel-Performance was opened in the open area of the estate Dahlmann- Schmidt, Mittehrenbach.
It takes place under the roof of the Tourism Association, round around Walberla, as part of the series, art and enjoyment.
This opened its doors in the 15th year.
A large visitor was shown the fascination of the exhibition.
21 copies of 20 artists can now be viewed in Mittelehrenbach.
Hausherr Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to the opening of the Vernissage.
He himself has been there since the first hour.
Like Volker Hahn, who made a name for himself as the main organizer and artist alike.
Something surprising but Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, however, he placed his task in proven young hands with good prospects of the future.
Both have already been actively involved in the selection of the artists in the past and have co-designed flyers.
Also this year, on the occasion of art & enjoyment, there is once again a 70 cent special stamp designed by them, available at any art station.
This year's poster, Betzn austanzen, can also be designed by Volker Hahn, for eight euros.
Hahn was delighted with the high demand for the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg was able to win for the musical framed.
As you walk through the spacious garden, the visitor quickly becomes aware that the title \"Windspiel performance\" challenges the artistic imagination in a formal way and ultimately leads to playful expression.
These are works of art made of metal or ceramic, often with colourful accents.
Already at the entrance of the property, the visitor awaits on the right side of the \"Glücksbaum\" by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree trunk, brightened, playfully decorated with 20 windshields, 24 hives and 24 alu tubes as soundpieces.
With the sun blowing through the bush in the background, the object seems fairy-tale and invites you to stay.
From Eckental, Barbara Waschneck, who prefers three-dimensional letters to the event 15 years K&G.
There are many parts, in the wind in motion.
On half-way, Siegrid Frey from Eckenental exhibited her work \"The Wind of the Heavenly Child\".
And at the end of the area, Volker Hahn shows his colorful imagination made of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The topic of \"wind-play-performance\" to be beaten by the versatile art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be visited by 31 December 2018.
50 years of MGV 68 Albatan: singer celebrates 50th birthday festive
1968 - that was the time of protest and student movement.
And even the Albatchers gave air to their despair at that time.
At least five of them.
They didn't want to find partout about the fact that after the dissolution of the church choir, \"Cäcilia\", there should be no more Sanges life in the district.
In the meantime it has become a legend: at a bank in the inn bush, they raised the MGV 68 albats from the baptism.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated in the House of Meeting.

Volleyball: 3. League Women: USC II wins high-class derby against BW Aasee
The climber marches.
Three games, three wins - the reserve of the USC Münster under the patronage of Axel Büring is quite well suited to league three.
No trace of shit or frog sauces, the independents do their thing.
And that at 3:0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) against city-concurrent BW Aasee was right.
“That wasn’t clear, but we already left the impression,” says the somewhat satisfactory trainer.
BWA-Coach Kai Annacker immediately told him: “This is a defeat that we can live with very well.
We are not satisfied, on the contrary.
In the evening at a subsequent birthday celebration by Ronja de Boer, the mood was good, the game stopped.
Yes, the result is, in fact, an optical deception.
In the third sentence, the guests had a sentence ball.
“If they get the goal, such a game can already kick - white büring from years of experience.
Finally, the USC, with its routine forces, made everything clear and brought the full yield to the goal.
“All of us are aware of who’s standing on the other side in such a derby.
That doesn't break us the trick.
I've seen really good volleyball in phase - did not hate Annacker with the 0:3 - and immediately went over to the agenda.
Where the journey goes for the independents, after just three days of play, it seems impossible.
“It’s just too early for this,” says Axel Büring.
Only in one he feels confirmed: “The 3rd league has an incredibly good level.
With regional league volleyball this is not nearly comparable - in the fourth league they no longer want to direct their gaze downwards anyway.
Should the West not be polluted in the next weeks, they must look up.
A first balance sheet can only be drawn after ten, eleven parties.
On Saturday, we'll go to Emlichheim.
Aasee arrives in Essen on 14 October.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the \"Traumschiff\" Heide Keller became a star.
Now she frankly says that the series may have had a share in her marriage-out with Hans von Borsody.
Her role as chief hostess Beatrice von Ledebur on the “Traumschiff” made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018 she went on board forever.
The series that made her star could be responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with whom she had been married for ten years.
“That could also have been a reason.
Because I was grown up with this work, traveled around the world alone with a suitcase, and many of my admired colleagues took me to the top of my eyes, telling Keller in conversation with the \"Image on Sunday\"
First of all, she was always \"the wife of Hans von Borsody\", but that changed with the \"traumatic ship\".
Because now the journalists only called with Heide Keller.
“I don’t know if he liked it so well, ” she says.
She thinks it is possible that her husband at that time could have been quite jealous, but \"as many men also saw Hans talking about problems and feelings\"
Keller always tried to be the only right one for Hans von Borsody and he didn't want to know my fears, my weaknesses.
That means in good German: I've changed - as she continues to explain.
She always felt like “not being good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman I was never in truth, even though I sometimes appeared angry and courageous on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever,
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller once again said, \"Although I was afraid that it could also go wrong a second time,
On the day before the wedding, I was crying in the wardrobe and wanted to cancel everything.
The marriage to Borsody also failed.
Why has it never worked with men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller's love at the time - as presented in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not everyday.
I've come to love a lot too naively,
The nightfolder, who regularly explores the city's nightlife in the NZZ-Ressort Zurich, has this time been waiting for the ZFF opening party.
Our fangs are not moths, but they're a little ludicrous.
And the grey glow in which a green carpet is dipped on the six-legged square blinds it over a fee.
But it's still film festival, because more or less celebrities want to sunk in the spotlight.
So on this late Thursday evening, he swirls over the place to facilitate himself in the \"Aquaclean WC Oasis\".
For example, the public toilet facility sponsored by a large sanitary company, which celebrates its premiere at the festival, is called: the needing institution in the part of a new pavilion is a lot of effort to streamline a luxurious atmosphere.
However, this evening in the Lord's oasis, for any reason, it stinks to heaven.
So get out of here, go over to the other roadside: Invited guests who have just booked at the best level in the cinema next to the opening film \"Green Book\" celebrate the opening of the festival with a party in the three-storey department store.
Your name fits perfectly with this film festival: The works shown are known to be from all over the globe.
What should not be included in an article about this festival in order not to fall into the trap for its 190 partner companies.
The falter binds a bundle around the felters, who put a good fee on him, and two bully doorposts actually waved him down generously.
Inside, the invited, they dance far after midnight to live music or can be presented by DJ rhythms to which they shout each other, and rinse down with Cüpli exquisite heaps.
In the delicate food store in the Souterrain, oysters wait for sloping mouths, next to which the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut, spraying a chocolate fountain.
And the hammer is: All the sales shelves of fully exclusive products have not been cleared for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to be working without large losses.
You have to love this country for that!
The Falter studies the sign at the roller stairway: “Treat a long dress, please be careful about the roller stairway,
If the two were separate instructions, he'd be in the dress code.
But it is rather a conditional construction, and it has certainly saved life.
In the upper floor of the household goods department, the poultry kicks a cocktail prepared with espresso called \"Golden Eye\" suitable for the festival award.
The price for the best drink does not forcefully receive this mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents himself.
And George Clooney, who has been branding for years, isn't here that evening either.
However, between local prominence, cash desk, and kitchen items, a face that is well known to the observer: Peter Farrelly, director of the opening film.
That's probably not the way his main performer is.
And really: Viggo Mortensen, with soon sixty acting like a choral nod by the crowd.
He's not being harassed, he's not getting it, he's stealing at most.
Especially for this restraint, like to misunderstand as clumsiness, international stars love this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with Cumbia dances
Trainer and ex-football star Diego Maradona is delighted with the victory of his team.
Argentina's football legend Diego Maradona seems to have lived well in his new home Mexico.
After a 2:0 win of his Club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced with a player in the cabin to Cumbia-Rythmen, as can be seen in a video already published on Saturday.
In the 15-second clip of a team member, Maradona dances in the yellow-colored jersey, fired by the players.
The Mexican second-ligist had defeated the Leones Negros with 2:0 on Saturday.
After the game, Maradona called into a TV camera “Always with my boys, always”
The 57-year-old has been training the Mexican club since the beginning of September.
Handball: Verbandsliga 1: ASV Send to Last-Minute-Pleite \"damaged in the ground\"
Sween Bieletzki, coach of the Handball Association Litigist ASV, could hardly believe it: \"So bitter a defeat - His shooters were \"damaged in the ground\" after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) - Pleasure - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday evening at LIT Germania 2.
They had not played badly, as in Steinhagen, as against Hullhorst, over long phases, the transmitters.
The ASV trainer was only upset at the initial phase of “sleeping completely”.
At 8:1, the houselords also carried out the early break-out, which Bieletzki had taken, at first did not produce.
“But then suddenly a ruck passed through the team - Bieletzki took the second quarter together.
During the break, the residue was only two more gates.
Especially Send's Bester, Marius Hintze, met another time in the phase.
After the change, it was even better from a visitor's point of view.
After 33 minutes, David Ernst was 15/15, and then the season changer was almost continuous.
Four minutes before the siren, the lead was still seemingly calming three hits (29:26).
And then?
Attack the impartial into action.
Bieletzki usually avoids looking for blame for others.
But: The 120-second time penalty that Steffen Mühlhoff charged, \"was a joke\"
LIT had a good laugh and met up to the end four more times - while the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The boys fought great, also standing well at the back of seven men and always throwing them on the empty gate.
Only they can buy little for the compliments.
“Now we have to win a damn victory, so the restlessly served Bieletzki.
ASV tour: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kumper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).

Bayern: Woman missing for 30 years - Police digs for body parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of an 18-year-old from Naila, the police look for the mortal remains of the woman.
On Saturday at Marx Green, force forces dug up a road.
For this purpose, the street floor and several layers of it were carried out, as police and prosecutor told together.
According to new findings, the missing person may not have been buried far away from their place of residence.
The woman has disappeared since 4 November 1986.
The investigators did not end a crime at that time.
Since last year, the Criminal Police Court, together with the prosecutor, has been working on the case again closely.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Denkmal Protection Authority, the investigators used a ground radar to attack the street at Marxgrün.
With the help of a dog trained on the smell of human bones, the officials confined the site to a few meters.
The results of the excavations should be announced during the afternoon.
The hacker attack on millions of Facebook users shows what dangers lie in the network.
However, users themselves can also provide additional security.
Instead of complicated letter sequences, users should prefer to use passphrases to secure their accounts on the network.
In addition, security updates, such as for Windows, should be installed quickly, nor does it harm to equip computers with anti-virus protection.
Elon Musk, founder of the electro-auto-manufacturer Tesla, has escaped his threatening appointment as head of the military company.
He and the U.S. Stock Exchange Supervisory SEC filed an extrajudicial dispute over misleading Twitter news, in which Musk could have lost permission to lead listed companies.
As part of the comparison, Musk and Tesla pay 20 million dollars each, and Musk gives the Chairman's office for three years, a comparable position to the Chief Supervisory Board.
Chief of Management is allowed to stay with him.
In comparison, which either must be confirmed by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla committed misconduct.
The SEC had sued the world famous manager before the U.S. Federal Court of Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, also headed by SpaceX, is the public face of electric car pioneers, who are now rated on the stock market with more than 50 billion dollars.
Musk is not aware of guilt
Musk let him explain that he did nothing wrong and was sad and disappointed about the complaint.
He has always acted in the sense of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk had written his more than 22 million Twitter supporters, he might take the company off the stock exchange and pay $420 per share that the financing was secured.
That would have rated Tesla at 72 billion dollars in total.
Later, Musk rowed back: Tesla stayed on the stock market.
After the agreement, Tesla now has to find an outside chairman, appoint two independent board members and also set up a committee that oversees Musks communication.

The team of the controversial coach José Mourinho lost at West Ham United earned 1:3 (0:2) and stayed with ten points after seven days only in the middle of the table.
The pressure on Mourinho will continue to grow before the Champions League match on Tuesday against the FC Valencia.

Surveys: 46 percent do not want Merkel as a chancellor until 2021
After the quarries of the past few weeks, GroKo collects several survey depths.
The SPD falls behind the AfD in a survey - Angela Merkel is critically seen.
Berlin - The AfD has for the first time overtaken the SPD in the Emnid Sonnentagstrend for the picture on Sunday.
In the weekly survey of the Institute of Opinion Research, the AfD accounts for 17 percent by a counter, the SPD points out a point compared to the previous week and ends at 16 percent.
CDU and CSU also lose a counter and only reach 27 percent.
This is the deepest value for the Union in the Sunday trend so far.
Greens reach 15 percent, left 11 and FDP 10 percent.
If the Bundestag elections were held on Sunday, the government parties would receive SPD, CDU and CSU, according to Emnid, only 43 percent of the votes.
In this way, the great coalition has at present lost the majority in the Sunday issue at all major research institutes, except Allenbach.
The government parties come consistently to 43 to 45 percent of the votes (Allenbach: 51 percent).
In the 2017 Bundestag elections, they received 53.4 percent.
With the other parties, the bandwidth is also large: The AfD, in several surveys the second strongest party, comes to 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens reach voting shares of 12.5 to 17 percent.
The left is on average 10 per cent, FDP at 9 per cent.
For statistical reasons, such surveys have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent up and down depending on the voting proportion.
But also the restraint for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has fallen significantly since the 2017 Bundestag elections.
At present, only 48 percent of the citizens find Merkel to be the right person in the chancellor's office, as the Emnid survey on behalf of the BamS revealed.
According to the survey, only every second (50 percent) currently wants the big coalition to hold until the next regular election of the Bundestag in three years, 41 percent are for a new election.
Also in a further survey published on Saturday, there were clear losses of popularity for Merkel.
The Germans also assessed whether Merkel should again apply for the CDU in December.
According to Emnid, 47 percent are against it, 44 percent against it.
Therefore, 64 per cent of the Union's supporters do not want a candidate, 35 per cent.
Aushang bei Aldi: Price Reduced to Love Happiness
Will Aldi become Tinder 2.0?
Who says that in times of tinder there are no more romantic acquaintance stories - he should talk to Aldi about putenfleisch.
Munich - In times of the digital \"fast food dating\" by Tinder and Co., the supermarket as a familiar place for love almost radiates an anachronistic romance.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced putty meat, boxers' short snacks at the Wühltisch or the favorite pudding is in doubt still a better story for the later grandchildren than a mere swipe to the right.
The Tinder app is in the reputation of being less a contact but rather a sloppy stock exchange.
We have dared the test: how do women react, one does not speak around the hot breeze for long, right in the first message?
Here's the amazing result.
Regular Hollywood Lovestory potion has it when the love happiness precedes a out-of-the-eye lost-and-rediscovered plot.
If the guy even reports on his prayers under the e-mail address bio-putenfleisch@gmx.de, then that sounds very much like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and consortia - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
Thus, the author of this announcement in an Aldi branch unknown to us would like her to also find her dreamman, with whom she has briefly talked about the “30 percent reduced organic put meat”.
She definitely earned her Happy End à la Hollywood for the belief in the magic of analog learning.
Picture pool: 500 lids for a life without paralysis
Since the beginning of the new school year, the Ludgeri School has been participating in the action \"Cuts against Polio - 500 Covers for a life without paralysing children\"
Polio is the abbreviation for polyomyelitis, an infectious disease caused by polioviruses.
The disease referred to in German as a child paralysis leads from paralysis appearances to death.
In Germany, polio is considered eradicated, but there are still three countries worldwide in which the disease occurs.
The cause of polyomyelitis, the polioviruses, can only be inhibited by vaccinations as mentioned in a press release.
Football: Giants and Zorc demand peace for idols
Leverkusen (dpa) - BVB Sports Director Michael Zorc and Captain Marco Reus have called for an end to public discussion on the form and fitness of Mario Gotze.
“We should stop thinking about Mario.
That's not good for the boy.
And that's not good for us, said Reus, friend of God after the 4:2 victory in Leverkusen at the TV station Sky.
Zorc had already emphasized before the game.
For him personally, this is not a simple situation.
Football: Eberl: No hurry when negotiating with Hecking
Mönchengladbach (dpa) - Manager Max Eberl of the football league Borussia Mönchengladbach sees no hurry in possible contract extension with coach Dieter Hecking.

There is no fixed date when we do this.
“But there will certainly be the moment we sit down and talk,” Eberl said on Sunday evening at TV station Sky.
Football: District league: Researcher appearance of the VfL Wolbeck against the SC Altenrheine makes courage
There were moments in this still young season when Alois Fetsch went to court with his hard men.
Wortkarg gave himself, the coach of footballer VfL Wolbeck, to withdraw (innerly) to reflect on the lack of readiness for performance on the green.
All history.
Meanwhile, it's going back around the Brandhoveweg.
Taufrüsser Beleg is the 1:1 on Sunday against the SC Altenrheine, in the last season only hushly scrapped by the climb.
Yeah, I'm very happy with the performance.
“We have narrowed the rooms and exerted pressure on the ball.
This could be seen - praised Fetsch's boys and sought out each individual for the party to simply say \"Thank you\" for so much resistance to the ambitious guests.
The coach had to make a system conversion after 26 minutes.
After Nico Frerich's injury (muscular problems) - for him, Luca Rehberg - it went from 4-4-2 almost seamlessly into a 4-2-3-1, where Niklas Thewes was waiting in front of balls.
Wolbeck had significantly more playing parts in the first section.
And chances.
But Frerichs before his out (17th), who moved in Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the tour.
Almost that would have been the case when in minute 41, the SCA in person of Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer slammed up dangerously in front of the Wolbecker caste - Tormann Damian Hallas proved himself a master of his trade.
After the break, the VfL took over the full control.
Thewes from 18 meters failed barely.
Schroer also came too late after 58 minutes on a Thewes release.
With the moving of Miles Geske, Fetsch missed the left side again a fresh cell cure.
When Altenrheines Chris Naberbäumer fell in the 70th minute Robin Westhues, there was an indirect escape for the placelords 18 meters in front of the guesthouse.
The fouled one joined himself and demonstrated his jeopardy with standards.
Westhues - Things with the right slant hit the bottom left from the view of the shooter - 1:0 (71.).
20 more minutes to get fucking long.
And then that: VfL captain Florian Quabeck flew the leather in the penitentiary in the 80th minute.
Arbitrary Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79.).
In the final phase, however, Wolbeck had to survive many minutes before Geske had the victory hit on the punch in the 87th minute of 12 metres.
Could have been too much of good.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75th Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26th L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vuelmeyer (66th Geske) - Thewes

Eintracht Frankfurt wins 4:1 vs Hannover 96
Starting position: Four points after five days of play - this could not be enough for coach Adi Hütter.
Against Hanover 96 Eintracht Frankfurt finally wanted to ensure the first victory at home.
Stormer Ante Rebic, who was in the startelf for the first time after an injury, should help.
Also midfielder Luca Torró was back with a sham injury and with his headball strength should prevent the SGE from cashing further goals according to standards.

At the landing, the airfield was still under attack.
The four inmates were easily injured.
By 14 o'clock on Sunday at the airport in Kottingbun, a drama was held.
When a helicopter landed, there was turbulence as confirmed by the police against oe24.
The Heli was captured by a windstorm, force on the ground, and came to the side to recover.
Police, rescue, and firefighters were immediately informed.
With a large bid, the crews came to the emergency station.
The ÖAMTC-Notarzthubschrauber was also called for caution.
Inmates only slightly injured

Allbright Foundation Report: Women remain a rarity in corporate boards
Thus, only 8 percent of the board members were female on the day of the end of September 1, as stated in the report \"The Power of Monoculture\", which is officially presented by the Allbright Foundation this Monday and presented to the German Press Agency in advance.
\"The companies will have to set up differently, otherwise the international competitors will move past them - said Stiftungs Managing Director Wiebke Ankersen.
In the United States, Great Britain or Sweden, purely male-occupied executive teams - with few exceptions - have long been unthinkable.
The backlog made the German competitors less diverse, innovative and future-oriented compared.
It's a different corporate culture.
The small increase in women's share among German stock exchanges companies was also due solely to positive impulses in the medium-sized index index (MDax).
According to Allbright figures, only 6.8 percent of the board members are female.
In the previous year, however, the value was still 3.8 percent.
For the 30 Dax companies - in recent years previous drivers - women's share has stagnated.
At last, 26 women worked in the board.
“I am sure that the Dax companies will recruit consistent women again next year - in their own interest - said anchors.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement would have signaled that they did not continue to commit themselves to increasing the share of \"zero percent\".
Another picture is given by the Supervisory Boards: on 1 September, the female share was 30.5 percent - 45 women more and 68 men less than a year ago.
\"A large number of women were recruited for the board of directors every year, if a share of 40 percent had already been reached in 2023, it is said in the report.
Some even make Miese: Luxury Cars: Which manufacturer deserves the most per car?
At best, Ferrari deserves it.
The Italians take 280,000 euros with each Ferrari sold and make 69,000 euros of operating profit.
Big cars, big profits: This slogan still applies today - in most cases.
Who makes the most profit per car among the noble providers.
Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much do the luxury manufacturers cash per car they sell?
This question has been addressed by Autopopst and Wirtschaftsprofessor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer.
His study shows: The differences are massive.
Ferrari made 69,000 Euros of operating profit in the first half of the year with each car sold - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only comes to around 800 Euros, Tesla and Bentley even place heavily on each car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are well in the race with prices ranging from 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and about 3,000 euros before interest and tax EBIT.

Torch to open the 60th Abtswinder Weinfest
With a torch train, the Tourist Association opened its wine festival session in Abtswind.

The chairman of the Tourist Association, Wolfgang Starz, Mayor Jürgen Schulz and Weinprinzessin Lisa Kursawe, welcomed guests in the already prolific party. “60 years of such an appearance - this is an insanity for a small place with 800 inhabitants.
You can be proud of that - thanks Starz to all the helpers.
Weinprinzessin Lisa II later arrived symbolically with the guests from the stage.
\"Beautiful, so many have found the way to us after abstinent winds, and later the \"Troglauer\" provided a sense of mood.
On Sunday, on which the Abtswinder Kirchweih was also celebrated, the club had fixed the beverage prices as 60 years ago on the occasion of the anniversary of the afternoon.
A celebration evening for the 60th wine festival takes place on Friday, October 5, in the guest's house, before it goes into the second round one day later in the party tent.
In Bonn: Notarztauto force in Taxi
A notary car is heavily damaged next to a road.
A 27-year-old passenger has been fatally injured during the collision of the use vehicle with a taxi.
If emergency doctors are called, they should help - save the best even human life.
Such a rescue trip took a deadly end in Bonn for a 26-year-old.
Bonn - In the collision of a notary car with a taxi, a 26-year-old pedestrian has been fatally injured in Bonn.
The taxi driver, the emergency doctor and their driver were seriously injured, as the police told them.
On Saturday afternoon, the 46-year-old driver of the Notarztauto had a red traffic jam with blue light and Martinshorn.
He then collapsed on a crossroads with the taxi that drove green.
After the collision, the doctor's car slid against an ampel mast and a tree.
He recorded the passant, who was still dead at the accident site.
Driver of the emergency car and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the emergency car were severely injured in their vehicles and had to be set free from operational forces.
The also badly injured 29-year-old emergency doctor could free himself, but the pedestrian could no longer help her.
Another registered notary tried this - but without success.
The three serious injuries were brought to hospitals.
The police, in close consultation with the Bonn prosecutor, determine who is responsible for the accident.
Manchester United loses again, for Mourinho we're uncomfortable
After the blaming out in the leaguecup Manchester United is now losing in the 7th round of the Premier League.
West Ham United is subject to ManU 1:3. The way of defeat should still be spoken.
The scene was meaningful in the 74th minute, in which the renewed Marko Arnautovic shot 3:1 for West Ham; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford supposedly led the Red Devils back to the game.
Since they suspected an offside at Mark Nobel's passport, all the defence players of Manchester remained standing, and Arnautovic allowed all the time in the world to pass the ball by helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative peak of a previously inadequate performance over a wide range.
The commotion at Uniteds Urban Rivale Manchester City is quite different.
The citizens trained by Mourinhos' great competitor Pep Guardiola came against Brighton & Hove Albion for an approximate 2:0 victory.
After half an hour, Raheim Sterling broke for the home team for the first time the outsider's defence belt.
After a good hour and a double pass with the former goalkeeper, Sergio Agüero ensured the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus also for the jump to the top of the table.
Liverpool no longer table leader
Three days after the 1:2 defeat in the leaguecup, Xherdan Shaqiri fought a 1:1 against Chelsea with Liverpool in the Premier League.
As with the Cup-Out, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man with the Londoners.
The hit of the 27-year-old in the 25th minute remained the only hit of the game until the final phase.
Shaqiri, who came to the field in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, missed the balance after 70 minutes.
It was better to make Daniel Sturridge in the 89th minute with his locker.
So after the Reds had started with a flawless balance sheet in the week, Chelsea was unable to beat for the second time.
At first, the Londoners eliminated Jürgen Klopp's team in the Cup, and the Remis in the League dropped the Blues Liverpool from the top of the table.
How City also celebrated the two London city clubs Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (again Watford) 2:0-winning.
The fans of the Gunners, in which Granit Xhaka played through, however, had to wait until the 81st minute for a success message against the surprise team from Hertfordshire County.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defender Craig Cathcart introduced Alex I, who was unhappy in his own goal, only two minutes later, Mesut Özil, with his third season hit, made the decision.
Thanks to the fifth victory, Arsenal passed Watford in a row and is again right behind the great rival Tottenham to rank 5. A strong impression continues to leave climber Wolverhampton under his Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.
The Wolves remained unbeatable for the fifth time against Southampton in the league at 2:0 and took 8th place.
VW core brand missing: Paris Motor Salon in the wake of the diesel debate
The Paris Motor Show takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially no subject and yet omnipresent: The diesel scandal and ringing for driving bans and retrofittings should not let the German car companies go away even at the industry meeting in Paris.
At the Autosalon 2018, they show their novelties together with the competition from all over the world in the French capital from the coming week.
The diesel doesn't actually play a big role anymore.
However, the possible exchange and retrofitting offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are to be negotiated with the government in Berlin until then, should still be an important topic at least behind the shiny scenes of the trade fair booths.
A big name is missing in Paris: The Volkswagen Group is with Audi, Porsche and other daughters, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are there and, among other things, have their first pure electric models: The e-tron of Ingol Stadtädter will be on the market at the end of the year, the EQC of Stuttgarter 2019.
Both have already been officially presented.
The iNext of BMW is scheduled to start in 2021.
The new 3er is at the centre of Paris.
A total of more than 250 exhibitors are represented this year from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car companies, motorcycle builders and numerous mobility service and software providers are present in each of their own halls.
The fair, which celebrates its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, there were well over a million visitors.
At least 380 people have been killed in the severe earthquakes and the following tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
In addition, there are more than 500 injured.
The island had been shaken by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first tremor had the strength 5.9, the second the strength 7.4.
Communication and transport connections are damaged, there was enormous damage.
After the earthquake, the tsunami broke over the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal city of Palu, hundreds of people gathered at the beach for a feast.
It is feared that the number of victims is still rising significantly.
To date, the figures have only come from Palu.
However, there are also numerous other municipalities - along Sulawesis West Coast.
About 150 bikers celebrate worship in Werdohl
Motorcycle pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the graduation service for motorcyclists in the Peace Church in Eveking on Sunday with a team of helpers.
Werdohl - The square in front of the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to the motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the graduation service for the bikers was on the program.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and thus responsible for the mental concerns of PS-strong two-wheelers.
Between April and September, the traditional motorcycle worship (MoGo) takes place at the Nordhelle House on the last Sunday of a month.
The bikers celebrate the end of the season traditionally in the Peace Church in Eveking.
On Sunday, about 150 bikers had gathered to engage in a service other than usual.
As early as 10 p.m., the Bolids were erected in front of the church's entrance portal.
First, the biker's breakfasts were on the program and it was allowed to be strengthened with coffee and cake or even with a thick curry sausage.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorbike group from Gummersbach, were also present.
The sermon was held during the biker worship service by pastor Dirk Grzegorek.
The singer-songwriter Valerie Lill provided for the musical underpainting.
“Although the bikers prefer the blues rock, Valerie Lill suggests more poetically and calmly tones, according to parishioner Frank Schröder.
This too was certainly a novel yesterday in the history of motorcycle worship.
Füchtorfer Heimatverein celebrates great celebration: After the apple comes the milk
And also on the actual day of action Borisch was active.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pan cakes.
George Hartmann-Niemerg also aroused great interest.
He had his apple press in his luggage and demonstrated his amazing viewers step by step the process from mature apple to apple juice.
Then and when, Hartmann-Niemerg left the children the field and left them to fill the apples in the big vipers.
With a little muscle force, the apples became a finely crushed mass.
Not many of the children were able to imagine how a tasty drink would once be.
But they were also able to look at this important step on this late Friday afternoon.
Packed in shapes and wrapped by nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the little piece of apple looking like a hook for layer over each other.
Thanks to some technical support, the last step was no longer so difficult.
The freshly squeezed juice gradually ran into a large vessel.
But the farm owner had already filled out specialties.
He opened his “Schatzkiste” and presented the latest spring whites to the older visitors.
The demand for the good drop “Made in Fichtorf” was correspondingly large.
In a pleasant atmosphere, the parents got into conversation, while the children were not only able to follow the process of the apple press, but also discovered the constructed hipburg for themselves.
Activists of former soldiers were also involved during the celebration and invited to play for short-term games at some stations.
In the coming year, the Home Association will also be offering an action day.
But then, as Gregor Krützkamp stressed, the home in the heart of the Asparagus village will not be the place of the event.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also due to the theme on hand: Finally, it will go around the milk.
1:4 vs. Frankfurt: Hannover with fourth season lead: \"Beschissene Situation\"
Frankfurt/Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disillusioned professionals from Hanover 96 and spoke to them courageously.
However, there was a lot of positives previously not seen at 1:4 (0.2) of the last table at Eintracht Frankfurt.
“It’s a shitty situation, but you have to get out there as a team,” said 96-football pro Pirmin Schweiler and follows: “This is of course disappointing, because you’re always taking a lot of notice.”
The further victorious Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86.) met for the connection, is at the bottom with two counters and is in its present constitution a descending candidate.
On the other hand, as a result of the outstanding Ante Rebic, Frankfurt celebrated the first season-home victory.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45.+1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59.) and Luka Jovic (89.), before 46.300 spectators scored the goals for the DFB Cup winner, who, after the successful general trial for the Europe League game against Lazio Rome, set seven points in the middle of the table.
Croatia's vice world champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive action of the Hessen and never got into control of Hanover's defence.
The stormy storm that followed the World Cup long showed with its pace and perseverance why it is so valuable for entry.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, borrowed from the Liverpool FC Liverpool, was the first time in the initial formation of the Frankfurters, which began to swing.
A headball faltered on the gate network by Lucas Torró (17th) brought danger for the first time.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in a promising position at the last moment by the 96 defence around the Brazilian Felipe, who replaced Kevin Wimmer (backs) in the short term.
The leadership for the landlords was almost necessarily and completely deserved.
Filip Kostic raised the ball after a resisted corner into the prison room, Haller extended by head in front of the gate, where Ndicka only needed to keep her foot.
It was the first Bundesligatreffer for the French second-ligist AJ Auxerre in summer.
And Frankfurt was still putting up with it before the break.
This time Haller adapted to his storm partner Rebic, who was well-knocked and left 96-torwart Michael Esser no chance.
In the mid-term, Hannover-Coach responded to the weak imagination of his elf and brought two new offensive forces to Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
Although the Lower Saxonyes played a bit more bravely forward, burning ideas remained until just before the end, when the connection hit.
The Hessens were much more efficient.
After a short hour, Rebic started a solo and then crossed De Guzmán, which only had to push the ball into the empty gate.
The rest was only running for the Frankfurters against the overriding guests, even Jovic met a minute before the end.
The Morlaix square becomes the party mile
Whirls Despite cool temperatures, good mood prevailed at the October festival in downtown.
The Munich Mayor Dieter Reiter managed to open the 185th anniversary of the 185th anniversary.
Municher Wies'n last week with two blows.
Geisingen: Geisinger Christians Celebrate Holy Cross Feast
The Geising Catholics celebrate the Holy Cross festival on September 14 or Sunday thereafter.
The festival service takes place in the city church, then there is a procession to the Holy Cross church with the final bride.
The Holy Cross church houses the shot Christ, who comes from the 30th-century war and is supposed to have shot at the legend after a Swedish soldier.
From the gunshot wound, blood flowed.
This led to a great pilgrimage to the shot Christ, who then also led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
This is not yet finished, only the altar room stands, the missing longhouse is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon, priest Adolf Buhl reminds us that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
Despite the importance of the Geising parish, the worship service was ill - visited.
After the worship, the procession took place on the Holy Cross Church and with the final end of the church part of the cross festival ended.
For many years the Catholic Church Choir has been invited to the Catholic Pfarrheim for the worldly part of the festival.
The choir members provided the visitors with hearty dishes as well as a wide selection of cakes and the weather adapted, farm ice cream.
In the afternoon, the parish still offered guided tours around the town church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed visitors on behalf of the parish about the damage to façade, roof, sandstone works and windows, as well as the ongoing construction measures that will continue until next year.
After the gear has been standing for some time, the damage could be more accurately detected and the individual tenders prepared more specifically.
It is certain that the renovation is more expensive than planned, because the damage already existing a few years ago has increased, but it has also been found more, which was only possible by means of the opening certificate by means of equipment.
The sockwork is complete, before winter is to begin with the natural stone work and one still hopes to be able to complete well half of these work this year.
Inauguration: Neues Wohnheim in der Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
The Donau-Iller Life Aid opens a new home for people with disabilities in Münsterblickstraße.
The fact that in Münsterblickstraße now, a very special house, is handed over to its destination, there were all those present at the time of the inauguration.
Finally, the twelve wheelchair drivers, who have been living in Donau-Iller's home for some time, have already been dependent on the special architecture of the new building.
Wider corridors, corridors and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access to all areas has been taken into account by architect Rudolf Bader in his concept.
The first plans began about eight years ago when the former officer building of the U.S. Army was placed on the test stand for the residents with cell phone cap: “The house had come into the years and was no longer timely in the equipment,” said Bader retroactively.
In 2016 the excavators stepped in to tear down the house.
The new building should be made as friendly and bright as possible so that the inhabitants can feel comfortable in it, says the architect.
Life aid Danube-Iller opens new home
Around EUR 4.6 million invested in the new construction.
The Free State granted 2.4 million euros, the district Schwaben 450000 euros.
The construction works, according to architect Bader, remained in the planned framework - both time and financial.
The managing director of life aid, Jürgen Heinz, also thanked him for this.
The spagat between a barrier-free and at the same time fireproof construction was not always easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and artisans had established a home with the many requirements that allowed the inhabitants to experience freedom to move without outside help.
Gertrud Kreutmayer, Head of Social Administration of the Schwaben District, also said: “The house is oriented towards the special needs of its residents, who need tools to be mobile,
In doing so, the housing and functionality were well combined, said Kreutmayer.
And further: “The property in this position is a real fortune because it is no longer available in today’s situation”
In total, the new residence in Münsterblickstraße offers space for 30 people with disabilities, which are divided into three residential groups, almost 1500 square meters.
Stolz is Life Help Manager Heinz to the eleven full-time workers, all of whom are employed by tariff.
Germany: Slightly accused of differences between East and West
Berlin - Before the day of the unit, Deputy SPD President Manuela Schwesig appealed to all the countrymen not to deal with the disadvantage of East Germans.
There are differences that pain after almost 30 years of loneliness.
With these differences, we must not be satisfied - the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern said the \"day mirror on Sunday\"
The goal must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that East Germans worked longer than the people in West Germany, but were less likely to earn 15 percent.
“I can’t explain that for almost 30 years after the German unit,” said Schwesig.
North Korea: Does this pitty dog end the Korean conflict?
The one-year-old Pungsan hunting dog is supposed to smooth the waves between the two Koreas.
In an effort to relax relations with Seoul, Pyongyang made the South Korean President Moon Jae a gift in two North Korean pungsan hunting dogs.
As Moon's office announced on Sunday, the two dogs reached their receiver about a year old on Thursday.
They therefore passed the border town of Panmunjom together with three kilograms of dog feed in order to facilitate the \"accustomation\" of animals.
The dogs with the thick white fur, pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They belong to the national cultural property of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The friendship was announced to the North at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean Powerman Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang in mid-September.
Both countries also agreed to join international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and to join in the campaign for the 2032 Olympic Games.
In the course of the mutual approach, Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test system for rocket drives.
Austria's moving history in the mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
On the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated for almost ten months since this year, numerous new books have appeared, most of which answer this question in retrospect of the past hundred years.
Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and Director-General of the Austrian State Archives, will present it in the magnificent picture book, Austria, which will be published on 1 October.
New week, new chance for the government
Back to work - this is the unofficial motto for the current working week of the Grand Coalition.
Almost an interview, hardly a speech in which the chancellor and her minister from CDU, SPD and also from the CSU have not, last but not the ‘return to the facts’, made a mantra-like complaint.
This may have led some artisans, doctors, cashiers and other working citizens in this country to the legitimate question, which is actually the difference between work and work, but be it drum.
If the federal government is now ready to dedicate itself again to its mission - the government - then it should not now be held up with terms of debate.
Whether Union and SPD can actually bring something together after the provocations and blasts of the last few weeks will be shown as early as Monday.
In the evening, the leaders of the government parties meet for the coalition committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to call this round on a regular basis to end conflicts early; a lesson from all the dispute.
First, however, there are conflicting issues on the agenda with the diesel retrofittings and the Professional Immigration Act.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants to make the car companies with exchange premiums glimpable, SPD and CDU see the manufacturers in the duty of technical retrofitting of older diesels.
While an approach has been drawn up in the diesel crisis over the weekend, Union and SPD are still far apart from the planned professional immigration law.
The SPD calls for a standby perspective for rejected asylum seekers who work or make training.
The Union is strictly opposed to the \"change of track\" from the asylum system in the labour market.
So there will again be disputes among the coalition partners - and how should it be different?
Not equally and equally has joined the GroKo, but three partners with partly very different social images and priorities.
Conflict is good.
Without dispute, a society drawn by such diverse, sometimes contradictory, interests does not advance.
However, in order to be constructive, disputes must not be re-constructed for party-tactical reasons on the question of being or not being.
It's still about politics, not theatre.
Union and SPD are to argue - but always have a view of people's viability.
What is feasible and useful to many?
With this guiding question, both the diesel and the track change question can be explained pragmatically - and thus regain confidence.
Above all, the People's Party must fight now.
Pilz checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister in the visor
Does the Minister of Labour violate the applicable law of service?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look at this.
“Really day and night,” said an overwhelming Minister of Social Affairs at the presentation of their own two weeks ago, “they had worked on social security reform.
In the case of List-Pilz-Mandatarin Daniela Holzinger, the statement by Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) is a surprise - it now brings the matter to Parliament via request.
She concluded that \"the Minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm about the use of her team and not to announce violations of applicable service law in front of running cameras,
Nevertheless, they now have questions to say to Hardacher, \"to be able to say goodbye to every suspect\"
Police are looking for a street in the search for a woman's body
Marxgrün - Lange didn't want to talk to the police about it.
Now there's a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, the state road between Naila and Bad Steben has been dug.
The line is still closed in the area of Marx Green until Monday.
It was predicted that the investigators had previously used an archeology dog.
The dog specially trained for the smell of old human bones, along with its leader in multiple use, was finally able to limit the relevant site to a few meters.
In addition, a soil anomaly was discovered together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the top Bavarian Monument Protection Authority in the area of the said road piece.
For more than a year, the prosecutor and criminal police court have handled the missing case.
A cycle path was repeatedly blocked at Marxgrün and examined with sonar instruments, because the investigators suspect that in the course of the new construction of the Staatsstraße 30 years ago Heike's body might have been sharpened here.
Color powder and eggs: Krawalle in Barcelona before Catalonia anniversary
On Monday the controversial independence referendum will be held in Catalonia for the first time.
But before, it's coming to Krawallen.
The separatists have not forgotten the police intervention of autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan Independence referendum of 1 October 2017, clashes between separatists and police occurred in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by the independence advocates, among other things with color powder, when they wanted to prevent them from approaching a demonstration of the National Police and the Civil Guard.
Some 3000 police officers from the Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil police units wanted to honor their colleagues with a rally that was used last year in the election venues as an illegal referendum.
In an attempt to prevent citizens from taking part in the vote, violence also arose at the time.
The Catalan police would have formed a chain to keep the separatists and central government security forces separate, Spanish media reported.
Some of the 6000 separatists, however, would have tried violently to break the police chain and, among other things, would have been throwing the officials with color bags and eggs.
Six people had been arrested, 24 others had been slightly injured, and the authorities had been called upon to do so.
On Monday, for the first time, the independence referendum will be held.
Following the vote and a subsequent decision to divide the wealthy region of Spain, the central government in Madrid placed Catalonia under forced administration in autumn 2017.
The then regional president Carles Puigdemont fled to exile in Belgium.
Other politicians also settled abroad.
On the other hand, several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement continue to sit in U-Haft.
In December, new elections were held in the region.
After the accession of the new Catalan government in May, the forced administration was terminated.
But the new regional president Quim Torra also has the right to self-determination of Catalans.
Football: Oberliga Westphalia: Collected Counseling: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen separate torlos
Red-white Ahlen continues to appear.
Even with the FC Gütersloh, there was only a 0:0 difference.
The final light and the third-last they unplugged in front of 438 spectators in the Heidewald stadium as a assembled councillessness.
The first half could be overlooked by the entertainment factor arg.
Therefore, anyone who preferred to get a beer or a bratwurst could do so unscathed.
There was no risk of missing a torch because there was practically none.
First shot after half an hour
Güterslohs Nick Flock was responsible for the first (harmless) goal shot of the entire party in the 28th minute.
The best - and in principle the only real - option was the Ahlener, when Cihan Yilmaz forced FCG-Torwart Frederic Westergerling to a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the prison room border.
Even more harmless were the hosts.
Their most effective action was in an early shift.
Stormer Lars Schröder had to be exchanged for injury, for him was Sinan Aygün.
After the change, both teams decided to do something against the growing boredom.
In the 48th minute Sebastian Müttel, 18 metres above the housing, and after an hour too, the freight shedrs appeared openly for the first time.
After a ball conquest by Matthew Wieckowicz, it went fast.
The quickly presented counter over Sinan Aygün-Kroente - Nick Flock (62.) with a rather laced shot into the arms of RWA-Torwart Bernd Schipmann.
In addition, with a headball of Wieckowicz (66.) they followed a corner ball of the ex-Ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA interim trainer Angelo Daut responded, first bringing Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60.) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mutzel (70.).
It did - nothing.
More than optical superiority thanks to its own initiative, the Ahleners did not succeed.
It was only in the 91st minute that Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but it also didn't bring in anything.
Angelo Daut then tried to strike out the positive: \"I like that we played zero, but unfortunately the zero also stood at the front.
“We weren’t as dangerous this time as we were against wooden wickedes and that although our opponent didn’t want to play with us, RW Ahelns’ interim coach.
Offensively, everything was a bit of a fight against a team that only wanted to defend.
In any case, I didn't feel like we could get a opponent, so that's what Daut.
To his suffering, however, as a spectator, one did not feel as if his team could shoot a goal.
For that, the idea was too urgent.
Reaching Fields Harvest Thanks Market: Fortunately there are enough Kreimers
Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler are pleased with the range of table editions for which these donations are intended.
The Honorary Insurances: \"These donations also remain in Reckenfeld\"
At the opening, the sky was bright blue, the place on the other hand was still a little empty, but that should change over the course of the day.
Because, “It’s so beautiful here, so we’re here today,” said one visitor.
The organiser of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit as always with a decent pristine humor.
Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer entered for the couple Brockmann, which was supposed to be weighed against food.
Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) became ill.
But there's enough Kreimers.
And the \"replace\" did not allow itself to entertain the growing visitors in between.
It was so good that some folk songs were sung later.
“Simply great - Marcel Kreimer was happy.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to put the opening date in his schedule this time.
He is pleased with the many active people with their booths, including mostly clubs.
“ Actually, there should not be something like a table at all, ” he thanked himself for the action of the men’s choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the use of all those who were in service at the stands and also included the other festivals held in September and the “Clean Up Action”.
Our garden town has a colorful painting - here's what goes.
Then the maikranche was taken from Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück with the help of the firefighter and brought to the winter quarter.
Many stands have been worked for the physical well-being.
From sweet to hearty was all to have.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has been living in Reckenfeld for only a year, was creative on his decupier saw.
Furnishings, beer cover with fields of reach motifs and a lot more he had on offer.
A specialty offered three fields of imker: \"Reckenfelder honey\" brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Weedershoven and Helen Roth-Bushschlüter.
The latter has another specialty.
Honey cake in the glass, of course with honey from my own production.
The little Elsa had to get back on her, so the cake tasted so good.
It is the gathering that allowed the visitors to stay for a long time until the evening hours, even without a stage programme that does not exist at the autumn festival.
Lubrication with local political message: No successful advertising for skate plant
In Lengerich, unknowns have hardly promoted the construction of a skate plant.
In several places there are appropriate lubrications, says Jürgen Kohne from the city administration on request of the WN.
In at least one case, criminal charges have been filed with the police for damage to the property.
In large letters, the three words “Skatepark für Lengerich” are pronounced on signs, among others at the Gempt-Halle and the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, manager of Halle, reports that after the professional election fair on 19 September, a corresponding letter was discovered on the advertising sign at the stairway to the Gempt-Bistro.
Since the short message of his time had apparently been left “only” with an edding, they could easily be removed.
\"Only days later, however, it was there again, this time sprayed up, as Rottmann said.
He assumes that the corresponding advertising sign must be replaced.
A special note is given in this case by the fact that on the table several large companies from Lengerich are also mentioned.
If the skates are built, their realization is also to be made possible by sponsors.
In addition, Jörg Hesselmann of the urban department of school, sport and culture, explains without naming.
It is possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the damaged table.
For years local policy and administration have been dealing with the theme of skatemaking.
After the old ones had been mined at the truck clinic, after some time the search for an alternative location began.
Finally, the Council largely voted in favour of the Firearm Park.
However, this was not implemented - too many factors apparently spoke against a construction at this site.
At the end of June, a turnover followed.
The members of the Chief and Financial Committee voted unanimously for the Gutenberg School area.
Jürgen Kohne says about the state of things that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning.
The last word is the City Council.
He makes a decision this year, so that he can be built in a positive vote in 2019.
Closer flight safety fit is getting worse
Frankfurt/Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos in summer, the German air traffic fleets see no signs of improvement in the coming year.
“This year we had wind, 2019 we will have strong wind, and then the storm will come,” said the chief of the trade union of aviation security, Matthias Maas, the German press agency in front of the aviation summit on 5 October in Hamburg.
An important reason for the numerous delays and failures is the long-standing need for personnel in the European air navigation system, for which there is no quick solution.
“Airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year, but training new lorries takes four to five years,” said the trade unionist.
The market for ready-made lotteries was empty across Europe.
Only in the centre of Karlsruhe to monitor the upper German airspace were about a hundred missing.
Maas again criticized the fact that various air transport unions were not invited to the summit.
In Hansestadt, on Friday, representatives of the Federal Government, the countries, air navigation, airlines and airports meet to address the causes of delays.
“If you want to talk about additional work compression and overtime, this will not go without us,” said the head of GdF, who has many members in Germany’s own German air navigation system.
Maas again took responsibility for the Lotsen Mission's provisions.
Transport forecasts for the regulatory period running until 2019 were far too low.
The resulting costs and personnel savings in national air navigation systems are now fully linked to operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Minister for Transport Andreas Scheuer (CSU), in Brussels, for regulations that do not further detract air from air navigation security.
At present, EU regulations would be coordinated by 2024 and further tightening would be feared.
The EU was constantly exposed to lobbying by airlines.
“Ryanair chief Michael O’Leary and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they have sown themselves in recent years,” Maas said.
He hoped that the high delay costs would lead to a rethinking of airlines.
The GdF will only contribute to the improvement of the situation if the German Air Safety Agency (DFS) offers a \"voting training and future package,\" Maas said.
The previously announced admission of 120 lottery students per year over the next five years is sufficient just to compensate for the age-related losses.
The necessary personnel are not yet connected.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board agrees for group conversion
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously for the plans to rebuild the Group.
According to the will of Thyssenkrupp-Interimsführer Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed Chairman of the Executive Board at the meeting on Sunday, the crippled group is to be split into two independent companies.
Both companies should have their seat in food and be listed on the stock exchange.
There should be no additional reduction in staff beyond the already known cuts in the administration.
After two withdrawals, the control body on the capital side only counts eight heads.
Ten representatives of the employees are opposed.
However, the final decision is expected to take a general meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG will include, among other things, the 50 percent share of the merged steel business with the Indian partner Tata.
In the second company Thyssenkrupp Industries AG, the business is to be bundled with elevators and supplies.
Barcelona: Violence among demos by police and Catalan independence advocates.
Two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish police and Catalan independence advocates in Barcelona have led to violent conflicts with numerous casualties.
According to the city administration, about 3000 policemen from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as well as some 6,000 supporters of independence demonstrated.
The Catalan police tried with a big offer to keep the two protesters away from each other.
However, according to the competent authorities, independence advocates repeatedly tried to break the security barrier.
They attacked the officials with color and gunshots.
According to Rangeleien, there was also the information between the participants of the various protest groups.
24 people were injured, according to the records of rescue personnel.
The police told us there were six arrests.
Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues
With its demonstration, the police wanted to honour the colleagues who had gone against the independence referendum prohibited by the Spanish central government in Catalonia almost a year ago.
At the same time, they demanded better salaries.
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil feel it is unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers earn significantly more than they do.
The demonstrators felt it was provocation that the Spanish policemen were demonstrating in Barcelona.
“Why did they come to protest here,” asked the 55-year-old Catalan demonstrator Manel Perez of the news agency AFP.
It's just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they've messed us up a year ago.
A 31-year-old police officer of the Balearic Islands, who only wanted to give his name to Daniel, rejected the accusation.
“Of course, we want to support our comrades who have only done their duty last year: defend the law,” he said.
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we are doing it in Barcelona because it is a big European city and there is more echo here.
He and his colleagues, however, “did not come to provoke,” assured the police officer.
Panne allowed access to personal data of British Minister

Football: Juve coach praises after top party: Ronaldos best game
The Portuguese star-stummer played the best game this evening together with the half-hour of Valencia, praising Juve-Coach Massimiliano Allegri after the 3:1 (1:1) victory of the record champion against the SSC Naples.
For the trainer, the expensive bought-in star was also without its own goal the decisive man in the important party against the pursuer.
“Ronaldo had a lot of fun and it’s good,” Allegri said.
Although we started with tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good at our first gate - and from the moment we grew up.
Thanks to Ronaldo's three goals, Juve turned the game after the early fall through the hit of Dries Mertens (10th minute) and depended on the worst pursuer first.
The Torjager, obtained by Real Madrid, first set up the former Bundesliga-Profi Mario Mandzukic, who provided a double pack (26/49.) for the tour.
And Ronaldo, after a corner by headball, also had to prepare for the hit of the defense chief Leonardo Bonucci (76.), who had to move in just before the goal line.
“He gave many presentations - he praised the trainer.
But Allegri also wants to see goals from the attacker, who is both in the Champions League and in the Portuguese national team of record-torch.
“We need to become even better at serving him,” the coach demanded.
Best Juve gatekeeper is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three on the account.
With Ronaldo's purchase for more than 100 million euros, Juventus' overpowering seems even more oppressive.
Seven wins in seven games is the flawless series in the series A. At 21 points, the master of the last seven years already has six counters leading to Naples.
The second table, trained by the former Bayer-Coach Carlo Ancelotti, was not without chance against Turin.
But at the latest after the seat of the already warned Mario Rui (58.) the top party was decided.
The Portuguese had to climb against Paulo Dybala with yellow-red from the square after a tough climb.
“We played well against a good Naples,” commented the Turin Coach.
Emre Can was also able to feel that way.
The German national player went through with Juve.
The professional who came from the FC Liverpool was in service at all seven league parties.
The midfielder also played against Valencia in the Champions League party, which allegri said with a half hour: Ronaldo had flown from the place at the 2:0 victory of the Turiners and is locked for the home game on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West changes his name
With a particularly scurvy appearance, Rapper Kanye West has provided attention at the US TV show \"Saturday Night Live\" on weekends.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume provided foreheads and question marks for the spectators.
The 41-year-old also announced a name change to the release of his new album.
From now on, you can only call him \"Ye\", the musician says.
“The being formerly known as Kanye West, he tweeted in response to the late singer Prince, when he put down his artist name.
The pseudonym, however, is no novelty.
The tenth album was already released under this name.
In an interview with the radio station KRRL, the artist had explained that \"Ye\" has a religious significance for him.
“I believe ‘Ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means ‘du’, so the rapper.
Football: Kreisliga A1 Münster: Finally!
Created!
Hoetmar's coach Averhage made no helm out of his disappointment.
That was a weak game of ours today.
The opponent was simply more witty, we put him in trouble as well as never before - according to thin reading the list of Hoetmar's shot options.
Grade two torchancs in 90 minutes, so only rare games can be made positive.
Football-Kreisliga A1: SC Hoetmar is under SG Sendenhorst with 0:2 (0:1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG also had only two options in the first passage, but the first one used Maik Krause from a pointed angle to the early lead (7.).
In the 43th minute Steffen Uphus could have increased, but after great preliminary work by Krause, he stood free.
The hosts had only a double possibility when, at first, Moritz Höne failed to meet Torsteher Jos Schuhmacher and in the after-sale Jan Blome also found his master in the Sendhorster Keeper.
After the break the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49th), Julian Turl (61st,) and Heinz Linnemann (69th) all donated.
A trade meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved by hand on the gateline and saw red for it - could also not use Niklas Eilmann for the guests (75.).
Only when Nils Berheide punched the ball over the line was the party decided (81.).
“We had been harshly criticized before, which was different today from the last few weeks - was the conclusion of Florian Kraus.
Sendhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77th Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90th Leibig), Turl.
Tore: 0:1 Krause (7.), 0:2 Berheide (81.).

Football: Kreisliga A2 Münster: Spektakefootball in Albachten: GW Albersloh is under Concordia with 3:4
“I don’t even know what to think of it, ” he says.
“We don’t have access to them at all,” he said,“and he thought it was the wingsnails with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but probably also all the other green whites that were on collective offensive.
He could still laugh: “A dirty victory,” he still said, swindled furiously and drew from then his players, on the other hand, the easement was to note that they had pulled themselves out of business with three points.
Well-marked, after a duel of two teams, one of whom, namely Albaten, plays for the championship and the other, Albersloh, fights for the class.
With understandable mixed feelings, GWA trainer Sven Lewandowski looked back at the 90 minutes that lay behind him.
“This was by far our best season performance,” he says.
\"As we come back after the 0:2 as we hold against one of the league's top teams over the entire season, that was really phenomenal already.\"
All the more bitter it was that you now had to go home with empty hands.
Top-Torjäger Lars Zymner led the host with his 12th season hit (24th).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this goal.
The 2:0 he placed on the left side patterned for Fabian Frünning (39.).
We knew this, but you can't take it out completely.
“This was already madness, which he did,” Lewandowski recognised the enemy’s quality.
Shortly before the change of sides, his own elf was able to compensate: McGill's free jump from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia-Torhücher Hinkerohe into the long toreck (45.).
After the change of page it was again McGill who achieved the compensation (59.).
After that, it went back and forth.
It was a clumsy, action-loaded game.
Nübel again shocked Albachten (64.), only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann looked like him (69.).
Despite overnumber, Albersloh was no longer able to counter the last Concordia hit again (80.).
We now need to concentrate on Wednesday.
“The game against sheep animals, that’s what we have to win now,” Lewandowski said.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbucker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87th Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87th Bareksai).
Tore: 1:0 Zymner (24), 2:0 Frünning (39.), 2:1 McGill (45.), 2:2 McGill (59.), 3:2 Nübel (64.), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69.), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80.).
Yellow-red: Atalan (74./Albachten).

According to media reports, the entire Bureau of Football-Tweitligist Dynamo Dresden has resigned.

Evangelical Academy Tutzing: Prominent guests and new offers
The Evangelical Academy Tutzing offers about 80 meetings by the middle of next year.
As a result, France's President Emmanuel Macron has signaled his intention to pick up the Tolerance Prize personally in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff the term of office was too short: as a Federal President he was not in Tutzing's Evangelical Academy.
But before and after, Wulff was a guest there.
This is how Academy Director Udo Hahn calculated him, when he proudly said: \"All the Federal Presidents and Chancellors were with us already, that at the Academy in Tutzing Castle there were always celebrities, but was also a topic in the presentation of the annual programme.
At the end of October, Liedermacher Konstantin Wecker participates in a conference on spiritual experience in a philosophical perspective, on 29 September, author Frido Mann is at a conference about his grandfather Thomas Mann.
Meanwhile, France's President Emmanuel Macron has also promised: He wants to personally accept the “tolerance award” awarded to him by the Academy in Tutzing, which in another category also receives television moderator Dunja Hayali (we reported).
The around 80 meetings will take place until mid-2019.

Music Cabaret: Gender Understanding with Heart - Wolbeck - Westphalian News
\"The musical cabaret with Tina Teubner was suitable for both adults and men on Friday evening in the Hall of Christ's Church in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret testin, Teubner stopped the gender understanding, not only with humor and warmth for the (feeling) woman and the (feeling) man and what else might exist, but also with music.
The mini guitar put her in and also mastered her violin.
Ben Süverkrüp sat on the wing.
On the one hand, he is the male sparring partner who sometimes also comes to the end of the sentence, on the other hand a true pianist: So congenial harmoniously accompanied Suverkrüp Teubner, that some may have desired a solo.
There was also, with Beethoven and Chopin, but different, that is, as it suited to the red thread of the evening.
There Teubner had put a paradox into play: The satisfaction of the husband comes when he has a partner, but he doesn't open the door.
A closed door without a partner, on the other hand, brings no benefit.
The piano solo demonstrates the same: What would have come out of Mozart's composing, would the door have been unhappily opened?
Thus, Suverkrüp glides over in improvisations, from Bach's head full of blood and wounds, into the song of death, and Mozart's g-moll symphony into a playful dance.
There was great applause and “Bravo” from the full hall.
Flowers handed over Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the association, the chansonette.
However, the chairman Heidemarie Markenbeck did not receive any additional thanks.
She had the idea to give the duo, in addition to performances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt, one in Wolbeck.

The Ahlers had problems especially with the third-liga player Carolin Stallmann, who marked ten hits alone.

We didn't get them in the grip - as ASG-Coach Dogan Aydogdu did.

The ASG therefore ran behind a residue almost to the end, at 11:12 a.m. and later at 15:18 (45).
Only by the end of the year did the wider bank of the hostess become decisive.

International: Turkish municipality: mosque opening as missed opportunity
The Turkish Community in Germany (TGD) criticized the way in which the great Ditib mosque was inaugurated in Cologne by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
“The mosque opening in Cologne has left behind a barn cluster in the German-Turkish relationship, which can only be worked together with effort,” said the chairman of the TGD, Gökay Sofuoglu, the German editorial network.
Both the Turkish and the German side had missed the chance to have a joint, conciliatory appearance.
\"On the side with German top politicians to emphasize the belonging of Muslims to Germany, Erdogan has used the term for his purposes - accused Sofuoglu.

After the long summer break, folktreff time is finally back.
On October 18th (Donnerstag) at 7.30 pm, the Heimatverein Nottuln already organises his fifth folktreff Nottulner in the fireplace room of the Old Amtmannei.
Almost on the day exactly then it was a year ago that we had a folk meeting for the first time.
Meanwhile, this event has become an integral part of the musical event calendar in Nottuln - is pleased with Hanns Moormann, chairman of the Nottulner Heimatverein.
I wouldn't have thought that our folk meeting was so fast in Nottuln eta.
Whether Sturmtief Friederike was busy in January or heat wave in July, the fireplace room of the Amtmannei was always full.
“As always, the programme at the next Folktreff is a colorful mix of German folk, hiker and sailor songs, folk songs, evergreens and old beaters,” says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who repeatedly invites friends to Nottuln.
For the first folktreff birthday, Klaus Spellmeyer has promised his accordion.
He was a member of a group from the neighbouring district of Steinfurt, which played music with German lyrics for many years.
Now he's on the road with an Irish folk band.
The makers of the Folktreff are happy to remember the last event in the summer when Christoph Schulz of the Folktreff Emsdetten, with his international version of the song \"Frösche at night\", excited the listeners and sent them home with an ear worm.

From pure fruit growing to ecology
With a gala in the Dr. Stammerger Hall, the 125-year-old existence of the district association for horticulture and country care was celebrated.
On 29 September 1893, with a fruit show at the Kulmbacher Vereinshaus, the last founding impulse was set for the district association for horticulture and country care Kulmbach, and exactly 125 years later, on Saturday evening, he celebrated a great anniversary in the Kulmbacher Stadthalle.
In 1893, he was raised from baptism by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa.
The purpose of the fruit-building association also differed from today's work - it was actually purely about the fruit-building, about flowers and gardening, nobody thought about it at that time.
“At that time, in the era of enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite child of elites,” said Günter Dippold, district home nurse in his festival lecture.
Fruit trees should swim long distances, in schools so-called industrial gardens were built.
The fruit cultivation is still the task of the 55 horticultural associations in the Kulmbach district, which comprise almost 7000 members.
But with that, the spectrum is by far not exhausted.
A natural gardening, biological plant protection, village beauty and nutrition play a major role as well as imparting knowledge, a healthy diet and youth work.
The numerous tasks of a horticultural association were shown by the members of the Huchzdorf Youth Group (Mulworms) on stage.
“The youth work is urgently needed in the digital age,” said the county chairman Günter Reif, as well as OB Henry Schramm stressed how important experiences in nature are for life.
The chestnut collection was a giant thing for us children, I doubt that you can gather with smartphone & co. similarly much joy.
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with Landrat Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
\"Where to stand, the association decided - complemented Landrat Söllner and highlighted the special importance of the horticultural associations for the villages.
The association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the district also left no doubt about it by the district manager and specialist consultant Friedhelm Haun.
He led the many visitors through the long history of the association and reported, among other things, the need for self-sufficiency after the war.
In the past everything came out of the garden, for the winter it was dipped in.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the utility garden turned into a ornamental and residential garden.
“Nature has existed, she was there before us, and we have to focus on her,” said the expert for fruit and nut trees.
Therefore, for the horticultural associations, there is an incentive not to let down, so that our homeland remains beautiful and viable.
It also included welcoming the new citizens in our associations, the president of the Bavarian Landsverband, Wolfram Vaitl.
“We have to stop the eclatant decline in insects, which we owe to our children and grandchildren, Günter Reif closed the successful festival, which was solemnly framed by the turbulence of the Thurnau music club.

Priority for Nafta talks: Canada's Foreign Minister moves UN-Rede
Mexico's government wants clarity in matters of Nafta: they put both trading partners an ultimatum for an agreement.
Canada's Foreign Minister now gives absolute priority to the trade agreement and shifts her speech to the United Nations.
Due to the time pressure from the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with the USA and Mexico, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has postponed her speech at the UN General Debate in New York.
Instead of speaking this Saturday, the Minister will not speak until Monday before the United Nations General Assembly, she spoke to Adam Austen.
In the meantime, they focus on the renegotiation of Nafta.
On Friday, the Mexican Minister for Economic Affairs Ildefonso Guajardo had declared that the negotiating leaders of Canada and the United States would have agreed for 48 hours if Canada actually wanted to join the trade agreement between its country and the United States.
The United States and Mexico had agreed to a recast of the Naphtha Regional Free Trade Agreement in August.
US President Donald Trump pointed out that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.
The talks about a new edition have been going on for over a year.
By Sunday evening (local time) they will now be brought to a conclusion, Trump's government intends to submit the agreement to the U.S. Senate before 1 October.
In the event of a failure of the negotiations, Mexico's designated president Andres Manuel López Obrador announced on Friday that he would endeavour to reach a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against presidential candidates Bolsonaro
The Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, injured by a knife attack, left the hospital.
The right-wing Ex-Militar wanted to fly to Río de Janeiro, where he lived, according to a report from the daily newspaper \"O Globo\".
After his dismissal, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will hold public performances in the South American country before the presidential elections last week.
At the beginning of September, the politician was attacked in South Brazil during an election campaign.
Meanwhile, in several Brazilian cities thousands of people went on the streets to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title \"Ele não\" (in German: \"The Not\") women's associations had called for protests against the ex-military.
Even in social networks, the associations against Bolsonaros made racist and women's contemptuous statements mobile.
Several thousand demonstrators were expected in the São Paulo economic metropolis.
In the capital of Brasilia, the protests were mixed with a proclamation by the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers' Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He took the position of ex-president Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to twelve years in prison for corruption and therefore must not apply.
The presidential election in Brazil was held on 7 October.
As ex-citizen of the million city of São Paulo, Haddad was in polls far behind the right-wing candidate Bolsonaro.
Although the \"Trump Brazils\" has long been involved in politics, it has recently been presented as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates in the first round of elections reach the absolute majority, there will be a fine election on 28 October.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not succeed from this - no matter who he goes against.
Bolsonaro is known for hating homosexuals and blacks and glorifying military dictatorship (1964-1985).
Again and again, he shocks with verbal enticings.
Another time he said that the supporters of Lulas left-wing workers party were to be shot.

After long illness: Danish rock legend died
The Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 years after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen informed on Larsen's website.
On the deathbed Larsen was surrounded by his wife and his six children.
The musician had been in treatment since the beginning of the year because of prostate cancer.
Larsen had become familiar with the band Gasolin', which was extremely successful in Scandinavia in the 1970s.
Their songs were influenced by international music sizes such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and Beatles.
After the resolution of the band in 1978 Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold about three million records in Denmark.
From 1983, his album “Midt om notten” is the most sold album in Denmark.
On Sunday, Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen honored Larsen as \"street boys\" but was in all hearts.
Moreover, the Head of Government reminded us that the monarchy enemy Larsen occurred in 2010 on the 70th birthday of the Danish Queen Margrethe II.
Rock night in the shoe factory: volume at press air hammer level
\"Here we stand, take the bone saws and light a concert evening with the power of a tiger - alone the band names of \"Here We Stand\" - \"Tiger Bonesaw\" and \"The Ignition\" suggest such a rewrite of the rocky live music experience on Saturday evening in the hall of the citizens' centre shoe factory: Hardrock pure of three with another friends.
After the sound check and just before the concert starts, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
Of lamp fever there is no trace.
Afterwards, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all in conjunction with the Booking Agency Mosquito - from Oelde - with their bands are loudly looking at the 120 visitors of the Mint Mosquito Rock Night.
The Quartet - Tiger Bonesaw - with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika also knows how to convince at the start of the concert evening with the latest, unknown pieces from his own spring and the next CD.
In front of the stage the band is danced to the vocal and impressive interplay.
Even though \"admission\" calls are not to be overlooked, \"Tiger Bonesaw\" then leave the stage to the trio \"Here We Stand\".
At the same time, guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on the bass and drummer Kai Hölscher, demonstrate that hard rock is not the same as hard rock.
After the \"High Energy Rock\" the \"Tigers\" is added to the \"Here We Stand\" a synthesizer is also used in addition to the guitar rock.
Not only is it a longing, balladous “Take Me Home” that impresses by changing melodic passages to the guitar-laden rock riffs of the multi-layered songs.
Since its founding in 2005, the Quartet - The Ignition - from Tönnishüschen has been playing a special degree of fame.
The band presents its hard rock on Saturday full agility.
The fact that the \"The Ignition\" with its performances before the very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the 2017 tour in China - has special stage experience is obvious and inconceivable.
In conjunction with the band, singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann also uses the only covered song of the evening, \"Word Up\" by Cameo from the 80s, quite their own accents.
At the same time, guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers a rejuvenated solo to the sound that is even higher than before, while he is running through the audience.
Of course, a certain volume is of course part of this kind of hard rock concert: at the Mint Mosquito Rocknacht, the Mischpult team's information at the Threeer concert of \"Here We Stand\" and \"Tiger Bonesaw\" and \"The Ignition\" is about 98 decibels.
This is, for example, at the press air hammer level, but it is still clearly below the controls of the \"wake-fesitval\" on the \"The Ignition\" on their website.
At this rock night, the Ahlen audience doesn't need to listen to 120 decibels in nozzle-powered lute as usual, as in the annual metal-stelldichein in the north of the Republic.
After almost four hours, the three bands of harder, rocky gangart have long convinced with their sovereign, virtuoso play and their own compositions.
\"Here we stand, have taken the bone saws and set a concert evening with the power of a tiger - all three groups, of course in a transmitted sense, can say at the end.
And especially enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

A death by sail plane accident at Essen/Mülheim Airport
At Mülheim/Essen Airport, a fatal accident occurred.
A sailing airplane was crashed on Sunday in a parking lot at Mülheim/Essen Airport.
The pilot died in the accident.
Near the airport of Mülheim/Essen, a fatal accident occurred on Sunday.
As reported by the \"Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung\", a sailing aircraft was crashed at the Messeparkplatz at the airport.
The pilot was killed.
As the “WAZ” continues, the flight student was on board alone - the plane is supposed to be a resident.
At the time of the accident, the plane was already in landing.
The crash site is only a short distance from a fortress on the airport grounds.
But since this weekend there has been an October festival.
Mülheim/Essen Airport is located on the border of the two Ruhr area cities and directly on the way to motorway 52.
From the parking lot there is a Park&Ride offer at large events at the Essen fair or the Gruga Hall in Essen.
Trump urges Kim: “And then we fell in love.
The fact that despite the nuclear crisis, the US President of North Korea's power-holder Kim is quite well-off is not a secret.
But Trump has now made a genuine statement of love to his colleague.
She also has to do with Kim's beautiful letters.
At the tender age of 72, the married U.S. president has become known as a new flame.
The Tragic: It is a distance relationship.
On Saturday, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to the North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un.
In front of supporters in the U.S. state of West Virginia, Trump found almost tender words for the half so old spray of the reigning dynasty from Pyongyang, although the atomic disarmament in the rings around North Korea proves to be quite tender chunks.
“I was very hearty, he was, too, and between us it went and around,” said Trump.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And not only the conversations with Kim had brought his heart to melt.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Her personal connection also bore political fruit: Trump referred to the stoppage of all nuclear and rocket tests announced by Kim, even though critics have so far seen little more than lip confessions.
That the affection for whether or not his martial threat was notorious for \"Rocket Man\" - so Trump's nickname for Kim - would not be any memoryr seemed to be quite conscious to the U.S. President.
In any event, he took the expected criticism of his appearance in a large sports hall in Wheeling City straight ahead: “Donald Trump says they fell in love,
How terrible, how terrible is that?
That's so unpresidial.
But to him, it was very little, so Trump explained, and then directed his index finger to the crowd: “I have always told you that it is so easy to be presidential,
But then there wouldn't be 10,000 people out there pushing into this messy arena, but we'd only have 200 people out there.
October festival attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler Best visited, moody as well as above-three pampered by sun sat: Very varied and with a good shot of Oktoberfestflair Baesweiler's inner city on Sunday has pushed out.
For the first time, the Oktoberfest took place not only in the fortress at the Firearm Tower, but was extended to the City by the Trade Association on Sunday.
Refugees saved thanks to video from Libyan prison
Nigerian refugees have pointed out their catastrophic detention conditions in Libya with the help of a mobile video, thus enabling their rescue.
The group had shot in its cell in the coastal town of Sawya in July under the risk of life and spread online.
“They refuse to send us back,” said a man in the video message.
We suffer here, we die here.
The recording was sent to the “France 24 Observers” website, whose editors alerted the International Migration Organisation (IOM).
The refugees were finally fled to Nigeria at the end of August.
“Without the video we could not have returned to Nigeria,” said Efe Onyeka, who had recorded the video, the AFP news agency.
The 25-year-old was arrested in Libya in an attempt to reach Europe via the Mediterranean.
With the video, he brought himself to life by his own statement.
One of his associates was almost beaten to death by the guards, Onyeka said.
In general, the detention conditions were disastrous: “They beat us all with pipes and plugs,
They didn't give us anything to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organises the voluntary return of refugees stranded in Libya.
About 2,700 migrants from Nigeria were sent back to their homeland this year with the help of the programme, said IOM spokesperson in the West African country, Jorge Galindo.
The case of the now saved Nigerians is not exceptional in view of the poor terms of detention in Libya.
But he hasn't heard of a phone video call.
International organizations have long criticised the conditions in Libyan refugee camps as humane.
The North African state, which is dominated by too many militias, is the main transit country for migrants on the way from Africa to Europe.
When a teacher at Sunday afternoon went to the public school place to prepare her lessons for Monday, she was surprised by a burglar.
By 16:50 the teacher entered the building above the main entrance.
In the front house of the 1st floor, she saw a man who immediately fled.
Only through a door, then over the roof terrace and from there over a step into the ground floor or the courtyard.
The teacher informed the police who took the investigation.
Whether things or money have been stolen cannot yet be said.

German was caught in his own car for days
A 75-year-old man had to endure several days and nights in his car in a middle frank forest area after he had trapped the car away from all forest paths and blocked a tree's door.
Rescue forces accidentally discovered the car on Saturday afternoon near a pasture and released the missing since Tuesday evening, the police told it on Sunday.
The 75-year-old from Pleinfeld was reported to be in good health despite the cold nights and the long time without care.
He indicated that he was looking forward to his home.
The pensioner had been reported missing by his family after he had not returned on Tuesday from a trip with his land car across the local meadows and fields.
Despite intensive search measures, the man’s stay remained unclear for days.
Laschet mentions the rule of law in Turkey
Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) has called on the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to state his own rule of law in Turkey.
The relations between the two countries were, at present, “overestimated,” Laschet said on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne Airport.
This is particularly true of arrest waves, press and religious freedom.
He therefore made it clear to Erdogan that if relations are to be normalised in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, that the rule of law is a very important prerequisite for this,
Laschet also mentioned the cases of Germans sitting in prison in Turkey.
He expressed the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
Erdogan once again stressed the independence of Turkish justice.
Laschet and Erdogan had recently been transferred to a building prepared for flight by the Federal Ministry of Defense at Cologne Airport.
Originally, it was supposed to take place at Schloss Wahn - but the castle owners rejected it out of political conviction against Erdogan.
After the conversation Erdogan traveled on to the opening of the Ditib mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had canceled a joint appearance in the building.
But he said: \"The Muslims who go into this mosque are also citizens of our country\"
And we are also their contact - and not the Turkish President.
Lack of confidence in the United States: North Korea calls for disarmament
While U.S. President Trump is not tired of stressing the successes in the negotiations on denuclearisation of North Korea, the East Asian regime is more sobering.
Foreign Minister Ri calls for a meeting with Washington.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has ordered the US government to block negotiations for an nuclear-free Korean peninsula with its continued sanctions.
“The latest downturn is that the US is building on forced measures that are fatal to the formation of trust,” said Ri in New York.
A disarmament would be unthinkable to North Korea under these circumstances.
“Without any confidence in the US there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way that we will be the first to disarm ourselves,” the North Korean chief diplomat carried out.
The fact that criminal measures could force North Korea to 'knee' is 'a dream of people who don't know us'
In order to build confidence, however, his country has stopped its nuclear and rocket tests and destroyed a nuclear testing plant, Hob Ri.
The US side did not, however, give any 'responsive reactions', criticised by the Minister.
Because of North Korea's nuclear and rocket programme, the UN Security Council had adopted sanctions against the internationally isolated country three times last year.
U.S. President Donald Trump and his Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo have been pushing the United Nations to ensure strict compliance with the criminal measures in recent days.
At the same time, the U.S. government is working towards an approach.
In June Trump had first met North Korea's powermaker Kim Jong Un.
After the first summit in Singapore, the U.S. President set out for a second summit with Kim.
In October Pompeo is scheduled to return to Pyongyang to discuss the end of the North Korean nuclear weapons program.
The HoT serves: New kitchen with donations from the municipality
That they were actually in a youth meeting, many visitors of the house of the open door HoT got nothing with them: white blankets and flower decorations on the tables and a large buffet waiting for the guests after the harvest thanks service.
The young people of the HoT had enchanted the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The institution was funded by donations from the municipality, for which the young people wanted to thank the food.
The start with the new establishment was not easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the head of the HoT, recalls.
We had filled our refrigerators with food and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared for the big day.
But then the first day after the summer break came the bad surprise: a power failure had put the huge, two-piece refrigerator out of operation, the food was ruined and had to be disposed of.
“Now we had to start again from the beginning: Although we received a lot of support from friends and neighbors, the children and young people wanted to do it on their own, Westbour said.
And that's how everyone took it.
The result could be seen, the guests were excited.
“Betters can’t do it, too,” a visitor praised, while Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served or guests were allowed to serve on quiche, liver cheese or cake.
“It’s really great what the children and young people have put on their feet,” said parish priest Frank Beckmann, while magician Stephan Lammen, with card tricks and other pieces of art, caused surprises.
Jürgen Sator leaves the Head of State NRW of the Table
From frustration over criticism from their own ranks, the head of the Essen Table, Jörg Sartor, has delivered his posts in the Landesverband.
Sartor had become known nationwide because the Essen Table had introduced a recording stop for foreigners.
He had already resigned as Vice Chief of the NRW Task, said Sartor of the World on Sunday,
Too many fell into my back.
The head of the Tafeln-Landesverband NRW, Wolfgang Weilerswist, expressed his understanding of the dpa for the decision of his long-standing deputy.
The sharp criticism took Sartor.
“I can understand his step - people who didn’t know exactly why the Essene Table does that.”
Sartor, however, is still active for the Essen Table - \"six days a week, nothing changes in it - so Weilerswist.
Sartor again criticized colleagues of other tables in the world on Sunday.
One should not follow the approach, \"without us hungering the people of the city\"
It is up to the state to ensure that people do not starve.
The Essener did not attend a congress of tables on Friday in Berlin.
“That’s where too much sweet dirt is told to me,” he said.
There are these whole social fuzzis, which have criticized me so much at the time.
SF Lorch play 2:0 lead - Gmünder day post
Football, district league Lorch loses against Neuler 2:3 - TV Heuchlingen wins in Kirchheim after resistance - bed rings clear Lauchheim.
With 2:0 Lorch was already in the lead in the home game against the TV Neuler - at the end it was 2:3 and the disappointment with the sports friends was great.

Gladbach plays two-time guided tour - Schalke without Embolo with first victory
Borussia Mönchengladbach must continue to wait for an outward victory in Wolfsburg.
At 2:2, the foals play a lead twice.
Schalke comes against Mainz for the first season victory (1:0).
(sda) Four times Schalke has maneuvered himself in the first five league games with early opponents.
Now Domenico Tedesco's team put that strength back on the day with which it had held the first place behind the Bayerns in the last season.
Alessandro Schöpf led the home team in the eleventh minute after strong preparatory work by Jewgeni Konopljanka by head, as a result the hosts preserved the mini-polster with a compact defensive performance.
Thanks to an extraordinary comeback, Borussia Dortmund greets new from the top of the Bundesliga.
The team of Lucien Favre had acted against Bayer Leverkusen until the break, but in the 2nd half of the season the team still won the 4th victory.
Jacob-Brown Larsen (65.) and Marco Reus (69.) compared with a doublette within four minutes, Paco Alcacer, who was replaced by Favre in the 63rd minute, provided another doublette in the final phase (86./94.) for the crowning conclusion of the increase in performance after the break.
VfB Stuttgart also won the first victory.
In the meantime, the Stuttgarters had to fear against Milos Veljkovic, because of a yellow-red map already decimated before the break.
Borna Sosa and the unnoticeable Goalie Ron-Robert Zieler manufactured a kurioses Einwurf-Eigentor, which helped the guests in the 68th minute to compensate.
Seven minutes later, however, Gonzalo Castro won the VfB for the first time.
In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang did not experience a complete successful but no failed debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
The Gladbachers, who joined the Swiss Quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang, took a lead twice, finally played 2:2 and continued to wait for an outward victory in the VW city since 2003.
For Wolfsburg's compensation to 1:1 Renato Steffen was in charge with his second Bundesligator.
Yann Sommer was powerless at the flat shot of 20 metres from the Aargauer, as was the second match after an hour.
Nevertheless, the trends at Gladbach are quite promising.
In the storm of the foals, Alassane Pléa is seen as a goaltender.
The French record purchase from the OGC Nice met for the third time in a row and for the seventh time in the seventh game.
After seven rounds, Gladbach holds 4th place.
Within 40 minutes, the previously unbeatable Werder Bremen was maneuvered against VfB Stuttgart in an uncomfortable situation.
After 19 minutes, the team of Florian Kohlfeldt was surprised by a Stuttgart counter, which the ex-Luganesi Anastasios Donis completed with his first season hit, after 36 minutes Milos Veljkovic continued to join his team: the 23-year-old Serbe was held after a jersey against Daniel Didavi Yellow-Rot.
While Stuttgart's defenders Borna Sosa and Goalie Ron-Robert goalters brought the Bremers back to the game through a kurioses Einwurf-Eigentor (68.), a quarter of an hour before the end, Gonzalo Castro shot back to the Siegesstrasse in excess of Stuttgart.
Nürnberg decided the duel against Dusseldorf 3:0 for himself.
After half an hour, Hanno Behrens took the home team on course by means of foulpenalty.
Macedonians vote on new state names
In Macedonia, around 1.8 million citizens today agree on whether their country's name should be changed to northern Macedonia.
In the case of a yes, the almost three-year-old conflict with the neighboring Greece could be resolved.
Athens had existed on a change of name because of its so-called northern province and had blocked any approach to Macedonia to the west.
The voters therefore also decide on the future West Integration.
The United States had announced that the country could quickly become a member of Nato at a positive outcome of the referendum.
Syrer in U-Haft.
Refugee attacked three women.
A Syrian brutally beat three pensioners and in part severely injured them.
On Friday, the 41-year-old asylum had ran into Alsergrund in the Flugtgasse on Friday, at about 22 o'clock.
When the police arrived, they addressed the accused, who went on passersby with balled fists, and tried to attack them, on his behavior.
Then the Syrians tried to beat and kick the officials.
Little later, it became apparent that the suspect had struck three older ladies (65, 67, 75) with his feet in Wahringer Straße at a tram stop.
In addition, he had stepped the Trio with his feet.
In some cases, the pensioners were seriously injured.
They suffered hematoma, bruises and brain damage.
The asylum was seriously injured, as the police called it, because it was still unknown.
He was hospitalized and monitored throughout treatment.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Almost a year after the marriage began, SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-standing friend Christoph Rohde.
The two of them gave themselves the jaword on Saturday in Hamburg.
A registered life partnership had not come into question for them, Kahrs had previously said the \"image\" newspaper.
“If we marry, then really he’s been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is the household political spokesman of the SPD-Bundestag Group and one of the spokespersons of the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD-Flügel.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of the marriage for homosexuals, Kahrs had excited with a rage on June 30, 2017.
For example, he had ordered Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to join the theme \"Stomped\".
“This was your Schabowski moment,” he said, in response to the accidental proclamation of the GDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since 1 October 2017, same sex couples can marry exactly like heterosexuals.
Before, they had been able to enter into their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example with adoption law.
Garden day: 400 meters hedge cut
There was a whole lot of work in front of the members of the Children's House and the Society for Leprakunde.
About 400 meters of hedge around the gardens of the inhabitants of the Pfründnerhaus should be cut.
Supported by the inhabitants, it went to work for about twelve supporters.
“We do this to reduce costs,” said Walter Schröer, Chairman of the Civil Society.
And it's got a lot of things.
Because of the hot summer we are late this time, but luckily it is now just a shape cut.
Because in spring you have already shaved the hedge once.
The following breakfast on the job has also been a long tradition.
“All should remain with forces, too,” said Walter Schröer.
World Cup in Rio: Hannes Aigner picks gold at the Kanuslalom World Cup
The Augsburger Hannes Aigner won the gold medal at the conclusion of the Canuslalom World Championship in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old set a perfect course on Sunday at the Olympia line.
Two years ago he had missed Olympia-Bronze by three hundred seconds.
I was well prepared, had already had enough rides here on the plant and it has fit everything today, said London 2012 Olympic Third.
In the goal, he threw his paddle away with joy and drew both arms to the heights, well knowing that at least it would be enough for a medal.
After all, he had four starting numbers.
But the six remaining starters were unable to stop his fable time of 89,69 seconds.
Second was the Czech Jiri Prskavec in front of the Russian Pawel Egg.
The police inspection Gauting mentioned the first invasion attempt of this autumn into a single-family house.
Fortunately, the perpetrators failed.
The days will be shorter - that's what burglars want to use again.
This is how the police inspection of Gauting mentioned the first attempt to break in this fall yesterday.
The alarm system is due to the fact that it remained at the one-family house on Königswieser Straße.
That was when the perpetrators laid hands on Friday just before 20 o'clock.
The burglars admitted that the residents were not at home.
The alarm system, however, apparently surprised her so much that she took flight without prey.

Pleate at Hertha: From reality: Bayern demands against Ajax
The predicate is unbeatable: the defeat in Berlin will not be liked by the FC Bayern.
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first intermediate for the term of Niko Kovac.
The first small power hole under the new Coach Niko Kovac is not intended to increase to greater autumn depth for the Munichers.
“A week ago you still had the impression that we are invincible.
Now a little bit of reality has taken us into account - Thomas Müller, after earning the 0:2 defeat at Hertha BSC and called for a reaction for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Who knows us, who knows that's getting us angry and we're going to give us gas for Tuesday.
For the first time since more than a year out there was no single goal shot, as at the same time of the previous season two mandatory games in series without victory, the table lead in the football league first lost to Borussia Dortmund.
Although the overall situation is not as dramatic as the final phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, the Record Master must be warned.
The FC Augsburg at 1:1 with its running-intensity man-on-man tactics and the Berliners through their playful needle stitch across the outside have delivered two blows within three days, as the most overwhelming Bayerns have yet to crack.
“Those who know FC Bayern know that we don’t like it and we’ll do everything we can to be successful again,” said Kovac.
On the other hand, with his losers in his city of birth, he was surprisingly gentle, and his first defeat as a Munich coach was merely due to a lack of opportunities.
A victory against Amsterdam and against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would still make the first stage of his term of office turn out to be positive, otherwise the tone might get worse.
Kovac did not take any exceptional measures before the second king-class appearance of this season after the 2:0 season at Benfica Lisbon.
After the day off on Sunday, as planned, the short preparation for the second round against Ajax, which had also forced Athens at the beginning of AEK 3:0.
“Now it caught us in two games, but we’re going to make our goals again,” announced National Team Captain Manuel Neuer.
As after the lost Pokal finale against Eintracht Frankfurt, Joshua Kimmich spoke in the same place, above all, clear text.
The legal defender acted in the role as a Mahner.
“I don’t think this is all bad, we have to rework it because we don’t make the multitude of opportunities and make mistakes in the back of the Olympic Stadium,” stressed the 23-year-old just before he left.
On the seventh day of the previous season, the Bayerns were even behind Dortmund with five counters, which has now taken off with a point of advance again.
And so Kimmich, with an eye-windling at least, was positive that the public debate about the supposedly unbeatable Bayern ended.
“Yes, that’s good already,” said the national player.
It's good for the league.
DFB boss in shooting line: Özil-Causa: sharp attack by Erdogan and Grindel
With heavy accusations, Turkish President Erdogan is calling for the exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, but defends the association line.
Now a new post is to be created.
Berlin - On different stages Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the clarity in the permanent dispute theme Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish President severely criticized the dealings with the ex-World Champion in Germany at the opening of the great Ditib mosque in Cologne, the DFB chief defended the association line.
On the early Sunday morning, Gindel, personally attacked by Özil, announced consequences from the Causa in the Mainzer ZDF-Sportstudio.
“In the future, we need to draw very precise conclusions, because we also have many players with a migration background in the U-teams, that something like that doesn’t repeat,” said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without a migration background as further integration officers.
At the same time, Grindel reiterated that Erdogan did not stand for the values of football and DFB.
This one had in sharp terms called for racism against Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our born and raised in Germany Mesut Özil and our Ilkay.
They excluded them from this society because they were able to take pictures with me in England - Erdogan said on Saturday in the Cathedral town.
Frankly, as their President, I was not able to digest the fact that our two young men, who had risen up to the German national team, were excluded.
Gündogan’s statement was that in contrast to Özil, he felt \"reasonablely treated by the DFB\" after the World Cup affair, which had started by taking photos of the two with Erdogan.
At the same time, he announced that he would like to face players in the future.
That someone says: If I win, I am German, if I lose, I am a migrant - that's not true.
\"That he has such an impression, I regret it very much, said Grindel.
We had to defend Mesut more, I always said that.
However, he does not see a basis for a return to the national team Özil.
In addition to the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon, the following will be appointed an additional integration officer.
“If someone has a significant impact on society and football without a migratory background and says, “The theme is important, we have to take care of it, that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our associations on the ground where integration needs to work,” said Grindel.
Despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair, he wants to run for the office again next year as DFB President.
“I do my job and try to make it as good as I can,” said Grindel.
Yearly, three accidents are built within three hours
Coburg/Rödental - As the police report, the 75-year-old caused the accidents on Friday between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m.
At first, the 75-year-old driver was addressed by a lady at the red traffic lights in the Lauter altitude area.
He told the pensioner that he was driving against her car.
There was no change of staff, however, as the 75-year-old could no longer find the lady in the parking lot.
A short time later, the police received a telephone call from a driver who had come down the road and drove against a footpath.
The man didn't want police on the spot and then drove away.
After that, the Rödentaler drove home.
However, the pensioner in his place of residence, where he has lived for decades, has worked and rammed a construction vehicle while turning.
Finally, the police were able to find him and stop him.
His car showed significant accident damage.
The 75-year-old made a wretched impression and couldn't remember much more.
The damage is around 1300 euros.
Moorbrand in Meppen: Still nearly 1000 operational forces in operation.
About four weeks after the outbreak of the Moorbrand on a federal defense site in Emsland, 980 workers are still employed in the clearing work.
The Bundeswehr announced this on Sunday.
Since the situation of a spokesperson continues to develop in a stable way, 70 volunteer assistants have recently been withdrawn.
A further reduction in the number of crews is planned, it says.
On the night of Sunday, an underground fire had been discovered and removed.
Last week, the disaster had been lifted, which had been proclaimed well a week earlier on September 21, because it was feared that the flames would endanger adjacent forests and settlements by means of wind and spark flight.
On Thursday it was said that the fire would no longer threaten neighboring communities.
At the time, more than 1500 force forces were trying to get the big fire under control on the spot.
The Luftwaffe supports the work on the Bundeswehrtestground at Meppen further with a transport helicopter.
There are also reconnaissance flights with drones of the federal army.
According to the Bundeswehr, information flights with \"Tornados\" are planned again for October 2nd and 5th.
The fire had been triggered by test rockets that had fired Airbus technicians.
The moor fire smoke flag was temporarily pulled up to a hundred kilometres across the northwest of Germany to Bremen.
On Monday, the Bundeswehr wants to set up a contact point to receive damage reports.
First claims for damages had already been announced by hoteliers and holiday home owners.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the main church of St. Katharines in Hamburg after their wedding.
Almost a year after the marriage began, the politician married his long-standing friend in Hamburg.
They've been a couple for 25 years.
Hamburg - Almost a year after marriage began for all, SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-standing friend Christoph Rohde.
The two of them gave themselves the jaword on Saturday in Hamburg.
A registered life partnership had not come into question for them, Kahrs had previously said the \"image\" newspaper.
If we get married, then right.
He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is the household political spokesman of the SPD-Bundestag Group and one of the spokespersons of the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD-Flügel.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of the marriage for homosexuals, Kahrs had excited with a rage on June 30, 2017.
For example, he had ordered Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to join the theme \"Stomped\".
“This was your Schabowski moment,” he said, in response to the accidental proclamation of the GDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since 1 October 2017, same sex couples can marry exactly like heterosexuals.
Before, they had been able to enter into their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example with adoption law.
referendum in Macedonia on new names of states began
In Macedonia, the referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state was expected to start with tension.
Around 1.8 million voters are expected to decide whether their state will be called North Macedonia in the future.
This is because of its northern province of the neighbouring Greece.
As a means of pressure, Athens had blocked any approach from Skopje to the EU and Nato for almost three decades.
If the citizens vote with yes, they will also give the start to western integration of their country.
Elie Wiesel - The author who saves the Shoah from forgetting

Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The register is intended to facilitate organ donation and relieve family members in stressful situations.
The new procedure does not alter the fact that organs may continue to be removed only with express consent, Swiss transplant emphasizes.
(dpa) Switzerland will start an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This is intended to facilitate organ donation and relieve family members in stressful situations.
People who want to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes are then available in the case of a Swiss transplant.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs - as in Germany - may only be removed with express consent, emphasizes Swiss transplant.
It is assumed that 15 percent of Swiss donors have a donation card, says Franz Immer, Director of the Swiss Transplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of cases, a card will be found at the crucial moment with possible donors.
In more than 60 percent of the talks, the relatives do not know the wishes of the deceased.
“You have to decide, in the sense of the deceased, what is often very burdensome, so always.
A similar registration system already exists in Great Britain.
In Germany there are considerations to store information about possible organ donation on the health insurance card, as the spokesperson of the Federal Centre for Health Information, Marita Völker-Albert says.
“There is no register for people to submit their wishes, per or counter organ donation,” she says.
Federal Minister for Health Jens Spahn has called for a new regime for organ donation.
According to his proposal, everyone would initially be considered organ donors unless he or she objected.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old student is world champion in headcounting
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is world champion in headcounting.
He spent the weekend in Wolfsburg against 39 fellow fighters.
Martina Flamme-Jasper told of the science museum Phaeno, the venue of the competition, on Sunday.
The 16-year-old Wenzel Grüss from Germany took third place.
The youngest WM participant was a twelve-year-old Japanese student, the oldest a 74-year-old pensioner from France, as lead judge Ralf Laue said.
The Computer Science Professor from Zwickau (Sachsen) organizes competition every two years.
Previous tasks included: 14.130 214 x 17.981.822 or 57.809.355 + 28 x 16.448.333.
Since spectators were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon where participants from the audience met with pocket calculators.
Wenzel Grüß from Lastrup demonstrated how to hold a ball with his head in the air while he was reclining.
He is one of seven Germans in competition.
A total of 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for competition.
Two years ago, the 14-year-old was in Bielefeld.
With terms such as super brain, genius or miracle child, organizer Laue can start little.
“Coupling can be trained,” he said.
Many participants exercised several hours a day.
In India or Singapore, even in stages, there are computing competitions.
The disciplines include, for example, square rootling of six-digit numbers.
In terms of versatility, candidates are given surprise tasks for which they need to quickly find a solution strategy.
Here too the Germans would have good chances, said the main judge.
Otherwise, Asians are often in advantage because they are taught more intensively and with other effective methods in early childhood.

Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
Vienna - The Federal Government plans a clear extension of the prohibition of the use of extremist symbols.

Polar cold air brings new snow on the mountains in the west
For the first time, Mrs. Holle shakes her beds in the west for the coming week: Polar cold air reaches Vorarlberg, Nordtirol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to the meteorologists of the Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall limit falls to 1,500 to 1,200 meters at the beginning of the week - in narrow valleys it could snow down at a strong intensity of up to 1,000 meters, it was called.
From the Bregenzerwald to the Hohen Tauern, it is estimated from 2,000 meters above with 20 to 40 centimeters of new snow.
On higher pass roads (Arlbergpass, Timmelsee, Bieler Höhe, Brennerpass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße) the road conditions become wintery.
Farmers are allowed to start the annual knick care on Monday
Schleswig-Holstein's farmers are allowed to begin their annual knick care on Monday.
The “green forests” in Germany have shaped the landscape of the poor federal country for about 200 years.
The tree and shrub hedges, which are up to five meters wide, are the last retreat rooms for many animals and plants.
Knicks combine as corridors scattered habitats that can still function in the exchange of organisms, as said by the managing director of the Naturschutzbund Deutschland (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski.
Knicks are living fences
The Knicks were built on the basis of a command of the Danish King Christian VI in 1766, who ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The “living fences” were not only field-limited and cattle fences, they also supplied firewood and beams to farmers for their specialist houses.
From that time on, his name was Knick: By \"knocking\" the branches, the dense, interlocked delimitations could develop.
Today, some 45 000 kilometers of hedges extend between the North and the Baltic Sea and give the picture of a rich, multi-structured landscape.
According to the NABU, they are now used as a spare habitat by some 7000 species.
In one kilometer Knick could live up to 1800 different species and breed up to 30 pairs of birds.
However, its ecologically important function can only fulfill the Knick if it is maintained accordingly in winter.
In addition to the variety of species, Ludwichowski said that he would prefer a light series of trees.
Knick care, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, may only be carried out outside the breeding period from October to March.
After Tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesian talks about SItuation on site
The local Radika Pinto describes in the interview with the editorial network Germany (RND) the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquakes and tsunami:
Were you on the spot during the tsunami?
No, I was at the time right in Jakarta on the island of Java.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
Then when I learned of the tsunami, I immediately made my way back to Sulawesi.
There I arrived on Sunday morning because after a flight I had to drive even more than 20 hours because the airport was closed on Palu at the time.
How is the situation on the island now?
The national government has opened the airport again, so that aid can also be included.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, all of which were completely destroyed.
Our office of World Vision has also been destroyed, but we have set up provisionally something where we have also accommodated other people.
What are the people who live on Sulawesi now?
Many have run to the surrounding hills, where they still endure for fear of another tsunami and earthquakes and where they have no access to water and food.
Some stop in front of their houses, there are still survivors.
Because many grocery stores and the gas stations are completely closed, people partially claw food and gasoline.
The public service is completely shut down, the national government helps out.
A prison has also been destroyed, the prisoners run around partially free and the search for them is difficult.
There are still many bodies around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How do communication and information provision work on the island?
At the moment we have mobile phone reception, but before that didn't work, and we only got information about radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors and other people who do not know if they live and where they stop because people were not at home during the earthquake, but for example at work.
The tsunami warning system did not work properly.
Do you have any information on this?
We don't know the reasons for this, but when the warning came, many thought \"Okay, no tsunami\" - and then he came.
In other regions not affected by the tsunami, there was misinformation that a tsunami hit the region and they ran to the surrounding mountains.
Is an island like Sulawesi, which is on the Pacific Fire Ring, not prepared for earthquakes?
But there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst.
We usually know how we react to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the entire infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has hit many people.
Muscle injuries against Werder: VfB must for a long time give up on Aogo and Donis
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo are missing the VfB Stuttgart with severe muscle injuries for a long time.
At 2:1 against Werder Bremen, Aogo joined a muscle fiber race in the rear left thigh on Saturday, the football leagueman announced on Sunday.
At Donis, the doctors diagnosed a muscle bundle crack in the thigh.
Both players are definitely not an option against Hannover 96 on Saturday and will probably miss games even after the next country game break.
The VfB Stuttgart did not deliver a forecast for the downtime.
A muscle bundle crack usually heals within six to eight weeks, a muscle fiber crack usually heals a little faster.

However, the action went on for some time.
Even a boat came into use.
Olching - Walking on Lake Olching, a white, injured duck appeared on Sunday morning.
She stopped in the water station area.

In spite of the injury, she was able to keep the forces out of action.
At the end, she fled to the lake.
With a rescue boat, the firefighter could circle the animal in and push it back to land, where it was then put into a transport box after almost an hour by a firefighter with a mastered handle.
The duck injured at the chest was then taken to the animal clinic of the LMU to Oberschleißheim.
But according to the first estimates, their chances of survival are rather small.
Biathlet Julian Eberhard peels WM medal and
==References====External links==*Official website
In the coming winter, the Saalfeldener wants to recover the missing precious metal at the World Cup in Östersund.
The last shot cost the 31-year-old in Pyeongchang's Olympia Sprint to grab near Medaille.
Seven tenths of a second were missing from bronze at the end.
“I have deliberately given myself time to process this,” says Eberhard at the opening of the MyGym fitness studio in his hometown of Saalfelden.
A medal was the goal, I was in top shape, but it just didn't want to be.
All the more motivated is the pinzgauer to recover the missing precious metal in the new season: “The goal can only be to come back to a big event with the Constitution, win something.
At some point you have to hit it.
The World Cup trail in Östersund (SWE) is located in Eberhard: “I have already reached the heart of the route, and he is delighted to remember his fourth World Cup place in the single race in the previous year.
Immediately after Olympia, he celebrated the only single victory for Austria in the last World Cup winter in the competition for the mass launch of Kontiolahti (FIN).
He went on to rank two in Oslo (NOR).
Board of Kavanaugh: FBI investigation at the Turbotempo
Time is extremely scarce and the number of decisions planned is very limited.
With an FBI investigation at the Turbotempo, Republicans in the U.S. Senate want to secure the thin majority for the judge candidates Brett Kavanaugh, who are controversial for claims of necessity.
President Donald Trump has set a time limit for the investigators until Friday to clarify the alleged incidents that lie back more than 30 years.
The latest turn in the drama about the vocation of Kavanaughs accompanied by a cultural struggle had been triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing by Kavanaugh and the first prosecutor Christine Blasey Ford, in whose course the lawyer angryly opposed the oppositional Democrats, the Judicial Committee of the Senate should open the way for the final confirmation of the arch conservative judge at the Supreme U.S. Court.
The majority of Republicans seemed assured when, suddenly, Senator Jeff Flake said he would agree to his original announcement, but demanded an FBI investigation.
After tumultuous scenes, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who had still referred to the heavy reservations on Thursday as 'beschiss', initially had further attacks on women and, on the contrary, spoke of 'happiness in the worst of circumstances'.
In this way, the last doubt could be raised, he said.
Later, in an election announcement, Trump strongly attacked the Democrats because they rejected Kavanaugh: “They try to block and destroy,
Trump orders FBI investigation in the Kavanaugh case
The White House has also extremely limited the powers of the investigators.
One will investigate the known accusations of two women, more than that, a government representative said to the \"Wall Street Journal\": \"They don't go on an fishing trip\"
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses are to be heard.
The mobile radar device installed in a civil vehicle by the municipality of Ried for the monitoring of the pace limit is stationed on the garden road from Monday, 1 October.
There is also the Federal School Center.
The municipality also operates several fixed-install radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: Fear has been felt
Trainer Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated the first season victory against Mainz.
The relief on Schalke is great after the first season victory.
However, against Mainz, the factor also played a role in time.
Gelsenkirchen - Meanwhile it is well known that Christian Heidelberg is a huge pessimist in football games.
That was no different in the home game against Mainz 05.
“I saw every ball in there.
And there were many corners and lots of balls in our prison room - said Schalke's Sports Board 04 - and breathed up.
Finally, it was still possible for the King's Blues to bring the almost 1:0 against the Rheinhesses over time and thus the first season victory under the roof and compartment.
In fact, it could have been different.
After the leadership by Alessandro Schöpf 11. The team of head coach Domenico Tedesco had given security to Tedesco: \"In sum, the first half of the time was good, both playfully and pressuringly, with increasing playing time, the head obviously played a role more and more.
Do not actually create a headball match
“The last ten minutes have felt like two hours for me,” said Heidelberg: “If the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bank, I can understand this“
The boys were afraid to give it out of their hands and therefore continue to retreat.
And defended against Mainz with man and mouse.
To save the first three meters of the season.
“All of us have fallen off the heart of a huge stone,” said Schöpf, who had no real part in this with his headball hit: “I am actually the worst headball player in manship.
But in the end only victory counts.
The relief was noticeable throughout the arena, of course also at Tedesco.
“We wanted to start impressively in the initial phase and make a fireworks out of it,” Schalkes said chief coach.
The victory was important.
Finally, we can enjoy a few hours.
I am very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We played intelligently, calmly and courageously, so we have to play games over 90 minutes
The biggest manko of the afternoon: King Blue missed it to worry about clearer conditions.
The possibilities for this were finally there, for example by the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who twice met the Latte 59./72. or Amine Harit 62.
“Then it wouldn’t have been a zitter victory,” said Tedesco: “You’ve already felt the fear a little bit, ”
That's why I'm glad we won.
That wasn't the only bowler he had.
Fischbachau: smoke column visible in the Leitzachtal 2 km
The smoke was not to be overlooked.
From about two kilometres away, a hiker in the Leitzachtal observed a fire on Sunday at 1.30 p.m.
Now the police's gonna figure it out.
Fischbachau - The cause soon found out police and firefighter: an unknown one had lit garbage on a two-square-metre area on the Gsch of the other mountain.
According to police, it seemed as if he had been watching the fire for a long time, but then the glut left unsupervised.
And that near the forest.
30 Fischbachauer Feuerwehrler was involved in drawing out and deleting.
The police are now trying to find out about a fire foundation.
Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: a discussion at eye level
In front of them is the author, Professor Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He followed for the repeated invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
“I have been responsible for bringing interesting people to Greven for many years,” explains the founder and chairman of the “Reckenfeld Treffs” - that association that cooperates with the “Cultural Policy” in the direction of the evening.
El-Mafaalani enters the reading very loosely, describes the writing process of the book, discusses how difficult it was to explain the subject in an understandable way.
With a lot of gestures, hand-held numbers and one or another joke, he brings the listeners one of the most controversial topics: migration and integration.
Why do conflicts arise despite successful integration?
The Syrian author uses the answer to the question of a metaphor.
At a table, the German society, at the cat table, sits the migrants of the first generation.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to be at the table.
The third generation of migrants is born in Germany, they have always sat at the big table and now want to agree.
This leads to conflict.
Therefore, it is not a matter of being politically right or left-wing, but of being \"in favour of or against an open society\".
At first rather behave, then the discussion is always going on.
And there is a need for speech.
An Afghan refugee from his perspective, two teachers tell how they see successful or unsuccessful integration among students.
El-Mafaalani stands out, not on stage, a symbol of the discussion: she is at eye level.
The sociology professor does not impose his opinion, stressing that he speaks of the average, not of individual fates.
He is pleased that there is an interest in the subject, because “first, if we understand what the problem is, we can find solutions,” says El-Mafaalani.
Even during the subsequent signing hours he became an open ear for the guests' questions and also in the foyer, with prepared Kurdish specialties, discussed intensely further.
Basketball: Bonn and Gießen win kick-off games
The Giessen 46ers and the Telekom Baskets Bonn ended the first day of the basketball Bundesliga (BBL) with a home and a outward victory.
Gießen competed in an ambush party in his own hall with 91:84 (43:46) against the Central German BC.
The ambitious Bonners won the BG Göttingen at 86:79 (49:47).
The first table leader of the season is Alba Berlin after the 112:55-Gala on Saturday against Science City Jena.
Much more effort had been made at the beginning of the new season of the German champion Bayern Munich and the former serial champion Brose Bamberg.
Munich was already working on Friday for an 83:77 with ratiopharm Ulm, Bamberg won the Frankenderby at s.Oliver Würzburg with 84:80 on Saturday.
Construction in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 plots
The need is apparently huge: over 100 interested parties have applied for the purchase of one of the property in Landsham-South.
The municipality of Pliening has sold the first plots in the new construction area of Landsham-Süd on the free market.
This is what Mayor Roland Frick is telling me.
In addition, the application phase is completed for those 20 plots that the municipality offers at more favourable conditions or prices - similar to the previous domestic model.
Well over 100 applications had been received, Frick said.
\"The documents are currently being examined in terms of the application criteria, completeness and accuracy.
According to the Plieninger Mayor, the aim is to have the candidate rankings for the 20 plots created by the end of the year and to present them to the Council of Commons.
After that, the award could be made.
In total, 50 plots for single and double houses are created on the area in the south of Landsham and four areas for multi-family houses with probably eight housing units each.
The opening is now as well completed, the roads and roads will soon be paved.
One single plot and two multi-family houses belong to a private person, the rest of the municipality of Pliening.
It sells the bulk of it on the free market, 20 properties in the social-contractual model.
According to Frick, the two multi-family houses of the municipality are to be built as affordable housing.
With a total of 16 independent, income-oriented housings.
Place for 200 people
Grob is estimated to provide living space for about 200 people on the area of the Landsham-South new construction area.
Not only that: Now, in early October, Frick is there going to be the start for the new construction of a children's daycare facility.
Three Kindergarten and three groups of cripples and a multipurpose room are to be accommodated.
The opening is scheduled for September 2019, at the start of the next kindergarten year.
Schalkes Naldo's big sport also succeeds at the bank
For the third time, not in the start-elf: Nevertheless, Naldo thanks himself to Schalke-Trainer Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues for the third time in a row, not in the Schalker Startelf, but on the exchange bench, understanding would have been great in many people, if the nearly two-metre-large Brazilian would have talked so accurately about the frustration of the soul.
But when after the 1:0 victory over the FSV Mainz 05, the Schalker players gathered as usual in the middle circle and thanked Chief Trainer Domenico Tedesco with all his pros, the 36-year-old named Naldo turned in and said, \"We have to thank, coach\"
“This was very emotional, that was great sport,” Tedesco later said about the reaction of his vice captain, who despite his re-reservist presence did not have any resentment.
Naldo, who has been celebrated as the best scallop in the past season, knows that he has not actually been taken to the post in his coach - but for good reason gets a break.
A reason called \"taxation control\"
It wasn't easy to tell him that
“It wasn’t easy to tell him that, I’m telling you honestly,” said Tedesco about the moment he told Naldo that he wasn’t in the start-elf.
He's an important player, he's an important person.
But it's always about the thing, it's about the club - Tedesco founded the step.
Naldo played against Bavaria and Porto 90 minutes.
He's 36 years old.
It is important that everyone can get through at the moment.
And that we all keep in the boat, Tedesco explained the rotation, which finally caught Naldo.
And to whom the Brazilians responded with the wisdom of his advanced age: by also proving himself on the bank as exemplary team players.
The mood in Austria's industry has continued to accelerate in August in comparison to the Eurozone.
The shopping manager index (PMI) was 46.7 points on a 37-month low.
Nevertheless, Austria has the third best mood behind Ireland and the Netherlands throughout Europe, and the Markit Institute announced its survey among 3,000 companies on Monday.
Unlike Austria, the PMI of the euro zone rose by 1.1 to 45.1 points, but the index is nevertheless the 13th month in a row below the 50-digit mark that indicates growth.
Only Ireland's industry cracked this threshold in August at 50.9 points.
The final light was the Greeks (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the mood barometer declined, but slower than in the previous months.
In Spain, the index reached the highest level since March at 44.0 points.
“Although the slight weakening of the valley trip may mean that the worst is overcome,” said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
However, the industry remains one of the largest barriers to growth in the third quarter.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: Export orders in the euro area were not as strong as they had been since November 2011.
The companies therefore completed the seventh month in succession.
Industrial production also fell in China in August more than initially adopted.
The mood barometer decreased from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts initially expected 47.8 points.
The shopping manager index is based on representative surveys by 3,000 European industrial companies.
Developments in turnover, employment, stocks and prices are raised, among other things.
Tuchel's PSG team succeeds after victory in the eighth league game
29 September 2018 at 19:45
Nice coach Thomas Tuchel rushes with Paris Saint-Germain in France's football championship further from victory to victory.
At the OGC Nice, the title defender won three matches from Superstar Neymar at 3:0 (1:0) and was successful in the eighth league game.
At least 82 years ago, Olympique Lyon in France had set such a good start to the season.
The Brazilian Neymar led PSG after 22 minutes and finished in the post-playing period.
Christopher Nkunku (46).
Paris thus also succeeded in the general trial for the second champions-legague group against Red Stern Belgrade on Wednesday.
At 2:3 in Liverpool, Tuchel's team had to accept the only mandatory game defeat so far in this season.
