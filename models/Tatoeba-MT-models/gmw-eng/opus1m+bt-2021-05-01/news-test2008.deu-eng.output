Food debt to European inflation
The main reason for the increase in inflation in the euro area is the rapidly rising food prices.
In the 13 countries of the euro area, the rate of inflation in November was higher than expected - after 2.6 percent in October, an annual inflation rate of 3.1 percent was recorded, as reported by the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts were made of only 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
In contrast to the US, British, and Canadian central bank, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not reduced the guiding principle. In its opinion, the reduction in interest rates would favour the rising raw material prices and the slight decline in unemployment.
The ECB is committed to keeping the inflation rate below two percent, or at least close to the two-percent mark.
According to an analyst, the ECB was in the Zwickmühle: Inflation should be “agreements” to exclude future needs of action.
At 3.3 percent, the inflation rate in Germany reached a 12-year record in November; in Spain, the rate climbed from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
The increase in inflation in the euro area is responsible for increasing food and energy prices.
The MATIF wheat quotations rose by 88 percent, and the price for soybeans also reached a record high since 1973.
Food oil and dairy products were also very expensive in 2007.
The world market price for crude oil rose by 52 percent this year - last month the price per face of black gold reached nearly 100 US dollars.
According to the ECB, inflation will rise from 2.1 to 2.5 percent in 2008, but is expected to decrease to 1.9 percent in 2009.
For the next 3-4 months, analysts are starting from a 3-percent inflation rate, but the average annual rate is 2.1 percent.
For 2008, experts expect the ECB to reduce interest rates twice.
Gallup sorts government crisis
After long stagnating, the number of Fidesz-sympathisers has grown significantly until the beginning of December. For the first time since 2002, the party has the largest base camp, while the agreement for the socialists according to Gallup has reached an unprecedented low of 13 percent.
In the case of party loyal voters, the difference is clear thanks to the high determination of opposition advocates: more than two-thirds (71 percent) are opposed to a fifth (20 percent) approval for MSZP.
According to the survey, MDF and SZDSZ are under the parliamentary barriers to entry: they come in the total population to two percent.
The number of party voters has grown by one percent in both camps.
Compared to the last low, the general economic mood has deteriorated further - never before has the proportion of those who consider the country's economic situation to be \"exactly bad\" so high (41 percent), while another 46 percent hold it for \"presumably bad\".
After more hopeful prospects in spring and summer, families see the change in their financial situation again more pessimistic.
For the coming year, the majority of the population expects a further deterioration of the situation; only one tenth is from a improvement.
A Gallup survey carried out in December revealed that 71% of respondents - a historic high - judged the prime minister's work as “bad as right earlier. ”
Thirteen percent of the respondents have great confidence or trust in Ferenc Gyurcsány, while Viktor Orbán's advocate's share is 38 percent.
Around 54% do not trust the head of government at all, compared with 27% distrust of Fidesz's party leader.
One of the indicators of political mood is the number of those who believe that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister could be overcome without change of government.
After the unrest of last October, 35% for the government's and the head of government, this proportion is only 20% today, while the relative majority (33 percent) see the solution only in new elections.
Asked for their interest in the referendum, 60 percent replied that they would participate “with certainty, and another 20% would probably give their vote.
In comparison, if Parliament's elections were to take place this Sunday, only 55 percent would, with certainty, go to the urns, another 15% would consider their participation to be \"probably\" in view of these trends, the outcome of the referendum would be foreseeable.
74% would vote against the study fees, 79% against the practice fee, and 84% against the hospital daily fee.
The group of participants in the referendum, with certainty, would have the share of the opponents of study, practice and hospital fees even 81, 84, and 89 per cent respectively.
Even the most expensive, Tesco increases by almost one fifth
The hypermarkets in the Budaörse trading area also maintained this year the average price increase of 16% of last year, with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Article from Napi Gazdaság
In the Budaörser Handelstrieck, the price of the \"Napi\" Christmas basket has increased by 16 percent this year, but over 1,000 HUFs have been recorded in all hypermarkets.
After the prices in the food markets have been ‘galoped’ last December, the cost of food has not fallen dramatically, compared with the already high, earlier level of output.
However, it is certainly frightening for consumers that this year, for which they paid far below 9,000 HUF last year, is not even available for 10,000 HUF.
The price of the Napi basket exceeded the magic 10,000 HUF limit by at least 91 HUF in the investigated markets.
The highest price was 10,573 HUF.
(In 6800 the price was 6,800 HUF.)
The prices for unicum and live fish remained almost at the previous year's level, but the prices for putenbrust fillets, nuts and mohn increased significantly.
Prices for flour and bread corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, but there were 1kg of bread for 139 forints at Auchan.
There was no competitive price fall in the product on less than 200 forints.
Also surprising was the price of a two litre Coca-Cola bottle of under 200 forint, so the drink including the pound cost only 257 HUF.
Nevertheless, this year in the “Napi” shopping cart-compare Ochan is the most expensive, and Cora is the most affordable.
Our calculations have shown that Cora increased the prices in the Napi cart compared to the Christmas prices last year by 15, while Tesco and Ouchan each increased by 18 percent.
The difference between the most cheap shopping cart in the previous year and the most expensive today was 12%, while the increase between the cheapest shopping cart in the last year and the most expensive in the current year was 21%.
The average price increase was 1,480.00 HUF.
The average price increase was 1.206.00 Forint in the previous year, but the VAT increase made it noticeable at last Christmas prices.
This is exactly what the trade has done: it appears that the warehouses did not have the right to decide which price margin they should apply to the individual articles, as the effects of the price increase on consumer behaviour were inconceivable.
(If the dealer plans the circulation speed of a product poorly, he may fall by substantial profits in the price range that is directed towards traffic intensity.)
As a result of the value-added tax, last year’s “Napi” shopping cart was so radical that the most expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 Forint, whereas the price difference in the cheapest basket was only 844 Forint.
This year, such extremes were not observed, as the most expensive basket costed 1.630.00 Forint more than in the previous year, and even the cheapest there was a price increase of 1.284.00 Forint.
Compared to the last two Christmas seasons, a catastrophic price increase was shown, the price of daily consumer goods in the hypermarkets rose by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This, in turn, does not necessarily confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: in some basic foods, the Statistical Office established more than 30-percentage over the period of 12 months.
So in about next to flour also for eggs.)
However, if you take a look at the “Napi” shopping cart, this seems almost impossible at the latter, as the price level of the product already expensive in the previous year has risen by little more than 10 percent even in the worst case.
Clearly, flour suppliers are in a stronger position than the egg suppliers - however, they were able to reduce the drastic price increase to the multis.
In the golden trade triangle, the hypermarkets do not complain; it is reported continuously of good years.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three warehouses are no longer looking at prices.
It is bought from all large quantities, durable food goes in pallets over the charging tables.
Wednesday morning morning there were endless snakes in all three warehouses, when suddenly the number of customers exploded.
However, a lower frequency of customers is reported by the country, so that many multis complain to opinion researchers, they could not even achieve planned sales, not only for food, but also for sustainable consumer goods.
Many places are spared from disinfectants
Today, more than a thousand infections have been recorded in hospitals due to improper treatment of antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions in hospitals, the overcrowding of beds, the overloading of staff - all factors that are not directly attributable to the insulation of infections, so the senior physician of the National Epidemiology Centre.
In many places, disinfectants are also spared.
In the traumatology department of the János Hospital, an MRSA infection was recently diagnosed.
The antibiotic-resistant bacterium was found in a male patient who was hospitalized after a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year there was already a similar infection here.
The injured person of a serious car accident was released from the hospital, but it was not until later that the man had to return with an MRSA infection. An important operation has not yet been performed since the bacterium, which is still in the patient's body.
By 10 December this year, multi-resistant pathogens have reported infections to the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System from hospitals in 1094, according to the leading physician of the National Epidemiology Centre, Karolina Böröcz.
So many infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens have been recorded in hospitals with certainty, but the dark rate is expected to be higher.
About two thirds of the infections (683 cases) were triggered by MRSA, which is resistant to methicillin oxacillin Staphylococcus aureus.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacterium carries about one-third of the people in their nose without causing a disease.
SA-related infections (such as neck inflammation, almond inflammation, skin inflammation or wounds) usually respond well to antibiotics, they are beneficial.
However, if the drugs are administered too high or improperly, they arise from the well-responding bacteria antibiotics-resistant ones, which spread rapidly in hospitals under appropriate conditions.
Especially in patients with weakened, or permanently poorly functioning immune system, but also in older, or low body weight, these bacteria can cause serious infections such as wound infection or blood poisoning, i.e. sepsis.
According to the medical director of the János Hospital, MRSA infection is no special, such incidents are part of the daily hospital.
Tibor Nyulasi - MRSA did not want to be confused with the epidemic, where it is not sought.
Resistant to Antibiotics
“Such patients are isolated, the care staff wears rubber gloves and masks for care, and we have the antibiotics needed for treatment, so Tibor Nyulasi.
While patients are being investigated for MRSA during their delivery to the hospital, infection cannot always be avoided.
Sample withdrawals too rare
The majority of infections caused by MRSA in hospitals would be avoidable, however, the currently prevailing conditions and circumstances would be unfavourable for preventing the emergence or spread of multi-resistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröcz.
After this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and old age homes, the hospitals should investigate the patients delivered and immediately isolate MRSA infected.
In Hungarian hospitals, however, microbiological sampling is not practiced so often.
Not least because there are no grants for this investigation on the side of the state health insurance fund.
Therefore, most cases are only visible when the patient already has a noticeable MRSA infection, according to the medical director of the epidemiology center.
From the European Union's side, there are strict recommendations on the use of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also guidelines in Hungary for the treatment of certain infections and diseases.
Antibiotic therapies should be targeted, i.e. microbiological studies are necessary in order to avoid resistance to the drug, but this directive of hospitals is not always respected.
Among the outpatients, or patients in basic care, microbiological samples were even rarer, according to Karolina Böröcz.
Separation of disinfectants
Scientific evidence proves that MRSA is most often transferred from one patient to another by the care staff.
This is precisely why hand washing, or wearing gloves and masks is of great importance, but there are also significant shortcomings in hospitals in this area.
MRSA is transmitted by droplet infection or contact, but in the local hospitals there is not always the possibility to isolate the infected patient.
The rooms are often overcrowded, the beds are tightly arranged, although there should be a distance of at least 1.5 meters between them from an epidemiological point of view.
Unfortunately, as Karolina Böröcz continues to note, in the less well-off hospitals, it even occurs that in disinfectants are spared, there are few caregivers, many patients - all factors that directly promote the emergence of infections.
Such infections are evidenced to be far less common, or the further spread of the pathogen can be stopped where these protective measures are observed, according to Karolina Böröcz.
Government programme against MRSA
Getting MRSA infections under control causes health insurance enormous costs, so they are fought everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA, or its restraint in the government programme, has been maintained.
After first signs, the program is successful - as published data proves, the trend of MRSA infections in England is decreasing.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has declared the prevention of multi-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and the prevention of infections in hospitals to be one of its priorities.
Death-believing police officer was not drunk
In the case of the car accident caused by the police chief of the XXII district with fatal outcome, the official opinion is now available.
The now retired police chief of the XXII district, who killed a pedestrian on Tuesday in a car accident, was neither alcoholicised nor under drug influence, said Attila Morvai, the press spokesman of the Budapest Supreme Attorney on Friday, after the official opinion was presented on the case.
The opinion confirmed the results of the first investigation, according to which the chief of police had not consumed alcohol before he was taxed.
The former police chief, with his own car in XXII district, entered the Kossuth Lajos street, and took over a 55-year-old man who crossed the road at an unmarked spot.
(According to StVO, this is not a milder circumstance - the handlebar has, even though pedestrians do not cross the road on the zebra strip, succession.)
The pedestrian is injured after being delivered to the hospital.
According to police reports, the Lenker suffered a shock, returned his duties, and asked for retirement.
The Budapest prosecutors launched their investigations into the incident.
In addition, Attila Morvai mentioned that from the beginning, the former police chief had cooperated with the investigators.
EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Minister of Finance János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) signed three credit agreements of EUR 400 million in Budapest on Friday.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a EUR 300 million framework for the financing of transport and environmental protection projects implemented with grants from the Cohesion Fund. The EUR 100 million loan agreement was signed earlier, and the current agreement deals with the use of the EUR 200 million loan.
The sum of EUR 150 million agreed in the loan agreement will also be spent on budget financing of education projects.
The EIB has granted a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose for Hungary, and the use of the remaining EUR 150 million will be decided later in the context of the extension of the credit agreement.
In the field of innovation, the Contracting Parties signed an agreement of EUR 50 million, which will mainly flow into research and development programmes at the University of Debrecen.
At the meeting, the metro line 4 was also spoken.
It has been agreed that as soon as Hungary has clarified the details of subway financing with the EU, the original contract and any modifications will be re-examined.
According to János Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects worth EUR 8.4 billion in Hungary.
The credit interest rates are EURIBOR-linked, the loans are provided by the EIB with an 8-year grant, without commissioning.
Bulgaria, EU Immobilities
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is fabulous - the whole of Europe looks closely at the previously rarely mentioned Balkan state.
What, where, and who is still buying the most cheap market in the EU, but which is rapidly becoming more expensive?
An Analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max Division.
Bulgaria is currently the most desirable patch for real estate purchases in the Eastern European area, with cheap ski apartments and houses by the sea.
Between the mountains, the regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are among the most popular, at sea are Albena, the Gold Coast, the Sun Coast, and the historic towns of Sozopol and Nessebar, but real estates around Kavarna and Balcik are also increasingly needed.
According to estimates by Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, the interior of the country has also attracted investors earlier or later, for example Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, and also the extremely favourable area of Russians has recorded more buyers.
The capital Sofia also offers tempting offers - commercial and office areas offer highest returns.
Bulgaria is on the best path to becoming one of the most attractive European golfer paradises, and thus attracting tourists in the two other seasons in addition to the summer and winter season.
Therefore, prospective investors are already buying in great style, for example around Bansko.
According to analysts, people who acquire real estate in Bulgaria also seek a change in their lifestyle.
Most buyers are Englishmen, but they also come from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while there are predominantly Russian buyers at the Black Sea and in the ski resorts.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to settle, either buy revitalized properties by 50-100,000 euros, or come down houses by 5-15,000 euros, which then renew them themselves.
Good connection and reachability as well as communication options are written large, but also proximity to a big city, shops and doctors are crucial for buyers.
The second category includes those who are looking for a holiday home (Bulgaria was listed among the top ten holiday destinations of the Germans in December).
The third group makes up businessmen who invest with the aim of a medium to long-term increase in value.
Real estates in the capital, however, are becoming increasingly expensive, due to the ever-increasing demand.
Within the EU, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, but over the past five years there has been an increase of 21 percent annually.
The cost of real estate prices far exceeds the increase in salaries.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percentages
As environmental minister Gábor Fodor announced, the expert meetings will end on Tuesday, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries discuss Bali's roadmap, in which the emission reduction measures for the period after 2012, i.e. after the end of the Kyoto Protocol, are set.
At present, a heated debate is under way between industrial and developing countries.
The US has already signaled that they do not want to negotiate concrete figures, but they would be willing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990.
The other major issue of the conference is whether the industrialised countries are willing to support the developing countries financially, technologically and financially in addition to reducing emissions.
An agreement on support for developing countries has also been reached.
The adjustment fund submitted to the Kyoto Protocol is to be managed by a 16-member Council, expected to be reviewed at the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF), as in the Piac és Profit.
Hungary's six percent
Environment Minister Gábor Fodor, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU's efforts to maintain its pioneering role in global climate protection measures and to reach a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister said that by 2020, the EU will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% (measured by 1990), regardless of whether the ‘Agreement after 2012’ was achieved successfully, or not. The Union would even be willing to make a 30-percent reduction if other major industrialised countries in the world, or developing countries, are also willing to meet their obligations according to forces and responsibilities.
Gábor Fodor stressed that the objective of the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was a reduction of only 5.2 percent, whereas the EU, with its 15 member states at that time, had already committed itself to a 8% minus.
The requirement for Hungary is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6% compared to the years 1985-87 - a requirement which the country will certainly meet, as can be seen in the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The commitment is high on Bali - after all, the long-term international climate policy agreement must be completed within two years, otherwise it would be safe to enter into force only after 2012. In this case, the reduction project set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not follow a new international emission reduction system, the importance of which is also highlighted by the IPCC, the international scientific climate change committee awarded by the UN with the Nobel Peace Prize, in its recent report.
This would delay emission reduction, and the increase in Earth's average temperature by more than 2°C would be inevitable, which, according to scientists, would result in extremely serious and irreparable consequences.
British Army advertising on YouTube
Units of the British Army have published recordings of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to increase popularity on the video portal.
First, the British Air Force (RAF) YouTube has discovered for itself: Special Units stationed in Afghanistan have been loading videos against Taliban-led operations into the network since March 2006, reports BBC.
The tapes shot on helmets are controlled at the Kandahar Air Force Base and then sent to London, where they are placed on the Internet.
Political Embassy Unavoidably
Air Force soldiers have already contributed 139 such shots, their channel has been regarded more than 75,000 times.
The UK Department of Defense was registered in the spring of 2007, in order to publish videos on Iraqi and Afghan operations, but also the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Commonwealth Office) and the international peace troops (MNFI) stationed in Iraq have their own YouTube channels.
Application in Afghanistan
Originally, the Luftwaffe has published the videos with the aim of recruiting soldiers, and as the Ministry of Defense says, contributions also serve the purpose of informing the population of the actual objectives of foreign operations.
Such kind of published propaganda is almost free of charge compared to traditional television advertising, according to defense expert Gordon Mackenzie to BBC, but these videos always carry a certain amount of political message in themselves, as they confirm the existence of the military measures decided by the government in their own way.
Americans are throwing game
However, the army must also fight against amateur footage, which, in addition to the carefully edited, censored recordings, also create into the net - such as those that show the death of soldiers: in the somewhat hypocritical, \"official\" propaganda films are talked about the losses at most, but the bloody sides of the war are not shown.
By the way, many of the wartime shows in Iraq and Afghanistan have already been loaded into the platform, but the British have only recently discovered them.
The Americans, however, cast in a slightly different way, namely with the free downloadable shooting game \"America's Army\" in which the player can slip into the soldier's skin in the context of a more or less life-tight simulation.
Christmas celebration with Tombola and Pogatsche in the ministries
Minister of Labour Monatika Lamperth is by no means cynic: Instead of a Christmas celebration, she organises a working conference, where her employees can let coffee and pogatsche go out in 2007.
Some ministries celebrate with live music, others enchant Christmas with Tombola or instigation into the official hearts.
Party, Christmas mood, concerts and buffet - so celebrates power.
The Christmas fever has already recorded the offices.
The greatest Christmas celebration of a ministry is held here in the defence resort, but the Ministry staff are not expected to do so.
At the Christmas celebration of the orphans, children are given by fallen soldiers, at the “Mission Party” family members are hosted by soldiers currently stationed abroad, but there is also a reception for the press.
The resort provides around 25 million for the celebrations.
In comparison to other resorts, the National Agency for Development (NCF) and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport beat the strands.
The 4.32 million Forint's expensive Christmas celebration of the Ministry of Economic Affairs is held in the House of the Future, about 350 of the 600 employees are expected.
Although the celebrations focus on Christmas, there will also be live acts and a tombola release.
The National Agency for Development (NFÜ) held its 4.7 million Forint expensive Christmas celebration on Wednesday at the House of the State Justice Council (OIT), with concerts and a feast.
The hall rental was 1 million forint, the rest was spent for the more than 400 invited guests.
According to our information, a department of the NFU is also invited to another Christmas celebration organised by the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG Zrt) from EU funds.
For the celebration, the building was rented at the Lustspieltheater, Vígszínház.
The MAG Zrt did not confirm this information as we did not reach the authorities.
What's the suit for?
The OIT building was open not only to the guests of the NFU, but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, who held the Lucia Ball there instead of a Christmas celebration on December 7.
They did not have to pay rent to OIT for the use of the premises.
About 500 visitors came to the ball.
The celebrations were opened with a speech from the minister, after which dinner there was live music to dance.
At the request of [origo], it was informed: there was no ball dress or suit obligation at the ball.
The ministries of health, work, and self-government each prepare themselves for Puritan celebration.
The Ministry of Health organises the celebration for employees in its own four walls for around 400,000 forints.
Minister of Labour Monatika Lamperth officially invites her employees not to a Christmas party, but to the annual conference.
It is calculated with about 180 guests, who - according to the press department - are only hosted with coffee and pogatsche, so the celebration goes out with 350,000 forints.
Self-government minister Gordon Bajnai, with his colleagues, will simply attack the aula of the Ministry.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) organises a Christmas celebration in its own hall, to which 436 employees are expected.
The expenditure was measured at 2,500 forints per head - for this money there is a buffet reception with subsequent impact.
Since the beginning of the term of office of János Veres, the PM employees have been celebrating each year in this way.
However, there will be no proper party voting - not only because of the official speech of the minister but also because the celebration was held for the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture invites a New Year reception on 20 January, the Ministry's Christmas celebration falls out this time.
One hundred guests are asked to the Vajdahunyad castle in the Városliget city park; according to the information of the resort, expenditures of 1,000 forints per guest are measured.
As the Press Department reports, it will be a very simple get-together to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
The receptions, which are held each year, traditionally begin with a short speech by the minister and sound with reserved dirt.
As the corresponding press offices report on [origo] request, there will not be a Christmas party at the Ministry of Education or the Ministry of Education.
Asked about the cost of the Christmas celebration, no information could be given to the press department of the Ministry of the Environment.
In any case, more than 400 guests were invited to the festival, which is held at the Kunstgewerbemuseum.
More and more forces mobilized for giant strike
On Friday, the League of Trade Unions and the Hungarian Trade Union Federation formed their coordination committee for the unspecified duration of the strike starting on Monday.
On Saturday a large protest meeting will be held, on Monday - on the day of the referendum on the Health Insurance Act - work will begin to decline.
It is expected to have strike-related, significant traffic barriers, as rail traffic is almost completely discontinued, and Budapest's public transport companies (BKV) strike until 1 p.m.
Details of the strike on Monday will be shared on Friday afternoon by the League Trade Unions and the Trade Union Federation.
A LIGA - MOSZ Strict Committee is also established, which is responsible for coordinating the actions on Monday.
A large protest meeting will be held on Saturday, and from Monday all organizations associated with the strike will be working for an indefinite period of time, unless agreement is reached with the government.
In other words, the end of the strike on the day of Parliament's vote on the Health Insurance Act was not defined.
Should the National Council not adopt the Health Insurance Act, the trade unions shall immediately withdraw the call to strike.
However, if the Act is passed, the strike committees shall meet to discuss the further action.
Due to the agenda of the National Council on Monday, it is even possible that it will not be possible to vote on the Health Insurance Act until late evenings, or even at midnight.
The strikes starting on Monday will require considerable traffic barriers: the railways lay down their work for an indefinite period of time, the majority of public transport and more than half of the Volán companies remain silent on the morning.
At the same time, there will be many local highway locks in one direction.
The call to strike has followed numerous trade unions and civil organizations - the list of participants is constantly updated on the league website.
Some organizations have announced strikes for an indefinite period of time, while others are planning a temporary reduction in work.
Until Thursday afternoon, between the Hungarian Railway MÁV and the Free Trade Union of Railwayers VDSZZ, there was still no agreement on sufficient services, although more and more people are travelling by train just around the Christmas holidays.
According to previous reports, the BKV will strike between 7 and 9 a.m. from 1 p.m. to 1 p.m. at the Budapest Airport, the LIGA trade unions for electricity and heat energy will lay down the work for four hours, and the teachers' union, for example, the Democratic Teacher Union has called for 2 or 2-8 hours of strike.
The Hungarian Medical Association is trying to alter nationally at various times, the EDDSZ, the Democratic Trade Union of Health and Social Affairs Employees, a SZEF sub-organisation, the trade union cooperation forum, is holding a two-hour alert strike.
The most important of the four points demanded by the League is that the Government withdraw the draft health insurance reform and submit a new concept for social discourse.
The second requirement concerns the gradual introduction of the new pension calculation model, which will be due from next year.
Claim number three means that the eligible professional groups will be able to access the early retirement system before 2010.
The fourth point is that the VDSZZZ, belonging to the League of Trade Unions, did not accept the offer submitted by the Ministry of Transport and now calls for a new approach.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard Increases State Risk
According to the Risk Analysis Division (Risk Analysing Division) of Political Capital, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, founded in August with the support of the “Motive for a Better Hungary”, have increased Hungary’s and region’s risk in several respects.
Among other things, the Institute’s “risk warning report” states: In connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the highest political risk is the “severalisation of existing ethnic tensions between the Gypsy and non-Gypsy population in Hungary, which could even lead to violent ethnic conflicts in the short term”
The main reason for this is the Hungarian Guard strategy, which is likely to target the provocation of such a dispute, says the Research Institute.
As reported, this is seen as a failure on the part of the political leaders: “People of public life have left the discussion of the Roma question representatives of radical political groups who have now built their political strategy on the Roma-Hungary approach,
It is assumed that this would exacerbate the problem, make reasonable dialogue impossible, favour extremes, and increase the likelihood of violent conflicts.
The research institute also believes that the activities of the Hungarian Guard would have, not least thanks to the enormous attention of the local and foreign media, \"inflicted on Hungary’s image abroad, in particular with regard to confidence in stability and democratic maturity,
We remember: Since autumn 2006, the reorganization of radical and extreme right groups in Hungary has been continuously in the process of upswing, so that since summer 2007, several organizations, “national self-defence association”, have been founded.
“These groups are generally defined as civil organisations, while they are openly talking about preparing their members for - sometimes armed - defence tasks (disaster protection, national defense, order prevention), calling for the incapacity of police, army, or state itself.
And further, it all happened according to that method, which tries to tarnish various political and party dissensions based on the population's political aspirations as a bourgeois initiative.
The emphasis on civil character and form of association thus serve not only to circumvent legal hurdles that might arise in the course of registration in court - it is at the same time a political strategy.
As the analysis shows, the Hungarian Guard's activities are also a risk-enhancing factor in relations with neighbouring countries.
“In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been cited as a potential source of danger in several neighbouring states, so many ultra-nationalist politicians of certain neighbouring countries see in the creation of the Hungarian Guard the confirmation of their own anti-Hungary policy.
All of this has an impact on the political stability of the region - it was called.
From the point of view of the research institute, the creation of the Hungarian Guard is not a single phenomenon in Central-East Europe, so the political risk for the whole region has grown.
As reported, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are comparable to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose establishment was announced in August 2007 by the Federal Republic of Bulgaria (GNU).
In the background of the creation of the Bulgarian Guard were the Roma mass cries that took place in a district of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU took the incident on the occasion of the establishment of the National Guard, with the argument that the objective of the organization of \"national protection\" was the same.
In her opinion, over the past 17 years, there has been a sense of \"giant terror\" in Bulgaria, but the state has remained active and indifferent, according to Political Capital.
And further, the initiative had triggered a heated debate in the Bulgarian public.
As said, the increased risk for ethnic conflicts is also demonstrated by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organizations have announced to establish their own guard for resistance purposes.
As the activities of the Hungarian Guard so far show many similarities to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not excluded that the Hungarian Roma also react to the threats by organizing their own protection, says the Risk Warning Report of Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, Research Director at Political Capital, said at the request of the news office: The risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
Every year risk analysis reports would be published, and risk changing trends should be identified, public opinion will be informed, as in the case of the issue of the risk warning report.
Holidays are not everywhere Holidays
In Hungary, holidays are regulated by law, so that the practice of redisposing the working days around the holidays has now been established, but the coming year provides us with fewer days.
Also in the EU and in America, there is something else under the \"Festday\"
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between state holidays and work-free days.
Work-free days are usually church holidays, or are associated with significant historical events.
For example, we also celebrate New Year: Both the last day of the old and the first day of the new year are work-free days - the latter alone so that the New Year celebrations can rest.
All year long we have a total of fourteen holidays.
The days of the State are 15 March, which commemorates the Revolution of 1848, and 23 October, the Memorial of the Revolution of 1956.
On August 20th, the founding of the State, on May 1st, will celebrate the work, on November 1 and 2nd, we will commemorate our dead.
In addition, there are two holidays each with Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.
Since our state, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, the practice of working day shifts has proven itself in cases where we would only work one day before or after the holiday.
However, the price of extended weekends is that we have to work on Saturdays before, or go to school.
If this day, which falls before or after the holiday, is to be finalised, the Minister of Labour has for many years been set out in a separate regulation.
The legislation applies equally to all employers and employees, public employees and public service officials.
Only firms and facilities in which the operation is continued without interruption, i.e. on the holidays, are excluded.
Today's working order is only somewhat messed up by the holidays at the end of the year: from December 24th on, life in this country will remain formal, as most of the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve will be between Christmas and New Year's Eve or take their own holiday.
In the next year, more holidays fall into the middle of the week, or the end of the week, so that there will be fewer respite in the working days than this year.
The calendar is first put on the head around the day of work so that people can stay at home for the same four days.
Saturday, April 26 will be a working day so Friday May 2nd can be a rest day.
The second redisposition will be related to the holiday on 23 October: on Saturday, 18 October you will have to finish Friday, 24 October in advance.
The end of the year, however, will be without fail in the sign of the holidays, after all lie and stand from December 24th, even if New Year's Eve falls on a Wednesday.
Six deterrents to anger colleagues
Emails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive - harmless lies that no longer notice us: they bring “colours” to everyday life at the workplace.
The question is whether you are accustomed to these little inconveniences, or whether you are better at facing the challenge and trying to avoid them misunderstandingly for other annoying situations.
Tips.
“Sorry, I forgot to tell you that someone called from the marketing department,” says a colleague.
That you missed a meeting?
In addition, one regrets it and tries to make up for it again by perhaps calling at the marketing department and being desperate, one would have forgotten to align the message (that is the less common method).
Most of the matter is settled with an apology.
Before dealing with embarrassing excuses, consider how you can truly prepare your colleagues for unpleasant moments and try to avoid these situations consciously.
What's not your own thing?
There's hardly anything more nervous than getting into a document, office accessories, or the phone, but it's not there.
Yesterday the elevator was still on the desk - this morning it's gone?
Or will the lost bullet writer be discovered on a colleague's desk?
Without question, you should not borrow from colleagues, for they are rightly offended if they find that something has gone away.
So, don't put any envelopes or post-it out of the office in the bag, because it could happen to you: none more there if you need it urgently.
Talk about the private life of colleagues?
There is no effective means of stopping a trachea that has already been put into the world.
Who's with whom, what's done?
Where and why?
The information (or assumptions) about the private life of colleagues should not be tied to everyone's nose if possible!
And if anyone opens up and betrays our innermost secret, we should not abuse that trust!
It is best to swear like a grave, rather than align the people who are not present at all, even if others know about the problems of the colleague.
Reported ill for no reason?
If you're calling in the office to report sickly, calling for painful headaches, because you just feel uncomfortable, or just want to rest, you should be aware of one thing: your own work, inexhaustible completions, projects with fixed dates now have to do the colleagues instead of yourself.
So don't play bad with my colleagues!
If you already know the day before that you won't make it to the office, or if something could come in between, which is why you have to stay at home, you should report it in time so that neither the colleagues nor the boss will be confronted unexpectedly with the absence.
Total, Chicken, Telephone
Is it just in his work, but is suddenly disturbed by the loud geek of the ladies?
I don't want to hear a phone call that you shouldn't have heard?
One should not be nervous to the colleagues with sums, singing, loud conversations (which lead them across their heads), tramples, continuous chimping or narcotics.
All of this can be very disturbing, even if they are not really in a task (writing, planning, organizing).
Are the others always to blame?
If a project is not completed in due time, you have forgotten to send an important letter or important message, you should not seek the blame of your own forgetfulness for others!
If possible, don't talk about the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!
It is best to admit his mistakes and apologize if others have been affected by them!
The question of how to correct the mistake again, or recover the failure, is only too appropriate!
In the office - a feeling like at home?
Training pants and slaps: Comfortable at home, but didn't lose anything in the office!
Not even then should one dress so army if it would actually allow the workplace!
Just don't get too sloppy - you should respect both your colleagues and yourself to the extent that you dress accordingly in the office - if desired, also pretty and elegant!
It all wants to do right - or how to be uninteresting for others
Stop and go traffic, the car in the middle of the morning.
From the radio sounds a strange melody: the sound of a violin paired with electronic effects.
I turn the volume up.
The tempo changes, to the previous sounds comes the bass, and as a real sound jewel a female choir.
It is the song \"Wings of Love\" by Zagar, which sounds like mr2.
For a long time, the domestic music scene has not spoiled us with qualitative electropope.
But now you even see the bar different when you hear Zagar's new album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, so many new and exciting productions from the native digital underground scene contribute slowly to a change in the overall picture, and even if the garage skirt with its guitar-like look is again in, the domestic electropop proves: there is new under the sun.
Baláz's Zságer started in Pécs, musicted himself in the band Yonderboi before he - perhaps because a host does not tolerate two peppers - began to walk his own way.
However, the breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music, which melts elements from jazz, electronic, and pop, only created him when one with the request to compose the soundtrack to a film, arrived at him (e.g.
‘Szezon’ by Ferenc Török).
The formation, which was initially performed in smaller clubs, became known to the wider audience only when the magazine,wan2, was first released in 2002 under the top 50 domestic albums and Zagar, together with Yonderboi, was selected as the almost single, marketable trendsetter in the West.
Without a doubt, Zagar and his band “trendy” were interested, but no one was interested in whether they would like to wear this brand.
The band responded as it should: With a new, even better album.
The new album with the title \"Cannot Walk Fly Instead\" now appeared could open new paths to them, but already the title expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécser years.
The expression comes from the time when Baláz's Zságer was still on the road with another band.
The airy, flying play would be fine, but besides the essential character of the music, the louder guitar, the influences of the rock'n'roll, - the spirit of the time and the trends.
With these songs, the English singer György Ligeti has presented himself at the premiere in Millenáris with the band \"The Puzzle\".
A song from the album has even made it a radio hit - which has been broadcast from early to late pop music mr2 Petőfi has recorded the listeners with the song \"Wings of Love\", recorded with the participation of six local singers \"Underground Divas\", successively set the earworm.
So it's all right (?).
The hvg.hu inquired at Baláz's Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: To what extent does your music remain a certain layer?
Baláz's Zságer: I don't think that the term \"Schichtmusik\" means much to me.
In my opinion, there are two boxes in pop music, not mainstream and underground, or alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even the so-called alternative or underground music can be segregating and nothing-so-called, but they can only be produced for sale, which makes them commercial music.
A good pop number can also come from an honest motive.
The listener's willingness to take part also works independently of languages and national borders according to this principle.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audiences of your music?
B. Zs.: In foreign countries, especially west of us, pop music has a greater tradition.
There are not only teenagers or twenties going to concerts, but also the older audience.
They follow the trends in pop music that happen around them, much more attentively, because they also consider them to be part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience play in your work?
Is it important who, where, how many listen to your music?
E.g.: Of course it is a good feeling to see that more and more come to our concerts.
But we never composed for the market.
With us the music is not created to serve a purpose, but for a particular reason.
The role of the audience is usually felt at the concerts, where there is already a mutual interaction, but in turn there is only in the infernal changes of the moment.
Yet one thing happened to me: If you want to do it right all the time, you are no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: How far do you want to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He is on his way as a soloist and has built his career in the West rather.
E.g.: We are not really going his way, apart from trying to interpret this into our music again and again.
We see ourselves rather as team players relying on the musical presence of the other and allowing them to unfold.
At first, of course, comparisons of our work with that of Yonderboi were inevitable, since several of us came out of his band and took a different path.
hvg.hu: In the charts of mr2 Petőfi, \"Wings of Love\" is the first place.
Many have only heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Was the opening deliberately staged with a slightly more popular style towards a wider audience?
E.g.: We had no plans to write a hit that should then be held as a train horse for the album.
This song is about more.
It was thought of as the finale of the album, with which we wanted to solve the sound orgie and the somewhat more difficult topics.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why just her, what was the guiding principle?
E.g.: The basic idea was to make a gospel-like choir.
Then came the idea of compiling the choir from gifted soloists of the domestic music scene.
This is how the six-member choir was created - Senna, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we then baptized later “Underground Divas”.
hvg.hu: Would you like to have the song the same way, or did the girls like it?
E.g.: The number has been in the instrumental version for a long time, but when the material for the album was finished, we thought that this number still needs something.
The chord sequence has formally demanded a singing voice.
I sang the melody on the same night, and later they learned the girls.
It all came practically on notice and frighteningly spontaneous.
I remember being quite electrified at the time, but it already required the \"divas\".
With my voice alone, the song would never have become so powerful.
hvg.hu: Both on the record and at the concert, however, one had the impression that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo party (apart from Judy Jay's short solo), they have no role to play, sing completely together and are not louder than the music, so their singing is not just accompanied by music.
They were also on stage behind them.
Is it intended?
For example, the fact that they were behind was because of purely technical problems.
However, we deliberately did not want to give them solo roles.
The number also involves forgetting his ego a little, forgetting who came where and where he went, we simply let this particular wing, the wings of love, lift us up.
I would have liked others to feel this euphoric state that we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which was the most elaborate song?
E.g.: In the musical work, there is actually no one at all, there has been more difficult tasks when mixing.
For example, at \"Dorian Gray's Dilemma\" in which I played on a concert piano, or at \"Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls\" where the groove no longer wanted to work, but gradually everything has been joined together, as with a puzzle.
hvg.hu: Which is your favorite song from the new album?
E.g. Zs.: This changes with the concerts constantly and also now, where I have the album “lostly”.
Currently it is called \"Prophet Is A Fool\" (Escape From The Earth) and the number \"Never The Same\" (Never The Same).
Deductive brokers risked billions because of feelings of inferiority
Groundless cheaters
His former employees Jerome Kerviel of the French banking company Société Générale, owner of the local Kommerční banka, is named.
It came by nearly five billion euros.
It seems, however, rather that Kerviel was only a big player who wanted to do the same for his colleagues, in addition, was certainly not incapable.
Unlike all large bank houses, he recognized the crisis in time in the American mortgage market.
“He’s mentally weak,” he heard from his superiors who showed him to the police.
But as can be seen from Kerviel's statements published by the French media, for example the Le Monde daily, he was a person who had earned profits of 1.6 billion euros at the end of last year with his business.
Crisis Not Just in America
“All I wanted was to make money for my bank,” he claims in his statement.
In the summer, he was able to earn half a billion euros directly at the American crisis.
He had already seen the occasion at the beginning of the year.
In February there were first news that so-called sub-prime mortgages, such as the low-income customers or those who had previously had payment problems, would be in trouble.
But this crisis should not affect the whole economy.
Kerviel didn't believe that and kept right.
At the end of the year, he had raised his profits up to 1.6 billion euros.
“Even when I earned the first half billion, I didn’t know how to explain it,” he admits, adding, adding that he definitely didn’t keep anything for himself.
During the whole interrogation, he admits that he has faked documents so that he can't get to the shelves.
He even managed to lead his bosses behind the lights, even though the Eurex stock exchange was gradually interested in his business.
Risk benefit
Was he afraid to fly?
Hardly.
\"I thought she was satisfied with the simple fact that I earned 1.6 billion for the bank,
How did he take the courage to risk so much?
He had to work out his position gradually.
He joined the Society of Generals in 2000, immediately after he finished his studies at the University of Lyon.
Its annual salary was about $51000.
After two years he was already an agent and in 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual salary of $90000.
Yet he knew that he would never earn as much as others.
“When I first spoke in 2005, I knew that I was being watched.
Because of my training and also because of my professional and personal development, Kerviel explained to the investigating officer.
But soon after his entry, the first great success came.
With the Allianz shares, he earned a lot by placing half a billion euros on the price losses of this title in the London bombing attacks.
And that was the trigger - now he wanted more.
As long as you make a win, we'll let you
“This is like a snowball,” he told the policeman.
But the chiefs were supposedly aware of everything, or they knew it.
“As long as I earn money, the eyes are closed,
But then the great blow came at the beginning of this year.
On a single day, he lost one billion euros.
On a weekend in mid-January, he wanted to balance this.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer a bank employee.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it had lost five billion euros.
And how did they get to him?
He was suspicious of himself through a vacation.
“I only took four days from the previous year.
A broker who doesn't take a vacation is one who doesn't want to look at him in the cards, - said Kervüg final.
The Czech Republic has the chance to reach 365 billion
Yesterday, Czech ministers and representatives of the European Commission signed a total of nine development programmes, which will allow the Czech Republic to reach EUR 14 billion (about 365 billion crowns) in the coming years.
It is about half of the sum that the Czech Republic can receive from Brussels in 2007 to 2013.
About 125 billion crowns come from seven regional development programs.
Czech companies will be able to get around 100 billion crowns from the program “Company and Innovation”.
Most money, about 150 billion, will flow into traffic expansion.
The transport programme is the largest development programme and comprises up to 22 percent of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the fund.
This money is raised in line with the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will have 90.8 billion next year.
The \"Company and Innovation\" programme aims to help entrepreneurs and companies to win money into innovative enterprises.
The companies will thus win funding for the introduction of new technologies, for business research, but also for the introduction of more effective organisational methods.
Czech Republic is among the new accession countries among the least successful countries in the current EU fund money acquisition.
Nicaraguan court confirms twenty-year imprisonment for ex-presidents
On Thursday, a court of appeal in Nicaragua confirmed the twenty-year prison sentence for former President Arnold Alemán, to which he was sentenced for financial fraud of $100 million (nearly 1.8 billion crowns) in 2003.
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived under house arrest on his Hazienda at the Nicaraguan metropolis.
According to the AP news agency, whether the former Head of State (1997 to 2002) is back to this Central American state is currently unclear.
According to Ileana Pérez, the chairman of the appeal court, it will now depend on the prison officials whether they leave Alemán's sentence at home or whether he has to go to prison.
A court ruled four years ago that Alemán had regularly moved money from the government to accounts of foreign firms in Panama.
These companies were fictional and the accounts actually belonged to their relatives and closest supporters.
Some of this money ended up in a fund that Alemán had set up to finance his election campaign in 2001.
Budget is through
Yeah, it's done.
The State budget is approved.
What is special about this household?
It is the first budget designed by this government and adopted without the support of the opposition by the coalition majority.
The ČSSD (social democrats) was still approved for the current year because Minister Sobotka (of this party) had presented him, and the ČSSD could not therefore be allowed to reject him.
In contrast to the lively debate before the vote on the motion of distrust against the government this time, nothing was dramatic.
The House of Representatives approved this traditionally little, yet most important, law in complete silence.
That's kind of paradoxical.
All governments begin and end with the individual chapters and posts of the household, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but is obscured by the government's struggle for power and opposition.
This is a more grateful topic for the media, and therefore they pay more attention to it.
A dispute among politicians is much more interesting to the public than sober figures.
The state budgets have suffered from three weaknesses in the past social democratic governments, which the budget cannot eliminate for 2008 at once:
The first is the high proportion of expenditure committed by law, not only by pensions, but also by social expenditure, which has decided the 'silent' coalition of ČSSD and KSČM (communists) last year before the elections.
The second is the deficitary budgetary policy as a result of the first weakness.
The third limitation is the deficits of public finances, i.e. the budgetary deficits of the municipalities.
However, the greatest risk is not the government budget deficit.
This budget is publicly and sometimes under control.
However, a real time bomb is the budget deficit of the municipalities.
Many mayors gave additional sources of investment except for taxes, taxes and bank loans, often giving out unbiased debt bonds, which they overrendered to their councils.
In recent years, they have managed to pay off these debts by mass sale of shares of the energy and other supply networks that they received in the course of privatisation from the state.
Now this source is already sealed.
As far as we are concerned only with official and verifiable facts, we find that:
For a few years now, like the rest of the world, our economy has been experiencing a growth phase, whose ČSSD is famous without interruption.
This was a unique opportunity for their governments to correct public finances.
Instead, however, these governments owed the state even more.
Other countries, except for a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have much more reasonable economies than our Republic.
This is a huge disgrace that is mainly attributed to the former governments.
We are among the countries that, on a global scale, are least at risk of poverty.
That is why there is no need for massive social programmes, which, unfortunately, have been blown up to a huge extent in recent years.
Even if it has succeeded in removing some of the nonsense of populist expenditures adopted this year before the elections, it is clear that if the next time there is no shift in the retirement age and pension reform, then virtually every policy in this country ends, and no matter who is in power, it will not remain a mere administration.
It is only easy to exaggerate when it is said that then ruling politicians become officials who mechanically divide most of the tax revenue into pensions and social expenditure.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be a revolution, but can only stop normal expenditure by means of compulsory expenditure.
The deficit of 70 billion crowns for 2008 would have been superfluous if previous governments had not issued what was going on in the last ten years.
If we do not want it to really come to be purely administrative officials from ruling politicians, then we must be patient and not too strong a coalition government, which, however, is aware that the state can only spend as much as it can on taxes and fees to accept peace in preparing further reform laws.
Only these allow for the progressive enforcement of a balanced state budget.

Banks want to cope with crisis
The U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Central Banks of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together the crisis on the financial markets.
For example, more than 100 billion dollars will be generated by auctions to currency markets.
At these auctions, banks auction interest rates to which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the American Fed sends $40 billion on auction, and another 24 makes it looser for the European and the Swiss Central Bank.
It is the first time after the attacks of 11 September that the central banks of each country agree to a coordinated approach to defence or to mitigate the consequences of a financial crisis.
“This step is intended to eliminate the biggest difficulties of the economy, that is, the growing shortage of freely available capital that banks can afford,” wrote Bernard Baumohl, in a report to his customers from the Economic Outlook Group consulting firm.
\"The coordinated action of the central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the US from 65% to about 50%,\" added Baumohl in his report.
Banks have already lost 60 billion dollars because of unattended loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect further billions of losses.
“The central banks must have been afraid of what can still be done when it is decided to do so,” said ABN Amro’s chief economist, Kieran Davies.
“It looks like the situation is really bad,” he continued.
The central banks are afraid that if banks themselves have difficult access to bonds, loans will also be more expensive for their customers.
This would reduce consumption and push the American economy into recession, possibly with effects on economic growth around the world.
The central banks decided to do so after they failed to reduce the so-called LIBOR, the London Interbank rate used in the money loan between banks.
This means that banks were constantly afraid to borrow money from each other, even though the central banks of the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom had reduced their interest rates several times during the fall.
“This will have the same effect as a further reduction in interest rates,” said Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting of Reuters Agency.
Some analysts believe that this step of central banks contributes to the heating of the crisis because it does not solve the basic problem, namely the case of the real estate market in the US.
Klaus: Ecologists' debates are not credible
Global climate change is said to harm developing countries the most.
President Václav Klaus once again spoke about the problem of global warming.
The criticism now referred to the UN International Conference on Climate Change in Bali that is to come to an end.
In Vienna, where he presented his book \"A Blue, No Green Planet\", he explained that the debates of the ecologists were not credible.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference unacceptable, forming a strange mix of government representatives and such non-governmental organisations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that accompanied them and reality.
\"The debate there is unstructured, it is a word-fire work that only substitutes for a real solution to current problems,\" Klaus said.
The Czech President stressed in his book that his topic was very important to him and that he was therefore so committed to it.
He also expressed his satisfaction at the fact that his book appears in German translation, because I often meet on cartoons of my views,
Now, therefore, stakeholders could look at his attitude uncorruptedly.
Klaus recalled that he was not a climatologist, but he felt he had sufficient prerequisites to write such a book.
Finally, he was an academic capable of understanding and assessing professional negotiations, experience with statistics and was also an economist.
As the book's main statement, he described the thesis that climate is constantly changing and that its changes are normal, that there is no consistent opinion among scientists for global warming that the consequences of current changes are not too big and serious and thus no threat, and that efforts to influence climate development are superfluous, ineffective and unacceptable.
In addition, he considers it as someone who has experience with totalitarian systems to impose unacceptable, unproven views on others, he sees this as a dangerous restriction on freedom.
On questions of those present, he repeatedly stated that he was not opposed to \"a reasonable environmental protection but against militant eco-activists who do not take into account the relationship between effort and yield\"
Klaus had talked about the same topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600000 people failed to exchange their driving licence
600000 drivers missed the time limit to exchange their old driving licence, the validity of which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day that the exchange can be applied for to allow the authorities to issue a new driving licence by the end of the year.
However, the Ministry does not fear that after New Year hundreds of thousands of riders will travel on the streets without valid driving rights.
According to the authorities, mainly those who do not want to drive have not exchanged their driving licence.
While small towns report a strong decline in interest in the trade mark exchange, the capital offices are flooded with requests, and the interest in the exchange grew this week.
The City Administration manufactures around 2000 customers every day.
You have to stand for about half an hour.
In Prague, around 140000 drivers have not yet exchanged their driving licence.
The exhibition will take 20 days to complete a new driving licence.
But it is possible to apply for the exhibition with a shorter period of five days.
In this case, however, the driver must add 500 crowns.
Car drivers who do not create the required exchange until the end of the year without a valid driver's license will be threatened with a fine as of January.
The offender pays a maximum of 2000 crowns.
The police, however, can also use it with a warning in the event of wrongdoing.
In the event of a violation, the penalty may rise to 2500 crowns.
According to previous information, the person may also receive a penalty imposed by the municipality, who does not drive at all.
He could, as it were, threaten a punishment of even 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry has already called on the authorities to hold mild elections and to impose a penalty of 1000 crowns at most.
According to the spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, no one is threatening a thousand crown penalty.
The driving licence is a document that allows anyone to decide whether or not to own it.
It does not deal with a staff card that everyone, namely a valid one, must have.
People who don't want to drive should give up their driving licence.
It is enough to bring him to the competent congregation office or to send him there by enrolment.
At the end of the year, driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will be invalidated.
However, drivers must gradually exchange additional types of driving licences.
People with driving licences from 1994 to 2000 still have three years to change.
The validity of driving licences issued in 2001 to 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it is about 2.6 million more driving licences.
Court lowers penalties for detectives allied with Berdych
The former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, who are accused of having made common cause with the band of David Berdych, received 13 or 10 years of imprisonment.
This was decided by the Prague Supreme Court, which reduced its penalty for a two-year or two.
Originally, the detectives of the \"office for the fight against organized crime\" threatened 14 or 12 years.
Against today's ruling there is no possibility of appeal, only revision by the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdych himself is also accused in this case, but first of all he is in favour of the initial sentence.
In other processes, however, he had already received a total of 16 years of punishment.
More than that, he can't be condemned.
In January a district court charged 19 persons mainly for participation in robberys, the Supreme Court today negotiated the appeal of 16 of them.
Most defendants argued from the beginning with the reasoning that it dealt with a constructed case.
According to the Central Bohemian District Court, members of the police in consultation, among other things, gave information to Berdych Criminals from sources of police, covered various robberys, and helped members of the gang to escape the prosecution.
The band left Opava and Koňařík 30 percent of the prey.
The charges are for crimes committed by the band from 1999 to 2001.
Especially for robberys, whose victims often suffered serious injuries, but also for abuses of authority and unauthorised possession of weapons.
In the case of house searches, the police discovered illegal guns, ammunition with steel cores, a laser target tube and a machine gun.
The band is said to have enriched itself by millions of crowns due to their robbery.
Except for nearly 20 men in this trial, Berdych courts and a number of others recognized legally as guilty due to further robbery.
Other men from Berdych's circle must be responsible in another trial, and further cases have not yet been brought before the court.
The main proceedings have so far escaped Tomáš Půta and Maroš Šulej, who are in Irish custody and are awaiting the final decision on their extradition to prosecute in the Czech Republic.
Children exchanged - invoice: 12 million
The lawyer of the injured parents, Igor Veleba, of the hospital in Třebíč, wants 12 million crowns of compensation plus court fees.
For each of the mothers three million each, for the fathers two million each, and for the children one million each.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200000 for each parent.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostál, therefore disagrees with the proposal of Velebas entirely.
“We reject such a proposal, it lies too high for many times,” said Dostál after today’s negotiations.
\"In order to be able to express an opinion on this counterproposal, however, we need the opinion that the opposite side was created.
We'll find out if it has any statement value at all.
However, we believe that this should be in the hundreds of thousands of years together, - stressed Dostál.
The amount should move between 100000 and 200000 crowns for each of the four parents.
At the beginning, the family from Jablonov wanted a million crowns for every month they had not raised their biological daughter.
For Veleba, the basis for compensation negotiations was an opinion drawn up for him by the University Hospital in Prague Motol.
The parents of the children, according to experts from the field of psychology and psychiatry, suffered mental damage and stress symptoms in different strength and depths.
The men believed the stress situation was better, even if they saw accusations that they could have prevented the confusion of the newborns.
The women, in turn, cope with the aftereffects of the experienced trauma, as well as with what is happening right now, with Veleba's content.
Veronika and Nikola exchanged nurses at the Decommissioning Hospital in Třebíč on 9 December last year.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermáks in Přibyslave, and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jabloňov.
At the end of October, the head of the Vysočina (Böhmisch-Mährische Hoch) handed over 100000 crowns to each family as a substitute for expenses incurred by the failure of the hospital in Třebíč, which is subject to the district.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are insured by law for liability.
In the event of a doubt, they must reach out to a reserve fund, only in exceptional circumstances can they request assistance from the institution.
To date, the courts have attributed comparatively low amounts of damages, the amounts have been determined by tables and have moved in the area of hundreds of thousands, excluding millions.
Polívka came around his kingdom Walachei
Bolek Polívka lost the struggle for the brand \"Kingdom of Walachei\"
According to the judge at the district court in Ostrava, he was the first to use the term \"Walachian king\", but in many years of work the project had built a team around Tomáš Harabiš in collaboration with the actor.
Polívka did not participate in the negotiations today.
According to his lawyer, however, the matter is probably not ended and his client will probably appeal.
“The dispute is that Mr Harabiš and his team want to participate in the popularity of Bolek Polívka’s parasitics,” said after the trial Polívka’s lawyer.
Everyone presented himself to these actors and comedians in the words \"Walachian Kingdom\".
The same opinion is also Harabiš.
“We have a ten-year-old job behind us.
Purchasing and concepts of activities, he said.
According to him, the cause is a struggle for money.
“After years, they noticed that the project was successful and that they could also have some of it.
They want to win parasitically at our work, - he continued.
Lucrative business
According to the court, Polívka used the term \"Walachian King\" for the first time in one of his television broadcasts.
In 1993, he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
But at that time this did not go hand in hand with the intention of establishing a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came up with the idea of spending Welsh passports.
From an initially fun action, a business and an entrepreneurial activity crystallized, to which Harabiš then joined the foundation of the company \"Walachian Kingdom\".
In 1997, Polívka agreed to use his name and signature in the passports and even offered discounts to their owners when visiting his farm and theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also argued that Harabiš used only the mere idea that Polívka had made public for his entrepreneurial intentions in the broadcast “Manege”.
“The popularity of Polívka has certainly helped the project of the Welsh Kingdom,” the judge said.
She added, however, that the soul of Harabiš project and his team were very dedicated to him.
The cooperation of the parties that are now disembarked lasted until 2000, when Harabiš organized the official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, the disputes between Polívka and Harabiš have begun to arise, which in the settlement \"King Boleslavs I elected to St. Nemins-Leins-day\" have been painted.
The leadership role then took on inspiration Harabišs Jarmila Šuláková as queen mother.
In 2002, Polívka filed a lawsuit against Harabiš and his company, which the court rejected today.
Clarity in the dispute could bring the battle prepared by Harabiš for the throne and half a princess.
A new king should come out of that.
Details and an appointment he didn't want to tell yet.
“We don’t want to overreact.
It's supposed to be like the king's move in the Walachei.
The king was to be elected for a certain period of time.
Mr Polívka can also sign up in a calm manner, - added Harabiš.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Front parts disappear
To tell the truth, I was never a special fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not worth much, the quality of the gear, steering and also the processing could be described as below average.
But now his successor, Peugeot 207, is on the market, and he is much better.
The combination with the term SW is still a bit further, and I just want to revise my opinion.
When I tested the classic hatchback of 207, for example, I had to complain about too little head freedom on the back seats.
These complaints are no longer available, because the body of the combi is designed so that not even two-meter men will suffer.
Fast Forward
I just go through the interior to avoid repeating too much.
It's a really successful design, where I only have objections because of the cool middle tunnel.
There I would welcome a bit more designer design, where the car otherwise makes such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable, and beyond are the times when we may complain about too short seats or headrests.
The page content has also improved considerably compared to the 206.
As far as space is concerned, you can also see here the enlarged dimensions of the body.
In combination, the already mentioned lack of head-freeness is also eliminated.
Bag in the trunk
But the main thing about this car is the loading room.
I have to describe it (also because of the folding back window) as very easy to load and space saving.
The hollow rooms are equipped with straps, which represent an ideal compromise.
They do not interfere, can move apart and also hold heavier objects.
But we're talking about the load volume.
According to the table in the basic equipment, it is 428 litres, which is a more average value compared to competition.
However, not compared to the most sold vehicle in the Czech Republic, the Škoda Fabia Combi.
When we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we find that the peugeot remains with clearly noticeable 52 litres.
This value is already critical for a stay abroad or when you invite a children's car.
But in order to highlight the positives, I still have to mention the very flat loading room or the very low loading edge after wrapping the back seats.
120 hp in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder petrol engine with engine capacity of 1.6 litres and a power of 88 kWp.
And frankly, a 1600 cubic engine that drives a family hitchback should look like that.
It's quiet, has a low consumption and goes well away.
If I compare him to his counterpart at Škoda, which sometimes acts as if his exhaust was clogged with a lap, then I can only be thrilled by him.
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not just popular.
We must remember, however, that we tested a well-equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400 petrol engine at the height of 329900 Kronen is still going on.
With our engine it costs 410900 crowns, which is quite a lot already.
The equipment Premium of the test car again beats with 80000 crowns in addition to beech.
However, we had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic disc wiper discharge, electric window lifters behind and...
This is how the car costs a total of just 531900 crowns.
This is a lot, but once you count the addition of a Fabia together and you will arrive at a very similar sum.
So only the choice of brand one wants to choose remains.
Integration of Slovak pupils in British schools is not successful
UK schools are increasing the number of children from Eastern Europe, which causes local fears about the further development of local schooling.
The integration of the Eastern Europeans has so far been subject to a number of obstacles.
British schools even find cases where disputes between immigrants and the children of the original residents increase in violence.
The problem of integrating children from Eastern Europe into British schools illustrates the case of North Kent, where the disputes between locals and Slovak immigrants are gradually increasing.
Struggles, schikans and robbery among pupils have transferred to the relationships between parents.
The situation has developed so far that the police in Chatham arrested a Slovak woman who had beaten a ten-year-old boy with an iron rod.
The accused defended himself from insulting the boy with racist insults.
The police also had to intervene on a Slovak immigrant after an attack by two minor girls.
The girls had allegedly made racist remarks to the man and threw him with stones.
“When we went home, a boy climbed onto a bush sauce and spit on us.
When I told him to stop, he threw us with apples and pears and then blew his butt, a mother of Slovak students from The Times described another unpleasant incident.
Complaints come from both sides.
One of the locals even described the struggle with the immigrants from Eastern Europe as a survival struggle.
The cases cited show that the mood between locals and immigrants in British schools is becoming more and more intense.
In the UK, 70000 Slovakians have been reported coming here for job searches.
About 30,000 Slovak students therefore attend British schools.
Cuba - most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors it is really an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holiday will be fulfilled if you choose only the right person.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea that is quiet like a pond.
Palms and All Inclusive with waiters offering pizza, ice cream on the beach and captivating cocktails.
Kitesurfing, Golf and Roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean you will find this to a great extent.
But only on one island you will find much more, and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba was their bastion for the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place ever seen by a human eye.
Havanna once became a warehouse or transit warehouse of treasures that the Spanish had robbed in America and then transported to Europe.
And then came the American era.
The Nacional Hotel was built at the end of the 20th century.
It was built by one of the chiefs of the American Mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was considered a crime in the United States (especially during the Prohibition), was seen and supported in Cuba - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were among others.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-rises grew over the broad boulevards, which were among the cult symbols of the fifties of the past century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojímar he had his yacht lying down.
Stars of the show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
And today?
You can also leave your autograph on the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana.
At the bar at the Hotel Nacional you mix cocktails as you wish.
And the cult cars of the fifties drive around in Havana to this day, because the once imported Schigulis and Fiats have long since collapsed in the salty and humid air.
Mag Havana, especially its oldest part, has come down heavily, nowhere can you find as many wonderful colonial sights as here.
Other places are being pushed out, for example Trinidad.
In view of the urgent need for money for tourism, there was a green light for this development.
In the last fifteen years not only new hotels have emerged in Havana, but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and also on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers another marotte that is unique in the world and attracts mainly rail lovers.
The sugar cane from remote plants brought steam- and the same-driven narrow trackways to the sugar factories.
Their fleet has not been renewed for decades, so there are well-kept and fully functioning locomotives, whose age-old fellows are in the museum for a long time.
Destinations for excursions
The most important places do not leave out the majority of visitors to Cuba.
So you don't have to write about Varadero or Havana in more detail.
Just keep mentioning that in the already mentioned Hemingways estate there is a museum whose visit should not be missed by the one who likes this writer.
The Viñales valley in the west of the island is one of Cuba's most picturesque angles.
The lush vegetation grows on lime floor.
The mogotas, lime hills and rocks, rise steeply from the valley floor, in their hollow rooms gathered fertile soil, which also covered weathered rock areas of dense vegetation.
This valley is where the perhaps best Cuban tobacco is grown.
In its final form, you can meet him when you visit one of Havana's cigar factories.
It may also seem interesting that the Chilean episode of the television series “Major Zeman” was filmed there.
Trinidad
An ancient city that was founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
Her fame and wealth brought her the trade of slaves and sugar.
The wealth was embodied in the beautiful beauty of the small town.
The Spanish colonial architecture, strongly influenced by the later French settlers, has hardly changed for four hundred years.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray mountains, is such a remote place that in the 1950s there was no road that would have connected the area to the other country.
This isolation contributed to the lack of respect for it.
Nothing was built there, but therefore nothing was torn, everyone was glad that he had a roof over his head.
If you have more than one afternoon time for Trinidad, it is worth seeing interesting places in the area, such as the beach Playa Ancón or the valley of sugar factories.
In the evening you should go to Casa de la Música, which lives after the darkness, and where the music does not sweat until the morning.
Baracoa
This town in eastern Cuba refers to some as the most beautiful of the island.
Certainly, this view is also influenced by the way in which it goes.
Both roads leading from Guantánamo there must overcome high and winding mountains and pass through a landscape that is hardly affected by human intervention.
This eastern suburb of Cuba took UNESCO into its world heritage directory thanks to the unspoiled nature there.
There is the best chocolate produced in the church showing the cross of Columbus (in reality it was created about a hundred years after the voyages of Columbus), and from the hill where the former castle, the present-day El Castillo, stands, there are several table mountains, of which El Yunque is the most famous.
About the coffee, the rum, the cigars, the Sierra Maestra Mountains, the pig's bay and the island of Isla de Pinos, about the Tropicana Cabaret, the sanctuary of Cuban patron Caridad del Cobre, about Santeria, an African religion to which the descendants of slaves confess, about all this one could write many pages.
But, as you say, better look with your own eyes.
Ally in Afghanistan are passive, claiming Americans.
Too few soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment affect the United States according to the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO should, according to Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, design a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan did not follow their ideas, and the representatives of the countries stationed in the south of the country in Scotland agreed in Edinburgh.
In addition to the growing resistance from the Taliban side, the eight participating states also discuss further coordination plans among the allies.
While the United States called for more activity by its Minister of Defense Robert Gates, Britain sees the priority in strengthening the authority of Afghan government and in intensifying development assistance.
“A forward development is noticeable in Afghanistan, but military power can only be a part of the solution.
Another part is to enable the inhabitants to start developing economic and security themselves, says the British Minister for Defense Des Browne of the BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan insurgent has reached the highest level for five years, according to the American army.
The number of acts of violence increased by 27 percent compared to the previous year, in the southern province of Helmand even by sixty percent.
NATO countries have stationed some 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the allies have reached an absolute limit on the organisation and equipment of the units.
They specifically demand more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
“We will have to give serious thought to the concrete objectives for the next time and to the way we can achieve them,” said Gates.
Similarly today, NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop spoke.
“I am not happy about what we have to land and air in Afghanistan.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that's too little, \"De Hoop of Reuters Agency said to conclude three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
In recent months, there has also been a dispute among the countries involved as to whether all the allies in Afghanistan are doing their best.
For example, Germany has been criticized for being passive.
“The Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
But they are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum of violence and the fighting requirements for them are not as high as for us in the southern and eastern part of the country, said Gates.
This week the British Boulevard newspaper \"Sun\" called the German soldiers \"Fulpelze\".
“Afghanian Non-Stuur disenchanted: The Germans make games while our boys are fighting,” wrote the “Sun” in a post supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German picture newspaper went over to counter-attack and printed a picture of a British unit in a rugby competition in southern Afghanistan.
State debt will accelerate to one Billion in 2009
On every Chechen there is a sovereign debt of 84000 crowns.
The total debt rose to 842.7 billion crowns by the end of September.
The government had planned to owe 159.2 billion cans this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion thanks to the improved development of the state budget policy.
The government debt of the Czech Republic rose to 842.7 billion crowns by the end of September.
As a result, within the first nine months of this year, it increased by 40.2 billion.
Since June, however, they have fallen by 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance thus confirmed its information on the government debt from the beginning of October.
On every Chechen there is a debt of 84000 crowns.
Over the past year, the state owed itself more than 111 billion crowns.
“Up until now, it seems that thanks to the lower deficit for the coming year, we may not exceed the limit of a Billion Kronen until 2009.
Next year, the debt would move between 900 billion and a billion crowns, said David Marek, analyst of Patria Finance, server iHNed.cz.
Similarly, Vladimír Pikora, analyst of the Next Finance, says: “We could come across a billion in the course of 2009.
If so, it depends on the next budget that we do not yet know.
If it should be shown that the situation on the political stage is changing, and politicians should be willing to save more, this could last until 2010.
But I don't expect such a change to happen, he noticed.
Growth of debt
The government debt comes from the government's debt and comes mainly from the accumulation of deficits of the state budget.
The government debt is financed by treasury statements, government bonds, direct bonds or, for example, by bonds from the European Investment Bank.
The national government debt now rose to 719.4 billion crowns this year.
The foreign debt of the state now rose by 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable government debt reached 803.3 billion crowns at the end of September and decreased by 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of government debt rose to 6.5 years.
“The total debt rose by 13 percent over the year from the first to the third quarter, which is really much in view of how well the economy is doing.
It is interesting that the growth is particularly evident in debt securities, where the increase is 20 percent.
It is bad that the debt rises, but on the other hand this shows that you can do something before the pension reform comes, Pikora commented on the data.
Better than expected
The financing strategy and handling of public debt for 2007 show that the government had planned for this year to include 159.2 billion crowns.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns thanks to the improved development of government budgetary policies.
This amount is mainly due to the government budget deficit, which will obviously reach 76 billion crowns this year instead of the estimated 91.3 billion.
It is also a maximum planned budget for the consolidation agency of 13.3 billion crowns, a ten-billion reserve for the payment of pensions, the financing of government debt securities for 43 billion and for rates for the loans to the European Investment Bank of 1.8 billion.
For giving a name to a teddy bear, she was presented to a court in Kum today.
According to her lawyer, the British teacher who had been accused of insulting Islam in Sudan was sentenced to 15 days in prison by a court in Khartum on Thursday evening and subsequent expulsion.
The British were accused of allowing six to seven-year-old pupils to give a teddy bear the name Mahomet, although any representation of the Islamic prophet is forbidden.
She would have deserved to be kicked out.
After parents of pupils had complained to the Sudanese Ministry of Culture several times, the 54-year-old elementary school teacher, who worked at the University High School of Khartum, was taken home on Sunday and accused of insulting Islam in accordance with Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code.
In fact, this issue takes its start in September when the teacher calls on her six- to seven-year-old students to choose a name for the class teddy.
The children suggest eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, reports head of school Robert Boules.
Finally, when the class votes, 20 of 23 children choose Muhammad as their favorite first name.
Of course, Muhammad is the name of the Islamic prophet, but above all, also a very common name in Sudan.
Afterwards, the children created a book for the class, with the photo of the bear on it and the image signature My name is Mohammed .
The bear itself did not carry a shield with this name, but the problem is quite simple, that the representation of the Islamic prophet is regarded as insulting Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, said he knew them well, and she would never have done anything that could have led her to a religious belief, I only regret that she asked the children to vote for a name, in his opinion this is just an innocent mistake.
An opinion shared by numerous students of the teacher who described these as very attentive to their students and as a person who never spoke in class about religion.
Consider that the first name Mohammed is also the second most commonly given second name in the UK, for which 14 different forms of writing exist in English.
This first name, often chosen by Muslim families, is considered to be a kind of honor to the prophets (he is often given to the firstborn of a family).
But how do the rules regarding the use of this first name sound?
Is it possible, for example, to give him a toy?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
There was no agreement on the future status of the province at the last negotiating session in Vienna on Wednesday.
At the end of the failure
The Serbs and Albanians from Kosovo ended a sixth and last session on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, without being able to overcome their controversy about the future status of the separatist province.
It is regrettable that the parties could not reach agreement on the status, said European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
With emphasis on the fact that peace was at stake in the region, his American counterpart Frank Wilsner called on Belgrade and Pristina to fulfill their obligations to maintain peace and continue the talks beyond the end of the negotiations.
No acts of violence are expected in the immediate future, but we are at the beginning of a very difficult time, he added and indicated that there are quite clear tensions.
End of mediation on 10 December
The mediators of the Troika, which unites the European Union, the USA and Russia, will meet for the last time in Serbia and Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the 90% of Albanian speakers could become clearer if Ischinger, Wilsner and the Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submitted their report to the UN Security Council by 10 December.
The talks of Baden, near Vienna, formed the sixth and last session of negotiations since the Troika had received a new mediation from the UN last August.
Americans and Europeans expect their mediation order to end on 10 December.
The Russians, who had already blocked the approval of Kosovo's independence to the Security Council, are continuing negotiations beyond that end date.
Russia was and continues to advocate a negotiated solution, a common solution, Botsane-Khartchenko said.
One-sided Declaration of Independence?
For eight years after Kosovo was under UN administration, the Western countries considered EU independence under EU supervision the only solution with a future.
Pristina is ready to announce this unilaterally if the Security Council should not decide in favour of it.
Belgrade is based on greater autonomy
Unfortunately no agreement could be reached , the president of Kosovo's autonomous authority, Fatmir Sejdiu, announced at the hotel in Baden, where since Monday these negotiations have been held the last chance.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Cosovarian Rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, expressed regret.
He added, however, that the plan proposed by Belgrade belonged to the autonomy of a past that led to murders and deportations .
Domino Effect
The Serbian President Boris Tradic, for his part, felt that a compromise would always be sought and warned the Albanian majority of Kosovo of the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence from the province.
Belgrade believes that it is particularly a “Domino effect” in a region that is still so weakened by the wars of independence in the 1990s.
For Serbia this does not mean that compromise would be impossible, he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision be made only by one and only one and only one in the Security Council, where their Russian allies have a right to veto.
Kosovo's Parliament will have the last word
Only one decision made by the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia, said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
These negotiations took two years.
They must end as they began: in the Security Council.
The journalist replied to Fatmir Sejdiu that Kosovo's Parliament would have the last word on the status and added that any unilateral Declaration of Independence will expire in agreement with the Western countries on the part of the Albanian speaking population.
Bush triggers an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of the International Peace Conference, held on Tuesday under its leadership in Annapolis, Maryland, President Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed to a joint declaration.
He further stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to start negotiations immediately to find a final settlement of the 60-year-old disputes between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a peace treaty before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians had to destroy terrorist infrastructures and Israel had to put in place its colonization work, Bush said, reminding the two parties of their commitments to the roadmap for the peace they had agreed to in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian authorities under Abbas last end sought a peace treaty to clarify all open issues without exception, and including the central issues.
This term covers the three grave problems that mainly revolve around the disputes between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arab refugees who were expelled from their homeland in the course of the 1948 conflict, which is in today's State of Israel.
According to the U.S. President, Abbas spoke and insisted that the forthcoming negotiations be carried out comprehensively and thoroughly and that they provide a regulation for all points, including Jerusalem, the refugees, the borders, the colonies, water and security.
On his part, when Olmert took the floor, he committed himself to conducting the upcoming ceasefire negotiations directly and without interruption and to trying to end it even before the end of 2008.
Bush set the time limit for the implementation of his vision of two states , a Palestinian and an Israeli who live side by side, for the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has revealed that Bush has received assurance in this sense from Bush before it decided to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis represents a great success for Washington, has led a plan taken by all Arab countries that offers peace to Israel, in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the war of 1967, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis is a divisive path in the history of the Middle Orient, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and at its central points of view, the Saudi Arab Prince says in his interview with the Arab-speaking daily financed by Saudi funds.
According to the state lawyer, the police are not responsible
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always with this kind of local news, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigation of the National Disciplinary Authority of the Police (IGPN), a police car headed for Villiers-le-Bel on Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m.
He had no use, but was on strip, and drove with 40-50 km/h, without blue light, a police spokesperson.
A green motorcycle of the brand Kawasaki, not released for public traffic (see below), came, controlled by two young people without helmet, driven at very high speed.
It rammed the left side of the police car after it had ignored its advance from the right, a policeman continued.
The alcohol control carried out in vehicle passengers is far negative.
The condition of the car (spoiled cot wing, split windscreen, torn shock rod) is evidence of the heaviness of the impact.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the state lawyer of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry announced that she had entrusted the IGPN with an investigation into the ‘facts of involuntary suicide and the lack of assistance to persons in danger’, in agreement with the main management for public safety of Val-d`Oise.
In the afternoon, on the occasion of a press conference, the state lawyer declared that it excluded IGPN from the responsibility of the police officers at this stage.
According to the Magistratin, three witnesses of the accident heard Sunday evening confirmed the version of the police, namely that this small-wheel wheel was approaching its left side relatively quickly.
Yesterday a kind of rilling, certainly caused by the friction of the footstools on the ground, showed that the two vehicles were stuck together until the police managed to brake.
The vehicles were seized and will be subject to a technical assessment.
The body names of the two victims were observed yesterday.
What happened next?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, a rumor quickly made the round, as a result the police would have left the accident place very quickly, and that, without helping the two young people.
Although the IGPN remains very careful, it would also exclude this matter with regard to any serious error.
According to a police source, this is a difficult aspect of the investigation for which further investigations are necessary and in which there is a great need for careful action.
Libération has met an eyewitness of these few moments shortly after the accident.
From one of his windows he had direct views of the scene.
We immediately went out with my cousin, who is a nurse in the hospital, to try to revive her, this witness tells us.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw a completely destroyed policeman who was limping.
Two others tried to revive one of the young people who phoned fourth.
In view of the tension that quickly arose around the event and, as it seems, because of the certainty that the people present had about the unsolicited situation of the young people, the police officers from colleagues who had arrived at the accident site were taken away in the car.
Still according to this testimony, the rescue forces arrived about twenty minutes after the police left.
They have also taken heart massages, but in vain.
I am not going to let you say that the police had not helped the young people.
The first aid was given to these young people.
The firefighter came right away.
Everything was done to try to save her, she emphasised the lawyer.
In Pakistan, tension increases
On Monday the Pakistani police struck down the first demonstrations, two days before General Musharraf had proclaimed the emergency.
Witness statements suggest that in Lahore City, east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers who demonstrated the measures taken in the context of the emergency were injured by the tear gas grenades that the law enforcement forces used there.
Those then threw stones with which they violated the police.
At least 350 lawyers were arrested temporarily.
Similar scenarios existed in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police attacked and injured lawyers.
Several would have been temporarily arrested.
In Islamabad, the lawyers of the Supreme Court called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, as a result of a wave of about 500 arrests of oppositional, human rights defenders and lawyers during the weekend.
On Monday morning, the streets leading to the Supreme Court had been blocked to prevent the assembly.
Further demonstrations would have taken place in Multan (Mitte) and Peshawar (Nordosten).
On Monday, the election was supported by the religious parties united in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, whose president urged the population to send flowers to the judges who opposed the emergency and to those who had taken an oath before Musharraf.
Musharraf's promise no longer applies
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the special measure announced on Saturday evening.
On the following days he had to refer to the legality of President Musharraf's re-election in a direct election on 6 October.
The President of the Court of Justice, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was dismissed and dismissed from his office.
All that we represent is illegal, anti-constitutional and contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court , the Magistrate of the newspaper The News stated.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to give the command of command of the army and become a civilian president no longer applies since the call of the emergency, said the Minister of Information Tariq Azeem on Monday.
It was expected that he would give his military uniform until November 15, the date on which his first term of office as president ends.
The Vice-Minister for Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government demented the rumors that were persistent in the country, according to which President Musharraf had been assigned a residence by his deputy commander.
Still more than a third of pregnancies are not planned
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unforeseen births.
Even today, 40 years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Act, which allowed contraception in France, one of three pregnancies (36%) is not planned, as a study by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined) shows.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unforeseen births.
The Ined estimates that the different methods of contraception such as the pill or spiral still show a failure rate of 5-6%.
According to the Institute, which notes that the percentage of pill users between the ages of 20 and 40 who use the pill has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, the liberalisation of contraception has nevertheless allowed better control of fertility.
In any case, eight of ten births are planned carefully today.
In one of five couples even calculated exactly on the month, and, if possible, in the spring, the season in which it seems most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair at the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his comrades from the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) will have used more than seven hours in space to perform the spectacular repair of a defective solar collector that is indispensable for continuing scientific work at the station.
A daring exit, which due to its duration, the removal of habitable modules, the speed with which it was organized, and the tools built by astronauts to perform the repair, has achieved several records.
The problem arose on Wednesday, when the astronauts had downloaded the Harmony module from the Discovery spacecraft, a large cylinder-shaped part, which is about to absorb the European and Japanese scientific laboratories.
This module is a kind of landing bridge for the module lab.
But you have to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was to implement a 17.5 tonnes heavy module for power generation via solar collectors already on the ISS to bring it into its final position.
After they moved it, the crew went to the restructuring of the solar panels of the module, whose span was 76 meters.
And then it happened that one of the collectors who could fold up like accordions was damaged by an enclosed cable at a length of about one meter.
The restructuring was stopped to no longer harm the collector.
The astronauts who originally left the Discovery spacecraft for a control course and then another solar collector whose rotation system was faulty were forced to dedicate themselves to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was selected to walk around at the end of the 30-metre-long remote-controlled arm of the spacecraft that had been attached to the station to perform the repair.
He is one of NASA's best spacewalkers.
Large, resistant, very skillful, he has a well developed upper body and long arms.
The 46-year-old doctor was thus selected to operate the injured solar collector.
After carefully examining the damage, he separated the faulty cable and fixed some kind of rail on the damaged spot.
He was supported by a second spacewalker, who remained near the castle, and, from within, by the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, commander of the crew.
The tool he used, a mini hockey striker, wrapped with insulator to prevent an electric blow on the solar collectors that generated several hundred volts, had the astronauts on board the station thought and baffled.
When the action ended, Scott Parazynski waited until the collector was fully folded before counting his tools and returning to the station.
Last afternoon the astronauts enjoyed half a day of relaxation, before today seven astronauts returned to the Discovery spacecraft to start the return flight to Earth on Wednesday.
The title EADS on the stock exchange sanctioned
After the Aviation and Defense Group announced that it will have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to counter the residues of the A400M, EADS is currently showing a significant decline on the Paris Stock Exchange.
EADS currently loses 4% to EUR 21.96 on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The Group was forced to review its 2007 business forecasts once again referring to the residues caused by the slow development of the A400M engine, which delay the flight of the aircraft.
The costs announced in October to offset the delay in the delivery of their military transport aircraft amounted to between €1.2 billion and €1.4 billion, of which more than one billion for Airbus , announced by the European manufacturer EADS's parent company .
Based on these costs, EADS will be forced to announce new operating performance targets (EBIT) for 2007, when presenting its quarterly results, without further detail.
The group also indicates that the assessment of the new costs is related to the six-month backlog.
In order to remember that EADS’ business performance fell from 86% in 2006, significantly due to the delay of another program, the very large carrier aircraft A380 costs.
Originally, the group had planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French Army for October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
On Sunday it will not be exciting to count the urns: the mass of Russians will decide for President Putin's party, United Russia.
After a very closed election campaign, she confirms her desire for stability, even for authoritarianism.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin issued a message to the public broadcasters, who have already been recorded, but whose content is kept secret.
He does so in his capacity as the United Russia's top candidate, the Pro-Kreml Party, for which he announces an overwhelming victory.
Yesterday the President had nothing to look through when he received the foreign ambassadors, and was pleased to deliver a new attack point against the Western powers accused of interference - his favorite theme during the election campaign.
We know the price of true democracy and expect honest elections , extremely transparent and open , elections without fraud , he added .
From the point of view of the opposition, they have done so.
She denounces an election campaign that has been mocked by oppression.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that there would never have been such dirty elections, not even in each person's time.
After the suppression of the demonstrations last weekend, ex-Schachwelt champion Garry Kasparovder was sentenced to five days in prison for unauthorised demonstrations, according to his lawyer continued to be banned from visiting.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovieticus
After these parliamentary elections without any tension, two many more questions arise:
Who will succeed Putin as President?
Last yesterday the term of office announced the date of the first election of the presidential elections, 2 March 2008; the candidates have until 23 December time to make themselves known.
Since he was elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot join a third mandate in succession.
And now there is no successor.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
President of the majority of Parliament and the All-Mighty Party United Russia, the government and the President will choose?
Whatever it may be, in the parliamentary or presidential elections, the present power will triumph.
This is tradition.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovieticus, they are not master of their fate, says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the Independent Center Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov of the State University of St. Petersburg goes even further: the bourgeois society has developed very slowly in this country, which has been christianized to Europe for five centuries; the famous community spirit has delayed the development of individuality.
After the liberal reforms of the 90s Putin has once again linked to the model of a paternalist state, which was completely accepted by the population, all the more so since this new paternalism did not follow terror, but rather some economic prosperity, Maria Lipman says of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today , the Russians from free pieces renounced the personal responsibility that they had put on short-term after the collapse of the USSR .
What are you thinking for a long time?
This phenomenon concerns all layers of society, including the business world.
And the administrative elite understands to keep the status quo: 65 governors (of 85 Russian regional leaders) are leading the local electoral lists of the United Russia.
The new freedoms coming from the West are often equivalent to chaos, as in the 90s.
Generality prefers stability.
In this sense, the Russians will not vote for the extremist parties either.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: What do you think for a long time?
Those who are in power are not so bad as to redeem them?
A Hard Remembering
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which document the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now freely available.
The 47 million documents of the archive, which are located at a total length of 27 km in Bad Arolsen, have not yet been able to be viewed, except with a humanitarian intention, in other words individually and called upon to question a former victim or his family.
The eleven States, including Germany, France, Israel and the USA, with their administration, agreed in May 2006 to make them accessible to researchers and historians.
After the ratification process of this Decision has been completed, the opening has been valid since yesterday.
Heikle Information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will enable researchers to conduct research, especially on the deportations of prisoners, the inmates of concentration camps and the state of health of forced workers, Reto Meistern, head of this archives, which are managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, several states, including Germany, were opposed to making these name-related documents accessible to the public, due to the delicate nature of certain information.
For example, the alleged homosexuality or the mental disability of some deportation victims.
The listings of the concentration camps or the arrest warrants issued by the Gestapo had been compiled after the war for a practical reason: to find civilians who had been deported or subjected to forced labour, and perhaps to provide them with a means of proof of their arrest so as to pave the way for their compensation.
Today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent staff are processing tens of thousands of personal requests.
Nevertheless, part of the scientific community shows only a limited interest in access to Bad Arolsen.
Nothing is fundamentally new in these documents, Mr. Wolfgang Benz, Head of the Research Centre for Anti-Semitism at the Technical University of Berlin, explained in 2006.
The EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008.
Currently, mutual trade between India and Europe is already reaching the 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India's most important trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
European Minister of Commerce Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, stated that the European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
The EU Foreign Ministers had given the European Commission a green light last April to open negotiations to sign free trade agreements (ALEs) with India, South Korea and the Association of South-East Asian Nations (Aseans) and trade between India and Europe at 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but according to the figures of the European Commission, India is only the ninth trading partner of the EU.
A free trade pact will greatly advance the two economic areas and India would improve its access to a market of 450 million wealthy Europeans, confirmed Peter Mandelson.
Europe is the first or second market for the ten most frequently exported products from India, the European Commissioner said. The Asian and European giants exchange annual goods worth 47 billion euros and services worth 10 billion euros, Daniéle Smadja, chairman of the European Commission's New Delhi settlement this week, had declared, and regrets that mutual trade has not yet exhausted its potential.The EU and India will meet on Friday to its eighth diplomatic in New Delhi, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barroso.

The Bank of England takes note of the concern and offers 10 billion pounds for five weeks
On Thursday, the Bank of England expressed concern about curbing current recurring concern over credit conditions and announced an offer of ten billion pounds with a basic interest rate of 5.75% for five weeks, an offer with unusual duration.
In order to reduce the fears that the conditions on the financial market will be particularly severe at the end of the year and to give banks greater certainty as to the way in which they are to organize their liquidity positions at the time , the Bank intends to offer a significant portion of its savings during the maintenance phase starting on 6 December , in the form of an open market operation for five weeks , in a notice .
The Bank continues to state that on 6 December at 12.15 GMT 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be transferred, at the basic tax rate and only by 10 January.
This seems to be the first time that BoE is running around in an open-market operation of liquidity for five weeks.
This usually happens for a week.
In its communication, BoE adds that it is prepared to take further measures to maintain the interest rates of interbank loans varying from day to day with its basic interest rate.
The interbank interest rate from day to day was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate has risen to 6.6%, slightly higher since September 18.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the sums of fines that the banks had prevented from using them have been linked by the Bank of England.
According to certain rumours, reinforced by the development of the pounding rate as opposed to the euro, many preferred to sign for the sums transferred by the European Central Bank, more favourable interest rates and with safer discretion
UMP and NC refuse to review the PS's proposals for purchasing power
On Thursday, the UMP and Nouveau Centre groups refused to discuss the articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which resembled a rejection of the text.
The text produced in the context of a socialist niche (meeting on the initiative of a parliamentary group) indicated about ten measures adopted by the National Committee of the PS on Wednesday, most of which were 50% for employment allowance, reintroduction of the TIP, a transport check or the limitation of rents.
After UMP and NC voted against the examination of the articles (180 votes against 115), the session was dissolved after the main discussion, which offered to partially violent word changes between majority and opposition, several hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's television contribution about purchasing power.
The leader of the members of PS Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group would present the whole of its proposals as an amendment to the bill for the correction of finances that had been examined by the Assamblee last week.
A new festival is born
As a result of numerous rumors regarding the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in cooperation with Festival Republic of the UK producer Melvin Benn.
It is an honor for our company to work with a person who, no longer and no less, has served as an example for the current festival movement in America, told Charlie Jones of C3 on Bilboard.com.
C3 organises the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping holidays.
The festival will take place from 8 to 10 August on a 500-acre private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of Festival Republic Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the producers of the world's most renowned festivals.
In 1989 he took over the direction of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts around 80,000 people each year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added his portfolio to the Leeds Festival, and then, in 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival in Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn, as a co-owner, has also taken care of the production, the licensing concessions and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3, who describes Glastonbury as the most inspiring event in which he has ever been involved, says that his company and that of Melvin Benn are working in parallel with each other to provide the area with a festival event in European style.
We chose Philadelphia as a market and worked diligently with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in the city centre of Philadelphia, says Charlie Jones.
We conducted negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we have remained stuck in political debates regarding the current administration, continues Charlie Jones.
\"Happy we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are preparing to create a great festival in an extraordinary place that will ultimately benefit the population,
C3 Presents revived the Lullapalooza Festival in 2005 at Grand Park Chicago after it was profiled in 2002 together with Austin City Limits Music Festival in the world of the festival.
The two events were able to achieve $9.8 million in 2007 and $11.8 million in gross taxes in 2007.
These two festivals take place in urban environments.
“The European model of Melvin Benn is a rural festival, whereas those of us are more likely to take place on the urban green areas,” says Charlie Jones.
\"The aim is to merge these two concepts one way or the other in order to give the impression of a rural festival in the European and urban ways,
Vineland is located about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The community of Vineland, including the mayor, takes pleasure in the burden of this event,” says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to award the terms of the agreement, but he confirms that they are sufficiently interesting to invest in such an event and to host a festival that will hopefully have a long life,
Charlie Jones says that the recording capacity of the festival is - very large - equivalent to about 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that the invitations were sent to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed when they were printed.
“Vineland will offer tasteful rock, but music will be very diverse, hoping to attract all kinds of viewers,” says Charlie Jones.
His partners of C3, who received the Top Independent Promoter Award of the last Bollboard Touring Award, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal meets the terminator.
Not easy to get the main platform for Hollywood films to Montreal when no less than the terminator opposes.
These lock trials are among the delegate tasks.
A political “heavy mandate” because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, challenges the runaway productions.
Is it difficult to negotiate with the \"governator\"?
“You have to be careful, because it’s the industry that decides where it goes.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favourable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer those who are considered to be the best - he says.
The Run to the Festivals.
Denis Turcotte, however, has the highest priority at the moment of introducing the cinema there.
The hunt for the Oscars has begun.
At all the festivals on the west coast, although that of Sundance, that of Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it will be about presenting the films from Quebec, assessing them and ensuring that the producers give interviews.
The dark age had a successful performance at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
He will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on the poster in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
This month Quebec also presented four long and four short films at the American Film Institute Festival.
Is the stock exchange a final year rally? Disunity among the experts due to the US mortgage crisis
With almost five weeks until the end of the year on the stock exchange, investors already rub their hands in terms of the coming final year rally.
Nevertheless, the experts cannot produce a safe forecast of this.
Banif believes that purely statistical view, the month of December on the stock exchange usually corresponds to a positive market development
Nevertheless, it is not advisable to draw up forecasts in the short term and only on the basis of statistics, especially if the current market situation is to be determined by serious tensions.
Although other experts do not approve such a strong price increase in the last few weeks of the year, they nevertheless note that the stock exchange rate is determined by the given liquidity of the market and the market participants, which, due to the lack of secure stock funds, is mainly affected by pension funds, which are heavily affected by the emerging trend towards profitable assets.
According to these experts, the stock exchange will show a rather lateral price trend influenced by market fluctuations, especially because we cannot yet estimate the extent of the possible decrease in the US bank’s interest rate, an uncertainty that is mainly due to the increased crude oil price and the risk of inflation increase.
Javier Barrio, chairman of the sales department at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is a waiting time to announce an upcoming market rally.
The chances are not very good, assures the expert.
The Spanish stock index Ibex has already lost a value of 4% since its highest mark on November 8 of 15.945.7 points.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
According to Juan Solana, analyst at Intermoney, Ibex 35 could successfully conclude the year with almost 16,000 points each year following the restructuring of the investment funds and the traditional grant of the pension fund by that time.
Nevertheless, the expert points out that this year things could develop a little differently; especially because of the final year rally already taking place in the second week of December, and therefore immediately after the day of the bridge to the day of the Constitution.
According to the analyst, price fluctuations would not affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, analyst at Bank Inversis, the market situation assessments are at an almost technical level, which could lead to a deviation from the index values, the extent of which depends on the consequences of the US mortgage market crisis.
The analyst trusts that these are positive.
In selecting the values to advance Ibex to new maximums, the analysts agree.
Solana of Intermoney believes that this year the great values are on the line.
Among the winners, the expert would count the two big banks and some real estate companies, as the electricity sector will be too expensive at the given time.
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha assures Bank Inversis that the increase in the banking and industrial sectors will be accompanied.
If the rally actually happens, the real estate companies will benefit from it.
The ACS has been on the pick-up course in recent months and we hope that other real estate companies, such as Ferrovial and FCC, will take the same path, according to the expert.
As regards increased consumer behaviour during Christmas days, the market situation is determined in the last half of the year.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technologies will also achieve positive revenue, even if they are only represented in a small number on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December showed only two declines.
At the end of 2003, when the technology bubble broke out, the stock market took off its crisis and initiated the last real year rally.
This year, when Ibex 35 picked up by 28.17 percentage points, December showed a 6.68% increase.
Whether 2008 will result in the fifth winning year (the Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and a final year rally will also show up.
Popular will have opened its 200 credit institutions from Monday to Friday for 12 hours a day.
Popular has decided to modernize much of its branches.
A total of 200 of them are located in the most economically active regions of Spain.
For the institute operating under the brand name Popular Max, these branches mean a large milestone.
But also for the rest of the Spanish institutions, as popular as the first group of banks, the leap is daring to extend the opening hours of its branches weekly to 20.30h and to start on Saturdays from 10h to 20.30h.
The BBVA banking group, which also repeatedly announced the extension of its opening hours in the branches, has not yet reached a definitive conclusion.
The current negotiations of the Bank with the trade unions seem to aim at an agreement, with 75% of all branches closed on Saturdays and open to it on a weekday afternoon, although not for the customer.
Whether further banks join the new initiative, which adapts to business opening times, will depend on popular bank's experience.
And that is also the intention to pursue popular with their project.
The aim is to extend the opening hours of those branches, which, due to their location, can capture the commercial clientship of independent, small and medium-sized enterprises, but also those of large department stores.
The Bank wants to open the new 200 branches over the next 18 months, as these are not new but changed opening hours.
For this purpose, the Bank will remodel the premises of those branches already located in business zones and at the same time align them to the individual customer profile of the different zones.
The expansion of opening hours is linked to a new space design of the branches, which is characterized by a more up-to-date, colorful design.
The competent bank representative Ángel Rivera assures that the restructuring did not require larger investments, but resulted in an increased staff setting, as a branch now no longer required six, but eight or nine employees.
The branches, which will even be equipped with additional premises for SMEs, will not sell financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested his concept at nine branches in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, according to Ángel Rivero.
The offices of the streets Bravo Murillo, O-Donell and Gran Vía have been selected for what seems to have been a wise decision.
Popular currently leads about 2500 branches.
And another 60, which operate under the name Mundocredit. These are specialized on immigrants and also show extended opening hours, even on Sundays and holidays.
In these branches of PopularMax, the model of BBVA is not used, as most of them will instead offer a wide range of non-financial services for sale.
We do not want to compete for our customers, explains Rivero.
With Telephonica, they have provisionally come to the agreement to sell mobile phones using external banking staff.
The Spanish private broadcaster Telecinco doubles its stock market value for the first time and thus overtakes its rival Antena 3.
We did it.
With this set, the managing director of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, announced his satisfaction at the closure of the stock market. The transmitter he had managed had increased its value by two times his rival Antena 3.
However, one aspect dampened his joy: that is exactly what hurts me; not that we had higher growth, but that we had lower losses, he found.
He stressed that despite the weak market they did not sink too deeply.
Telecinco ended yesterday the day with a plus of 2.54%.
This profit reduces its previous losses to 15,66%.
According to Bloomberg, the company's value now reaches the 4,488.88 million euros, while Mediaset controls the capital's principal share (52%), and Vocento is only involved with 13%.
The Rivale Antena 3 lost 1.52 percentage points yesterday and has recorded a total loss of 40.5% since January, so its market value is 2,193.46 million in half.
The market value of other listed communications companies, on the other hand, increases; in the case of Sogecable to 3,571 million, in the case of Prisa (editor of the magazine Cinco Días) to 2,518.53 million and in the case of Vocento to 1,779 million.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be deduced from the fact that it is two similar companies , Vasile said.
Certainly, the question remains, to what extent we can actually operate on the market, at what price and how we can make it lucrative at customer level.
Telecinco announced a week ago his project to raise the first television station with more than 1000 million gross profits from advertising revenue. This assured Guiseppe Tringali, the managing director of Telecinco and Publispaña, the group's advertising company.
If the project were to be implemented, the broadcaster would increase its advertising revenue by 3.6% compared to the 965.4 million from the previous year.
In the case of Antena 3, net turnover increased by 1.6% in the first nine stock exchange months (up to 734.4 million), while net income from the TV business could only show an increase of 0.7% (630.4 million ).
The main factor for Telecinco's comparison of better stock exchanges is that the analysts see the high payout ratio that the company could have up to now: in 2006 the company, led by Alejandro Echevarría, caused a 100 percent dividend distribution.
Vasile assures, however, that after buying 33% of the shares of Endemol, with Mediaset as a parent company, the ratio may still vary, even if it is still too early for an official announcement.
We are obliged to pay at least 50% of the shares to the official compromise, even if we have always stated much more.
I hope that we will be able to satisfy our shareholders this year, whose shares we have already been able to increase by buying 33% of the final shares.
According to analysts, the market currently has certain loss trends.
Lehmann Brothers recently reduced its profit calculation at Telecinco by 4% for this year and by 7% for 2009.
This is the result of the reduction in the expected growth rate, which will decrease from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
This has also reduced the expected profit calculation of Antena 3 by 4.5% for 2008 and 7.5% for 2009.
3 options.
1.
Ibersecurities: relies on its high efficiency return and its sustainable potential and therefore recommends the purchase of both shares.
2.
Caja Madrid: measures Telecinco (buying) as a result of the multiple incentives and the prosperous market a more advantageous position than Antena 3 (keep).
3.
JPMorgan: recommends reducing expectations in both cases in view of similar threats (satisfied market and poorer economic climate)
Congress approved the MIFID Directive, which entered into force on 1 November.
In parallel to the parliamentary preparation, which today ended its session with the Senate's congressional decision on the additional/change requests associated with the project, the government published the provisions resulting from the new law with the intention of enabling the entry into force of both regulations by the end of the year.
The representatives of the various companies unanimously praised the efforts of Congress and Senate Members, who had pursued in their negotiations and votes the goal of setting up the best possible regulation that ensures investors' safety and regulates individual entrepreneurship activities in order to ensure a generally efficient market situation.
In addition to modernising financial markets, the MIFID, which re-established the Securities Services Regulation, is pursuing an improvement in investor protection, increasing the control claim of the Spanish Securities Commission (CNMV), and promoting cooperation between the various control authorities of the European Union.
The new Directive allows both specialised firms and natural or legal persons to offer financial advice and also contributes to the establishment of new financial services companies (ESIS), the consulting companies that join the investment and mediation companies of securities.
It also expands the number of systems for the execution of financial transactions, thus adding to the regulated circulation markets the multilateral systems of the securities business and the systems for the internationalisation of trade orders, which would eventually compete with the current economic operators.
The Act requires investment companies to announce the priorities of their corporate profile, confrontation and the forms of dealing with risks on the market and to register all projects carried out to facilitate the CNMV's control task.
The Congress's Economic Commission subsequently proposed further changes, with the decision that the debt bond provided for in titles must now be considered a complex financial instrument for the investor due to its high level of risk, confirmed by the US mortgage and banking crisis. (US mortgage crisis)
In addition, the entry into force of the Directive on the legal restriction of the working areas of graduate economic scientists was used; 30 years after 1977 the Regulation, which limited the working areas reserved for economic scientists, was adopted.
The Senate, for its part, established new positions in the financial sector, such as that of the economic mediator working on a foreign invoice, which does not require authorization by CNMV and which can provide its services for the commercialisation of products and for customer gain at the same time several investment companies.
The harmonised consumer price index (ICI) increased by five tenths in November and is now 4.1%.
The indicator that Eurostat serves to assess the inflation rate within the European Union provides average price developments in Spain in November.
Its publication is in accordance with the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), which aim at a local and quality comparison of US products by providing the data.
The forecast for the indicator can be prepared early by applying the same approach as the harmonised consumer price index, but at the same time use several other statistical modelling methods to assess the information not available at the time of calculation.
However, the Spanish Statistical Office (INE) pointed out that the indicator determined prematurely should only serve as a guide and therefore not be consistent with the final result announced on 14 December.
Consumer price index (ICP) will continue to remain at a relatively high level
According to Deputy Head of Government and Minister of Economic and Financial Affairs Pedro Solbes, the increase in the VPI in November was temporary; at the same time, it assured that the price index would continue to remain at a relatively high level in the coming months.
However , Solbes found in the halls of the Congress building that even if the present number is not good , the inflation difference between Spain and the other members of the monetary union has remained more or less the same in recent years .
He also explained that there were fewer surprises in November than in the previous month, where the government did not expect such a high increase.
We expected a 4% value , announced the Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs in terms of the forecast published today .
Virgin expects Northern Rock revenue of over 42 billion euros over the next three years
The values of Northern Rock fell by more than half, after the Bank had called for an emergency loan in mid-September last year, and they now amount to only 12,000 million pounds (i.e. EUR 16,800 million).
At that time, the Bank's assets amounted to 25,000 million pounds in record terms, a sum significantly reduced within two and a half months due to the customer's loss of confidence and despite the government's 100% guarantee that the money would be secure until the end of the crisis.
The Virgin company, which would continue the group after the takeover under the brand name Virgin Money, has to bring in about a quarter of the income of the British banks, which will be composed of the facilities for the next three years, to purchase exactly those 18 billion pounds that are still needed to achieve their goal of 30 billion.
The Group of the Multimillionaire Richard Branson, known for its striking advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to have $50,000 million (compared to around EUR 70 million) flow into advertising and marketing campaigns annually in order to achieve its goal.
This week Northern Rock named the Virgin Group, in which three other companies are involved, as its preferred bidder, to lead it out of insolvency.
The mayor of Totana arrested for supposed suspicion of participation in urban corruption
The Spanish police arrested the current mayor of the village of Totano (Partido Popular) in the morning, due to the urgent suspicion of corruption in urban buildings, which was discovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretary-generals of the Municipal Council and the head of the municipal police were arrested.
Last May José Martínez Andreo took office in Juan Morales, currently a member of the Partido Popular and then Chairman of the Municipal Council of Totana, and could be the original wire drawer of the plot after information from the Cadena SER radio station.
Officials continue to search the business documents of the municipality and the Ministry of Urban Planning and do not exclude further arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, Juan Morales' lawyer was accused of the main suspect in the case of urban corruption discovered at the beginning of this week.
According to information from the Cadena SER, the lawyer was arrested by the popular , and consequently privileged MEP Juan Morales on leaving the residence of his client due to important burdensome documents to be related to the plot.
In addition, other sources of information from the alleged order payments morale are reported to a Galizian construction company, which provided for the conclusion of a urban contract in which the construction of a 200-hectare area was decided.
At present, eight people are in investigative.
Bono agrees to accept the candidate of the PSOE in Toledo and, in case of an electoral victory, in Congress.
Former Minister of Defense José Bono has accepted the offer of the Prime Minister and Secretary-General of Socialists José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, who will, as a result, introduce the list of PSOE candidates to the forthcoming general elections in Toledo and, in the event of an election victory of socialists, take over the office of Congress President.
For example, José Blanco, the organizational secretary of the PSOE, and Bono announced in the press conference after a meeting with Zapatero took place today at the headquarters of the party.
According to the Head of Government, the offer to the former minister is justified, as it is important in policy to be able to count the best and Bono is among the best.
Furthermore, in the event of a victory for the socialists in the coming elections, the politician from Mancha would appear to be the chairman of the Congress for the party.
Bono would replace Manuel Martín as Congress President, who had announced last November that he would no longer join the next general elections, end his career in public policy and instead use himself in the university field for climate protection.
The former minister had to admit that since his resignation two years ago, the President of the Government had continually pushed for his return to political action.
Moreover, he pointed out that the party, as in the appointment of the Vice-President for Economic Affairs, did not want to prevent citizens from taking over the position of President in the event of an electoral victory, and referred to this as an act of transparency.
If he should actually take over the office, he hopes to transform the Chamber into a House of Respect and not the insult or screaming, in order to make it appear more and more similar to the citizens.
Regrettably, from time to time, one gains the impression that the only place in which one cannot speak calmly and quietly in Madrid is Congress; thus, the President of the Government was interrupted once in the Senate up to 26 times.
At the same time, he praised current President Manuel Martín and his good work and indicated that he did not want to give the impression that he had already taken over the office, since his political opponents would otherwise describe this as arrogance.
Climate propaganda
Since the climate debate is subject to harsh criticism both by the skeptics of climate change and by those who are prioritising a social and political debate, the movement as a whole needs to maintain strong cohesion.
Especially when it is a leader of the movement, who, as in the case of President Zapatero, considers the fight against climate change more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even proposes to conclude a new treaty with the planet.
This proposal, however, brings him to the conclusion of the action or non-handling of his government, which has contributed decisively to Spain's being at the head of the countries within the EU, which have failed to meet the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol.
Who are the responsible for failing to meet the requirements on which sectors this is due, and why did his government, who had proposed the treaty with the planet, not stop this development?
In addition, he is now forced to present to the Spanish citizens the measures he has proposed against climate change without any confusion.
Which firms will be affected by the behaviour of the citizens, which individual and collective austerity measures must be implemented and which economic consequences will result.
More precisely, who has to sacrifice himself and pay for the rescue of the planet.
However, there is and will not be any such explanations in the future.
It's just because it's about the sacrifice and payment.
Because the measures that can really be taken against climate change are unpopular.
They are costly, uncomfortable and threatening to the firms and citizens' accounts.
Even the petrol cent proposed by the PSOE, Zapatero appeared so dangerously so dangerous that he saw himself forced to resume the proposal.
Accordingly, it is now necessary to save the planet with nothing, i.e. with pure propaganda and empty speeches without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, commissions, committees, protocols and new offices.
With its treaties with the planet, the otherwise suitable politician must not speak, complain, or demand, but instead follow the demanding issue of adorning the meetings and of inspiring others with his gentleness and kindness.
But this can only be done if the contract does not deviate from its purely virtual nature and therefore does not mean that the bicycle will in future become the only means of movement or we can only refresh ourselves with a fan.
The mayor and the police chief of Totana due to supposed involvement in urban corruption.
The Guardia Civil has arrested the mayor of the village of Totana, the popular politician José Martínez Andreo. In addition, the local police chief, the secretary of the mayor's office and a hotel contractor were arrested for the suspected suspicion of urban violations, it was now called for investigation.
The City Council was arrested at its residence, from where it was brought to the municipal office and where it is located until the present time, surrounded by numerous agents who had also arrived at the municipal administration and at the municipal construction line Suelo Industrial y Vivienda.
The three arrests are in connection with the last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, where it was revealed that more than 2 million hectares of unexplained construction ground for urban projects should be remodeled under the direction of the Galician construction company Nuaria, which should be built on the property 4000 apartments after the local administration had to provide it with illegal commissions during the last legislative period.
In addition, two other persons were not directly arrested, but were subject to an investigation procedure initiated and conducted by the First Totonas Court.
The first six arrested were presented to the judge today.
According to investigative circles, the former mayor of Totana and current independent PP deputy Juan Morales are also investigated.
Furthermore, his ex-wife, owner of a real estate company registered in Totana, as well as his current friend residing in Murcia, is under suspicion.
The president and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and entrepreneur from Vigo Manuel N.A., was arrested in the village of Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as the managing director of Suelo de Inmonuar Pablo José M.G., whose company is to have acted as a subgroup of Nuaria and received the lubrication money.
The investigations are carried out by the municipal authority against urban offences, under the supervision of the Central Unit of the Guardia Civil, whose representatives, in addition to the arrests, carried out another eleven searches, most of them in companies directly related to the arrests carried out in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
At that time, only one single person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a locally known poultry breeding industry, which should have acted as a middleman.
The Nuaria building group was commissioned to build the largest residential complex in the home of Murcia, which should include more than 5000 apartments, a golf course and two spa hotels.
The company acquired more than 2.2 million square kilometers of land in Totana, which was to be converted. The aim was to achieve a construction project, which would raise the population of the municipality to 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group includes other companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which promote the sale of real estate; Conyase, which, in Vigo, runs the parking spaces of Coruña, Venezuela and the Plaza Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, whose activity is limited to the direct marketing sector and Preconiza, specialises in the promotion, sale and installation of building elements.
Things that can happen
1.
If you agree, we will turn away from the expression book of the month and instead try to invent a price designation of other names with corresponding competences.
I already have a proposal.
People, life means change.
Of course, you are warmly invited to submit your proposals.

Our Finnish correspondent explains to us the comment published yesterday in the main Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat (Finland, by the way, is at the top of the PISA study), which refers to the comment published in the same newspaper on 18 November; by chance, on that day, his edition contained the criticism of the book Blackburns.
The content of the subject philosophy has become the subject of public debate after the tragedy around the school of Jokela.
Responsible for the cruel murders is an abiturient who quoted the works of Platons and Nietzsches in his news.
In an interview of the daily newspaper Helsingin Sanomat, the chairman of the Education Council for Philosophy, Pekka Elo, asked teachers to take a more critical position with Plato and suggested that Platon teach from the sublevel lesson plans for philosophy in Gymnasium.

A colleague informs about the inclusion of illegal Internet downloads in the Criminal Code:
A. Downloading a song would be a breach of law committed at six months of imprisonment.
However, if you take out a music business under a value of 400 euros again, this is considered simply a violation (Article 623.1).
B. If you rob the business of up to a value of 1000 euros, the theft will be classed as criminal offence, yet the penalty will be lower than in a download (Article 234 Criminal Code).
C. If you clap a car and give it back forty hours later, the penalty is still less than with a download (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a beating than in a music data exchange.
Participating in a rebellious dispute draws upon a prison sentence of three to 12 months (Article 154 of the Criminal Code), while the exchange of data results in a six-month-up to two-year-old release.
(Article 270 Criminal Code)
E. According to Article 184.2 of the Criminal Code, sexual harassment at the workplace is considered less bad than downloading a DVD movie from the Internet.
F. The trade in copyright-protected films, whose authorization by the authors has not taken place, is subject to a higher penalty than the distribution of pornographic film material to minors (Article 186).
Well, so if my colleague was right, someone would have raised his demands quite nicely.

My doctor gives me one of his long, strange research articles entitled: Money leads to activation of certain brain areas, especially when the others get more of it.
So the feelings that result from the monthly salary payment depend on the salary of colleagues.
The study was prepared using a tomographic-magnetic reference analysis at the University of Bonn, and the results were published in the last issue of Science magazine.
According to Bernd Webers, author of the study and director of the Bonn brain research center Life&Brain, activation was the strongest when the participant gave correct answers and his fellow participant failed.
The researchers were able to see that brain activity was always very moderate when both participants were right with their response and therefore received the same content; but when one of them received the double, there was also increased brain activity.
I am not quite sure whether it really requires so much scientific effort to achieve such a result.
The state lawyer from the Balkans
For eight years, Carla del Ponte has been fighting incessantly after the criminals of the Balkan Wars. Her office is located in the prosecutor's office of the criminal court of the former Yugoslavia, located in La Haya.
Their mandate will expire at the end of the year, and Carla will leave her office with a weeping and a laughing eye, as the main responsible of the Srebrenica massacre - in which eight thousand Bosnian Muslims were killed - is the ex-General Ratko Mladic and the former Serbo-Bosan leader Radovan Karadzic still on free foot.
Their names are on the list that the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach has not yet started as a template for the title of his documentary films La Liste de Carla (2006, Spain); a film that, at the pace of a political thriller, follows the Swiss state lawyer from Belgrade to New York in her project to detect the escaped criminals and pressure the respective governments to tighten their networks.
Which insurance is best for me?
Car insurance, which covers a possible damage caused by the driver, includes a high cost burden, the amount of which depends again on various factors, including age, sex, time of creation of the driver's license, family status, type of car to be insured and its use, etc.
Owning a car is just the beginning.
Because it is even more difficult to find the right car insurance than the right vehicle model.
First of all, one must be clear about what we are dealing with here.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and an insurance company.
This agreement shall be held in writing by means of an insurance contract which shall establish that the company receives the agreed insurance premium and is obliged, in return, to submit the corresponding amount of compensation in the event of a loss.
The insurance premium is the price of an insurance composed of several factors, including age, sex, time of creation of the driving licence, family status, type of vehicle or its use.
The insurance companies set their prices according to the statistics, so that higher contribution payments are also due in the event of a higher risk of accident.
For this reason, both 25-year-olds and women need to make fewer contribution payments because statistics show that these groups have a lower accident rate thanks to their caution.
The same applies to married persons, as they, according to the statistical values and therefore also according to the firm's conviction, tend to have fewer accidents than stand alone.
The benefit which is measured to the vehicle affects the frequency of driving and thus the likelihood of an accident.
The more frequent the use, the more likely the damage.
In setting up the premium, insurance companies must take a number of points into account.
For this reason, the driver must also thoroughly study the situation in order to select exactly the car insurance that most meets his personal needs.
We now list the most important points that should be considered in the selection of insurance in order to be able to make a choice not only in terms of performance but also in terms of price.
The under 25-year-olds face numerous obstacles when choosing low-cost insurance, such as low driving practice and young driving licence.
Even if it would be best for an ideal insurance scheme to complete full cash insurance, there are still cheaper alternatives.
The cautious drivers can choose a full-kasko with self-interest, so that the services of a full-kasko insurance are covered, but offered at a low price.
This type of contract involves the customer having to pay part of the amount caused by the damage himself.
The amount is determined before the conclusion of the contract and on the basis of the amount of the insurance premium, which is higher than the amount to be paid, explains Luis Noguera, Chief Representative of Spain at First Europe, an online insurance intermediary.
Another option is the extended insurance, which assures the customer of external accident damage, but not against the damage caused by the own car.
In addition, this type of insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here's a advice.
If you are under 25 years of age, it is in your hand to reduce insurance costs, so increase your credit by trying to drive carefully and avoid accidents.
A credit is a reduction in the basic rate for the corresponding insurance company.
On the contrary, a penalty payment includes an increase in the tariffs stated.
The amount of credits and fines depends on the company and its income.
If the company has a year rich in earnings, it may allow itself to increase the bonus payments, explains Noguera.
As soon as the 25-year mark is exceeded, it is easier for drivers to conclude a contract. This is due to the fact that the accident rate decreases with increasing driving practice.
Thus, it is most useful to decide on a full cash insurance with self-interest.
Usually young people cannot benefit from their previous experience, both in case of accident and at the time of driving, the Spanish leader of the European company explains, and adds that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of practice after the beginner's fears have been settled.
Nevertheless, it is more advisable for a married customer who does not have children to complete full cash insurance; of course, only if it allows the financial situation of the person concerned.
On the part of the insurers, married couples with children are considered to be the customers with the lowest accident rate, and consequently low, their contribution payments also fall.
In this case, full cash insurance with self-interest (at an amount of EUR 300) would be the best option. In the event that you have received a high credit rating, an extended insurance should be used only for the third vehicle year.
They are generally more relaxed and have a greater purchasing power that allows them to make a higher contribution payment, Luis Noguera notes.
For pensioners, full cash insurance with self-interest (at an amount of EUR 150) or extended insurance that only applies to a sufficiently high credit.
Finally, one must keep in mind that car insurance is something very important, not only because it protects the driver from possible accident damage, but also because it offers high costs that require that a thorough selection be made that corresponds to our personal situation.
The Celtic Glasgow is hoping for the eighth final point in Milan
The FC Milan and Celtic Glasgow will fight for the point they lack next Tuesday in San Siro in order to achieve their respective goals even before they finish the Championsleague pre-round. The Italians need the point to reach the top of their group, while the Italians decide on their participation in the shots.
The Italian team already has five points and has already confirmed its participation in the fifth round with a disembarkation in Portugal, while Celtic Glasgow needs nine more points to make sure that the FC Shakhtar with six points does not catch up with the Befica Lisbon with four points.
The two games of Group D will take place one week before the end of the sixth round of the game, as FC Milan will have to join the FIFA Club World Championship in Japan, where he will fight for the first time in the semi-final on the 13th for the entrance to the final, which will take place on the 16th.
So this group will be over all others and the disintegration in the Guiseppe Meazza Stadium will be the expected outcome, even if both teams will try to win. The Italians will not want to speculate at home, because the Celtic Glasgow will know that in case of a winner, they will have a better starting position in the eighth final.
The team of Gordon Strachan could even have enough defeat to qualify at a fall of FC Shakhtar. Nevertheless, he should not rely too much on such circumstances, because at nine points of equality the Ukrainians are standing to participate; they had lost in Glasgow last week (2-1), but were able to win the second game (2.0).
Therefore, the Milanese will try to avoid the evening. The again hope to reach the eight-final of the remodeled Championsleague for the second time in a row, after they have been defeated in the previous season in exactly the same round by a goal of Kaka in the post-playing period (1.0) and by a zero to zero inconsistency on the playoff.
While FC Shakhtar is waiting for the Rossoneri's victory, the team will have to focus on its own game, as both reaching the eighth final and its membership at UEFA depends on its victory and defeat of Celtic Glasgow.
Despite its lower table position and without the prospect of continuing to participate in the largest European championship, Benfica Lisbon could win third place and thus compete with UEFA.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver.
The Spice Girls gave the first tour of the band's resolution in the Canadian Vancouver in 2000 to the eyes of 20,000 spectators.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) y 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) explained just before the start of their concert at the GM Place de Vancouver stadium that the mood in the reunited band was excellent.
Around 20,000 people were able to experience the concert at the sold out stadium, where a video about the band's history, which had provided for Furore in the late nineties, was shown.
The reunification and the world tour overlap with the release of a new album, which includes their biggest hits and two more new songs, headlines and Voodoo, and which appears in Spain under the label of EMI.
The five members of the Spice Girls wore golden bracelets on stage, which the husband of Posh Spice , English footballer David Beckham, had previously given them.
The athlete was among the fan masses in the audience that made the GM Palace glow, although the nerves of his wife Victoria had forbidden it to him in the previous days.
While preparing for the show, Victoria told Beckham that the British star did not have a single face on our wardrobe, and that is why I'm very excited about what he's going to hold from the show.
Sporty Spice, whose withdrawal from the group in 1998 was followed by two years later by internal disagreements, expressed her nervousness two hours before the concert at a press meeting.
I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw that the attitude of the world public had changed that the feelings towards the Spice Girls had changed.
And that's why I thought why not; so I'm glad to have made this decision, Chisholm said about the separation of the band she had caused nine years ago.
The singer also announced that the disputes had been eliminated and that all of them now very much liked each other.
However, many things have changed since the last joint appearance of the Spice Girls in 1998.
First, the group arrived in Vancouver in a special machine of Virgin Airlines, according to the report of the TV station CTV.
Upon arriving at the airport, the band was received by an army from children's girls.
The five have seven children together.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will be the next in California, San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
In Madrid they will enter the stage on 23 December.
New fears about natural gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
A new price dispute swirls between Ukraine and Russia, increasing the risk that Russian exports will be affected by fuel to Western Europe.
Most of the Russian natural gas exports to the European Union (EU) are led by Ukraine and every dispute between the two nations is closely observed.
Kiev warned that if Moscow increases the price it has to pay for natural gas, it will charge higher transit fees from Russia.
A previous conflict between the two countries last year reduced deliveries to the EU countries.
The recent dispute between Kiev and Moscow happens at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian, state-run gas monopoly Gazprom are trying to reach agreement on how much Ukraine must pay for Russian natural gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine needs to be more calculated, since the Group has agreed to pay up to 50% additional for natural gas from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that this could mean that Ukraine has to pay 40% more for Gazprom imports.
“It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states in the course of talks,” said Ukraine’s Minister of Economic Affairs Anatoli Kinakh of Reuters news agency.
\"The changing prices of natural gas should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the amount of transit charges [to Western Europe] on Ukraine,
In the last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006, Gazprom reduced deliveries to Ukraine.
This resulted in a case of exports to Western Europe, which dramatically increased prices.
Russian gas makes up a quarter of the supply of the European Union.
Russia has the world's largest gas reserves, but much of it remains underdeveloped.
The consequence is that Gazprom complements its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations.
NHS must control foreign workers,
The Scottish State Health Service must improve the controls of the pre-punishment register for workers outside Europe, said a member of the control body.
The recommendation of Chief Financial Controller Robert Black came after a foreign doctor in Scotland was brought to Glasgow Airport in June in conjunction with the attack.
Black also expressed concerns that the Scottish State Health Service did not have any precise ideas about the number of its foreign employees.
But his report pointed out that other important controls were carried out correctly in a sample of five health authorities.
The main financial controller examined personnel recruited outside the countries of the European Economic Area as a result of the attack on Glasgow Airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a land car was driven through the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in a video broadcast in Old Bailey in October and was charged with the alleged car bomb attack in Britain.
It is expected that the State Health Service will carry out checks in advance of the appointment of foreign employees to ensure that they have the necessary qualifications, experiences and authorizations to work in the United Kingdom.
Although the health authorities use Disclosure Scotland to review criminal records, the Agency does not have the responsibility to obtain this information outside the UK.
The chief auditor's report now states that, in addition to other recommendations, the Executive Board should adopt guidelines for the criminal register extract that assist employers in controlling in different countries.
“Although we have found references to these controls in some staff documents, they have not been routinely carried out,” the report noted.
Black said that the Scottish health authorities would follow their research guidelines with a high level of employment, but added: “Our report shows areas where the system can be improved to ensure that accurate information on the number of foreign health service employees is available,
BMA Scotland Chairman Dr. Peter Terry said it was \"extremely unlikely\" that prior to the appointment of potential NHS employees, investigations would identify people who could commit future terrorist attacks.
“The report says that current pre-employment tests by the NHS Scotland are working well and it is not clear which added value the recommendations will deliver,” he said.
The Scottish health authorities say they currently have 1,161 foreign employees, the vast majority of which are doctors and nurses.
However, the financial controller warned that the number was likely to be higher, also because the board had trouble identifying those employees who were left on an indefinite period of time.
The investigation continued to note that established control procedures by NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian were largely complied with.
These include passport, work permit, and qualification checks.
the Scottish Government is currently reviewing its policies and guidelines for checks before the start of employment for foreign personnel in the NHS.
The secretary for Health Nicola Sturgeon said: \"It was a concern to me to carry out this work in the face of the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport,
She added that the Scottish government, in conjunction with the health authorities, would take into account the recommendations of the report and ensure that the best practices in updated guidelines regarding the control investigations would be reflected before all employees were appointed, including those from abroad, whose publication is planned next month.

208 arrested in Saudi Arabia for a terrorist plot
Saudi Arabia has discovered yesterday that it has arrested 208 militants because of their belonging to cells that had planned an impending attack on an oil plant as well as on clergy and security forces.
State television from the world's largest oil exporter said that one of the cells had planned to smuggle rockets.
sympathisers of Al-Qaida launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since 2003, following the invasion into Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign citizen, planned an attack on an oil plant in the eastern province, according to the TV report.
Saudi Arabia has created a 35,000 man strong rapid intervention to protect plants after a failed Al Quaida attack on the world's largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, referring to an internal declaration, says that 18 of the prisoners belonged to a cell led by a “rocket expert” who illegally immigrated to the country.
He reports that the militants had planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the Kingdom.
According to the report, another 22 of the prisoners had intended to kill the clergy and security forces.
The government has warned clergy to do more to stop Saudis striving for Iraq to join Al Qaida militias who want to fight the Allied forces and the U.S.-supported Shiite Muslim government, which is considered heretical by the Hardliners under the Sunni Saudis.
Al Qaida militias consider many clergymen in Saudi Arabia to be in cooperation with the authorities in supporting the policy of the royal family that dominates the government.
The militias - accompanied by calls from Osama bin Laden, the Al Qaida leader born in Saudi Arabia, to target the pro-Western Saudi government - have done so on foreign residential areas, government buildings and facilities of the energy sector.
“This was a very great effort by the security forces over the last... five months,” a spokesperson of the Ministry of the Interior told the state television.
The arrests also involved a \"media cell\" of 16 from Medina, which aimed to cast for the \"Takfiri thought\" - the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims, who supported violence against Muslims, who are branded as unbelievers and abstinents.
Among those arrested were also 32 people who were accused of providing financial assistance to the militias.
The climate on Venus could reveal an outlook on the future of the Earth
Venus may have once been a pleasant place to live, scientists said yesterday.
Data from a European spaceship on a orbit shows that the planet is even more similar to a distant twin on Earth than was previously known.
Venus is the nearest planetary neighbour to the Earth.
The two worlds have about the same size and have similar planetary orbits, but Venus is a little closer to the Sun.
Billions of years ago, there would have been conditions on Venus that would have been very similar to those on Earth and could even have been habitable, scientists believe today.
But because of the unrestricted carbon dioxide greenhouse effect, the erosion of the atmosphere through solar radiation and a slower rotational pace, Venus took a completely different development course.
Today the planet is robbed of water and has a surface temperature that is hot enough to melt lead and is devastated by hurricane-strong winds and lightning storms.
The findings of the Venus Express space probe of the European Space Agency, which examined the plants for a year, offer a sobering look at how the Earth could develop in the face of catastrophic climate changes.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Department of Physics at Oxford University, one of the leaders of the Venus Express Mission, said: “It becomes clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that on Earth, while the planets are otherwise quite similar,
“Our new data allows us to construct a scenario in which Venus began billions of years ago like Earth, possibly with an habitable environment,
‘Enriched uranium’ seized by the police
A kilo of radioactive material, reportedly enriched uranium, was seized yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said that three people were arrested and that the material was being tested.
He did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but said it could have been sold for $1 million (480,000 pounds).
Everything still open
Mitt Romey said he did not consider it worthy of a presidential candidate to be questioned by a snowman.
Nevertheless, the Republican candidate for the presidency finally declared itself ready for a debate on YouTube, in which ordinary voters pick up questions on video and submit them to the candidate to send them.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday evening, November 28, were as ridiculous as the snowman who asked Democrats about global warming in the YouTube debate of the other party.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected exactly the state of the Republican Party that broke up into the elections next year.
It is not known exactly how the producers of CNN, who supported the debate, chose the YouTube clips to be shown to the approaching candidates.
However, immigration was at the heart of the first half hour of the debate, the longest one devoted to a single subject.
The issue is one of the most decisive issues for Republicans.
The CNN asked a group of undisputed voters to use a dial when they heard things that pleased them: The TV station noticed tips of consent when the candidates spoke strictly across borders.
The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Romney, who moved forward in the crucial surveys in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani tried to shake the reputation of being jealous of illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney, in which he accused the former governor of Massachusetts of setting up illegal immigrants for work at his house.
The two of them stood out in particular as questioners, asking whether one of the candidates would support a \"amnesty\" (the illegals would give a regular status and the possibility of citizenship).
Imminent candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California Congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Congressman from Colorado, succeeded in addressing this issue.
None of the two men have serious chances at nominating, but both remain in the race, perhaps because they have been used earlier and harder than others to immigrate.
At least in the area of immigration, the candidates share the same views: sharper boundaries, intolerance towards illegal migrants.
This issue, together with fears about toxic toys from China or other concerns over the rest of the world, helps the Republicans to forget or minimize the differences between liberal and Christian conservatives.
But the debate was clearly problematic when other issues were raised.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he had supported arms restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drowning should be considered torture.
One of the questioners asked if the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
This led Giuliani to take the stand that although the Bible is his preferred book, he may not literally believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another questioner asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now contrary to all expectations in the first place in a recent survey in Iowa thanks to his long-standing Christian conservativism - said that the death penalty was painful, but necessary.
When he was pressed to see if Jesus would support them, he laughed about it and told Jesus that he was too intelligent to apply for a political office.
The race remains exceptionally wide open.
Huckabe's rise in Iowa coincides with Ron Paul's recent successful donations and his incidental storms in the debate of Wednesday.
These two are out of nowhere because the party's two wings have not yet been able to agree on one of the more well-known and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate joined the party from the beginning and convincingly united with a victorious message about the size of America and a twinkling to both wings of the party.
This time the party is split and the result is far from clear.
Labour Party Pain
Gordon Brown has discovered another pit to fall in; his way out of this remains the same.
For British scandals, this is not particularly clumsy.
No noble titles seem to have been sold, no politician paid Paris hotel bills, no extramarital tokens.
But the discovery that a wealthy businessman has stolen donations for the British ruling Labour Party over more than 650,000 pounds (1.3 million dollars) over four years under the name of other people, and that the party has failed to report this, is something without which the fighting Gordon Brown would have been good.
When two months ago the Prime Minister withdrew the call for an election, in a stupid way insulting the intelligence of the British by claiming that polls had not influenced this decision, there was hope that he would offer a robust, efficient government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the increasingly keen representative of the Liberal Democrats, expressed it, the once-fearing Brown of Stalin has developed into Mr. Bean.
The unskilled rescue of Northern Rock, an assaulted bank, showed regulatory weakness and poor judgment under attack.
Badly thought-out proposals to amend tax laws have imposed corporate associations against the government.
The tax-related loss of personal data of 25 million people showed unimaginable administrative stockpiles.
A trio of generals retired began an uprising in the upper house in protest against cuts in military spending: to be ministers of the armed forces, they claimed to be a part-time job.
Now there are the many donations from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labour's Secretary General (and their former director of performance) has already resigned.
None of this means that Brown breaks up irrevocably towards departure.
Nevertheless, governments can reach a turning point after which they feel impossible to govern.
People do not like or trust politicians, but they usually hold back their skepticism when a new force seizes the office.
Once it is clear that it is unlikely that a Prime Minister will improve the situation, and he does not even need to be there for a long time, this move is over: the public service is beginning to become impossible; the Cabinet ministers are starting to pee; the press is looking for bad news; and the government is becoming defensive and aimless.
In one way Brown's position is particularly difficult because, unlike other political leaders, he cannot claim to be a new broom.
If he was willing to deny Tony Blair, he was his chief lieutenant.
The problems with Northern Rock and the tax liability documents, for example, are related to decisions that Brown met as chancellor of the Ministry of Finance.
And even if it wasn't directly involved in Blair's mischievous actions - as in the long - money for noble titles - investigation of political party funding - voters may assume it was.
Yet Brown's situation is not as bad as she looks
The faults are not as terrible as the conservatives describe them.
As with Mr. Bean, no one died, or was completely swindled.
And the antidote, painful as it may be, is to deliver what Brown's natural Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, solid and easily brutal government.
The new get-together for political donations is a good example.
The garbosque of Abraham, comparing his donations with his non-profit gifts, says he does not wish public recognition for his goodwill.
That may be the case, but the decision on it did not stand him.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributors are clear and they exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who can buy access to those who govern the country.
Watt, he says he knew of Abraham's agreement, but not that it is illegal, will of course have to ask himself some questions; just as Jon Mendlesohn, Labour's main financial innkeeper, was told about the extraordinary donations in October.
But Brown is not involved: there is nothing to suggest that he knew of these confusions, although most of the payments were made after his office in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half of the work.
He quickly condemned the violation of the laws by his party, but he watered this determination by grasping according to a well-known instrument, an investigation committee on the subject - led to complete the measure, by a bishop in retirement and a judge.
In this case, the lessons to be learned are not very complicated.
If the law was broken, it's a matter for the police.
Apart from that, there are other things Mr Brown has to do about finding something to be a permanent chairman for the independent Committee on Standards in public life, which has been unoccupied for six months, and progressing with a comprehensive reform of political party funding.
This would require the Labour Hardliners to cooperate with the Conservatives and possibly give up the special financial relationship with the unions - bitter pills for a partymate like Mr Brown.
But he should be aware of some of the party facts.
The Conservatives now have a clear leadership in the polls of opinion; he has two years to regain voters; and the only way he can achieve a victory is through unscrupulous justice and solid competence.
Card shark
Is the credit crisis in America a credit card market?
If blood is in the water, it's only natural that backflows are getting excited.
Now that America's real estate market is crippling, the predators have the country's credit card market in the visor.
Analysts from Goldman Sachs expect credit card losses to reach 99 billion dollars if the risk of infection from under-funded loans spreads to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of the voltage are clearly visible.
There are increases in both the bookings and the rates of the sums, which measure the proportion of loans that are not inductable or are too late for more than 30 days.
The HSBC announced last month that it has taken a 1.4 billion dollar fee survey out of its US consumer financing, partly because of the weakness of credit card holders.
It's still too early to panic.
Losses and sums are still low.
According to the rating agency Moody, the third-quarters space rate of 3.89% was almost a full percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can partly be explained by technical factors.
A change in US private insolvency law laws in 2005 led to an abrupt case of bankruptcy applications, which in turn account for a large part of the credit card losses; the number of applications (and thus summation fees) would rise again, whether or not the general conditions for borrowers are deteriorating.
Industry also reports solid payment rates showing how much of its debt consumers pay each month
and confidence in credit card-based securities is quite strong, despite the standstill in other corners of structured financing.
Dennis Moroney of the TowerGroup, a research firm, expects that the 2007 volume of expenditure will ultimately be 25% higher than last year.
There are certainly direct channels of infection between the real estate credit crisis and the credit card market: it is more likely that consumers will incur credit card debt, now that home credit is drying out.
However, the card issuers look at the cash flow rather than capital values, so falling house prices do not necessarily trigger a change in the creditworthiness of the borrower.
You can even be of advantage to the card exhibitor.
The incentives for consumers to continue to pay mortgage rates are reduced if real estate is less value than the value of the loan; as a result, card debt is becoming more important under the repayment priorities.
Card issuers can also react much faster and more flexibly than creditors to the more stormy conditions by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of rapid re-evaluation of assets.
“We won’t wake up one day and revalue the loans completely,” says Gary Perlin, Capital One’s main financial officer.
Even if a sudden undercover crisis in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustainable downturn are much more real.
If lower domestic prices and a credit reduction push America into recession, the industry will undoubtedly face a more grim future.
Keep an eye on these shark fins.
British bankers confess themselves guilty in the case of Enron
Three British bankers who were to be brought before the court for their role in the fraudulent system with the former Chief Financial Officer of Enron, Andrew Fastow, changed their requests on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby, and Gary Mulgrew had originally pleaded for seven cases of fraud involving telecommunications for the alleged conspiring with Fastov in a secret financial fraud in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of their employer.
The procedure was initiated on January.
But during a hearing before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Junior, everyone pleaded guilty of a case of fraud involving telecommunications.
The three former managers of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, became known in the UK in the course of delivery procedures that lasted for two years.
In the United States, its case is a loose end to an investigation started after Enron's collapse in 2001.
The allegations initially filed against them in 2002 made Fastov aware that he was the target of a government investigation in connection with the Enron decline.
The charges against the bankers - called the \"NatWest Three -\" claimed that they had come to Houston in 2000 to bring a fraudulent plot with Fastov and his former top advisor Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of a partnership of Enron, controlled by Fastov, who was the architect of countless fraudulent Enron crafts that helped to pull the company into the bankruptcy wheel.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had estimated the value of its participation in the subsidiary to be zero, but the three British men knew that it actually had significant value.
A company under copper control acquired the shares of the bank in the subsidiary for $1 million.
The bankers paid copper $250,000 for a stake in this company.
According to the charge, Fastow falsely told Enron that the energy company would pay 20 million dollars to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But actually, the $20 million went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers received 7.3 million dollars, while Fastov, copper and others declined about 12.3 million dollars, according to the charge.
In January 2004, Fastov announced in two charges that he was guilty of conspiracy for his role in the Enrons Pleite.
The British Trio were arrested three months later.
Fastov is serving a 6-year prison sentence in Louisiana Federal Prison.
Copper has a penalty of three years and a month in an establishment in Texarkana.
Each of the three men was on a free foot basis on the basis of a $1 million deposit that required them to live in the United States in expectation of the trial.
Enron, once the seventh largest company in the nation, broke down in bankruptcy in December 2001, after years of bookkeeping tricks could no longer cover up the billions of debts or weakening enterprises.
The collapse destroyed thousands of jobs, more than 60 billion market value and more than two billion dollars of pension plans.
The Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were sentenced for their roles in connection with the Enron collapse last year.
Skilling has a penalty of more than 24 years.
Lay's convictions for conspiracy, fraud and other charges were canceled after he died last year because of heart disease.
Not very down in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough range to fly nonstop from Moscow to Los Angeles is at least 54 million dollars.
But that's little money for some of the rich Russians.
“It offers room for up to 18 passengers,” said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
\"But none of you ask for so many seats because it is for a private family or a corporate president,
Firer was at Gulfstreamstand last Friday at the millionaire exhibition, a four-day orgy of show-making consumption, which was held in a fabricated exhibition centre on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury providers had built up exhibition stands, hoping to make new money Russians interested in everything, from mahogany-filled yachts to diamond-coated autogrills that would be suitable for 50 cents.
Firer cautiously took a shiny orange Porsche to the visor at the next booth.
“This is a beautiful car, but it’s small money compared to us,” he said.
\"After the United States, Russia is the second largest private aircraft market,
Heated by an oil boom, the Russian capital seems so flooded with money like Dallas at its shine times.
“We went through the same phase in the 1890s, when some Americans came to vast wealth and went to Europe to see them as materialistic,” said Marshall Goldman, a scientist at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi Arabs of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians emerge as the world's most visible freelance currency issuers.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share of the gold rush.
Anderswo in Moscow, this week a conference of the luxury industry Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, has been held to exchange ideas on how to sell high-priced goods on markets like Russia.
(The conference is organised by The International Herald Tribune, which belongs to the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires who own a total of 282 billion dollars, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, 103,000 Russian millionaires belong to the second class, which together are worth 670 billion dollars, according to a study on the development of private assets in the former Soviet Union, written by economic experts from the Centre for Economic and Financial Research, an expert body here.
(The World Bank says that 15.8 percent of Russians lived under the minimum of existence in 2005.)
“There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - so we are all here - said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of David Morris, a London jeweler.
For the first time, she had attended the trade fair together with the Russian dealer of the brand Soho Jewelry Group.
\"The women are all well-trained and men are all worth a fortune,
As they travel through the halls on Sunday night in evening clothes, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26 call themselves and their clients millionaires.
“I looked at the cars and I tried to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche,” said Ms. Yumatova, who delivered the designer clothes she wore, like a red carpet veteran with Joan Rivers.
The trade fair seemed primarily aimed at the new regions, the type of brand-conscious Russian buyers who would be willing to stand in the bar for several hours to visit a suitable warehouse, which made tasteless Cadillac Escalades, Platinum pocket knife, Mövenpick Eiskrem, custom-made billiards, apartments in Dubai and Gund Teddy bears next to each other.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros ($44,57).
“The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and best,” said Mr. Gijrath, who was patriotic about a trade fair stand of the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft in front of a wall-sized imitation of a rembrandt image made of hand-painted blue mosaic stones.
\"Of course, Russians are more interested in Klimper-Klimper,
Indeed, traders here say that the Russians with old money (10 to 15 years old according to Russian standards) have already moved from large-scale logos to the kind of sober brands with limited quantities that would not be marketed at a trade show.
Nevertheless, several thousand people, whether millionaires, messengers of millionaires or simply tourists, pushed through the halls every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the general manager of King Koil Beds here, had sold two $70,000 mattress sets made of silk, cashmere and cotton, with sewn gold threads.
Also in the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, told a company that high-end cars equipped with high-end alarm systems had sold the grey orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, said that he had sold three car cooler grills for a roll-royce phantom, the same chain-arm tyres for 55,000 dollars each.
He showed a reporter a car tire developed for a Russian casino owner, with spokes he had covered with colored Swarovski crystals, making it look like a roulite ad.
The cost: $22,000 for a four-off.
“The Russian millionaire, who wants to have a wheeled road or a picture of his wife’s face from a cubic zirconium will not necessarily ride on these wheels,” said Mr. Karapetian.
“It will keep it in its 30 or 40 wagon garage,
Although many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the phrase \"Russia Millionaires\" would not at present express much exclusivity, given the increase in local real estate prices.
“If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, probably they are already millionaires, at least on the paper, if not in cash, he said.
\"There are more of them than you believe,
Those who were not millionaires could at least do as if they were rich at a booth operated by Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management company.
The company had set up four red telephone cells according to British example, which were stuffed with mountains of false million dollars.
Azad Karryev, the marketing director of the company, said his employees had printed 500,000 false banknotes for the millionaire trade fair.
Passengers stopped to throw the money piles around, mobile phone photos while they leaned back in the middle of the spare wealth, being cut by friends, or just stuck in a few million.
“See, in Moscow everyone can feel like a millionaire,” said Mr. Karryev.
Confused operation suspected in New Jersey case of death
It was the day before the harvest thanks ceremony when Ronald Livingston saw through the large glass window of the Just a Little Healthier restaurant and watched as an ambulance at the white Cape Cod stopped two doors further down at West Scott Avenue.
Soon after, there was a police car.
And then there was another one.
“Then I saw the box car of the medical body viewer coming in,” said Livingston, a restaurant supervisor, on Wednesday.
\"That was the point when I knew someone had died,
The hearings learned that the dead woman Olga Arroyo, 41, was an assistant to the director of the Newark police department.
Now the investigators try to determine whether she died because of a procedure conducted by an unauthorised cosmetic surgeon who did not identify the police, and who worked in the house on West Scott Avenue 212.
The authorities have not yet found out what caused Mrs. Arroyo's death, and are hopeful that toxicological investigations, whose results may not be available for weeks, will help to clarify a mysterious death that has sent a grief through the head of the Newark Police.
Ms. Arroyo has been an assistant to the police director Garry F. McCarthy since September 2006, and her voice was well known in the department.
“She was loyal, hard-working and stubborn,” said Mr. McCarthy about Ms. Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
“She was my Pitbull.
She protected me,
McCarthy said that Ms. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer working for the alcohol control commission, and that she left two sons, 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokesman for Union County prosecutor Theodore J. Romankow, said that investigators would try to determine whether Arroyo died as a result of unauthorised surgical treatment.
“This is one of the possibilities,” Mrs Walsh said.
‘It is an ongoing investigation’
The authorities said they arrived at the house at about 3 a.m. in the afternoon of November.
And they found Mrs. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared dead on the spot.
More than a week has passed and the authorities have communicated little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, which is listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh didn't want to say if Mrs Castro was questioned by the authorities.
The investigators try to determine if part of the house has been used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Ms. Castro's house, where a vilified rose shrub stands in the narrow front garden and a Dalmatian bells behind the house.
A blue face labeled “Ethyl Vanillin” - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfumes - sat in the parking lot next to a door that led to the lower floor.
Two mountain bikes hung from hooks on one side.
McCarthy said that when he first arrived in Newark after spending 25 years with the New York Police Department, Mrs. Arroyo was invaluable and helped him cope with the provincial and harsh political culture in his new city.
\"She said, 'You have to pay attention to this or that one'\" he said.
“She was always here when I arrived and she was always here when I went.
It was embarrassing.
Hope that the central bank will reduce interest rates will lead to the rise of world stock markets
The shares sprang up yesterday on both sides of the Atlantic, after market hopes that the central bank will try to calm the credit markets through further interest rates, reinforced by significant comments from the vice-president of the US Central Bank.
The stock markets rose in London, New York and all over Europe after Donald Kahn, number 2 of Ben Bernanke, president of the Central Bank, said that policy must react “flexibly and pragmatically” to the continuing pressure on financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm down the trifling markets, in view of signs of rising credit tensions, Kohn said that the recent turbulence had, in part, reversed some of the improvements to the market functions of the late part of September and October,
If the increased turbulence persisted, it would increase the possibility of further tightening the financial conditions for consumers and businesses, he said.
The comments were received by investors as a signal that the Central Bank is ready to enter and to stabilize the credit conditions with new capital injections into the US markets and possible further interest rates.
The statements also helped calm Wall Street, given other bad news from the U.S. economy, now that the sales of U.S. real estate reached a new record level in October.
The consequences of financial turbulence were underlined by the announcement by Bear Stearns, the Investment Bank, that it would eliminate 650 jobs, or 4 percent of its global employees, in a cost reduction measure to offset serious losses from its lost bets in the US mortgage credit sector.
It is expected that only 20 of these places in London will disappear, where the Bank employs 1,500 employees.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Index jumped 331 points, or 2.55 percent, to close at 13,289,40, while the wider S&P 500 index rose by 2.65 percent.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose by 165,5 points, or 2.7 percent, to close at 6,306,2, adding more than 39 billion pounds to the value of British standard values.
Germany's Index Dax increased by 2.6 percent and France's CAC40 increased by 2.3 percent.
The re-emergence of credit pressure on markets had previously been underlined after a significant 4.7 per cent increase in a three-month guarantee from the European Central Bank granted to European commercial banks, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the US Central Bank and the European Central Bank and to invest further capital in the money markets in London increased as the credit tensions saw the three-month Libor rates for borrowing between UK banks rising by 6.59 percent to their highest since late September, following a continuous increase since November 21.
England confronts decision on the statements of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each of which is almost as difficult as the other.
Who to beat as number 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, no less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the chairman of the election, on appeal at least under this special title, is here to help Chief Trainer Peter Moores and Captain Michael Vaughan decide on it, and because the table of High Morries, the English managing director, is gradually filled with applications for national electorates, if not even for those in part-time.
Anyone who does not always get the sixth hit position will be unhappy, but life is often unfair and sport is doubtful.
It is never easy to set exactly what allows a person to reach the top of his career branches, while someone else never comes beyond the lowest rank, sometimes out of lack of happiness rather than ability.
It is not only in Kricket, where the selection is difficult, where judgments are necessary, which are always subjective at the end.
Is it the right time for Bopara to rise?
Is it fair to Shah when he does?
The same may also be asked in another area, whether, for example, John Edwards or Tubby Banerjee, both intelligent young managers should be promoted with good grades, who know the business well.
Who can say what is the right class for a cricket player unless he is given the opportunity to swim or go down.
Of course, numbers have a great influence on decisions, but chances are.
Within a team, a cricket player has to catch the captain's eye at the right time when he can take a wicket and a beater has to get regular chances at the order if he wants to impress as a one-day cricket player.
Catching the eyes of the electors is more complicated.
There have been many who have been better in the last season than, for example, James Anderson, who will apparently play in the first test, even if Stephen Harmison himself declares himself healthy and how the wind blows into the nets.
Anderson took 32 first class wickets with 33 runs each to earn a position in this tour.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average, but both had their shine points and hoped for even more.
Whether Shah or Bopara play at Asgiriya Stadium, only one point of view can be.
The choice could be that of both men's careers, or it might make little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every test and was successful in the first, with five wickets and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, then still struggling to solidify himself, who created the breakthrough into an important test cricket player, and who, although he pointed out a double hundred against Australia in Australia, is perhaps still underestimated.
It is likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores will follow their conservative instincts and stomach feeling for Shah's greater experience of Bopara's youthful enthusiasm after a further discussion during today's network meeting at Asgiriya Stadium.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah, his funky and valuable 88 test debut innings in Bombay, 43 first class hundreds and only six of Bopara, who is seven years younger at the age of 22, and an excellent balance against turned balls.
But Shah only made ten runs in his two innings in May against West Indies in the test in Lord, his home arena as a player from Middlesex, and this, plus his immediate rejection of the electorate as Vaughan was healthy to take back his position for the next game, seems to have taken the swing out of his beat, which was still obvious in Bombay.
In contrast, the All-Konner from Essex has obviously joy in life.
He is impressed by nothing on a cricket pitch and his attitude away from it was put to the point when he had recently crossed a four-wheeled vehicle in an exhibition for England's sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was to extract his Vodafone (of course also sponsored) and call his teammate Alastair Cook, who had observed this from a distance, and to say with enthusiasm: “You saw this.
Bopara is a much better field player, he bends his middle pace with some effect here on the playing fields, which seems to fit it and beats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, the right time to choose another.
Perhaps this is the actual art of selection.
I tend to give Bopara his chance now, which does not mean that Shah may not stand well if, as the tea set from Ceylon suggests, he is the one who will play here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight Al-Quaida
The first bus charges of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, with a stream of displaced persons whose funds or visas had expired, and others who hoped that the city would return to normality.
Some had even returned to fight the rebels who had driven them out of their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was operated with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned to private transport.
“I decided to go to Syria after they had killed many doctors in Baghdad,” said Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
“I came back today because of what I’ve seen on television and what I’ve read in the newspaper, about what happened in Baghdad, and how it would be safe now, ”
They say that the Mahdi Army has stopped killing people - he said, in relation to the Shiite militias of the militant cleric Moqtada Al-Sadr, who has arranged to restore his forces at this time.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from the predominantly Sunni part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the regime of Iraq was not allowed to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called on him to tell him that a local militia, supported by the United States, helped to drive Al-Qaida out of their bastion in the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shiite tribe who had been expelled from his house in Sleikh in northern Baghdad by an attack with hand grenades after he had asked his fellow citizens to fight Al-Qaidas.
He came back to fight.
“Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they started one of the anti-Al-Qaida militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and those of my boys.
That's why I returned today, said Sabaah Alu Obidi, 62.
Many told them that they had been attracted by the increasing tranquility in the capital since the rise of the U.S. troops and the growth of local “groups of affected citizens” who were armed and defending their urban districts in cooperation with the American military.
But more were talking about being forced home through visa problems and spending money in Damascus, where over 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old three-year-old father, expressed the general suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite Prime Minister, had asked the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on refugees in order to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people have probably escaped the sectarian death squadrons in the country.
\"We went well to al-Maliki's visit to Syria and the government forced the Iraqis no longer to give visas to force them to return to Iraq,\" said the Sunni pensioner.
“I can’t trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house after I left”
Part of the reason for the decline in violence is that Sunnis were displaced from Shiite residential areas and vice versa, leading to the creation of many places where tensions have faded.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will rekindle sectarian tensions and conflict.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest federal country is leading in vocational training and even shines with the international orientation of its universities.
Only in one field of education, the Saarlands are pushing the same deficit as the rest of the country.
“I declared yesterday for the 50th time to a non-Saarland that we are not French - this slogan places the smallest federal country self-censorship on its 50th birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the education system of the Saarland, which is in place of five in the educational monitor of the Institute of the German Economy of Cologne (IW).
In this way, universities already cooperate closely with neighbouring countries from a tradition.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To date, students can complete their studies here with a double or even triple degree.
As a result, the share of foreign students is 15.6 percent.
But also the country children bring the Saarland in an above average number to the universities - many of them without a degree in high school.
“In Saarland, the vocational education system is used,” says Axel Plünnecke, IW’s educational expert.
More than every fifth youth acquires his degree in a vocational school, so Saarland is more than seven percentage points above the federal average.
The combination possibilities of vocational and academic training are also greatly expanded.
Appropriate to the population, the equipment with dual courses is the second best in Germany.
Despite the practical training and increasing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by a third in recent years.
That is why the Saarland Ministry of Education has now committed the universities to a marketing campaign for engineering subjects.
“After the first Pisa study, we launched several reforms in general schools,” says a spokesperson of the Ministry of Education.
This is how the government carried out comparison tests nationwide.
In order for the children to start learning earlier, the last kita year is free of charge - a model that now also copies other federal countries.
Whether or not students' performance improves sustainably will only show future comparison studies.
In Pisa 2003, the proportion of risk students decreased from 29 to 20 percent.
In total, though, Saarland did not grow as strongly as other federal states.
The Bayern count better.
And to the detriment of the Saarland countries, foreign language skills are not measured at Pisa - in this area one could otherwise score.
For the language of the neighbours is compulsory to Gymnasian - even if the Saarlands are not French.
Chávez sets the clocks
In Venezuela the watches will tick differently from the rest of the world soon.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chávez had the timepieces in the South American country turned back by half an hour.
In Spain, Chávez becomes a joke figure.
According to a new law, according to the Venezuela Official Journal, the clocks will be set for the world time minus four and a half hours.
This gives the South American state a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
The U.S. enemy Chávez justified his decision, among other things, by the fact that the United States of the world had imposed the division into time zones for full hours.
In addition, on Wednesday (local time) Chávez announced the termination of relations with the neighboring country of Colombia because of a hostage affair.
The left nationalist said that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe remained President of Colombia, he would not maintain relations with the head of state or with the Colombian government.
“I can’t do this alone because of my dignity,” said Chávez, who is pursuing a constitutional reform on which the citizens of the oil country have to vote in a referendum on Sunday.
With the reform, he would clearly expand his power in the country.
The outcome of the dispute was the decision by Uribes to withdraw Chávez from the mandate to negotiate with Marxist rebels in Colombia, in which it was about the release of hostages.
Uribe had criticized Venezuela with his decision to “spook in his face” on Sunday.
Chávez is also in the mouth of Spain.
A new cell phone bellton in the country provides for Furore: \"Por qué no te callas\" (Why don't you keep your mouth) is the set that has already downloaded more than half a million people from the Internet.
He was spoken to by Spain's King Juan Carlos, who was upset at the recent Ibero-American summit by the constant calls of the left-wing populist, who was driving him over the mouth.
German threatens 2007 wage minus
Despite the strong economic situation, German workers are facing a real loss this year.
Experts called a whole set of reasons for their pessimistic prediction.
According to a calculation by the Hans Böckler Foundation, employees in 2007 could actually count on the pay account less than in the previous year.
“Should this be the modest wage development, the increase in VAT and the price gap in food and energy,” said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research of the Image newspaper.
New burdens could also be imposed on workers in the case of unemployment insurance.
Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück said the \"New Osnabrücker Zeitung\" the planned reduction of unemployment insurance to 3.3 percent on the annual change is correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, if the Federal Agency for Labour should not come back into embarrassment to have to ask for loans or grants from the federal government, the SPD politician was cited.
On Tuesday it was announced that the price explosion in food and petroleum products has driven the inflation rate to the highest level for 13 years.
Overall prices rose by 3.0 percent in the year.
Venus is the wooden twin of the Earth
Despite its hostile atmosphere of life on Earth, Venus is more similar to that previously thought: The European space probe “Venus Express” has discovered lightnings in the atmosphere and windworms at the Poles, as they occur on Earth in winter.
For almost three decades, scientists have suspected it flashes on Venus.
Now, the European probe, Venus Express, has provided evidence of electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere: the flashes on Venus shoot at an altitude of about 56 kilometers from cloud to cloud, reports Christopher Russel from the University of California in Los Angeles in the science magazine Nature
According to the famous \"Ursuppen theory\", lightnings have created life on earth: thunderstorms are supposed to have stimulated reactions in the ocean that lead to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: “If there ever was life there, it must have been in the very early history,” says Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, there is hardly any living thing on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, it sometimes prevails under temperatures of 500 degrees.
“ Venus may be Earth’s devilish longing, but it is a twin,” Russel said.
Why Venus, so similar to Earth in mass and size, has struck such a completely different development, is the fundamental question of the Esa mission.
The launch of \"Venus Express\" in November 2005 was a milestone for Venus research, since since the beginning of the 1990s there was no probe on its own to explore this planet.
According to the researchers, the latest research results, now presented in several articles of nature, do not only underline the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
\"They also show that the similarities of our neighboring planet with the Earth are greater than initially assumed - the Esa tells us.
In addition to the already known whirlwind at the North Pole, the researchers also found a cloud strudel on the South Pole, which turns much faster.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of air currents on the Earth's winter hemisphere, writes a research team about Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Istituto di Astrophisica Spaziale e Physics Cosmica.
The second innermost planet in the Solar System has almost the same mass as the Earth and is almost the same with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers.
The planet, also known as the morning or evening star, orbits around the sun in almost 225 days.
But he turns much slower around himself: a Venus Day lasts 243 Earth days.
Although Venus with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar hardly remembers the Earth, scientists assume that both planets were created under very similar conditions.
On both of them, water that remained on Earth in oceans accumulated, but Venus was lost in space.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed on Earth in carbonate rocks, it makes up most of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler demands an end to the party dispute for the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellor's Office.
Indirectly, he criticized the SPD for their attacks on the chancellor after the September meeting.
Federal President Horst Köhler takes care of Germany's reputation and has asked the great coalition to end the dispute for the reception of the Dalai Lama.
“We shouldn’t present a divided nation to the outside world on this issue,” said Köhler to the Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler signaled understanding of the reception of the Dalai Lama by Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
“Human rights have universal validity for me, even if I respect the diversity of cultures,” said Köhler.
Everyone knew that Germany had to maintain sensitive balances in foreign policy, the Federal President emphasised, but Merkel took protection from the accusation, and they pursued a new China policy.
“The Federal Chancellor has not distanced himself from traditional one-China politics.
China also knows that, said Köhler.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had indirectly shown a lack of courage over the reception of the Dalai Lama and had therefore been attacked from the ranks of the Union.
Steinmeier, among other things, had complained of the Union's \"windowing policy\" in foreign policy.
After receiving the Dalai Lamas in the chancellor's office, there was violent irritation in the German-Chinese relationship.
For example, the Chinese leadership not only invited the German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but also frozen the so-called Strategic Dialogue of the Foreign Ministries of both countries, according to the information provided by the SPIEGEL.
China's Head of Government Wen Jiabao has now asked Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit the reception of the Dalai Lamas as a mistake.
China refused when European politicians officially received the Tibetan religious leader, Wen Jiabao confirmed the Chinese position.
The deeds and words of the Dalai Lamas showed that he was trying to split Tibet and the other Tibetan region, which also includes other provinces today, from China.
Schäuble warns against Krawallen as in France
Street battles with the police, shots, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against Krawallen as in France.
All that had to be done to prevent social dissatisfaction in Germany from discharging itself in violence on the street was demanded by the Federal Minister for the Interior.
Barricades burned, Randalierer shot at the police with squirts: After the heavy youth crawls in France, Federal Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
“We must be careful not to build up our social explosives and discharge them into violence.
We have to take this seriously - he said the \"New Press\" published in Hanover.
Not every young person is faced with the rapid change in social reality.
Bund, countries and municipalities were already working hard to tackle problems, Schäuble said.
This is not just the integration of migrants.
\"From integration to Islam Conference, the first success has already been demonstrated,
However, it was too early for a warning.
Schäuble also pointed out that urban and sociological problems did not exist in German suburbs as in France.
In northern suburbs of Paris, young people had delivered heavy street battles with the police last night.
Cars and public buildings were also burned in Toulouse.
In spite of the government's efforts to integrate the federal government, the Chairman of the Turkish Community in Germany, Kenan Kolat, called for greater integration.
In the face of the Krawalle in France, Kolat warned against \"follow-up effects\"
The situation in Germany was not as brilliant as in France.
But there is still a need for action.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate in young people with a migration background was below 25 years, above average.
More training places need to be provided in particular.
Kolat stressed: \"We need to give young people a perspective,
However, the chairman of the Turkish community added that in Germany, more than in France, there is \"a social control in the families\"
Many young people with migration background also did not want to destroy what their parents have built up here.
Kolat said: “But still we have to be careful,
Young people should be given the opportunity to participate in work and training quickly,
Meanwhile, it remained mostly quiet at night in the suburb of Villiers-le-Bel in Paris.
Hundreds of police teams were in action, a helicopter flew over the area with headlights.
The competent authorities reported three arrests as well as a few burning waste buckets and cars.
Since the day before, a bid of about 1000 security forces has been made for peace.
For as long as it was necessary, the police will be able to stop Minister of the Interior Michelle Alliot-Marie after a visit to the suburbs.
During the night on Tuesday about 80 police officers had been injured at Krawallen in Villiers-le-Bel.
In the aftermath, the riots attacked Toulouse.
The Krawalle was inflamed by a traffic accident in which two young people were killed on Sunday.
According to first findings of the prosecutor's office, the police are not responsible for the death of young people.
In the kingdom of Angela Wolke
The firm's more realistic appearance documents that the coalition is in the end - and that nothing can be expected of it itself.
In which country does this Federal Chancellor live?
After their uncompromising appearance in the general debate of the Bundestag, which was wretched and poor, it is necessary to say: not here - not in the country which had to be ruled by her at last.
The allegation that they focus too much on foreign policy has been rejected by Angela Merkel with an arduous sentence.
It was provincial, she said, and it only showed that she didn't want to understand what it was about the critics.
In the Bundestag, she has documented for all, how much their allegations apply.
There was neither concrete interest nor even a feeling for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Wolke presented herself: a deprecated politician who flees to foreign policy and remains in jeopardy even there.
Example of climate protection: It praises the decisions made by Heiligendamm, but does not say how to achieve the climate objectives in this country.
Incidentally, the self-belief - so much immodestness the CDU Chefin would have failed two years ago.
Now she clings to the floss that the upswing is coming to the people.
This will damage her image as a pragmatist who solves problems rather than beautiful the world.
But in Angela Wolke's realm, domestic problems are a marginal appearance.
Child poverty and the worries of low-skilled people?
She has a few extra sets left for it.
It is significant how often she promises to do so when it comes to child care.
There are three approaches Merkel needs to put out a half-way straight set.
She stutters like on a foreign ground when it becomes concrete.
Department of Attacks
In the YouTube debate of the Republican presidential candidates, the two favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney provide a hard hit exchange - and now have to fear an outsider candidate.
The pressure of the candidates is already being released on the first theme.
He has made New York a refuge for illegal immigrants, and Mitt Romney accuses his counterpart Rudy Giuliani.
On his part, he counters with heavy accusations: “I would say his own house was a harbor for Illegale,” Giuliani dismisses and accuses the former governor of Massachusetts of having employed private immigrants without papers.
The candidates blow to attack: Because the Republican base still has no clear favorites, the eight presidential leaders use the debate on CNN in particular to discredit their opponents.
The self-throated 30-second videos that Internet users have submitted via YouTube are hardly more than keywords.
\"With this kind of isolationism, we have let Hitler come to power - John McCain accuses his counterpart, Ron Paul, who calls for an immediate withdrawal from Iraq as the only one in the round.
Also Romney gets strong reading from the Vietnam veterans when he refuses to condemn the so-called \"waterboarding\" method of interrogation in which drowning is simulated as torture.
However, that the key issues of the campaign lie beyond Iraq's war and torture debates are shown by the reactions of the Saalpublikum in St. Petersburg, Florida.
When conservative values are always praised and future tax increases are rejected, by chance in the auditorium.
Once again, the weaknesses of the two favorites are evident.
“I was wrong at the time,” says Romney, groaning and deploring at the base and television audiences that he was still a member of the abortion advocates in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, comes to the bulwark when, in his view, he is asked about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns for the first time in civil
One day after his resignation as Chief of Army, the Pakistani power-holder Musharraf was defended as president.
This ended eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf was finished for another five years on Thursday.
Pakistan's television broadcast surpassed the ceremony in the presidential palace of the capital Islamabad live.
Musharraf vowed to respect the Constitution and act for the benefit of the nation.
On Wednesday, he had handed over his office as army chief to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani, thus preventing international pressure especially from the United States.
Eight years after his takeover of power in an unbloody military coup, the former general now ruled for the first time as civil head of state.
With his resignation as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had fulfilled a core challenge of opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is an end to the exceptional state that Musharraf had imposed on 3 November.
Soon after his defense, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, Musharraf will lift the state of exception and thus fulfill another demand of the West.
The supreme court of the country, which Musharraf had held with him after the suspension of the exceptional state at the beginning of November, rejected all objections to the controversial reelection of the head of state on 6 October last week.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed and four others injured in an attack on a military convoy in the northern tribal region of North Waziristan.
According to an army spokesman, the bomb exploded on a road near the border with Afghanistan.
The fathers of the herb rock return
Germany's supergroup of the Siebziger musizes again: The three band members of Harmonia once again performed their consoles at a concert in Berlin.
To the revival, a co-section from their great time — Live 1974 — appears
They were much more famous abroad as early as then.
The promised sensation then takes place in the form of three set gentlemen on the evening table.
Everyone has his box in front of them, his cables and, above all, his buttons.
Dieter Moebius thrones in the flower-white shirt at 63 years in the middle.
Left flanked by Michael Rother, 57 years old and owned by laptop and guitar.
On the right, from the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, is concentrated on the console.
Everyone contributes noises, sometimes even a beat.
And sometimes it accidentally adds to a traditional piece of music.
This does not seem to disturb the Lords themselves too much.
The music of the Harmonia band has provided some excitement among the herb-rock lovers.
What is allowed to be revealed here: Targeted requests revealed that the name was wandering through collective pop memory, but not so sustainable as to miss this band painfully for 32 years.
But why should the German not also celebrate his living legends from the seventies?
Especially what is called misleading herb rock was always more valid in England and America than in one's own country.
When the music industry awarded the echo award for life's work to the survivors of the Cologne Group Can 2003, it was seen in the hall in asking German pop faces.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the Laudatio, the surprise did not know any limits.
At concerts Michael Rother later chuckled at the Red Hot Chili Peppers on stage like an old buddy.
The problem of ignorance at home and the explanation in the foreigner is one thing.
The memory is therefore overburdened with harmonica because the Trio existed for only two years and at this time also a much lower power of action developed than was later assigned to them by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
First played in the basement under the Berliner Schaubühne.
Afterwards in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons for a record label maintained by the church.
Rother had recently helped with power plant and subsequently became a guitarist at New!, the perhaps most radical German group in the world.
In 1973, however, Rother followed the cluster musician in exile to Forest in Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a 16th-century ruins, they lived as urban refugees.
Less ideological than in Commune I, where Roedelius was allowed to plague himself as a child girl.
Previously in a pictorial artistry.
In fact, there was also a whim of the Harmonia Ottenstein singing club and a name for the art.
Some hold harmonica of it.
The first album was called \"Music of Harmonia\" and the following \"De Luxe\"
For so let alone and modestly the music also sounded, the band suffered material distress.
The gathering of rice did not serve alone in self-finding.
The CD, Live 1974, now published, was included in a concert in Griessem, in front of a rather 50-person record scene, as someone believes to be disillusioned.
From Rother came the desire at that time to force and occasionally practice harmony.
For Roedelius and Moebius an immoral demand.
The band declared their separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the Esoterian-Spheric and secured his existence with albums such as \"Flame Hearts\"
Cluster was revived in the eighties and has been more successful since then when it was Harmonia ever.
The Griessemer live album is due to Herbert Grönemeyer.
The aim of this record company, Greenland, has been to maintain the Krautrock as an honest German contribution to live music.
New! has already been excavated like Roedelius Solowerk.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place in the Berlin House of World Cultures.
Publicly subsidized, within the framework of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is there, the British, Old Punk and author of the handbook \"Krautrock Sampler\"
There's also the love parade inventor Dr. Motte.
What would have bypassed the entire range of influences of the herb rock to the subsequent pop music.
Harmonia fills the empty spot of the supergroup.
Brian Eno's set is floating with the most distinct sounds in the hall: \"The only true music, you belong to the future,
There are pictures showing the producers with harmonica in the farmhouse.
Legend is used for projections of further black and white photographs of wired equipment.
Before that, the three veterans are again involved in the improvisation.
No longer by sticking microphones to the organ and to the drums to unlock the instruments via self-managed effects devices of unheard of tones.
Today electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three Technically Deepened Tuftlers.
The choir of the house does not change that either.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, sound clouds are housed and locked and sung in a beautiful place with emphased “Aaaaaaaaah”.
Krautrock has always been a very English term.
It's never been Rock.
The roots were found less in blues than in music schools (can), technologies (power works) or in flight from artistic and social conventions (clusters).
Whoever calls here \"'68\" is not wrong, and Harmonia cannot get away from it now.
The most obvious thing is thoroughly thought out on stage.
Where does music start and when does it stop?
This can cause a great deal of luck to one's nerves or a fleeting moment.
Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough
Two films again deal with the Balkan War with \"The Hunting Party\" and \"Motheran Peace\".
But both don't convince.
Either the concepts put too much on action and balls or they are too touchy.
Richard Gere is also unable to help in the Hunting Party.
The good news first: Although the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic still hide themselves in the mountains of the Balkans, but calculated there, in the dark hinterland of the Bosnian war, the actor Richard Gere has now been found.
We had lost sight of the most beautiful man of the eighties, because too many nice and uninteresting roles in women's well-being films and too many press conferences on Buddhism drive out a desire to watch.
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument, \"The Hunting Party - When the hunter becomes a hunter\" (Why do movie titles have to be so long and we're like lokführer's tariff agreements today?) perhaps.
He provides a wonderfully eye-catching portrayal: Basically, his war reporter Simon Hunt is what could have been of great pleasure if the fate and the film industry were not so gracious: a man who has long been behind his very best times, but who has preserved himself as a ruinous monument of his decline still considerable remains of the former charm.
But despite this trump-up, \"The Hunting Party, together with the German production \"Morderal Peace\", is continuing this week, only the endless series of failed Balkan war films.
The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who saves a Serbin from cosovarian hedgehogs, on which one of them falls in love with one of them promptly.
Although it is welcome that once the Serbs are not represented as the sole root of all evils, the far-sighted film loses too fast in baller and action.
It remains a kind of \"alarm for Cobra 11\" without a highway but with war for it.
On the other hand, \"The Hunting Party\" can be explored in an exemplary way, why there has never been a really good Balkan war film.
The history of three U.S. war reporters, who are opening up to detect the Serbian war criminal \"the fox\", might have become a new \"Apocalypse Now\" with another director and other screenwriter (both in staff union Richard Shepard) at another time.
Because the stories are similar: both times small teams go into the forest to do something that the military can't do, and both times it'll be a trip to madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of the “The Hunting Party” is that Simon Hunt is not simply being the downtrodden cynic at heart when he is introduced to us at the beginning.
No, the script has to make him a romantic affair with a later murdered Muslim Bosnian.
Finally, \"The Hunting Party\" goes down the Bach if the reporters succeed in the past five minutes in the time-lapse process what Nato, CIA and all the world's head money hunters have not achieved in five years: catch the war criminals and leave the Muslim Bosnians for just revenge.
This is so bad that the International Court of Justice in The Hague wants to call for crimes against kinologics.
The film has a profound human concern.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still running around freely, and he suspects the Americans and the French (they should agree to this with the exception) not to pursue the persecution too intensively due to secret political agreements.
But the good means and evil are sometimes so similar that a famous Brecht poem comes to mind.
It says about the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet’s work table: “I feel the swollen foreheads, an indication that it’s hard to be evil,
Films such as \"The Hunting Party\" have exactly such threshold heads, but they show how strenuous it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of the Balkan war film.
Recently, this newspaper reported that all Iraq films were Hollywood's big flops.
You can add: There has never been a good South Africa film.
Almost always: If a star drives around the world’s crisis herds or minefields, something like \"Rangoon\" with Patricia Arquette, \"Jensides of All Borders\" with Angelina Jolie or \"Blood Diamonds\" comes out with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Perhaps all the conflicts are simply too close in time.
At least decades had to pass before Hollywood could make a good film about the Holocaust with \"Schindler's List\".
Some films will probably still mature - the Vietnam works that are now considered classics - The Deer Hunter, \"Apocalypse Now\", or \"Full Metal Jackett\" have not been celebrated as masterpieces in any way since then.
But perhaps today we know where every mass murder comes home in real time on two screens, even too much about the conflicts of the world.
And that robs the screenwriters of the carelessness it takes to tell good stories.
“His or not being, or “The Great Dictator,” has finally become so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how bad the Nazi regime really existed.
Maybe you don't want to be good if you want to make good movies.
Perhaps you have to have the sarcastically distant artist's view of the Romanist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about parallels between his historical novel \"Lemprière's Dictionary\" and the Balkan War, he replied: \"It's just because some things never change.
Large cities will always be terribly dangerous, people will always be murdered in a cruel manner, and war will always prevail in Yugoslavia,
By Beust Receives Criticism of Olympia-Absage
The resignation of the mayor from the application of Hamburg for Summer Olympics has met with strong criticism in politics and the economy.
Many want to continue fighting for the games on the water.
But Beust encourages realism in assessing the chances.
The head of the Chamber of Commerce of Hamburg, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, described a rejection on Wednesday as \"not good for the economic location\"
No other project has recently developed as great motivational forces in the city as the Olympian idea.
‘Without this objective, the sport policy swing would not be able to be maintained to the same extent,
Schmidt-Trenz urged the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new long-term approach to this, which is based on a changed time beam.
Mayor Ole von Beust stayed on Wednesday with earlier statements, according to which Hamburg's Olympic ambitions were unrealistic at least until 2028.
“Not Hamburg decides on an Olympic competition, but the German Olympic Sports Federation - said by Beust WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sportbund to apply for the 2018 Winter Games, expected for the beginning of December.
\"This preference means that we will not have realistic opportunities in the period up to 2028 that we have considered so far,
Nevertheless, the dream was not dreamed for all time, said by Beust.
The Hamburg Sportbund (HSB) regretted the statements of Beusts.
This gives the impression that Hamburg no longer wants to apply for Olympic games in the next 25 years.
\"It's too early to build up a chance by burying the plans already at that time, said HSB President Günter Ploß on Wednesday.
The application was also rejected in opposition to the Senate Chief's statement at a reception at the General Deutsche Hochschulesportverband.
There, Beust described the application of Hamburg for the Universiade 2015 “not as a substitute” for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The University Sports Association had only nominated Hamburg as the candidate city last week.
The SPD Citizenship Group told the Senate not to have used valuable time for housing in Hamburg.
“The development of the Little Grasbrook has been delayed by the Senate for many years, because it has set out on the Olympic map and the construction of the apartment,” said the SPD members Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD for the Kleiner Grasbrook has always required integrated planning for Olympia and later use of housing, the CDU has set one side on the \"Event Factor\".
The application for the 2012 Summer Olympics had triggered a great enthusiasm in Hamburg at the time.
Hamburg, however, had failed in Leipzig.
These are not Warhol's boxes
Those who link the terms Sweden and wood box think about Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
In Sweden, wooden boxes are currently throwing dark shadows on Warhol's work directory.
A majority of the ninety-four glasses boxes listed there are counterfeits of the type Stockholm.
After several months of doubt about the authenticity of Andy Warhol's brillo boxes of 1968, internal research in the Moderna Museet in Stockholm is now leading to a sobering result: The six “Brillo Boxes, which the former museum director Pontus Hultén has given to the Moderna Museet in 1995, are copies - and probably also the majority of the around one hundred other brillo boxes of the “Type Stockholm” that are in circulation on the international art market.
The history is fabricated, a confusing chain of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol created his first \"Brillo Boxes\" painted wooden boxes based on the red-blue and white design of the cardboard cartons of soap powder \"Brillo\".
An exhibition of his works at the Moderna Museet in 1968 - with Warhol's consent - produced hundreds of brillo boxes made of cardboard: these were (for cost reasons) not produced by Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo cardboard factory.
It was not about works of art, but about their examples, about mere pieces of exhibition.
At the same time, Warhol granted permission in 1968 to produce a few brillo wooden boxes in Sweden, although they were not exhibited in the Moderna Museet.
Contemporary witnesses now speak of about fifteen boxes, which at that time, as authorized original Andy-Warhol-Brillo-Boxes with the name \"Type Stockholm\" have rightly entered the history of art and auction.
Some of them have earned more than $100,000 in auctions.
The problem now is that later the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén falsely claimed that there were about a hundred wooden boxes produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol then left to him.
In fact, Hultén's 105 boxes were produced only in 1990 in Malmö for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At that time, Warhol had been dead for three years.
In addition to the six museum-owned Brillo Boxes, Lars Byström, chief conservator at the Moderna Museet, also examined three Swedish private owners, two of whom were manufactured in Stockholm in 1968: their press panel plates were grounded and smothered, and then white oil paint was applied with a brush.
The structure of the 1990 copies, on the other hand, tells us that the colour was applied directly to the press panel with a painting roll without a foundation - and it is not oil, but acrylic color.
\"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo Boxes, the director of the Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve, says: \"If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come to a different conclusion, the Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in its collection as copy/exhibition material \"
As early as July, the Authentication Board announced that it would follow the “severe accusations” raised in the matter of soap powder boxes.
But since then, they have been covered in irresistible silence.
Rebellious soldiers in Manila give up
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers have given up, who had taken refuge in a hotel in Manila and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He could not answer a bloodshed, said the leader Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of corruption and electoral fraud, reporters at the hotel.
Governmentally loyal soldiers had previously stormed the hotel under tear gas use.
The approximately two dozen soldiers had been in the building for hours.

He used the trial to suddenly end up with about 30 sympathisers.
The military police, who were supposed to actually guard him, apparently passed over to him and joined his mutiny.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and called for the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal government troops locked up the district around the hotel.
The President called for an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
National Security Consultant Norberto Gonzales condemned the action of the soldiers.
“People have enough,” Trillanes said.
“We call on people to join us “
General Danilo Lim, who had previously ordered the elite unit of Scout Rangers, said that other army units wanted to join the march in a short time.
Government critics had called for major demonstrations against the President for Friday.
Her government has been overestimated for months by corruption accusations.
Manila's financial district was the main exhibition of attempted muttering by about 200 military personnel against Arroyo in 2003.
The rebellion failed after almost 24 hours in the refusal of the army to join.
Since 1986 there have been at least seven coups against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
