Gutach: Even more safety for pedestrians
They are not 100 metres apart: On Tuesday the new B 33 foot walker at the village parking lot has been put into operation in Gutach - in sight of the older town hall.
Two plants so close to each other: intention or sign language?
This question was clearly answered yesterday by Gutach's mayor.
\"The town hall amp was installed at the time because it secures the school path - explained Eckert yesterday.
The Kluser Ampel secured both cyclists and bus passengers and the mountain dwellers.
The plant officially installed yesterday was important for the Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße cross section.
We have the museum, two churches, spa park, bus stop, a doctor and a bank as well as the flow of traffic from the residential area \"Grub\".
\"In the case of the high traffic and pedestrian rise, there had to be a further traffic light to their safety - Eckert said.
This also confirms Peter Arnold of the Landratamt Offenburg.
“According to current measurements on the B 33, about 12,000 vehicles drive through the municipality of Gutach every day, of which about 10 percent are heavy-duty traffic, Arnold emphasizes.
Therefore, the construction of a further traffic jam is more than necessary: “Security is just happening here,” Arnold said.
A total of four views had been carried out, and also a circular traffic was considered, but due to the narrow re-cast in the Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße crossing area.
According to Arnold, during the choice of the traffic lights, everything was previously tested: “In the middle of an extra transporter loaded for us with particularly long wooden poles, we have ruled out whether these vehicles can drive out of Sulzbachweg to the B 33 without reversing the traffic lights,” he said.
The around 15,000 Euros of expensive traffic lights itself is the \"modernest thing there are currently on the market\" explained Arnold.
The system is equipped with colored LEDs that shine so powerfully that the lights can be easily detected by car drivers, for example, even when the sun is deep down.
And she's sparingly too: the older light plants consume about 100 watts, the new just eight watts.
There are three lighting systems per direction.
Arnold explained the technology of the new system: it is equipped with two radar sensors.
If the pedestrian pushes the traffic button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic position.
If the road is free, immediately green comes for the pedestrian, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase can be completed for the pedestrian.
“Should a group or disabled people go over the road, the green phase will be extended, so everyone will surely get over the highway,” explained Arnold.
Of course, the driver had to think of this as a partner and watch the highway.
This was not the case yesterday: hardly showed the traffic lights for pedestrians green, a high-class vehicle pulled through - in bright red.
For more than 30 years Josef Winkler has been writing about the soul's needs for his childhood and youth.
The catastrophes of his Catholic village childhood - the speechlessness, the slope to crude violence and mute sexuality, the narrowness and joylessness - have often been described by the Carinthian poet.
The Büchner award winner is known mainly as prose author, theatre texts are rare in his work.
Collage from prosetexts Gerhard Fresacher puts together a collage of prosetexts for his performance \"Weather lights on the tip of the tongue\" which can now be seen in Garage X at Petersplatz.
For example, the theatre maker combines elements from the autobiographical novel \"The body's own\" (1987) with prosaminiatures from \"Leichnam, his family belaurend- (2003).
On the largely empty stage - important requisite: a grotesque sofa, on which is copied and masturbated, hangs the eight-headed ensemble through the text material.
Director Fresacher seems to have little confidence in the text.
The 70-minute performance surpasses the template with a wealth of line incidents, known from the repertoire of post-dramatic game forms.
Above all, the actresses come to the stage during the sometimes somewhat questionable scenic implementations.
They are hard-boiled, submerged with the head, tucked to the wall with their evening robes.
Forced into cellophanes or bodices, they strike at dangerously high poles through the staging, either monologize them loudly or lie completely muted on the stage floor.
However, the text hardly conveys itself in this demanding manner.
The best moments have the evening when singing - the bandwidth ranges from Deep Purple to popular song.
Only towards the end does the exhilarated performance come to rest somewhat, and Winkler's afterthoughtly absurd humor flashes up.
A blackbox in the car?
U.S. road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the decaying highway system, and believe they have found the solution in a small black box that can be found on each car's dashboard.
The devices that record every kilometre and report the information to the authorities are central to a controversial attempt by Washington and the planning offices of the states to revise the outdated system for financing U.S. roads.
The normally rather boring area of road planning has suddenly sparked an intense debate with colorful alliances.
Libertarians have allied themselves with environmental groups and express their opinion that the government can use the small boxes to record the miles traveled, and possibly where they have been driven, and then use the information for the calculation of tax decisions.
The Tea Party is devastated.
The US Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns.
But while it is not possible to agree on an action in Congress, several states are no longer waiting.
They are currently examining how they can switch over the next ten years to a system where drivers pay per mile driven.
Thousands of car drivers have already tested the drivers, some of whom are equipped with GPS monitoring.
This is really a must for our country.
“It’s nothing we’re only going to use,” said Hasan Ikhrata, Managing Director of Southern California Assn. of Governments, who plans to record the driven miles with all California drivers in the state from 2025 onwards.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology for this is here.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is financed from taxes paid by U.S. Americans at the Zapfsbild, is pleading.
But in America there is no more dancing as much as before.
Cars consume less gasoline.
The state mineral oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 Eurocents per litre) has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians do not dare to raise the tax by one cent at high price.
“The petrol tax is simply not future - according to Lee Munnich, an expert on traffic legislation at the University of Minnesota.
His state has recently equipped 500 cars with drivers to test a mile-based payment system.
“This is the most meaningful alternative in the long term,” he said.
bureaucrats label it as a file-based user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea of urban liberals is sound, for the tax could be used, for example, to influence driving behaviour in such a way that pollution and climate-damaged exhaust gases are reduced.
Californian planners rely on the system to develop strategies to achieve the ambitious, legally anchored goals of the state on climate change.
However, Republican Bill Shutter from Pennsylvania, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, also explained that he saw the most common long-term alternative in this area.
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also encouraged by the idea of allowing drivers to pay according to the route laid down.
“This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole,” explains Adrian Moore, Vice-President for Guidelines at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. ministers of transport who, in a 2011 report, asked Congress to move towards a milestone-based settlement.
Last year, the U.S. Senate approved a $90 million expensive pilot project that would have included 10,000 cars.
But the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the advance and responded to the concerns of Members from rural areas who represented people, who often had to travel many miles to work or to the city in everyday life.
Several states and major cities do not move on their own in this direction.
The most committed is Oregon, which currently hires 5,000 riders for the country's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the miles instead of the mineral oil tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is also considering this.
Illinois tests it to a limited extent with trucks.
And the I-95 Coalition, which includes the transport ministries of 17 states on the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently investigating how to implement the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the devices, car drivers were skeptical in thinking that the government could track any of their movements.
“Ambitions against Big Brother and such things were a big problem,” explains Alauddin Khan, Head of Strategy and Results Management at Nevada’s Department of Transportation.
People didn't want it.
When the test was running, Nevada's ACLU warned on its website: \"It would be relatively easy to turn the drivers into advanced surveillance devices,
There is no need to build a huge, bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of a number of states that now look forward to affordable technology, with which the state can capture the miles traveled, but not exactly when and where.
So, as Khan said, the public would be even more calm.
Hunting for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California.
The company originally did not arrive to help states with the taxation of drivers.
Rather, it was their goal to take foot in an emerging market for car insurance, where drivers are to pay based on the driven miles.
But the devices tested by her are also interesting for the road planners, because they do not work with GPS and only provide limited information that is regularly uploaded by modem.
“People are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded,” said Ryan Morrison, Managing Director of True Mileage.
In some of these public pilot programmes, serious mistakes have been made.
There are significantly cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this.
In Oregon, the planners experiment with giving drivers a range of choice options.
You can opt for a device with or without GPS.
Or they do not choose a device at all and instead pay a flat-rate fee based on the average miles driven by all residents of the state.
Other bodies hope to be able to sell the concept of a suspicious public by equipping the devices with more functions than with less.
In New York City, traffic officials want to develop a tax device to pay parking fees, to pay insurance only for miles driven and to collect speed data from other vehicles in real time, thanks to which drivers can diverge.
“Autodrivers would be motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits offered by the system,” says a city planning document.
Some traffic planners, however, wonder if the whole talk about paying per mile is not just a huge distraction.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay area, officials said that Congress could solve the problem of bankrupt Highway Trust Fund simply by increasing fuel tax.
An additional one-off fee or an annual fee could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little gasoline, so that they also pay a fair share.
\"There is no reason for an operation, if an aspirin is also sufficient, explains Randy Rentschler, the Head of Commission legislation and public affairs.
When we do, hundreds of millions of car drivers worry about their privacy and many other things.
Königsfeld: Small team gets awake
The volunteer firefighter managed her autumn head test despite staff shortages with Bravour.
Only eleven men participated in the exercise.
Department Commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the estate spring in Burgberger Straße in his exercise.
There should have been a short cut when sawing.
Two people were injured by the fire and the development of smoke, but one of them was able to send another emergency call.
After the first review of the situation, Hans Kammerer prepared to enter the building.
After a short time, it was possible to find the first person and lead him into the open.
The second person had to be worn.
This was not so easy, as a narrow staircase was also to be overcome.
The building, a workshop with integrated stable for two horses, was not easy to secure.
It stored a lot of wood and strawballs in it.
Furthermore, there were still electrical machines for woodworking.
The first extinguishing attack took place via the tank in the vehicle.
Another line took place via an overfloor hydrant around 100 meters away.
Now three deletion attacks could be designed.
A hollow beam tube was also used in the building.
Hans Kammerer also went on to show what to accomplish with little available staff.
In serious cases, support is given via the day-to-day Königsfeld group.
The commander was satisfied with the performance of the exercise.
Networking of universities and firms important
On his visit to the district of Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald, Landtag President Guido Wolf was also informed in Titisee-Neustadt about where the workers of tomorrow came from.
In the funding center of Hochschwarzwald, he together with the managing school leaders of the vocational schools, as well as the county high school and the parents' council chairmen, examined this important question.
“Education is an important location factor,” said Claudia Stehle, director of the Hans-Thoma School, who presented the networked school project Education Centre Hochschwarzwald.
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for training.
Since 2011, there has been a successful cooperation between the funding center, the county high school and the vocational school centre.
He also praised family friendliness in the county.
“It is important not only to have the family phase in mind, but also to have the phase for the care of family members due to demographic change,” Wolf explained.
He also indicated that more and more employees cared for the care and care of their families.
“Without the support of employers, the resulting burden on employees can lead to an end in the employment relationship,” said Wolf.
But no one could afford to lose skilled workers, he continued.
Another particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies.
\"For those who have already learned the advantages of the region during their studies, their knowledge and skills are often preserved by the regional economy, which contributes to the strengthening of the region, the Landtag President was convinced.
Only if sufficient training places were offered could the need for skilled workers be met.
In his opinion, the location advantage of the county is its advantageous location in southwest Germany, close to France and Switzerland.
On his train from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg, he also experienced the efforts already made to expand public transport.
“Stay persistent and ensure that public transport is getting better,” he explained at the address of the local politicians present.
Experience an entertaining afternoon with music
For the past 15 years, the Kaul family has invited the Dietinger Seniors to coffee, cake and then a Vesper.
In the past, older citizens were hosted in the restaurant.
This afternoon is held in St. Josef's nursing home.
The householders were looking forward to the delicious cakes and torts.
Later there was sausage salad.
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich were entertained with frequent melodies.
The over 100-year-old natural stone wall as a pre-restriction of the old school yard to the Kirchstraße prior to the refurbishment is to be set again with the renovation cost plan of the city of Bräunlingen.
In the days before the Kilbig, a small corner wall was installed during the first work of the refurbishment of the front school yard, for the stabilization and static discharge of the over a hundred-year-old natural stone wall with balustrade.
The further approach is to involve Alexander Misok from the Bräunlinger Stadtbauamt, the Landesmeinhaltamt in planning and to create a remedial concept for the old wall.
A cost calculation shall then be made by experts, who shall then be placed on the table to the Council for the decision and determination of the further procedure.
A decision on this will probably be taken in the coming year.
After the renovation, patching and planting of the old school yard within the two side wings of the school built in 1912, the follow-up measures must be taken in a foreseeable time, the cleaning-restriction wall must be renovated from ground to ground and placed on new substructures.
The historic, a hundred-year-old demarcation wall of the old school yard to the church street, is mainly due to water and frost damage, as there is no drainage, needs remediation and has a arching front.
Deep cracks in individual stones testify to weather damage, but the wall is not currently in danger of collapse.
A secure wall is a prerequisite for a schoolyard used by students, which has been carried out by the current fastening work.
Originally, the school court remediation was planned even in 2008/2009, but high unplanned spending brought a shift.
An important word in the historical school wall renovation, which has already been used for film recordings, will be given to the National Monument Office.
If provisions come from this side, then the city of Bräunlingen hopes for grants from the monument protectors.
The students of the Bräunlinger Grundschule, who are now being taught again in a well renovated old school building with a new aula, can soon use the old school yard.
Özdemir wants to get jazz training in Stuttgart
Cem Özdemir, Federal Chairman of the Greens, has now joined in the ongoing discussions on the future of music universities in Baden-Württemberg.
“I think it’s wrong to give up holistic training in the Musikhochschule Stuttgart,” Özdemir said, “Stutgarter Nachrichten”
Jazz and classics belong directly to the jazz location Stuttgart.
In doing so, Özdemir, who is considered a favorite in Stuttgart for a direct mandate in the Bundestag election on 22 September, contradicts the Green-Red State Government.
On the basis of an expert study, this forces a re-order of the five schools of music in Baden-Württemberg.
After that, among others, the study course Jazz and Pop will be moved from the Musikhochschule Stuttgart to the Musikhochschule Mannheim.
U.S. border: \"Super tunnel - discovered for drug smuggling
At the border between Mexico and the United States, Ermittler discovered and shut down a \"super tunnel\" for drug smuggling.
As reported by the US customs authorities, the more than 500-metre-long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, rail tracks and a ventilation system.
Three suspects were therefore arrested, eight tons of marijuana and nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine seized.
The tunnel has not yet been used.
“These cartels are stupid if they think they could dig themselves down under the radar,” said the U.S. District General of Southern California, Laura Duffy, at a press conference in front of a warehouse in San Diego, where it had been discovered an end to the tunnel.
Duffy told the drug gangs: “If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them, we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money,
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a permanent fight against the drug cartels.
Since 2006, more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime.
Constructed by experts
Due to the elaborate equipment of the tunnel, the investigators assume that it was designed by architects and engineers and that it took about a year to build.
The track system was equipped in such a way that electric-powered cars could be used there.
On the Mexican side is access to a building 80 meters from the border.
According to authorities, a ladder leads to the actual tunnel entrance 20 meters deep.
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 meters height and 90 centimeters width.
It would also have been appropriate to promote illegal immigration towards the United States.
Two suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine found.
The third, a Mexican, was captured because of the seized marijuana.
All three threaten as a maximum punishment for life-long withdrawal of freedom, as officials said.
Since 2006 eight such tunnels have been discovered, it has been mentioned at the press conference in San Diego.
But it was the first time that cocaine was found in such a tunnel building.
Normally cocaine is smuggled into smaller quantities rather than through tunnels.
This showed the “disappointment” of the drug gangs, whose traditional routes have now been cut off, said Bill Sherman of the DEA drug finder in San Diego.
They'd do everything to get to the United States.
No details were given to the arresters, at least one of them being Mexicans, said it.
You must expect to be sentenced to ten years in prison.
2014 becomes Geisinger Festiver
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250s.
The return of the first official mention is getting closer and closer.
When the year ends in about eight weeks, the anniversary year is on.
Geisingen and Kirchen-Hausen were first mentioned together in 794.
In churches a document was made, in which both places are mentioned.
On 15 March there will be an official opening to the anniversary year, and since Geisingen has no hall at present, this opening event takes place in the place where 1250 years ago both were first mentioned, in church houses.
Within the framework of the anniversary several events are planned in Geisingen as well as in church-houses.
Church Houses will be 1250 in July on a festival weekend from 18 to 20 July.
Celebrate again.
On Friday with a festival, on Saturday and Sunday with a festival around the Kirchtalhalle.
In addition, the church-house church festival is still on this weekend.
City Music Director Rudolf Barth has written an order composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary, which is listed on three dates.
On 21 June, together with the solstice celebration of the Schwarzwaldverein, on 12 July in the arena with fireworks and on 13 December as the first concert of city music in the new festival hall.
This will be completed and inaugurated in the anniversary year, the official date will be at the end of September, 27 and 28 September.
A new chronicle will be released on the occasion of the Geising city anniversary.
“But it is to be a chronicle not only of Geisingen himself, but also a printed work on the Geisingen of today, which consists of Geisingen, Church-Houses, Leipferdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen, according to Mayor Walter Hengstler.
And today's Geisingen celebrates 2014 birthday, in 1974 today's space was carried out with the meetings.
The new chronicle will then be presented in the new Festhalle in Geisingen on 21 or 22 November.
2014 is also a year with many anniversarys.
The Strahglonki narration begins on February 8 with a custom evening on the occasion of its 60th anniversary, the Harmony Gutmadingen becomes 90 years and has the festival banquet on March 29th and then celebrates the district music festival from May 1 to 4.
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen will be 40 years old, the Geisinger School has been at the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on May 10th, the Musikverein Polyhymnia Leipferdingen will be 150 years old and celebrates this in the context of the Fountain Festival from July 4 to 7th.
The city of Geisingen was first mentioned in 764 in a gift certificate owned by the monastery of St. Gallen.
The certificate was made in churches (houses), which was the court place at the time.
Both municipalities are therefore mentioned in the same document.
Reason 2014 to celebrate this 1250-year-old accordingly, in addition the municipal reform is also 40 years back.
Council takes into account track facilities
Should the railway crossing on Hirschen be elaborately converted in order to increase road safety?
Yes, the councils have decided.
Schiltach must take in €220 000 for this purpose.
The Deutsche Bahn intends to improve the Kinzigtal line next year.
In particular, safety at rail crossings is to be increased - regularly there are collisions of trains with other vehicles throughout the country.
The municipalities agree to the restructuring measures, they have to participate with a third in the cost, the rest share railways and the federal government.
Schiltach's Stadtbaumeister Roland Grießhaber explained to the Municipal Council the specifics of the Bahpassing - Am Hirschen -
There, the city plans to build an outlay at the height of the tunnel mouth west of the railway tracks.
There could also be larger vehicles, such as those that transport longwood, at counter-trafficking, without having to block the track.
Greetings therefore suggested constructing a necessary supporting wall in such a way that the city could expand the road in due time to ensure smooth flow of traffic.
This was discussed controversially in the Municipal Council, as some councils questioned the need for a road spread: Thomas Kipp raised the point with his statement: “We need to take so much money because of so few vehicles,
Mayor Thomas Haas contradicted: The railway crossing \"Hirschen\" is regularly used for longwood transport.
Even wood from the “Kuhbach” area will be transported partly by this route, because the vehicles up to 20 metres long could not use the route at the Häberlesbrücke because they could not turn into the main road there.
In addition, Haas argued that the route serves as a redirect for those vehicles not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is blocked.
In view of the fact that Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels had to be rebuilt and renovated, as is currently the case in Wolfach, there could also be a significant traffic significance for a longer period of time to pass through the railway between \"Am-Hirschen\" and \"Am-Hirschen\".
The councils agreed to investigate the costs of the planned widening of the road.
Regardless of this, the conversion of the railway crossing was largely agreed with the requirement that the necessary support wall be built in such a way that the city could extend the subsequent road towards the railway station road, where appropriate, for meeting traffic to about 5.5 metres.
On the other hand, the conversion of the railway crossing at the Gerberei Trautwein could lead to a completely different problem concerning access to the heavily rising Geroltzhäuser road.
The administration had examined the reconstruction plans of the railway from the engineering office Breinlinger, since it had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhaus road would be possible.
The investigation concluded that it was not excluded that the road inclination conditions could lead to longer vehicles being seated.
In turn, the responsibility for this was borne by the city as a road carrier.
The restructuring could therefore be carried out in accordance with liability disputes.
Since both the logging and the turning of the current expansion were working, Haas argued against the conversion of the railway crossing.
At this point, too, the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle which is on the transition would be significantly lower than that of the other rail crossings, because it is located directly next to the center of the stop to which there is a good visual connection.
Even trains from the main station would have to be brakeed to the point that no collision would threaten.
In majority, the conversion of this railway crossing was denied the agreement, as the city of Schiltach had to \"swipe out\" the problem with sitting vehicles, so the councils, as the railways could withdraw from the responsibility after the construction work was completed.
The board considers the conversions to the railway crossings, Vor Heubach and Vor Kuhbach, for which already crossing agreements have been made with the railway.
Esa decides on large space missions: Missions for billions
Remote planets, gravity waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency now have to agree on two major projects that they want to start in the coming years.
30 proposals were available, five are still in the race.
Remote worlds.
More than 1000 planets at other stars have already found astronomers.
No one knows if there are at least some of them.
The selection is difficult: Should you search for gravity waves?
Or rather explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or flying after earth-like planets, perhaps discovering extraterrestrial life?
These questions are precisely the responsibility of the European Space Agency Esa.
For their program \"Cosmic Vision\", they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that are intended to make research decisive.
The budget for such L missions is approximately one billion euros.
The start is expected to be 2028 and 2034.
At the beginning of September, the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 ideas were the subject of debate, five of which have now come into the narrower choice.
A number of bodies have examined the proposals and have looked into them.
In the next few days, a final decision will be taken by the Scientific Programme Committee.
In total, the Esa selected four major questions to which the Missions of the 2007 program \"Cosmic Vision\" should find answers.
What are the conditions for the creation of planets and life?
The precise processes in the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus also the formation of planets that orbit these stars - are still in the proverbial dark.
A large infrared telescope in the All could penetrate this dark.
And if a star has planets, under what circumstances can life arise there?
In order to answer this question, 2017 will launch the space telescope \"Cheops\", with which 500 already known planetary systems will be examined more closely in our vicinity.
But the possibilities are limited, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments, astronomers could map earth-like planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres, looking for biomarkers: gases that are considered to be an indication of biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
This question is also intended to provide an explanation of what conditions exist for the creation of life.
An important role is the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field as well as the particle radiation from it with the planetary system.
In our solar system, these processes can be examined in an exemplary way.
With the \"Solar Orbiter\", the Esa has already approved a mission of the M-Class (which is about half a billion euros) for this question.
The probe is expected to start in 2017 and observe the sun's surface and activity closely.
Of great interest to researchers are Jupiter and its moons.
They want to find out what role the giant planet played in the development of the solar system.
For this purpose, the Esa is the first of the three L missions of the Cosmic Vision programme.
The Sonne Juice (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) is expected to begin its journey in 2022.
Eight years later it reaches Jupiter and is supposed to examine the planet's atmosphere as well as the icy moons of Europe, Kallisto and Ganymede.
What are the fundamental physical laws of the universe?
The world room offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and to examine whether the laws of nature we know are still valid there.
Perhaps there are also variations that could show the physicists the way to a new theory, under whose roof all known laws of nature can be united.
How did the universe come about and what does it consist of?
13.7 billion years ago, our cosmos was created by the big bang.
In addition to our common matter, from the stars, planets and living things as we exist, there is dark matter, whose gravity holds galaxies and galaxies together, and dark energy, through which the expansion of the universe accelerates.
Until now, the researchers do not know what physical laws were valid in the first seconds of the bang, nor what dark matter and dark energy are.
With \"Euclid\", the Esa has already approved an M mission here, which is scheduled for 2020.
With a special telescope, the probe is supposed to examine the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time throughout the universe, thus allowing conclusions on the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could make the race
Of the 30 proposals, only two will remain at the end of the selection process.
According to many experts, the best chances for a permit as an L mission are that E-Lisa has a challenging concept for detecting gravitational waves.
Physicists understand changes in the structure of spacetime that Albert Einstein had predicted nearly 100 years ago.
They have not been proven to this day.
Elisa could do that, the scientists hope behind the project.
The mission includes a two or three probe detector that is stationed in the All.
In contrast to plants on Earth, it could also show gravitational waves that were created at the start, thus providing new insights into the formation of the cosmos.
Four other proposals are still competing for the second L mission: a large X-ray telescope called ‘Athena’, which is to explore black holes, ‘Icy Planets’, another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, ‘Prim’, a mission to measure cosmic background radiation, and the ‘Exoplanet Finder’ to track and examine the earth-like planets.
Already eliminated are proposals for sample bulk transport from Mars, for exploration of moon, Venus and asteroids, as well as solar physics.
Snowden is ready to \"cooperate with Germany with regard to US surveillance\"
Edward Snowden, the whistleblower of the U.S. intelligence service, has declared that he is willing to travel to Berlin and testify before the German Bundestag when the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not give any answers about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he received this asylum to discuss with him the statement in Germany.
In a letter from Snowden, presented to the media in Berlin on Friday of Ströbele, he writes: “Even if the result of my efforts proved positive, my government continues to treat a disparaging opinion as a breach of loyalty and attempts to criminalize political opinion with criminal threat, where no defence is possible,
The truth to say is not a crime.
In the letter Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community can convince the American government to drop the charge against him.
The charge raised by the US Department of Justice includes espionage and theft of state property.
German Minister of Interior Hans-Peter Friedrich said to time online: \"If Mr. Snowden is ready to speak with German representatives, we will find ways to enable this to happen.\"
Relations between the United States and Germany are affected by the allegations that NSA has heard the phone from Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the MEP, who is head of the parliamentary committee responsible for the intelligence service, said that it was appropriate to take the opportunity to listen to Snowden as a witness if this could be done without endangering him and destroying relations with the United States completely,
Ströbele, a member of the Greens, published a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists on his visit to Russia.
Ströbele explained that according to former NSA employee Snowden, he could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Snowden is speaking in Germany, then he needs an assurance that he is \"safe\" there, said the MEP.
Snowden, in his letter, explains that he was exposed to a “serious and ongoing” persecution campaign that had expelled him from his homeland.
However, he was touched by the global reaction to \"my act of political opinion\"
Citizens around the world, as well as high-ranking politicians, including in the United States, have described the revelations through an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a merit to the public.
In his letter, Snowden makes an offer to the German authorities to cooperate, \"when the difficulties relating to the humanitarian situation have been solved\"
Frontier Airlines raises fees for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to demand up to $100 from passengers who want to store hand luggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to $100 for a piece of hand luggage and $2 for coffee or lemonade, even if the announcement on Wednesday was to read that passengers should keep the entire can.
The new fee applies to hand luggage in the luggage compartment above the seat, small bags under the seat are still free of charge.
Frontier explained that you would charge $25 if the fee was paid in advance, and $100 for travelers who only paid on the airlift.
Frontier spokesman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee aimed at moving travelers to take care of the payment in advance.
“We don’t want to calculate this sum,” she explained.
Airlines began to charge in 2008 for the first and second abandoned luggage.
Passengers who tried to bypass them have therefore put as much as possible into their handbags, resulting in the frequent overcrowding of luggage compartments over the seat.
Fees are an opportunity to move passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said at the new fee, it's not really about making money.
It was about the most loyal customers of Frontier who had clearly expressed that it would be increasingly difficult to find space in the compartment above the seat.
Passengers who buy your tickets on the airline website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger may be allowed to take a piece of luggage free of charge on the flight from Frontier, but the next person must pay $100 for a comparable piece of luggage.
O'Malley stated that the Frontier website and the check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers would be informed of the fee before they came to the airport.
Frontier's new hand luggage fee only enters into force in summer, there is no exact date yet.
Passengers often scoff at luggage surcharges and other charges, but airlines like to take advantage of them.
They argue that the transport of luggage costs money and passengers should pay this service if they wish.
Many at Wall Street regard the new luggage fees as a sign that airlines are taking enough money to cover the costs of flight trips after years of losses.
Most, however, have left the fingers of fees for hand luggage so far.
Spirit Airlines Inc. demanded first hand luggage fees three years ago and later Allegiant Air, also a low-cost aircraft.
The only other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air, said Airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely followed the additional charges.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that the hand luggage fee Spirit brings in $150 million annually.
Sorensen, who had previously held a leadership position at Midwest Airlines, recently flew with spirit and was curious about what would be expected of him on the airlift if passengers were confronted with the company's unusual hand luggage fee.
“The boarding process was among the most smooth I’ve experienced in my career in aviation,” he said.
I expected to see tooth-clinks and hand-geared discussions on the flightway.
“The plane was full,” he explained, “and the boarding ran as slammed,
Frontier also follows Spirit with the $2 for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.
The company explained that passengers who bought lemonade or juice should keep the entire can and fill coffee free of charge.
Water is still free.
U.S. Airways had recently tried to demand money for refreshment drinks in 2008, but this was reversed seven months later after passengers complained and no other large company had been withdrawn.
Frontiers Step to raise fees for the hand luggage if passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative with which customers should be linked to their own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies like Orbitz $10 to $25 per ticket sold.
This gives all companies an incentive to move passengers to direct purchase with them instead of via an online travel office.
Frontier has, however, gone the farthest in this area.
In September, the company began to give only half as many frequent flyer miles when booking via an online travel office.
On Wednesday, the miles were reduced to 25 percent of the flight distance.
A trip with Frontier booked by a third-party provider over 1000 miles therefore brings customers only 250 miles.
Passengers can also book places only upon direct purchase on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer tribe at its seat in Denver, but the business shrinks and the company loses money.
The proceeds decreased by 9 percent and the flight capacity decreased by almost 13 percent in the first quarter, as read in the financial report published on Wednesday by the Mother Group, Republic Airways Holdings Inc..
Republic has tried to get the finances of Frontier under control as part of the sale of the company.
Words From the Bible
About 40 women visited the last breakfast of this year in the Evangelical Church of Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the municipal building was “Bible - and Medieval - Edition Words ”
After breakfast, Zita Köhler, the chairman of the church council, took part in a lecture on the biblical proverbs.
“Words contain lifestyles, regulations or warnings,” she explained.
She compared several proverbs with the corresponding Bible passages and explained the meaning.
She called such words as, \"The eye of the wood shall be watchful, as the scales fall from the eyes, an eye shall be on someone, the Lord shall give him in sleep, his hands shall wash in innocence.\"
Several times the speaker also advised their listeners about what the proverb was about.
The use of the Middle Ages was adopted by the church councillor Christel Dehner: All good things are three, blue, something to hide.
She explained the importance and origin of the speech she called “bridges in the past. ”
Finally, a Tombola was released.
The prizes were covered on a table and were defined humorously before being handed over to the winners.
Among the visitors to the breakfast round, Mayor Roman Waizenegger also mixed.
Learning instead of unemployed: pilot project for unlearned in tourism
A pilot project for the tourism industry is currently underway at the Mecklenburgische Seenplatte.
Under the leadership of the Federal Labour Agency, 49 women and men already working as unlearned in the industry will be qualified as specialists for hotels and restaurants over three winters.
“Newly, the six-month courses end with finals,” said Carmen Wiechert from the employment agency Neubrandenburg.
The benefits are diverse: the participants would not be unemployed, the firms would have trained professionals, who were increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants, and the agency would not have to finance unemployment.
The project also involves the Chamber of Industry and Commerce in Neubrandenburg as well as the Deutsche Hotel- und Gastättenverband (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
NSA explains that an \"internal error\" and not hackers are responsible for the crash of the website
The shadowy National Security Agency declared on late Friday that a mistake had paralysed their public website for several hours and not hackers as claimed online.
“NSA.gov was not accessible for several hours this night, as an internal error occurred during a planned update,” explained the spy agency in a message sent by e-mail.
The problem will be solved this evening.
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed Denial of Service Attack (DDoS) is not true.
In the early evenings, online server trackers had noticed that the NSA website was not accessible for at least six hours and this is still not available for some users.
Previously, a NSA spokesperson had explained to ABC News that the sensitive internal network of the Authority was “in no way” compromised.
Secret information is not in danger, the speaker said.
At least a group of hacktivists claimed to have paralysed the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In such attacks, the target website is flooded with page calls until the servers are overloaded and the website breaks down.
Cybertactics is relatively simple and the attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former supersecret NSA, whose nickname was once No Search Agency (no such authority), is now exposed to harsh criticism in the light of the public and, according to the revelations made in recent months, it has been exposed to extensive surveillance programmes in Germany and abroad, a result of the secret NSA data stolen and published by former NSA employee Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy over intelligence prompted initial speculation about the incident today is the result of targeted cyperoperation.
The number of people without jobs fell slightly in October by 22 to 1,307.
Although the quota is 3.1 percent better than last year and also better than in September, \"we would have hoped more, however, Monika Felden-Bauer, Deputy Head of the Agency for Labour in Sonthofen, says.
Many companies have so far responded in the case of attitudes.
According to Felden-Bauer, one reason for this is: “We have hardly any skilled staff in the crafts, in health care and in the elderly,
Since September there have also been job offers for staff in the hotel and restaurant industry.
The winter season begins in mid-December.

Exemption of profits from bombers after decline in delivery and orders
The Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15-percent fall in net profit on Thursday, after being pressured by declining orders and deliveries to aircraft in the third quarter, as well as contract problems in the railway sector.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not publish flight test data for his CSeries brand new aircraft and did not provide any new information on whether the aircraft could go into commercial use in accordance with the ambitious schedule next September.
Up until one and a half months ago, only three other starts followed the young flight of the test plane, which makes it seem questionable whether the test phase runs as planned.
The results remained behind the forecasts and led to a price crash of over eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
On Thursday, Cameron Doerksen, analyst at National Bank Financial, reduced his assessment of “outperform” to “sector performance” with a view to ensuring that the stock will have a limited price potential in the next one to two quarters.
“We were expected to have weaker delivery numbers in aircraft as far as possible, but we are clearly disappointed by the margin development in the transport sector,” said Doerksen in a customer letter.
We are of the view that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries when the test program progresses for the aircraft.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more sceptical towards the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries series can catapult the company into the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was introduced to the public in March and flew after months of delays for the first time in September.
However, binding orders for the CSeries have so far been moderate with 177, since potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests and want to see whether the company's claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost savings potential of the new jet transport aircraft are applicable.
There are currently 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
CEO Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will reach its goal of 300 binding orders at the beginning of commercial use of the jet.
The management also assured analysts and media on Thursday, the program was in the schedule.
“The test aircraft did not stay on the ground any longer than expected,” Beaudoin said at a telephone conference, adding that ground tests and software updates had been started during the flight’s lifetime.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We decided to take a first flight and then to attach a review period to whatever we did.
This happens throughout the flight programme.
The second of five test aircraft is expected to start in the next weeks, the rest shortly thereafter, it was mentioned by company side.
Nevertheless, analysts remain skeptical as to whether 12 months after the first customer can operate an aircraft of the CSeries.
Bombardier said it reviewed the planning for commissioning (EIS) and will update it in the next few months.
“The slow progress of the flight test, even if it obviously corresponds to Bombardier’s internal planning, reinforces our view that commissioning will move to the first quarter of 2015” said Doerksen.
In the third quarter with the end of 30 September, Bombardier's net profit fell to 147 million dollars and 8 cents per share of 172 million dollars and 9 cents per share in the previous year.
The adjusted profit per share remains 9 cents.
The sales decreased slightly and decreased from 4.2 to 4.1 billion dollars.
Analysts expected a profit of 10 cents per share and sales of $4.56 billion, says Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer says he delivered 45 aircraft this quarter, a decrease of 57 last year.
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
The order stock in the aerospace sector was $32.9 billion on 30 September and was therefore unchanged on 31 December.
“In the field of aerospace, the results were in line with our specifications, but the low order intake and overall market conditions were disappointing,” Beaudoin said.
The turnover in the aerospace sector fell by 13 percent to two billion dollars.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer, announced that sales in this department increased by almost eleven percent to $2.1 billion.
The order stock in the transport division was $32.6 billion on 30 September and was therefore slightly increased compared to 31 December.
The profit margin in the transport sector has been affected by settlement problems in some major contracts.
According to company management, there will be new requirements for the fourth quarter.
In the afternoon trade on Thursday, the Bombardier share declined by 8.5 percent and was $4.83 Canadian dollars, after it was also announced that the Google Finance Board will switch Patrick Pichette to the Executive Board.
The Brazilian Embraer SA, the world's third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and bomber's closest rival, reported a ten-percent decline in quarterly profits on Thursday.
United States: Shots at Los Angeles Airport
An unknown one fired at the LAX airport in Schüsse on Friday morning.
While the airport management informed Twitter about the gunman being in custody, the man reported that the \"Los Angeles Times\" was dead.
A security man had also been killed.
Media also reported several injuries.
US President Barack Obama is constantly informed of the situation, said White House spokesman Jay Carney.
The incident occurred in terminal 3. Eyewitnesses indicated that a shooter with a gun in one of the departure halls had seen several media reports.
A traveler told the transmitter CNN that many people had been looking for protection in panic.
Travelers would have cried and cried children.
Among the waiters, panic broke out, many would have been hidden behind chairs out of fear.
He heard two shots, says a traveller from the Los Angeles Times.
An employee of the TSA Security Authority suffered a shooting injury at the foot.
The scene was like in a movie.
After that, he himself was brought into a safety area, the man reported.
The shots should have fallen close to a safety control area.
Airport Building Evacuated
TV shows showed how numerous hospital and police cars took place in front of a terminal.
Hundreds of people were kept safe from the building.
Users on Twitter published photos of a special deployment command and a gun on the ground.
As reported by the airport management via Twitter, the incident began at 9.30 a.m. (local time).
The access roads were blocked, which, according to CNN, formed a long back stop.
Until landings, air traffic had been temporarily discontinued, it was said.
However, there were also several aircraft on CNN at the start.
Terminal 3 is mainly operated by smaller US airlines.
The LAX airport of Los Angeles is the largest airport in the United States.
Cocaine-dependent lawyer who warned drug-boss against police investigation must go to prison
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided information to Underworld size Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction might come to light
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court
A well-known criminal defender who warned a drug baron of a major police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug addiction could be discovered was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about investigations into his drug trafficking activities after being compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
The lawyer, who was the first-class criminal, named Bash, was arrested in his home in 2011 after the police supervised Scarborough, whom he had represented in an earlier drug procedure.
Officials watched Scarborough (32) deliver three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was with colleagues at a dinner in the bar.
The investigation revealed that Ditta regularly consumed drugs of Class A, after traces of cocaine in his hair, pocket and credit cards had been found during tests.
Over an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he attempted to obtain unauthorised information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were then monitored by the police as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trade in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 other people, they were later arrested after the police secured heroin and cocaine worth 1.5 million pounds and 200,000 pounds of cash in a series of house searches.
Ditta, 42, passed information on to the criminals because he feared that his drug addiction could become public.
Today, Ditta, who works for the law firm Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was found guilty and convicted at the Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week trial in two charges for the disability of the judiciary.
In an earlier survey, he assigned cocaine ownership.
The lawyer was transferred after the police found out in their investigation against Scarborough that he had been in regular contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw him go to Ditta's house and put the drugs there with a 60 percent purity in a black golf glove under the lawyer's garbage tons.
Shortly after he delivered the drugs, Scarborough regularly phoned Ditta, who was at the Blackburn Rovers in Ewood Park at the dinner stadium.
The lawyer returned home, picked up the drugs, and then nine messages were exchanged between the two.
In court, it was known that Ditta was a regular consumer of cocaine after tests of Class A drugs were discovered in his hair, pocket and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but refused to take cocaine and said he spoke to the alleged dealer because he was his client and claimed that their discussion was subject to the \"apprenticeship secret\"
During his arrest Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were assured and a hair sample was taken.
During the police interrogation, he stated that he was running an office and clients would call him at home for legal matters, both under his private address and at the workplace.
It was announced before the court that he had called on important actors of the drug trade, some of whom he had previously represented, after significant arrests and informed them of what the investigators knew about them.
Attorney Anne Whyte said, \"A criminal lawyer should know better than everyone else that the law is not broken\"
Ditta is accused of abuse of his position as a criminal defendant, since he has too much to do with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not simply that of a drug dealer, but of a drug dealer who provides his lawyer with drugs.
Some of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate, for he was the lawyer of these persons.
But that went far beyond the boundaries of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.
He acted as far as possible against police investigations so that they could continue their criminal activities.
Mr Ditta called into question his professional status.
He was too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta pointed out any misconduct of himself and claimed: “If I were a corrupt lawyer, what I am not, and wanted to pass information on to Scarborough, I wouldn’t wait 15 hours, but I would do so immediately.”
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police said: “Mr Ditta has taken the step from a criminal defendant to a criminal at the moment he started to acquire drugs from organized criminals,
His cocaine dependence led to hopeless compromise and made him receptive to the motives of leading members of organized crime who commissioned him to collect valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure confidence and confidence in the public.
Ditta has lost this confidence and has tried to hide behind the facade of his profession.
The Serious and Organized Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigation against Ditta, which also led to a conviction in three cases because of the possession of cocaine and judicial barriers, which underscored our determination to bring criminals to court.
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after declaring himself guilty of the conspiracy of heroin, cocaine, and cannabis trafficking.
Thirty-five others involved in drug trafficking were sentenced to total punishments of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta published an area of questions and answers about himself, stating that his dream job was to be represented as attorney clients in the death cell in America, his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali and chance inequality was the motivation for his work.
Revolutionary work of church music
At the conclusion of the celebrations on the occasion of his 160th anniversary, the Songkranz Dunningen will reframe two services with Franz Schubert's \"German Fair\".
After the great success of the musical “Rock my Life” which thrilled the audience in spring this year, the Song Crane will enrich two divine services at the conclusion of the anniversary year with the performance of Franz Schubert’s Deutsche Messe.
On Saturday, October 26, this extraordinary trade fair will be heard from 19 during the evening fair at St. Martinuskirche Dunningen and on Sunday, October 27, from 10.15 a.m. at the service at St. Johannes Baptist Church in Lackendorf.
The so-called German trade fair with the original title \"Songs for the Celebration of the Holy Victim of the Mass\" - D 872, is a spiritual musical work by composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was considered almost revolutionary at the time of the creation.
The trade fair is listed as part of the worship services, as the client Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind.
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied by the Bläsergruppe of the Musikverein Frohsin Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi on the organ.
Harassment: Skeptics softens confidence
The elections to the Council of Paris in 2015 will change, for example, in the Seelsorgeeinheit Haslach (SE) basics.
There is then only one common parish council for all six parishes.
At a joint meeting on Saturday, the bodies from Haslag, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared themselves for the changes.
There is nothing to be changed on the fundamental decisions of the diocese and it is up to the parish councils to implement them as satisfactory as possible.
Over the course of the day it became particularly clear: the scepticism towards the new one, however, is reluctant to look forward to confidence.
From the ideas and expectations of the innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish council, the extremely constructive talks of the six bodies with the main offices of the soul care team were enough.
Regional dean Georg Schmitt presented the newly adopted guidelines for soul care units in the Erzdiocese of Freiburg.
After that, the SE Haslach as a church community will form a body of public law that will enter into the rights and duties of the so far six individual churches.
There will only be a joint parish council and a foundation council in which the parish council is represented.
At least two elected members are to be represented from each parish, six parishes being formed on the spot called community teams.
Their task will be to promote church life in the place in the future.
The question of the finances of the individual parish was then a major matter for discussion.
The innovations suggest that accumulated assets in the parishes remain purpose-bound.
On the other hand, the liabilities are transferred to the whole municipality.
There were great concerns especially with regard to the large investments planned, whose commitment was then made to all parishes.
“Even in the past, only projects that could be managed by individual parishes alone have been invested in - relativized Hashach’s parish council chairman Bruno Prinzbach.
Practical experience with a joint body for five parishes, Barbar Ritter, the chairman of the board in the Schutterwald-Nuried Seelsorge unit.
In 2006, they had been assigned to \"one, five remain\" and had to find that this is not so easy.
The bodies of the Haslacher Seelsorge Unit then worked to answer the questions about the future composition and size of the Joint parish council and the practical work of the community team.
Preparations will be made at further meetings and agreed at a further joint meeting of all six bodies next spring.
At the end, parish councillor Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the soul care unit, which was approved by a clear majority.
In Pfullendorf the electricity becomes more expensive
The citizens of Pfullendorf have to adjust to higher electricity costs.
As the managing director of the Stadtwerke, Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed against the SÜDKURER, a four-member Pfullendorfer family of 70 to 90 Euros will have additional costs per year.
The main reason for the rise in prices is the increase in the so-called EEG volume from 5,277 to 6,3 cents per kilowatt hour.
This envelope is re-established each year in October by the four operators of the major trams.
These are the additional costs incurred by the energy transition, which can be raised by a change over the electricity price.
The town works Pfullendorf form the last link in this chain.
In his forecasts, the Supervisory Board of the Energy Company even had a higher envelope, as Jörg-Arne Bias reports.
Now the concrete payments would have to be calculated before the city works next week could inform their customers about the exact price increase.
“We go from an increase of 1 cent plus x - so bias, where the number will be closer to the 2 cents.
Ampel on permanent red: Keep waiting
Sometimes a traffic jam just won't turn green.
The contact loop in the street does not react, or the light sign is defective.
What should you do then - drive in red?
If a person has waited long enough for a red light and the crossing is free, he can continue, explains Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine \"Motorrad\"
The waiting time, however, had to be \"advanced\", which could be interpreted differently from case to case.
Becker advises to stand out for at least five minutes before the traffic jam is due to a function disorder.
However, those who continue the journey despite red lights must be aware that he is to blame for an accident caused by it.
Those who wait less than five minutes may not wait long enough, warn Becker and refer to a decision of the Supreme Court of Hamm.
In the negotiated case, a driver had ignored the traffic lights after about three minutes of continuous redness and had to be responsible for a negligence of red light.
The traffic lights were not defective, but they turned to green a little later.
A driving ban was spared him because of the special situation - but the fine was not.
Municipal Council is pleased with solid households
Whenever it comes to the household in municipal council meetings, Mayor Ralph Gerster has a good laugh.
The municipal store in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and debt has not been known since 2005.
In this sense, the financial year 2012 can also be considered a full success.
This became clear when the annual accounts were presented for 2012.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget of around 7.6 million euros was higher than planned.
The surplus of the administrative budget is also approximately EUR 1.8 million above the approach.
The surplus was mainly due to higher commercial tax revenues and to the municipal share of the income tax.
Again, the budget was clearly above the planned values.
Instead of the EUR 1.5 million planned, it was EUR 2.5 million last year.
“This is mainly due to the higher administrative budget addition,” says Rothmund.
As less investment than planned has been made in the financial year 2012, the increase in the amount of refund is also higher.
Overall, the general reserve could be increased by around EUR 2.1 million to a total of EUR 4.9 million now.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for the good work.
“You don’t just shake a piece out of your sleeves,” Gerster praised with a view to the annual bill.
He and the councils looked forward to the good figures.
It may sound paradoxical, but precisely these good figures could soon be expensive for citizens.
Because of the good financial situation, the community has been able to refrain from high lifting rates in the past.
However, according to Gerster, this had already been cut more often by the country.
There are requirements for these grants from various sources of compensation.
Among other things, cities and municipalities applying for grants must provide certain lifting rates.
“We need to look at the issue of lifting rates, as investments for which we would like to have grants are available in the coming years,” Gerster announced in this context.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter in choir for 60 years
At 60 years of age as a singer, Hubert Wermter's story at the men's singing club Cecilia is almost twice as long as that of the Herbsfest, in which he was solemnly honored.
Hubert Wermter stood on stage as usual in the colours of his men's singing club.
Even after 60 years, he still enjoys singing with the choir he has won more than love.
Wermter was also active in the association for 28 years, including 28 years as a member of the committee.
He received several awards for his engagement and his association loyalty: Jörg Kohr, Pastoral Officer on behalf of the Cäcilienverbandes Rottenburg-Stuttgart, gave him a certificate of honor signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst, since the choir is also a church choir.
His singer colleagues handed him the certificate of the German choir association as well as a gravitated tin plate.
In addition to the honor, the 31st autumn festival took place in the usual railways: with the MGV Betra, the song kranz Salzstetten, the singer department Baisingen and the local music club, the Vollmaringer had invited a colorful mix of different choirs and singing styles, which the approximately 400 visitors entertained.
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with vocal songs such as \"In the wine paradise\" and \"Lustig, her brother\"
Her honorary singer Hubert Wermter made her a small stand for honor - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's \"Federal Song\"
The Men's Song Association Betra also sings classic choir songs such as \"Jägerwerben\" by Julius Wengert, \"Weit, weit, weit weit\" by Hubert Goisern and the folk song \"When you go through the valley\"
With his mixed choir and his women's group - the \"Impulse Choir\" - the song crow provided the women's ratio of the festival.
The mixed choir, with the Neapolitan popular way of saying, \"Santa Lucia\" and \"Eviva Espana\" were kidnapped by Antos Gus in foreign countries, while \"Impulse Choir\" was also used in foreign languages: \"Liberatio\" and \"Hey Jude\" were part of their program.
The singer department of the Baisinger Sportverein returned to the local field with \"Wash der Schwob\" by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Pappert's \"Bierlied\", where the Vollmaringer Musikverein offered the crowning musical conclusion.
For the children there was a small secondary program - “Oma Hanne - alias Hannelore Stollsteimer performed a casperl theatre and read a few stories that the children worked well during the afternoon.
Children's Dreams Become True
The kindergartens and childcare centers in the Zollernalbkreis receive mail these days.
In cooperation with the Bauhaus and the Sparkasse Zollernalb, the Schwarzwälder Bote wants to support the institutions in the realization of their building and decoration wishes.
Does the Kindergarten need a new sandbox?
In the event of the action, all kindergartens, daycare facilities and children's cribs from the entire Zollernalbkreis can participate.
If you have a construction or decoration wish for your facility, you can apply for this at the Black Forest messenger.
Be creative with your children and surprise the jury of action Kindergarten building site.
A jury, consisting of representatives of Black Forester Bote, Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb, selects three wishes from all submissions.
What are the conditions for participation?
The wish should be realized with construction material worth a maximum of 2000 Euro and on a (action) day.
In addition, the winner himself must provide many diligent builders.
What about the day of action and the helpers?
Bauhaus provides the material with the support of the Sparkasse Zollernalb.
It is delivered to the Kindergarten on the agreed day and is then to be processed directly by the helpers.
Helpers can be parents, grandparents, friends, associations and, of course, the educators and children themselves.
Kenyan press outraged over controversial media law
\"We are in a distressing situation and we can ask ourselves, \"What does Parliament think about simply abolishing judicial independence tomorrow\" was read in the newspaper, which considers the draft law unconstitutional.
“The law is drachonic and very punishing and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, Managing Director of the Capital Group, who also belongs to CapitalFM, one of Kenya’s most prestigious independent radio stations and news sites.
He said that the new media tribunal will always be ahead of us because it is an extended arm of the government, and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
“I hope the President listens to us and we appeal to him to reject this draft law and send it back to Parliament,” he said.
According to The Star newspaper, the government had suffered a severe blow through the new law, “the media were effectively caught in a gun attack,” writes The Standard, Democracy, and Freedom of Speech in Kenya, and titled the draft as “draconian.”
The adoption of the law is one of a number of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the aftermath of the attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate shopping centre in September.
The Kenyan media attracted the anger of the authorities because they published recordings of security cameras on which they were seen as the units sent to the crime scene allegedly robbed the luxurious shopping center.
Chief of Police David Kimaiyo responded to this with the invitation of two journalists and a leading media representative, even if the invitation was withdrawn after a media riot.
Under the new law, media houses can be filed with a penalty of up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists with up to one million and the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation.
The Tribunal shall also have the right to take possession of the persons concerned if a penalty is not paid.
According to Daily Nation, \"without a single penalty, most radio stations can push into bankruptcy\"
In addition, the newspaper considers that these measures could have a devastating effect on the way they describe Kenya’s “living blogosphere”.
If they broke the media to silence, politicians could do whatever they wanted unpunished.
“No one will ever find out,” wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist in the nation who describes Kenyan media as a crucial control factor in public life.
“Abandoning politicians themselves, they lead the country into bankruptcy and we return to the time of hunters and collectors,” he commented.
In the past, Kenyan legislators have raised public trouble.
In May, they agreed to reverse the cuts ordered by the National Remuneration Commission and re-entered their vast salaries of about 532,000 shillings per month free of tax - they are among the world's highest.
Bad-Dürrheim: A dream will be true for the FC
In spite of the cold weather and the rain, the official inauguration ceremony for the artificial grass sports field was of no importance for the city and football club.
A more pleasant party hour last Saturday probably had all desired, but Peter did not want to join in.
So all those who came without umbrellas or could not keep such ones for any reason.
This was done by the musicians who framed the festival, just like so many speakers.
So Nass also became the FC chairman Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke about the fulfillment of a dream.
His thanks were to all the prominent mayor Walter Klumpp, who was very committed to the implementation of the project, the Council of Municipalities, the participating companies and club members who took part.
This is especially Lothar hero, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The elegant pensioners laid 400 square meters of patch stones for the new roads.
This remarkable honorary commitment was also appreciated by the Landtagman Karl Rombach.
Further greetings were given to the City Sports Committee Hubert Baier, the district president of the South-Bad football association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr from the planning office, who announced a donation for the club's youth department.
Mayor Klumpp recalled that recurring weather-related influences in spring and autumn caused the original lawn site to become so unplayable that it could not be played.
It was 15 years ago that there were the first considerations to solve the problem, when the construction of a third place at the grounds of the football club or at the real school at Salinensee was planned.
Both were rejected again.
Six years ago, thoughts came up to set up an artificial grass sports site, which was generally considered the ultimate solution.
Two years ago, concrete plans were put in place, when the FC took over the cable shop in Erbpacht, committed a cost contribution of 100 000 Euros for the construction of the site, and approved the land funding of 104 000 Euros.
In October 2012, the Municipal Council decided to take over the remaining 356 000 euros to the total cost of 560 000 euros, along with Klumpp.
The construction began on June 4th of the 68-meter artificial grass site.
During the three-month construction phase, 3000 cubic meters of earth were mined, half of which were used for the installation of a Dirt Bike track.
Union and SPD continued their coalition negotiations on the issues of internal and judicial affairs.
The responsible working group met in Berlin in the morning.
Among other things, it is about direct democracy, deputies and the federal police.
In the morning, the Migration and Integration Working Group also wanted to continue its discussions.
Among other things, it should be about dual citizenship in which both sides have opposing views.
The SPD wants to end the obligation for immigrant children born in Germany to decide for one - the Union refuses a double pass.
On the subject of transport, which is not on the meeting order this Friday, the SPD supported its No to a car toll demanded by the CSU.
A vignette was a \"flat rate for multi-drying and thus environmentally counter-productive\" the SPD negotiator for transport, Florian Pronold, explained in a letter to his group.
There was a threat of disembarkation on land roads, which are already causing serious accidents.
The introduction of a toll for all cars would, from the point of view of Pronolds, be just a first step.
“There is a danger that at a later date the compensation will be deleted for Germans,” he said.

Car drivers seriously injured in accident
In an accident on Thursday evening, a 37-year-old truck driver from Aachen was seriously injured.
According to the police, a 41-year-old from Müsch was on her way to Grefrath with her car on the Kempen exterior ring.
When the leftist wanted to turn to St. Töniser Straße, she overlooked the approaching car of the 37-year-old.
The cabs collided.
The Aachenian suffered serious injuries and had to be hospitalized.
Constance: Locking after accident at the shanzle circle
The accident was reported when a 51-year-old driver from a Swiss Seat Ibiza on Thursday evening, at 20 o'clock, drove the left-hand trail of the two-track Reichenaustraße cityway.
Shortly before the roundabout at Schanzle, he noticed that he was on the left-hand side towards Stromeyersdorfstraße and switched to the right-hand trail.
This led to the collision with the BMW, a 23-year-old Konstanzer.
Also damaged was the VW passat of a 19-year-old behind the BMW.
A total of 15000 accidents occurred, and the police told him.
The railway had to be blocked during the accident, it continued.
Vienna Airport Creates Passenger Calls
Mr Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
Such as this will no longer exist at Vienna-Swechat Airport.
A large part of the speaker's throughput falls away - the noise level is to be reduced so clearly.
Creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the goal of this innovation.
As airport spokesman Peter Kleemann announced to Radio Wien, Vienna Airport is following an international trend with the setting up of breakthroughs concerning individuals.
For example, the airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai have already given up the dwindling calls.
Due to the disappearance of these passages - on average, around 200 personal calls by the loudspeakers on one day - it is intended to be quieter at the airport in the future.
\"It has also been shown in the experience that these individual passages were relatively little perceived, but at the same time all the other information about changed flight climbs or departure times are going down a bit here - according to Kleemann in conversation with the radio station.
Highlander-Games on the Kaltenhof
In addition to the brake car train with tractors, there is another competition at the agricultural autumn festival at the Kaltenhof from 6 to 8 September.
On Saturday, September 7, the Highlander Games will start at 13.30 a.m.
Although they have a Scottish tradition, they are swabish in the Kaltenhof.
Teams and individual fighters measure tree trunks, hooves and water buckets in the disciplines.
The tree trunk is four and a half meters long and 25 to 30 kilograms heavy.
“It doesn’t come in the distance,” explains organizer Peter Saile.
The trunk must be discarded vertically, should cross over once and then just come to lie down.
This is assessed with most points.
The target accuracy applies to the hooves.
Eight meters away is thrown onto a pflock.
The participants must demonstrate skill and strength over 50 metres during water immersion.
Time and amount of water in a bottle are measured at the end.
From each clan or team, two may then participate in the single competition.
The winners of the team and individual competition are awarded prizes.
Training can be done from 10 p.m.
A suitable dress is desired, for example, the contestants can join in the Scots Rock.
However, swabian wear is also allowed.
For the “Outfit” the jury will give a few bonus points.
You can log in until one hour before the start of the competition.
With the Scottish-Swiss Highlander-Games and the tractor-pulling, which starts half an hour earlier, a lot of action has been said on the festival grounds on Saturday.
In the evening, the music friends are at their expense.
At 7 p.m., the Biraböhmic Blasmusik from Schömberg designed the big entertainment evening.
The chapel plays quick polkas and fairy tales.
Their repertoire also includes sensitive rollers and a sweet big band sound.
With this, the Heinz Koch, known as singing host and black sausage baron, will be among the rivets for a while.
In Dornhan he has already appeared at the Christmas market and at the fool's tuft.
On Sunday, the Musikverein Leinstetten will be entertained for breakfast, from 2 p.m. on the farmer's chapel Böffingen is a guest, and the \"Oldies\" will make the festival sound.
The Stoppelcker party with DJ Ralf is already open on Friday.
Other programme points include the Oldtimer and Schlepper Meeting on Saturday and Sunday, exhibitions by companies on the subject of agriculture and forestry.
Further attractions on Sunday are the Maislabyrinth, the craftsman's market and the sheep's shear.
Especially for children there is a striker zoo, straw hill castle, tractor riding (under instructions) and tractor surfing.
The organisers are the Förderverein Multipurpose Hall, the Ski Club and the tractor friends “Zündkäpsele”
Milk and egg alternatives at a glance
Vegan diet requires vegetable alternatives to eggs, milk and dairy products.
Purified tofu with plant cream, for example, is a quark substitute.
Further calls the Vegetarian League World Vegan Day on November 1.
On the occasion of the World Vegan Day on 1 November, the Vegetarian Federation of Germany proposes a series of vegan alternatives:
Pure plant margarine is a good alternative to butter, letting yoghurt replace with soya yogurt.
Instead of milk, soy, oat, almond or rice milk can be used.
Canned plant cream replaces conventional slag cream.
There are also herbal alternatives to eggs.
Half a crushed ripe banana, for example, can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
50 grams of apple or a spoonful of floured lentils plus three tablespoons of water are also suitable for this purpose.
Lockers become dough instead of egg for example with a mixture of a teaspoon of baking powder, a spoonful of food starch and three tablespoons of mineral water.
But also 50 grams of soya yogurt or seidentofu can fulfill this purpose.
According to the Vebu, around 800 000 people are currently eating vegans in Germany, i.e. purely vegetable.
Sleepless in New York City
On the way to her host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the students of the Black Forest High School met the American city of New York.
After eight hours of flight, it immediately went to the Brooklyn Bridge, which reached the heart of the city, Manhattan, on foot.
Here was a fascinating view of the world-famous Skyline, which makes a special attraction in the evening light.
The students were on their feet for almost 24 hours due to the shift in time, but were faithful to the motto \"The city doesn't sleep\" the day was decided on Times Square.
Despite Shutdown, on the second day, the statue of freedom could be reached with a ferry and be climbed on foot.
Then it went over the financial center around Wall Street to commemorate September 11.
On the third day, students from the 373-meter-high viewing platform of the Empire-State-Buildings were able to gain an overview of the fascinating large city and enjoy the view.
After that it went through the hectic drive of the New York streets via the Rockefeller Center to Central Park, which offered an ideal opportunity for a short stay in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students have arrived in their host families and are experiencing the school day at Weymouth High School.
This year, on the name day of Saint Hubertus, a Hubertus fair is celebrated in the parish church of St. Mary on Hülsbergstraße.
St. Hubertus was the sage after a rather ruthless hunter, who was converted by a vision and later appointed Bishop of Liège.
The hunting horn blower group of Westphalia's hunting rider under the direction of Brigitte Kluth musics on parforce horns (natural horns in the mood Es) according to old, originally French melodies.
The blowers wear riding clothing because they mainly accompany riders, horses and dog-to-dogs on tug hunts musically.
The festive fair will take place on Sunday, 3 November, at 11.30 p.m.
The newly designed pitch shines with a new cafe.
One that invites you to stay and come back.
One that wants to make the name of the program.
According to Lexicon, Déjà Vu refers to a psychological phenomenon that is expressed in the feeling that a new situation has already been experienced or seen.
In case of visiting the café of the same name at the opslag in the district city of Kleve in sight to the university of Rhein-Waal, it does not have to stay with the pure Déjà Vu feeling.
Finally, the café, with its beautiful name, has the very goal: to make a real stay not only thoughtful, but hand-held always revivible.
Because it's fun and it's just nice.
A look into the interior life at the top 8 gives the viewer a good feeling.
The state-of-the-art, but not cool, café ambiente looks like a place to feel at home.
Here the team with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top spoils the guest with various coffee or cocktail variants.
There are delicious cakes or individually furnished fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, have already made a name for themselves before the opening of the tasty café at the opslag as a gastronome: in Kranenburg they led the “Art Lounge”
From the move to Kleve at the opslag, the sympathetic café lovers expect more audiences.
Not least through the university.
\"Where we have no specific target group, Daniel Büttner emphasises.
Rather, the two young students here want to address the same thing as seniors and all age classes between them.
Appropos café lover.
The sympathetic pair of owners is behind the coffee pleasure.
Enjoy the fragrant hot brew in the various variations themselves.
Expressofan
Daniel Büttner is rather the Expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt the Cappuccino drinker.
“To this a baguette - that is my thing - she betrays the NRZ.
Two events already took place in the bright café.
Better say one.
Because the port festival took place rather outside - the café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it.
But there was also the Ringelnatz evening.
“Beautiful, successful and funny - they found the two 33-year-olds.
But not everyone's thing.
Perhaps Daniel Büttner is not a great fan of event evenings because of this: “You can’t make it all right.
And with an event I always address only those who are interested in the special event.
That's why events will be the exception for us.
“We would like to disturb the very normal operation as little as possible,
To be called: Déjà Vu also stands for reliability.
With regard to the quality of the products offered here, as well as to the team and the beautiful environment at the store in Kleve.
The road that develops more and more into a gastronomy mile.
To the delight of many clubs, the guests from nearby and distant and the students who discover the Gastromeile and thus also the Café Déjà Vu for themselves.

A day of thanksgiving at the MGV in Dinker
It was the 165th Stiftungsfestival to which the MGV-Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker had invited this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives, were happy to come.
In the club's venue of the restaurant \"Witteborg\" in Dinker, all enjoyed the harmonious cooperation entirely in the sign of the music.
Traditionally, the Stiftungsfestival is always the right festivity to make honors.
This time, author Rolf Wagener was delighted with the special award \"Singer of the Year\".
“You have not only written down a lot for us, but have also made some rounds for us, our warm thanks for this, according to the chairman of the choir Erich Schlotmann.
The awards for participating in the performances and choir trials by means of activity bouquets went to the choir manager Dieter Schulze with 44 participants this year, followed by honorary chairman Horst Pier-Ribbert, the chairman himself, and last year's \"singer of the year\" Friedrich Winkler with 42 participants each.
==References====External links==*Official website
A special expression of thanks was addressed to the team of Vereinswirtin Ange Pier-Ribbert, who once again had enchanted a menu of the extra class and to Gerda Pier-Ribbert for table decoration.
The MGV-Friedrich-Wilhelm meets at the club's premises at 7.45 a.m. on his regular choir trials.
“New vocals are welcome to us at any time,” Schlotmann said.
UN announces new targets in combating poverty
The United Nations will begin immediately with the preparation of a series of new objectives to replace the Millennium Development Goals for Poverty Reduction announced 12 years ago.
In the run-up to the UN Sustainable Development Summit, which began in Rio de Janeiro in the evening, Australian diplomats played a key role in the achievement of sustainable development goals to replace the Millennium Goals that expire in 2015.
They were included in the final draft document adopted by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said in the evening at the summit that the time had come to \"think beyond national interests\"
\"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to embark on a process with which universal, sustainable development goals are to be agreed\", he said.
\"These objectives will build on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will not hesitate to implement this mandate given to me by the Member States in order to achieve our vision of sustainable development goals based on the success of the Millennium Goals,
Even though the SG Achim/Baden has been without victory for four days, the handball superligor still has a good mood.
This leaves no doubt about coach Tomasz Malmon.
Everyone is still fully motivated in the matter.
Nevertheless, I hope we finally win again.
“I don’t know how such a victory tastes anymore,” Malmon expects a success experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even though the third-liga reserve from Fredenbeck has not currently destroyed any trees, Malmon is warning the signer in advance.
Many players I have trained myself in the A youth.
Therefore, they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex-coach.
\"The SG-Coach also shows up to see if there is any reinforcement from the first.
In order to finally return to the track of success, the Malmon team must definitely increase in comparison to the previous performances.
Above all things in the cover work and during the shift play it was a huge one.
There is definitely also a need to improve the chance utilization.
So I hope that during the short break, my players will finally get their head free.
Security concerns in Mozambique grow in the face of clashes between influential personalities
Thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputos under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder of the state and first President Mozambique, in order to agree to a rare public demonstration of peace calls.
“We want peace again, we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, Managing Director of an investment company.
Fearing the future of the country, she traded her business clothes against a T-shirt with the title “We demand security” in Portuguese and joined the crowd in the capital’s independence square on Thursday.
For two weeks now, there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, which are among the worst fights since the peace agreement over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, which was initially supported by the white - ruled Rhodesia and later the apartheid government of South Africa in an effort to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the 1992 Peace Treaty, she became an opposition party.
Analysts believe it is unlikely that the country would fall back into a growing conflict, but recent events have alarmed foreign investors and locals.
For the rapidly growing economy, much is at stake, because the discovery of huge gas reserves off the coast and coal deposits in the northwest could bring investments of over $50 billion from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the USA in the coming years.
The ruling Frelimo party, since 1975 the dominant force, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims that the government provoked the recent clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional stronghold Renamos, on 17 October.
The attacks on the former rebels escalated when government forces attacked Renamo support points and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, said Renamos spokesperson to the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to downplay concerns about instability.
In contrast to AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama considered himself a “loser” who wants to use all his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government,
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid war.
But the concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted with the words, Renamo giving rise to the 1992 Peace Agreement.
In contrast to FT, he said that he meant that Frelimo no longer respect the agreement.
“Our vision is to start negotiations again and seriously,” Mazanga said.
Previous discussions between the parties contributed little to the resolution of the tensions which were sparked by a series of clashes this year.
“We have two adult men here (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who meet the heads,” says Joseph Hanlon, lecturer at Open University and Mozambique experts.
None of them are good at negotiating and no one is willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who is pushing for electoral reforms, has already declared that they will boycott municipal elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as the attempt of a crippling movement to effect concessions and financial advantages from the government.
Renamos election success has shrinked since 1992, while a newer party, founded by a former Renamo member, Movimento Democrático de Moçambique (MDM), is likely to improve in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza, whose resignation is imminent when his second term ends next year, wants to destroy the country's democracy.
\"He doesn't want multi-party democracy, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to give up the Presidential Office - Mazanga says.
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has, but she has made rioting attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important north-south connection.
Most of the battles took place in the province of Sofala, which is a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but where Beira is located, the port, mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale are used to export coal.
In June Rio interrupted the use of the railway for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the route.
Mazanga replied reluctantly to the question of whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted \"the international community to warn that things are not good in Mozambique,\" said Mazanga.
Instability has increased frustration over the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many people have already been worried about corruption, the drag-and-run advances in development and a recent wave of abduction.
\"People think that the government and the President are responsible for the future of the country and that he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems, he explains.
Omar Sultane, a demonstrator, said that people just wanted stability.
“No one is interested in Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and useable roads again,” he explained.
Children should be taught myths and legends as “examples for life,” says one author.
Thor’s stories showed that “brutal force has no chance against clever tricks, and the artus legends demonstrate how important it is to have a dream.
Many of the myths were, however, far too wild, too violent and, in some cases, too dirty to be taught in schools, which is why Crossley-Holland advocated a \"careful selection\" of old-fashioned works.
“I find it wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education,” he said.
I've proposed this as a plan for twenty years.
He added that in the case of authors and teachers, who are \"excessively didactic\" children would be \"completely shut off\" because in entertaining stories the messages would be \"severe\".
Crossley-Holland, who has translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and is author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myth and the British Folk Tales, stated: “You can pursue certain intentions, but you should keep them in the background as far as possible,
The perhaps greatest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an author writing for children lies in the need to convey hope.
Not everything needs to be simplified or lead to a happy end, but there is an inhuman sense of good and evil.
This must be shown to be under-smooth, revealed by history and not explained.
That's the old story of showing instead of telling.
Hansjakob moves to Freihof once again
100 years ago, Heinrich Hansjakob moved to Haslach, where on Sunday his last years in the \"Frihof\" became alive.
The many spectators were thrilled by the extremely boring scene play.
From the arrival and the awarding of honorary citizenship to his death, screenwriter and Hansjakobteller Alois Kraftzcyk had designed a entertaining piece that received a lot of applause under the direction of Cornelia Volk.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as a spokesperson through the ten different scenes, explained contexts and bridged time leaps from youth to near retirement.
On October 22, 1913, Hansjakob comes home to his children's sky, to his courtyard.
And then began the scene game, in which Alois Krafczyk shined once more in his parade role as a great son of the city.
Stilecht was introduced by Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach with the two-spanner and \"Schwarzzwalder Füchsen\".
He was not only received by the public with a lot of applause, his sister Philippine also welcomed him.
Billy Sum-Hermann understood it incredibly well to move into the sister's role and gave her an enormous amount of life in mimics and gestures.
The Mühlenbacher Bauernkapelle played appropriately selected pieces of music between the individual playing scenes and finished the performance.
In order to give honor to the bourgeois dignity, Haslag's mayor Heinz Winkler gave himself the honour that he was waiting for in the representation of the then official holder Hättich together with a part of the city council.
Her expectation was then made by the three-king singers, who led Hansjakob to the exclamation: “How beautiful, there will be youth memories of my own three-king time again,
With their song, \"O Jesuslein\", they enjoyed the public in the Freihof as well as the children of Storchentag with their loud \"Out, Out\"
Hansjakob had expressed his criticism of the official church at the time, as did his concerns about the growth of agriculture, the consequences of industrialisation or the effects of the war.
In the home earth, behind his grave chapel on the fire at Hofstetten, he found his resting place.
“A restless spirit had finally found its rest and had gone home forever, it was at the end of the scene game.
Much applause and many praise words were given by the audience for the performance.
Basketball: The Hope of Neckar Giants Grows
The chances for the league stay of the sporty-deceased Ludwigsburger Bundesliga-Basketballers have increased.
Because there should be a wildcard procedure, then there is now a competitor for the Neckar Giants less.
The Hamburg Towers Basketball Project does not apply for a possible return space.
“We’re not going to participate in the Wildcard process,” said ex-national player Pascal Roller, who has been creating the concept for a professional club in Hansestadt since 2012.
A first breathing was not to be heard from Ludwigsburg.
“We didn’t deal with the wildcard process, so long as Düsseldorf doesn’t get a license,” said Neckar-Riesen-Boss Alexander Reil of our newspaper.
Up until 23 May, uplifter Düsseldorf Baskets can still submit documents to the Arbitration Court and prove its economic Bundesliga capability.
Up to now, however, the Rhine countries have been denied the licence twice.
The arbitration court is the last instance.
Haigerloch: Evening meal church gets to the point of view
As a contribution from the city to the 150th anniversary of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch, the city's cultural and tourism office is dedicated to the last of its public tours of this year on Sunday, 27 October, the Memorial Church.
After the visit of the atomic basement museum, the Haigerlochs were to be considered after 1850 when Haigerloch came under Prussian rule.
The coroner's final point is a visit to the church of the evening meal.
There, the leaders are told the story of the construction of the church and gain insights into the development of the evangelical community in a Catholic area through and through.
Last but not least, the church also has a view of the evening painting created by Friedrich Schüz with the support of Walter Kröll and Georg Haltritter.
It is an original faithful reproduction of the famous Milanese model of Leonardo da Vinci.
Meeting point for the other half hour tour is at the Atomkeller Museum at 3 p.m.
Maps are available at the shop of the Atomic Keller Museum.
The tourist office of the city of Haigerloch is available for questions and information.
Snowden could also say in Russia
Former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum.
Representatives of the Federal Attorney General could either ask written questions or personally meet the 30-year-old in Russia.
This was reported by the Interfax Agency, calling for unspecified circles familiar with the situation.
Such a question could be clarified intergovernmental terms, it was said.
Snowden's departure from Russia is practically excluded.
“In this case, he loses his refugee status,” the Agency quoted its source.
Because Germany was an ally of the USA, Snowden threatened delivery there, it continued
Long breath pays off
Six men competed at the tennis tournament of the clubs for the winning title.
In the end, the endurance of the Maier/Bronner team decided the last match.
A dream weather had been given to the tennis department of sports friends Rohrdorf for the tournament of local clubs and friends.
The fun at tennis games was in the foreground of the tournament.
There were five games per team on the plan, each playing against each one.
Played in double mode with a long set up to nine points or a maximum of 45 minutes.
Anja Schlichter leads the tournament
The tournament management was in the proven hands of Anja Schlichter, supported by Carmen Müller and Inga Kronemeyer.
After the first three games and a lunch break with pasta, the tournament went into the crucial phase.
The favorites Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner were the same time with Michael Klippel and Sadmin Osmicic (both teams of the SG Rohrweiler), so the last two matches had to make the decision.
In the event of the victory, Carmen Müller was finally able to hand over the hiking pool to Andre Maier/Mattias Bronner, who had the longest breath on the goal line.
The second place was the double Michael Klippel/Sadmin Osmic.
The bronze staircase reached Rainer and Bernd Maier of the Asphaltriecher team.
At late afternoon suns and coffees and cakes, the tournament's successful sound took place.
At the last weekend of August, the Schwarzwälder Freilichtmuseum Vogtsbauernhof in Gutach near Hornberg is again firmly in children's hands.
Traditionally, the museum welcomes visitors on Saturday and Sunday, 24 and 25 August, as part of the summer holiday program, to a colourful children's and family's celebration with numerous co-operations and events.
“Groß und Klein can learn different old crafts on both days,” says the press release.
Whether making soap, turning candles, felting or making ropes, for every age the matching person is there.
The children are assisted by regional craftsmen from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.
The museum workshop also works.
The young guests can demonstrate their craftsmanship in the construction of cuckoo pipes, waterwheels or circulars.
A lot of fun also promises the many old games, such as pushcar racing or stellar running.
Speed and coordination are required here.
For all small detectives, the Open Light Museum offers a puzzle tour through the museum on Saturday and Sunday, at 12 and 14 o'clock.
On a clandestine journey, the children must guess what stories correspond to the truth or have been lied to.
In addition, visitors have the special opportunity to get to know the open-air museum during a carriage ride with Black Forest foxes.
Not only horses, but also many other animals such as sheep, goats, cows and chickens are to be found and admired on the grounds.
In addition, all children are allowed to look forward to the Clown Otsch on Sunday, who drives his shack from 11 a.m. with the museum guests.
At Hermann Büttner's house, it is pleasant and fairy tale.
The storyteller takes the little guests to the wonderful world of fairy tales at 11, 13 and 15 o'clock.
In addition, the children's day-to-day dance group from Gutach will present traditional dances at 11.30 a.m.
In addition, many artisans such as the Besenbinder, the nearer, the spinner, the weber and the baker can be seen on both days from 11 to 17 o'clock.
Until the end of the summer holidays in Baden-Württemberg, visitors to the Freilichtmuseum expect a varied holiday program.
In a New Zealand small town, Burt Muro is considered to be a lovable causation because he set out to take part in a race in America with his motorcycle, built in 1920.
In spite of a heart failure, Burt is not to take away from his dream.
With his savings, a few donations and a mortgage on his old workshop ships, he transfers to Los Angeles by ship.
After the film there is coffee, tea and cake.
Schrilles Piepsen disturbs residents
Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily on land.
They distribute the coal coming from the ships to the hollow.
The company has several irons in the fire at the location.
In addition to coal imports, Rhenus Midgard relies, among other things, on wind turbine logistics.
Black shimmers the coal on the campground in front of the dike.
Two huge blue halving and recharging equipment distribute or load the coal here as needed.
Every movement of the envelopes sounds a shrill warning noise over the terrain.
“The signals are for security and are required by law,” says Matthias Schrell, Managing Director of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
Unfortunately, in the case of unfavourable wind, this is widely heard - and so there have already been some complaints from people from the city order.
He took the complaints very seriously and therefore contacted the persons concerned, says the 40-year-old.
In close consultation with the authorities, it was now necessary to keep the warning signals with technical measures quieter.
In the future, he will also put on open dialogue with the neighbours.
Matthias Schrell has a few more things in front of the site.
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony Bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to rely on coal imports for power plants and is one of the largest in Europe in this sector.
Thanks to the 18th-meter-lined canvas form terminal, capesize bulkcarriers can be finished here for a long time.
“This year we want to crack the 3-million-ton brand at the time of transhipment,” Schrell said.
In addition to the local Eon power plant, the import coal goes to power plants in the interior.
If the GDF Suez power plant goes to the net, then 5 million tons of coal imports per year are realistic.
The three shiploaders on the bridge as well as the second conveyor belt could create up to 10 million.
Bayerns Basketballer despite first defeat optimistic
Even the first defeat in Euroleague was not able to mask the huge optimism of FC Bayern Munich's basketball players.
“No one can forbid us from even winning against the best team in Europe in the past two years - balanced Bayern-Coach Svetislav Pesic after the unfortunate 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday evening with title defenders Olympiakos Piraeus.
We sent the message: Basketball also exists in Munich!
During their first third appearance in the European king class, the Munichers sold very well for a long time, but were simply not clear enough in the crucial phases.
The guests first created the piece of art to convert a 15-point stand 13 minutes before the end into a tour before Piraeus gave another turn to the game.
“We’ve been incredibly fighting back against the two-time Euroleague Champion, but we’ve made easy mistakes again,” said Bayern-Profi Yassin Idbihi.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful throwers of the Munichers who had celebrated clear victories in the first two games against the Italian serial champion Montepaschi Siena and the Polish title winner Zielona Góra.
Ben Greenman: Ten Years New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It could be said that New York City is the birthplace of Stand-up Comedy in America: Almost a hundred years ago, Varietekünstler Frank Fay, who worked as a conferenceer at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell the crowd of jokes in the form of a conversation.
During the years Fays innovation was expanded, as was the latest at the New York Comedy Festival.
Launched and led by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the booth-up-Institution Carolines, this year the festival celebrates its 10th anniversary with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theaters.
“Most of these headliners started at Carolines and then became more and more successful until they were at some point too well known to join a club,” said Hirsch.
We designed this festival so that we can continue working with them.
At this year's event there are performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as by Stand Up for Heroes, an annual music and comedy event for army veterans at Madison Square Garden, which includes Bruce Springstein, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
With the festival also the world of comedy has grown.
A number of comedians participating in the festival this year have become known in rather unconventional ways, such as broadcasts on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll became famous with a sitcom on cable television (the ironic and sloppy fantasy football series \"The League\" on FXX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the occupation both at Saturday Night Live and at Parks and Recreation, although she is best known for her viral video series \"Marcel the Shell with Shoes On\".
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic, focused on racial issues W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
Among the festival's largest magnets is an interview: David Steinberg speaks to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but has developed into a respected television and film director as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he staged a television broadcast entitled \"Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg\" at TV Land.
The meeting takes place in the centre of Manhattan in the middle of the Town Hall.
“The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry’s entire work,” Steinberg said.
He told me when he's here, he sometimes goes through the streets between two buildings and thinks, \"Hey, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll live here.
Iran satisfied with the process of nuclear negotiations
Iran is satisfied with the negotiation process one week before the next nuclear meeting with the five UN-Vetomachten and Germany.
“After years, we now have an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Authority to resolve the differences in the last few years,” Foreign Minister Mohammed Jsawad Sarif wrote on his Facebook page.
It would still be a long way, but the nuclear chief negotiators are satisfied with the negotiation process and also optimistic that in the end both sides will come to a solution.
Drama in Uruguay: Killing boys' chambers with machete
Two children have committed the murder of an 11-year-old in Uruguay.
The two 14 and 12-year-old boys had invited their victims to go on bird hunting with them.
With machetes and knives, on Tuesday, the 11-year-old took the body to a fountain, reported the newspaper \"El País\" on Thursday.
They would then have played football in front of their apartments in a working district.
The body was found on the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometers north of the exclusive beach town Punta del Este.
As an alibi, a five - year - old half sister of the disciple she had taken should testify that she had been sexually assaulted by the boy.
But when the girl described the Tathergang before the police without mentioning an attack against her, the two boys admitted the intentional killing of the 11-year-old.
As a reason, among other things, the elder called a rivalry in the football game.
He was temporarily transferred to a psychiatric youth institution.
Keeper must go to prison
Because of exploitative trafficking in human beings, custody, threat, insult and dangerous bodily injury, the Landgericht Constance sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years of imprisonment.
The former Bundeswehr soldier, who worked as a doorpost after two operations in Afghanistan, made a confession within the framework of a trial agreement.
He then met women in five cases via Internet or telephone contacts, which he sent on the line after a few weeks against their will.
He used force and threats to break resistance.
He retained the income of the women who had been working for him for some years.
By confiscating cell phones and SIM cards, he has made contacts with women to the outside world.
Together with a colleague who taught women, he brought them to various brothels in the southwest.
There, he had her partly monitored to control her revenue.
In court, the accused first claimed that he suffered from a severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan had died alongside him in an explosion.
After a psychiatric expert expressed great doubts about the psychological restriction and thus a limited debt, the 33-year-old made a comprehensive confession.
The court no longer had to hear any of the injured women.
As reported by a cripo official, at least four other cases of exploitative trafficking in human beings were identified after a first display by telephone surveillance measures.
The ensuing talks had been characterized by high aggression.
In later discussions, the injured confirmed their martyrdom.
Another witness, in which one of the women had discovered blue spots all over the body, made no statement to this day.
It dealt with “a completely broken personality,” the violence and exploitation in this meter as normal.
The defendant regretted his behavior yesterday.
“He resolved out of these circles and wanted to live a very normal life after his imprisonment,” he said.
Oil price continues up to 96 USD per barrel
The price of oil continued to fall on Friday, after concerns over a high supply overestimated a report, according to which the energy-rich manufacturing sector of China is growing.
The reference crude oil varieties for deliveries in December had fallen by 14 cents in electronic commerce at the New York Mercantile Exchange in late morning to 96.24 USD per barrel.
The contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a price drop of 5.8 percent in October.
The great supply of crude oil has taxed prices over the past few weeks.
The United States Department of Energy said on Wednesday that the US offer has increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over the course of five weeks, the offer had risen by 25 million barrels.
But on Friday there were indications of increased demand through two reports of an activity growth in Chinese manufacturing.
This indicates a continued recovery in China's economy, whose growth had increased to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after it had reached the lowest level for two decades in the previous quarter.
Crude oil from Brent, a reference value for international crude oil, also used by U.S. refineries, fell at the ICE Exchange in London by 26 cents to 108.58 USD per barrel.
Court Blocked Decision on the NYPD Stop-and-Frisk Directive
On Thursday, a federal court in the United States blocked the order of a judge who had requested changes to the Stop-and-Frisk Program (“Anhalt and Search - by the New York Police Department) and dismissed the judge from the case.
The 2nd U.S. Court of Appeal declared that the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin would be suspended until the city had been called.
The judge had ruled in August that the city violated the Constitution with the way the program for the arrest and interrogation of persons was implemented.
The City filed an appeal against its assessment and the planned remedial measures, including the decision to set up a supervisory body to assist the police in amending its Directive and the relevant training programme.
On Tuesday the Court of Appeal heard the arguments for the suspension requested.
The appeal report stated that the judge had to be excused from the case because they violated the Code of Conduct for U.S. judges by stating that a judge should avoid the appearance of partyhood; this was partly grounded with a series of media interviews and public statements in which she had responded publicly to the criticism of the court.
The judge had judged that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people, because they in an inappropriate way targeted black and Latin American men with the stop-and-frisk program into the visor.
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of substantial changes, including reforms in guidelines, training and service supervision, and appointed a pilot programme with cameras carried on the body in quarters where most of the checks were carried out.
In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of storing names and addresses of people who were released after a police control.
An oral trial for the vocation of the city is planned after 14 March 2014.
The stop-and-frisk tactics have been criticized by a number of civil rights advocates.
Controls of this species have been in different forms for decades, but the number of checks recorded during the term of office of the partyless mayor Michael Bloomberg increased to an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011, most of which were black and Latin American men.
In 2004, four men belonging to all minorities filed a complaint that developed into a collective complaint.
Proponents of changes to NYPD's stop-and-frisk program say that the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and effective police force and influence the way other police presidents use the regulation.
Opponents believe that the changes would dampen the morale of the police, but not the crime; also would waste money and not solve the wider problem of a police force that has been under pressure after the removal of thousands of places in the last decade.
The judge pointed out that it did not end the stop-and-frisk practice, which was constitutional, but only reformed the way the controls were implemented by the NYPD.
The happiness of the dreaming camels
Happiness is an oasis that succeeds only dreaming camels
The first president Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the association’s “Helping Hands” with this Bedouin identity.
On Saturday afternoon the tenth birthday of the club was celebrated, which can already show considerable success.
The first president of Henne reported in detail on the work of the association.
He was himself the first time in 2004 in Mauritania at the Cheijk-Zajed Hospital in Nouakchott.
As a result, further cooperation developed, and the gynecologist Henne performed numerous operations on site on several trips.
During the speeches, pictures of the inserts were shown on a large screen, so that guests of the anniversary event could take a picture of the actions mentioned.
The club's desert vehicle was also shown.
This is a former Federal Border Protection Vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former OB of Nagold, had proposed to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and now, according to Henne, plans to work at the association in advisory function.
In 2008, the Zimmerei Schleeh from Baiersbronn created the health station in Socogim, a wretched quarter on the outskirts of the capital in the record time of almost a week.
Henne also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouakchott
Especially interesting in times when the birth clinic is to be abandoned in Nagold.
One learns a lot in Africa as a physician, henne, for example, deceleration against burn-out.
Due to the political unrest in the country, it was not possible to travel as much as planned, but many physicians came to Germany to hospital in different areas.
In addition, containers are regularly shipped to Africa with materials, such as medical equipment, medicines, compound materials, hospital beds and glasses in March this year.
Co-initiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself provided a rich local colourit by telling Mauritania about Mercedes vehicles converted to the mobile brick stand and by describing the experiences of the Stammheimer musicians who traditionally support the association during their Mauritanian journey.
As his personal motivations, he called his work in the field of auditing as a young Member.
When he realized how much money was lost on the road, he decided to help Africans control a budget by the people.
In addition, Fuchtel stressed that global economy also requires global human love.
Nor should it be forgotten that Africa is closer than some think.
From Gran Canaria it was not far to Africa.
Coulson used phone hacking for checking a tip
The previous news of the Word editor Andy Coulson alleged that in an attempt to confirm a false tip on an affair by the then Secretary of the Interior Charles Clarke, phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
Attorney Andrew Edis QC told the court in Old Bailey that in May 2005 News of the World heard a false rumor that Clarke had a relationship with his attractive special advisor Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper ordered Private Detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlby's voicemails, and chased them, but Coulson also called them and left news as the court learned.
“In the public prosecutor’s opinion, Coulson, who is now the editor of the emergencyW, is no one who stands in front of people’s homes and hopes to catch them on fresh ground, but one who likes to confront people with a story to see their reaction,” Edis explained.
He said that NotW uses three methods to investigate stories: phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The publisher is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously he knows about the second, the surveillance, otherwise it cannot be.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He disagrees, but we say: \"And whether he knew of it\"
Rumors about a Clarkes affair were first taken up by the feature editor of NotW when a source who was sexually interested in Pawlby was said: “Don’t waste your time, she is with Charles,
A band with voicemails from their phone of at least three occasions was secured in Mulcaire's apartment in August 2006.
The investigators also found entries on the detective's computer, on which Pawlby and her sister were stored as projects.
During the time that the research ran, the grandparents received anonymous calls from Pawlby, in which they were asked for information about them, explained Edis.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup supervised Pawlby's movements.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail with the following content: “I have a story that we want to bring out tomorrow, about which I would like to talk to Charles,
Edis explained that Coulson's activities in this story followed the same pattern as other important personalities, such as former Minister of the Interior David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had confronted Blunkett for an affair with a married woman when he himself was lied to the co-indictor Rebekah Brooks, who had been married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks argued to have sworn with others to hack telephones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted the phone hacking.
From protesting against the planned wealth tax, French football will actually go through the first strike since 1972.
A meeting is concluded without results.
In the conflict around wealth tax, the government and professional football in France have maneuvered into a deadlock after a failed battle meeting.
President François Hollande received his lawsuits on Thursday at the Paris Élysée-Palast Association and Association Representative.
However, he refused to replace the football with the planned 75-percent tax on income of more than one million euros a year, which all companies in the country will pay for two years from 2014.
The opposite also remained hard.
The strike announced for the end of November will now also be carried out, the chief association of professional clubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel.
The days of play in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 between 29 November and 2 December are thus out of date.
Gingingen: No absolute protection possible
\"We want to involve the inhabitants in planning early on - Mayor Jens Hüßler opened the citizens' information event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
Around 80 participants had come to the municipal hall to explain the planned measures, to ask questions, to express concerns and to introduce ideas.
Hüßler made it clear: \"The final decisions are taken by the members of the Council of Commons,
The flood that Gechingen met unprepared on 15 May 2009 had been a decisive event that raised the question of protection for the future, says Hoüsler.
A river area survey had been commissioned with the neighbouring municipality of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
“The objective is to protect as many built-in land as possible,” says Hoüßler.
It is based on planning the protection against an expected flood every 100 years according to the German Weather Service.
The climate change is taken into account by a 15-percent supplement.
This is referred to as \"HQ 100aClimate\" in specialist circles.
The water masses, which led to considerable damage in Gechingen in 2009, corresponded to a 1000-year flood.
“There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement, as the locals say.
In order to achieve the protection of HQ 100aClimate, around four million euros must be invested in Gechingen, while the municipality can expect land grants of around 70 percent.
However, Hußler pointed out that support was only provided when an overall concept was implemented.
To this end, the community is dependent on the participation of the citizens.
An elaborate planning and approval procedure had to be completed.
In the best case, the implementation could begin in 2016.
Among other things, the protection concept presented in the Municipal Council last week (we reported) includes local measures in the influx of the Irm River from the Stammheimer Valley.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, participants took advantage of the opportunity to submit their requests.
Among other things, it was questioned why dams and back basins were no longer planned to protect the place.
Gregor Kühn, specialist planner of the commissioned Wald Engineering Bureau and Corbe from Hügsheim, who presented the concept, stressed that it required the interaction of all the measures presented to achieve the desired goal in the sum.
In addition, the most economical solution was to find, according to Joachim Wald von Wald and Corbe.
There was a lack of courage in the old town's inhabitants, who suffered from the overloading of the canal network even in the case of normal thunderstorms.
The problem is known to the administration and the first measures have already been taken.
However, Hausler pointed out that the guidelines for sewer systems were different than for flood protection and that they should not be mixed.
The municipality was obliged to interpret the canal network in such a way that two to three years of rain events could be taken away.
The wastewater channels would be larger to dimensionalize, and millions would disappear.
Severe injuries after collision
In the early Friday afternoon two drivers were seriously injured on Landesstraße 44 near Revensdorf during a frontal collision.
The police immediately locked the road completely, but could not say anything at first.
However, there are several witnesses who should be evaluated first.
The 19-year-old Lenkerin of a VW golfed towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf met her with his Hyundai.
Both vehicles roared together, with the woman being so severely clogged that the firepower needed almost half an hour to free her from the vehicle wreck.
The real cause of the accident remained unexplained at first.
Both of them were injured in nearby hospitals.
The route remained completely blocked for about two hours.
One could call him the Dostoyewski of the USA.
Philip K. Dick was a God-searcher, a metaphysicist, his novels and stories also have something serial.
Amazingly the relationship in the outside: the stinging eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And as Fjodor M. Dostoyewski, with his massive oeuvre, is to be understood as the founder and apologet of the Russian soul, Philip K. Dick is to be read as an American prophet, who is quite something in his own country.
Some titles have been published in Heyne Verlag, the Haffmans-Kassette with the 118 narrations distributes two thousand.
Dick explains America - the realm of breathtaking technical progress, paired with paranoia, security walls and the belief of being selected.
Dick had God's experiences, his late books read like a mixture of John's revelation and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy, had drugs attached to his brain.
He's caught, early on, that the computers are divinities.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what distinguishes a human from a machine, the Creator from his creation.
This is the Blade Runner problem.
Killing.
A Master of Science Fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories inspired film directors such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is now particularly significant.
The \"Minderity Report\" dates back to 1956, it sheds the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribune.
The principle of pre-crime is developed here, pre-crime, so what is now more or less official doctrine of the White House.
In Dick's world, which resembles our frightening, mutants look into the future - and the police are grasping.
“We capture individuals who have not violated any law,” says the head of the Authority.
“We’ll catch them before they can commit a violent crime,”
And: “There are no serious criminals in our society, we have a penitentiary full of pesudoverbreakers for this, they read time streams.
They assume that evil is happening, and prevent criminal thought from being put into action.
Dick's story acts like the blue break for the anti-terror laws and the NSA's hearing noise.
Anticipation of the attack: This is how Obama's drone philosophy and practice also works.
But Dick's story is not over yet.
The chief of police complains that there is no more violence, the military controls the daily life - and what is left of the state.
Then the guard himself is monitored and a future crime is committed.
The system is moving.
It's perfect, but it's lying.
It invents its own requirements.
Not only do mistakes and sacrifices take place, but they are built upon them.
The system creates the danger it is fighting.
Reading Philip K. Dick means getting closer and closer to the truth.
Spears about Merkel in Russia
Former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the U.S. department of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Representatives of the German Federal Attorneyry could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old personally in Russia, the agency Interfax reported.
Previously, the Grünen-Bundestag deputy Hans-Christian Ströbele had met as the first German politician Snowden in Moscow yesterday in order to talk to him about the affair.
NSA disclosures reinforce company paranoia due to state surveillance
On a mild day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew deep over the US consulate in Frankfurt am Main, Germany's financial capital.
At the direction of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection and Anti-Terrorism (BVT), the German Home Security Service, he should photograph the roof of the U.S. Outpost, less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
According to German media, the BVT wanted to demonstrate the presence of surveillance antennas and the action led to a change of words between the USA and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Clapper, U.S. Director of National Intelligence, once again insisted in September that the US did not use opportunities for foreign espionage to steal the business secrets of foreign companies on behalf of U.S. companies so that they could expand their international competitiveness or their profits,
But since Edward Snowden, who became a whistleblower, started publishing his full horn to U.S. surveillance secrets, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure that they can speak to the director.
Reports that the US National Security Agency has been spying on the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and has acquired data from American cloud providers including Google and Yahoo have brought the company paranoia to a new peak due to state surveillance.
The face to overflow brought the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been incarcerated, possibly for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can get into the visor, then, with certainty, corporate managements are also potential targets.
Snowden has made the intensive cooperation between U.S. secret services and companies transparent.
I think it is conceivable that these data will be used for mutual benefit.
“Germany needs to wake up,” explains Oliver Green, President of BITMi, representing small and medium-sized IT firms in Germany.
German companies believe that the US posed almost as great a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, such a survey published in July by the consulting firm EY.
However, in the documents submitted by Snowden, there has been no evidence that the US has passed on the business secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacks certain IT and Internet capabilities and should reduce its dependence on the US.
The companies are skeptical about this.
In the Bundestag it was suggested that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open her up ...
“That’s not how it works,” says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If you had wanted a strong European IT industry, you would not have let it die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal to cars to agriculture.
Everything, up to the IT industry.
Nevertheless, the range and technical refinements of the US spy authorities discovered by the Snowden revelations shocked companies who had previously seen the greatest spying risk in China.
Cloud computing is undergoing a major change because European business leaders are now more aware that data stored in the US is subject to legal case law and is therefore potentially at risk.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trading institution, according to the disclosures about US data mining activities with Prism about ten percent of the non-U.S. members planned to use an American provider.
Jim Snabe, deputy managing director of SAP, says: “We see a new question from customers that didn’t exist a year ago - it says: Where are my data stored and can you guarantee that these will remain physically in this legal space,”
Many German business leaders believe that the recent reports simply confirm what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and therefore have to be guarded at any price.
The fact that economic espionage is taking place is no surprise.
It's always been like that.
“It has been a topic for many years and has not changed fundamentally through the current discussion,” says Kurt Bock, chairman of the chemical company BASF.
Americans spy on us at a commercial and industrial level, as we do, because it is in the national interest to defend our companies.
The management does not usually boast about the countermeasures that have been taken, because this provides attackers with advantages.
In large companies, employees have long been bled that taking a free USB stick at a fair or the unguarded leaving of a laptop in the hotel room is not advisable, said linde.
Ulrich Hackenberk, member of the board of automakers Audi, says that it has been standard practice for years to collect the phones before a board meeting so that they cannot be used as hearing aids.
The German BVT advises executives to use simple prepaid phones when traveling abroad, because smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid phones are thrown away afterwards.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in the respective niches.
“Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets from unauthorized access,” warns the BAT in a report.
The United States warned its own companies against economic espionage by other countries.
According to Washington Post, in February France, Russia and Israel were placed behind China in the U.S. National Intelligence Estimate to rank two of the countries that served to obtain economic data from the hacking.
A board member of a German blue chip company agreed when it comes to business espionage, then \"the French are the worst\"
Bernard Squarcini, former director of the French Internal Security Service DCRL, was quoted this month in an interview with the following words: “The intelligence services know very well that all countries, even when working together in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies,
Hechingen: Messe gives answer to wedding questions
“Marry is the most important journey of discovery that man can make,” said the philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
Tips, as at least the wedding celebration succeeds, now gave a special trade fair in the domain in Hechingen.
Important providers were represented around a wedding.
A trend: The retro look has kept coming in again.
This starts with the wedding dresses.
White is must, best covered or in cream.
On the front are the multiple ruffled and embroidered clothes closed, often with a veil, on the back they go down the back and often end in a slut.
However, the spirits separate, as Stefanie Koch emphasizes from the fashion house Kleidermüller.
In men, the suit dominates with West and Plastron, but cream-colored or brown combinations can also be chosen.
The choice of the local area was explained.
Jewelry-free side rooms are not optimal, the ambiance should be special.
Here the domain drew attention to its own offer in the remedy.
If you want to go ahead with the carriage, Uwe Link has an offer.
“But kisses are also popular for young girls’ farewells,” he says.
Romanticism is also required for invitation cards, flower arrangements and wedding images.
More and more fashion comes the after-wedding photo - so series of recordings in special places, preferably waterfalls, a few days after the feast, but in wedding dress, Elisabeth Keidel explained.
Many more details of a successful wedding were presented on Sunday in the domain.
Flower arrangement, rings, wedding table, cakes and also a magician, such as Marko Ripperger, who can quietly entertain guests.
Don't forget the right cosmetics and nail care.
Everything for an unforgettable feast.
Dog Friends Successful
For the repeated time, the athletes of the dog friends Bitz were successful on a rally-obedience tournament.
Achim Scherrenbacher started in Kandel with two dogs; with his bitch Sandy he scored 94 points in the class Beginner and secured the fifth place, and with the 15-month-old Marley he brought it with 87 points in place twelve.
With her Woody in Class 1, Susi Höppen presented himself with critical views of the performance controller.
Parents of a Georgia teen who died in a tragic accident believe in murder
The parents of the teenager, whose body was found in a rolled-up ring mat in the gymnasium of his high school, are convinced that her son was murdered, explained the lawyer of the family on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in the U.S. state of Georgia was found on January 11 in an upright mat behind the tribune in the school gym.
The investigation officers of the Sheriff of Lowdes County concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, which the family of the 17-year-old doubted.
“They are convinced that her son was murdered,” said Benjamin Crump, lawyer of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, to FoxNews.com.
You never believed he died the way the sheriff did.
“They believe that every logic should be denied, in violation of the laws of physics, as well as of the common sense of human beings,” Crump said.
Rather, they are convinced that the truth will be obscured in order to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
“Your son went to school to learn and returned in the body bag,” he comments.
US prosecutor Michael Moore said on Thursday there will be a formal investigation into Johnson's death, as a number of important issues are still unexplained.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death due to a crime?
That is what Moore said at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts in which direction they also lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
“I believe that there is a sufficient basis for formal investigation,” he said.
Moore explained to reporters that the initial autopsy indicated that Johnson had died from the consequences of “position-related suffocation”.
However, a second autopsy caused another cause of death, says Moore.
“There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed,” he said.
Moore added that if there was sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil law investigation into Johnson's death, he would commission the FBI to carry out the investigation.
A representative of the County Sheriff's authority was not immediately ready for a comment on our request on Thursday.
A court in southern Georgia ruled on Wednesday that the authorities must release all surveillance videos that the investigators have reviewed.
The teenage parents said they hoped that the video recordings contained clues as to how he died.
Publishing CDC Allergy Guidelines for Schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a series of guidelines for dealing with food allergies of children at schools.
These are the first such directives issued by the U.S. government, as the number of children subject to education increases with food allergies.
One of 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy.
According to CDC, the spread of food allergies among children has increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines provide information for schools to raise awareness of food allergies in the body and staff and how children are to be treated that show allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have epinephrine in stock - the most commonly used auto-injection of the brand EpiPen - in order to encounter a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction.
The legislators in the states have recently changed the rules so that schools can keep epinephrine more easily available.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms mentioned by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, “It feels like something is pressing my tongue,” “My tongue feels like a hair is on it, or ‘My tongue is tingling’
Parents of intersexual children can choose gender indeterminately
Germany is the first European nation in which a third generation is recognized for children born with indisputable genitals.
Newborns are no longer assigned to male or female star.
According to the new law, parents no longer have to explain sex for such children, but can indicate \"undetermined\" or \"unspecified\" on the birth certificate.
The purpose of the law is to take the pressure of parents so that they do not have to make over-exposure decisions regarding surgery for sex allocation in newborns, and to combat the discrimination of intersexual people.
According to BBC years later, an intersexual person said: “I am neither husband nor wife ”
I'll stay the flickwork created by doctors mutilated and full of scars.
It is estimated that one of 2,000 children does not come to the world as a boy or a girl each year.
They are among the intersexuals, a group that fall under the diagnosis of sexual differentiation disorder (DSD), a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, germ-drying (iron-drying or testicles) or unusually developed genitals.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersexual.
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the United States recommend that you use the best available information for gender allocation, if a determination is not possible, and do not wait for the child's psychological and physical development before deciding, if at all, for surgery.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in the problem of gender identification, said that the new German law \"clings after a good thing\"
Intersexual children represent an ethical dilemma.
“Some people have life - threatening diseases that require surgery, but for most children this does not apply,” he said.
One could make a sexual assignment without surgery and then wait for the identity to develop.
The scientific data on how a child develops his gender identity is not very accurate.
No one knows why it happens.
It's like the secret of why people are gay.
In a 2011 report to the European Commission, it says that intersexuals are to be distinguished from transsexual or transgender persons, because their status is not gendered, but due to their biological constitution, which is neither male nor female, but typically both simultaneously or not clearly defined as one of them.
These characteristics were shown in subordinate sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature, prior sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals or in chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also gives an overview of the discrimination that intersexual and transgender individuals face in their working lives and of the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice crime.
Not consistent with the gender picture boys now have a special camp.
It is now possible for adults in Australia and Nepal to indicate male, female or third gender on official documents.
In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as the world's first sexless person, after a court granted the lifelong maintenance of an unspecified sex status.
In addition to M and W, German IDs have a third assignment in the future, X for intersexual, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news report on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French Members of the strict Catholic country signed a petition that the \"Gender Theory\" should be removed from schoolbooks.
The U.S. website Catholic Online has also opposed the German law, reasoning: \"If the world is torn into a new state where sex is a decision, but not sexual activity, then we twist two more pillars of civilization \"
The mother of a newborn from Maryland explained to baby zone that it would be better if babies were assigned a sex at birth.
“Parentity is already stressful enough without any further restrictions, especially if you don’t know the sex of your own child,” she said to the parents website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born with both male and female genders were called hermaphrodites, according to the attractive Greek god, who had both sexes.
Ten years ago, medicine viewed gender as something that one could erase and then rebuild.
But in the meantime, the ethical foundations of surgery are doubted after being known how complex the gender identity is, and that doctors can also lie wrong because they do not know how the child feels when growing up with the sex assigned by them.
“In the mid-20th century it was called a ‘psychiatric emergency’ - said Drescher.
If such a child was born, then one called not the psychiatrist, but the surgeon.
The ruling theory of the treatment of children with indisputable genitals goes back to Dr. John Money from Johns Hopkins University, who believed that gender is formable.
He coined the term \"sexual identity\" and argued, social and environmental abuses, as parents raised a child, interacted with the genes and hormones of a child, and characterized a person as either male or female.
But in a 1966 case known as John/Joan, his theories became controversial.
He told the parents of a boy whose penis had been separated in the case of a prickly circumcision, to completely castrate the child and also remove his testicles and then raise him as a girl.
“Money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation, which he was not,” Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15, he moved back to the male gender and married a woman.
But at 38 he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these sexual operations came to the public, which are “not happy with the result. ”
For example, Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes, but has two significant genitals.
The doctors were not aware of whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a \"satisfied life\" as a man.
So his external organ and the testes were surgically removed shortly after the birth in 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, he received female hormones.
“I knew I wasn’t a girl,” he said to ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he was to receive a vaginal plastic.
But since he was depressed and knew that something was wrong, he demanded his medical records.
What he found out was shocking.
I was sterilized at my birth - and nobody ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD through which his body could not produce enough testosterone to develop the genitals.
After learning the truth, he changed to male identity, received testosterone injections, and removed his breasts.
It has become infertile through the operation.
Today, he fights for others in an organization called Interface Project for intersexual people to be perceived as normal.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, Managing Director of the California-based Legal Group Advocates for Informed Choice, takes care that the German law can encourage \"to stamp and stigmatize\".
“Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and assign a ‘unspecified’ to the child,” she explained.
We fear that favors intervention.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait.
But yet we do not know how the law will affect us, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports the Australian law, because \"adults allow recognition as a third sex\"
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex,” she said.
The German law deals with the assignment at birth.
This is not a fight to force little children to do at that time.
When they are grown, they can decide on their own body.
However, Dr. Arlene Baratz, a breast radiologist from Pittsburgh, who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says that the German law \"authorizes\" both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgen resistance.
Because of the receptor defect of target cells for testosterone, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Today Katie is 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as an employee in child psychiatry.
Although she is barren, she hopes to be able to have a child through adoption or a limb.
“The law gives parents space, so they don’t have to make overt decisions,” Baratz said.
It gives them time to do different tests and to clarify things and so gives them time before they write \"male\" or \"female\".
In this way everything is fine - you raise the child and love it.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the parental happiness.
And you don't have to rush an operation that can't be reversed anymore.
“This includes the children’s decision and eliminates the fear that their parents are driving because they think they would not do the right thing,” she explained.
Finally, the child decides on the sex that is better suited to him, and that is wonderful.
This enables children to make the decision themselves.
Unknown injured girl by shot from car
Unknowns have injured a twelve-year-old in Saxony-Anhalt when shooting a car.
On Thursday evening in Genthin, the perpetrators probably fired an air pressure weapon at a group of children.
That was what the police in Burg told me.
The girl was easily injured at the left Wade.
Rescue forces took the girl to the hospital.
The shot came from a small car that had passed by a group of six children and had suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The perpetrators also shot at a bus stop.
A disc broke.
Then they drove away from it.
The criminal police found out it was on Friday.
Until now, police inspection can look back at Kempten on a quiet Halloween night.
The officials were only called twice to evict children who threw them against house facades.
Since the homeowners recognized this in time and removed the egg remains the same, no damage should have occurred either.
In addition, some sylves were burned in the city area, but there was no damage to the property.
A resident in the Bishop-Freundorfer-Weg reported that his car had been wrapped up with clay paper and his bicycle blinds had been removed.
Until the arrival of the police, however, the man found out all his bicycle blinds in the immediate vicinity, which is why the police did not have to continue to operate.
Living with a future perspective
In fact, Waltraud Ries lives dreamily.
Her house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with lots of greenery, an old tree, nice neighbours and also not too much traffic.
In the city there are only a few minutes of public transport.
“Hopefully they don’t fear spiders,” Waltraud asks Ries and points to a fat spider on the door frame.
I've been looking for a new apartment for my husband and me for some time.
But you know how difficult this is in Stuttgart.
However, the reason is not a spider phobia, but the concern of not being able to cope with the many steps to the house and in the apartment at an old age, she explains.
In addition: Since a meniscus operation, the mid-fifty woman has had to learn what it means to move from floor to floor with disability.
Only recently has a book been published by her on the subject 'Happy living in the age - Which living form is the best for me?'.
'Our apartment is the best example of what is not going on in old age,' she begins to tell.
When she moved into the Maisonette apartment more than 20 years ago with her husband, it was just a beautiful apartment in the middle of the greenery.
Today, in the middle of fifty, Waltraud Ries thinks differently about it.
However, she also knows that she is one of the few people who are actually dealing with the subject of 'living in old age'.
Most push it as long as it goes.
Only the others are getting old,' she says smilingly.
It is only when the pressure of suffering is really great that thoughts are made.
'Then it may be too late,' said Ries.
In her book, the interior architect presents 17 residential models for a self-determined living in the old age.
'What kind of living you choose, however, is always an individual decision,' she explains.
D i e solution does not exist for age.
Even those who could afford the retirement seat in Tuscany or Britain should always consider being able to get sick.
And: 'Without good knowledge of the national language, one also in Dolce Vita,' the specialist book author gives permission to consider settlement.
Among their models are classic care models, alternative residential forms or the often cited pensioner WG.
At age, everyone has his ticks and Macken
'For me, such a community would be nothing,' she means with an eyebrow.
Not as in a student WG with a shared bathroom and a kitchen.
'In old age, you just need its retreat rooms', says Ries.
However, the book author does not want to exclude that of a senior resident community.
But that would have to be different from the classic student WG.
And sometimes you just want his rest, too, she thinks.
With that in mind, at least in the capital, it is not alone.
'Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own home as long as possible,' is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of civil service life at the age of the state capital.
Your department advises people around the topic of getting older.
That is why older people would often also buy inconveniences and restrictions just to stay in their usual surroundings, which is also the experience of the Stiftung Warentest.
Today, there are many opportunities to make the house or apartment barrier-free.
Ries recommends that all those dealing with the age-appropriate reconstruction of their home or home to inform themselves thoroughly and not to instruct the first craftsman.
Today there are also specialists for age-related reconstruction.
Even in the rental apartment, this can be realized, and if it's just the toilet seat raise, the interior architect clears up.
But not always can the existing apartment be transformed old-fashioned and therefore barrier-free, even if it is still so beautiful.
This experience had to make Waltraud Ries.
Although one could install a staircase within the apartment, the road also paved with stairs to the door of the apartment would be the far greater obstacle.
She will continue to search until she has found the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before moving, she digs more than before the spider at her door.
USA wants to continue pursuing Snowden criminal law
The US has not changed its attitude toward former U.S. intelligence employee Edward Snowden.
He will continue to be accused of passing on unauthorised secret information.
Therefore, he had to commit criminal proceedings in the US, said the U.S. Foreign Ministry spokesman Jennifer Psaki, Washington.
Even Snowden's recent statements would not change.
Previously, after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow, German Grünen-Politician Hans-Christian Ströbele had appealed to the USA not to continue threatening him with punishment.
Psaki stressed that the statements were about a parliamentarian and not that of a German member of government.
Secret Service Secretary Edward Snowden is in principle ready for a conversation with German authorities.
First, however, he wants to know his situation clearly.
This has made clear to the former NSA staff sought by the USA in an unaddressed letter published by the Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded it to federal government, federal government, and federal prosecutor General.
The letter has the following text after a translation by Strobele:
To the Constituents
I was asked to write you on your investigation into mass surveillance.
I was a member of the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States.
As a result of my employment in these institutions, I became a witness of systematic violations of the law of my government, which led me to act out of moral duty.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I saw myself exposed to a serious and persistent heat that forced me to leave my family and my home.
I am currently living in exile and enjoy temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation under international law.
I am encouraged by the response to my political action, both in the United States and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world and also high officials, including the United States, have judged the revelations to be a system of comprehensive surveillance, which no one is responsible for, as a service to the public.
These espionage revelations brought many proposals to new laws and directives aimed at the formally hidden abuse of public trust.
The benefits to society from these findings are becoming more and more clear, while the risks taken into account were clearly reduced.
Although the result of my efforts was evidenced positive, my government still treats Dissens as a breach of loyalty and strives to criminalize and accuse political opinion.
Nevertheless, the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the United States government, with the support of the international community, will take this detractive stance.
I hope that, when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been solved, I will be able to take part in the responsible disclosure of the facts regarding the statements made in the media, in particular with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports, appropriately and legally.
I look forward to a conversation with you in your country as soon as the situation is clarified and thank you for your efforts to uphold the international law that protects us all.
Edward Snowden witnesses by Hans-Christian Strobele
Kindergarten has found a private buyer
“The building is in good hands,” says Winterling’s mayor Michael Maier.
The former Kindergarten in the Gartenstraße sold the municipality to a private person.
In its recent meeting, the Council did not agree to the sale in the public part.
The building changed its owner at a \"adjusted\" price.
“The municipality is satisfied - stressed Maier.
There were 100 000 euros in the household.
It is not yet clear how the new owner intends to use the previous kindergarten.
The mayor is right that winterlings have handed over responsibility for the building to someone else before the winter and thus no longer have to come up for the entertainment of the house, like heating, looking at the garden and cleaning the road.
“This effort is now gone - Maier is delighted.
Place concert at high summer temperatures
The Musikverein Hammereisbach offers a place concert on the terrace of the guesthouse Hammer.
When conductor Bianca Willmann lifts the clock stock at 7.30 p.m., the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
About 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of Hammrich musicians.
The chairman Manuela Honeck explains the pieces.
In this context, Honeck thanked all who had helped successfully cope with the first musical hock.
Report: Obama campaign considered replacing bids with Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama's closest advisers have secretly considered replacing Vice-President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 election campaign, according to the New York Times.
The revelation is the most remarkable surprise of the long-awaited work by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann about the 2012 election campaign, \"Double Down: Game Change 2012\"
The Times contains a copy of the next book and reported on Thursday evening that the top advisors of the President had carried out group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011 to find out if Obama's dizzying hope for re-election would be better if he dropped bids.
According to Jonathan Martin, national political correspondent of the Times, the book thoroughly traces the history of the efforts of leading employees of the campaign and the White House, including former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure the effect of the polls on former Foreign Minister Clinton against the Vice-President.
The potential change was a strictly guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and in the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the President's closest advisers, including Daley, former campaign leader Obama, Jim Messina, and former White House executive consultant David Axelrod and David Plouffe, knew about the planned change.
In Double Down, it is claimed that Daley was at the head of efforts to exchange bids in spite of her \"enough personal relationship\" before finally deciding against such a checkup after the data showed that the candidate Clinton's \"did not significantly improve Obama's chances.
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government had actually considered replacing bids with Clinton.
“I said a whole series of things to consider, and that was one of them,” said Daley to the magazine.
It must be remembered that the President had terrible polls back then, so we thought, \"For God's will, what are we doing?\"
While Daley described the investigations as \"provided care\", Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that considerable effort had been made during the campaign to re-election to find out if such a train would pay off in terms of the polls.
“In campaigns, not so much money is spent on surveys and focus groups, if you don’t think seriously about something,” said Martin on AC360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was thinking about an exchange.
Martin told CNN that he had asked Daley if his boss had known about the potential change.
Although Daley said that he did not believe that the president was aware of the possible change, the former Chief of Staff admitted that it was \"possible\" that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that \"Double Down\" did not have a definitive answer to the question of whether Obama's desk had reached the political probes.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama knew nothing about whether to let bids fall in elections.
“Possibly,” Martin replied.
What's going on with my email?
E-mail is actually called an electronic letter.
Was the letter secret implemented in the design of the Internet service e-mail similar to the conventional mail?
The concept of early Internet services was a priority in making communication possible.
Therefore, the basic technical protocols have not been designed to provide a stable foundation for a sound exchange of letters.
Therefore, a conventional e-mail corresponds to an open postcard rather than a sealed letter.
If user \"Anna\" sends an email to \"Benni\", are the computers of the two connected directly?
The email program or the browser of Anna sends the mail to the mail server of their service provider in the first step.
For example, if she has a GMail account, it would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider using Benni.
On the route, the mail can run via several other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content at his provider.
Are conventional e-mails read on their way through the network?
Most mails are read multiple times by software robots on the way.
In the case of the sender's provider, it is usually checked whether the mail carries a shadow program as an attachment.
A virus check is also carried out on the recipient systems.
In addition, the provider checks whether it is an annoying and unwanted spam email that is deleted or at least sorted away in a spam folder.
Do the robots have another task?
For systems such as GMail, the robot also detects the information that Google needs to place context advertising.
When Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their upcoming holiday trip, Google can show related links to holiday offers.
Do unknown people also read the e-mails with them?
The probability that unauthorised persons will read a mail is very low.
Theoretically, however, this is possible.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail.
The law enforcement authorities and secret services also have legal opportunities to intercept or take note of e-mails.
There are possible illegal expropriation actions.
Is it possible to protect e-mails from the reading?
With an encryption according to the OpenPGP standard, an e-mail can be effectively encrypted against co-read.
With high technical effort, it is also possible to conceal the metadata of an e-mail communication, so that it can't even be recognized without knowing who has communicated with whom.
How important are Yahoo and Google on the e-mail market in Germany?
According to a survey by Convios Consulting from August 2013, Yahoo and Google play only a subordinate role in the primarily privately used mailboxes.
While the shares of Yahoo mail had recently fallen, GMail was able to make it clear from Google.
Mother in the forest tightened and pension collected
When his late mother died, a man from Wolfsburg forged a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to cash their pension and care money.
A 67-year-old Wolfsburger buried his dead mother after investigation by the police in the woods.
First, he confused the death of the 89-year-olds, and then he dropped the money for more than a year and a half.
Now the 67-year-old must be responsible for fraud, as a speaker on Friday said.
So the man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was already suspected in May: At that time it occurred that no medication was needed for the needy mother.
The investigator told the pensioner that his mother had traveled to Spain.
Because this was strange to the officials, they continued to investigate.
It turned out that the two had lived in a shared apartment for more than 15 years and that he had last cared for them.
The 67-year-old finally gave birth to his mother.
According to police, no evidence of a capital offence was given.
Want ice cream shining in the dark?
A British businessman has developed the first ice shining in the dark, using qualls.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of marine animals and created a shining leak from them.
The idea came to him after he had read a research on qualls and was able to convince Chinese scientists to artificially produce the shining protein.
The ice cream reacts when consumed with the tongue, thus raising the pH in the protein and triggering the luminosity.
Chris explains that food ice reacts to the heat in the mouth and lights - so the more you lick, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company \"Lick Me I'm Delicious\" says: \"The product is incredible, but still in a very early production phase, and you get two grams of it for 200 pounds.
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH value.
When the mouth warms the protein, the pH value increases and the ice shines.
We have tested it in the last few months and it seemed ideal to bring it to the market at Halloween because it has this wonderful lighting effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because the chamois is four times more expensive than gold.
Every bullet cost me about 140 pounds.
But it tastes delicious.
Charlie's experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual flavors, including beer, cheese, beef and leaf gold.
But his latest creation is to become even more ambitious.
He says: “I would like to develop an invisible ice cream,
This is impossible on and for itself due to the break of light caused by the ice crystals from which ice cream consists; but I suspect we find a way to create it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a qualle artificially produced by Chinese scientists
The TSV Morsum is still without any point in the handball association league after six days of play.
The team of Ingo Ehlers now accounts for Derby against the TSV Daverden, who celebrated his first victory last weekend.
With this game, the season starts new for us.
“I hope we finally have our head free, Ehler’s behavior is optimistic.
At last, with the exception of the permanently injured Henry Blohme, he has provided his complete framework.
Daverden is also on a tempo game.
Therefore, we need to keep our error rate low.
First of all, however, it is important to increase the coverage, which has left everything other than a safe impression.
Daverden's Coach Thomas Panitz is clearly more relaxed after the first season victory against Nordhorn.
The game was of course a house number.
But that's why we're not the favorite for a long time, because in Derby everything can always happen.
However, Panitz now wants to go to Morsum to start a series.
Jan-Malte Jodat is missing.
For this purpose, the A-Youth Joost Windssüß, who is active with double-play law with the A-Youth-Bundeligist HC Bremen, celebrates its season debut.
Who is not hot in such a game should stay at home.
Halloween 2013: In numbers
When I was little, Halloween had some magic.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay late and dress up for the neighborhood.
Today I've become a Halloween muffle.
In the last two years, I have not declared myself ready to distribute from my home out of candy, and probably will not do so this year.
But according to statistics, I am a black sheep, as far as Halloween is concerned.
The majority of Americans - 158 million to be accurate - celebrate Halloween this year and spend a total of $6.9 billion for candy, costumes and decorations, according to the U.S. Association of Retailers (NRF).
One thing I'm looking forward to every Halloween again is the trend values.
Costumes will account for about 1.2 billion of the US$6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year the last scream is exciting inanimate objects.
Women no longer have to wear sexy clothes, they can now also embody seductive foods such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the daft punk space men will make it into Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most sought-after costumes are zombies, batman, pirates and witches.
I suppose it's nothing wrong with tradition.
We dressed our dogs last year and were not alone to my amazement.
In fact, Americans spend $330 million this year for costumes of their pets, according to the NRF.
These are a lot of hot dogs
As far as sweets are concerned, we are not clumsy.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, according to The Nielsen Company.
These are about 270 million kilograms of chocolate gels, luthiers, bean beans and rubber bears.
So good news for the US Department of Commerce 41 million people who, with the saying \"Sutes or Saures\" pull through the neighborhoods.
In fact, we will buy more than 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween, and we will do nothing to eat.
The only thing we don't want to consume is the sugar-sweet candy corn; however, 15 million kilograms of it are sold around Halloween, according to the National Association of Sweeteners.
That's about nine billion corn grains.
It's a puzzle I couldn't solve yet.
Nothing more belongs to Halloween than houses in which it spits.
They have great names such as \"Terror Behind the Walls\" (which, by the way, is in a real prison), \"Howl-O-Scream\" and \"The House of Shock\"
There are actually 1,200 officially recognized ghosthouses in the United States that earn 500 million dollars of revenue, America Haunts said, and this includes the wonderful photos on which you just pick up your pants and then put your friends on Facebook, where you won't get rid of them again, and one of the guy on whom you stand left a comment like \"net facial expression\"
But we finally come to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown made us familiar with the Great Pumpis when we were children, and the carving of a pumpkin lantern is like the decoration of the Christmas tree - something we made from small up.
Fortunately, the “baby in the pumpkin” trend only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up cutting the pumpkin and not sitting in it.
This year, Americans will spend some 106 million dollars on pumpkins, according to the US Census Bureau.
The pumpkin lantern, which is slowly rotting in the front yard, is probably from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms of pumpkins were harvested this year.
If you want to score correctly, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and cut a little chicken from their 921 kilos of heavy pumpkin.
Residence fire in Helmbrechts: Rescue forces mountains cooled bodies
The firefighter had to reach Helmbrechts on the late Thursday evening.
A three-family house in the district of Hof catches fire at night to Friday.
The rescue forces store a chilled body out of the house.
In a fire in Helmbrechts, rescue forces have found a chilled body in a three-family house.
Whether it's a resident's handle is still unclear, as a police spokesman in Bayreuth said.
On late Thursday evening it had burned on the ground floor of the house.
When the firefighter hit, the flames already slammed out of a window.
The operating forces went into the apartment and found the body in a room.
This and another room burned out completely.
The entire ground floor was damaged.
All the other residents were not at home during the fire, the police spokesman continued.
The building is no longer habitable.
The exact cause of the fire was not clear at first.
Germany's largest state church has launched an offensive to advertise for the profession of the pastor.
Background is a possible shortage of parishes: The Evangelical-Lutherian State Church of Hanover expects that the number of its present-day pastors will be halved by 2030.
For young people today, the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the work and day-to-day work itself.
With Burfien, the State Church has for the first time commissioned a pastor in a full position to inspire young people to study theology.
At present, fewer and fewer young people choose to study theology after graduation.
Burfien returns this to the process of disenchantment: “God’s voice is quiet, the world is loud,
The profession was characterized by great freedom and diversity.
I am Lord of my schedule and can focus on where it is important to me.
Pastors could be very close to humans as soul-careers.
They earned as much as teachers and could live well on it.
Certainly, in the free economy, more pay is paid, but theologians would have a safe employer for this.
This is true of the young people of today who are not only concerned with careers, but also with meaningful work.
According to the Landeskirche, which comprises three quarters of Lower Saxony, about 60 pastors are currently retired each year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a theology study begin their vicariate.
In thinly populated regions such as the Harz, Emsland or Wendland, it could become difficult to occupy places in the future.
Burfien wants to organise studies for young people, among other things, and also invites celebrities who have studied theology.
The theology study offers a wide range of training.
You can even become Federal President.
Land Rover Rally Series Announced
In the interior you will find race seats and six-point belts as well as a free speech system.
The options range from reinforced brakes, a service package with the support of bowler-work-mechanists and logistical support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport, explains: “The rally customers who come to Bowler have changed,
They are not all experienced racers, but people who are looking for tension and adventure as well as a reachable way to world class events.
We are pleased to be able to open this way in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format opens up new opportunities to experience the various rally disciplines in Great Britain and abroad and prepare newcomers for the Strapazen and the reality of Rally Raid.
We really had fun developing the Defender Challenge scales - this will be a entertaining championship.
In addition, there is a training and testing day in February during the Defender Challenge, as well as the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Firefighter called for the rescue of a female who was trapped 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rock promontory in a quarries
Cockerspaniel-Hündin Ruby was released after a minor traffic accident
Three days later, she was discovered by a walker in the quarries in her fragile location
Fire fighters sailed off the rock wall and rescued the dog from the safe death
The firefighter managed to secure a female who was on a 15-metre-high vantage point in a rock wall.
The nine-month-old Cockerspaniel-Hündin Ruby had run away after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived alone for three days before she was rescued from a quarries on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his friend Becky Hall, 20, who belongs to the dog, came to the stone break Flappit in Denholm, West Yorkshire to welcome Ruby again and thank the fire fighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They desperately sought out their missing bitch and published help calls on social networks when she escaped the stonebreak after the small traffic accident.
Around 14:15 a.m. on Wednesday saw a walker who carried out his dog, the stranded Ruby on the 15-metre high sale in the quarries.
The technical rescue team at Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the spot and sailed off to rescue rubys, which was then transported up in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, specialist of the technical rescue team, said: “It was in a dangerous situation.
It was located in the middle of the rock wall - 15 meters from the top and the ground.
She did not move muscle during her rescue - she was like stiff-frozen.
But now she's fine.
She then ate some dog cakes.
This was quite an unusual use.
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, specialist of the technical rescue team, said: \"Ruby has had a huge success\"
There was the possibility that she was very badly injured or slumbered.
Ruby was examined as a veterinarian but did not detect anything except exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: “Seeing salvation was frightening.
I couldn't believe she was really up there.
It was wonderful to hold them back in the arms.
The veterinarian explained that if the exhaustion had become too great and it had collapsed, it would probably have crashed.
The firefighters have done great.
It was really courageous what they did.
We are just so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson from Keighley added: “We were afraid that she would fall down, but she remained up -
The firefighters were great.
I can hardly believe where she was.
Mick Jagger explains he never made Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week, the pop star said that she worked as a background singer to Jagger's song \"Old Habits Die Hard\" from 2004.
Perry explained that she had dinner with the old rocker, and that when I was 18, he had been nagging me.
She added: “That's been a long time and he was very nice to me, ”
In a statement by a representative, Jaggers, 70, on Thursday, said that he “kategorically denied that he had ever made approximations with Katy Perry,
The representative added: “She may have confused him with someone else,
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance at the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album \"Prism\" ended on page 1 this week.
George Kerevan: European disintegration gives the Scottish the choice
A new day, a new horror story about independence.
This time we are warned that independent Scotland is required to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This provides the keyword for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a border secured with barbed wire along the Hadrianswall.
In fact, the Strathclyde proposal pointed out the possible economic benefits that would bring more freedom of travel in the rest of Europe, but this did not play a role in the headlines, as expected.
Nor has anyone mentioned that EU Member States often follow stricter rules when it is more favourable to them.
Since Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area, the continued non-compliance for Brussels would be only a small concession in return for what one really wants from the Scots.
So, actually, no story.
And one that has already come in the years that it already resembles a fossil: the first time I heard the \"independence means passport controls\" Ente at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient history.
Why should an independent Scotland expect it to dance after the European pipe?
Why exchange the London yoke against Brussels, especially now?
These are the real European news: the great plan to unite Europe after the war has come to a standstill.
With the euro crisis, Europe's project has died officially.
Everywhere in the EU, parties who are hostile to the EU or want to throw the euro overboard as a Community currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Party Alternative for Germany, first founded this year, was able to voice almost five million votes in the Bundestag elections in September and thus effectively expel the Free Democrats (the equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic resistance to the plan to create a Federalist Europe.
However, the current economic crisis turns out to be a turning point.
Because of the strict austerity policy imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in conjunction with the forced jacket in which the national economy is required by holding to the common currency, many people believe that the project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments causing excessive budget deficits - it was only in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has established its members in exchange rates, which are advantageous for German exporters, and would like to leave German politicians that way.
Without the possibility of devaluing the local currency, Southern Europe will be restored with a built-in productivity disadvantage compared to Germany.
The only possibility is to cut wages and public spending, encouraged by Berlin.
There is a deeper European productivity problem behind current budget and currency problems.
As a result of the \"green\" - energy directives - a code for subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers - European industry pays doubles for electricity and quadruple for gas compared with the United States.
This is a paralyzing cost disadvantage, as we could already see in Grangemouth.
All world wage taxes do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, a revolt rises, especially in France, the former EU cheerleader.
After the war, the political elite of France saw the EU as a vehicle with which to hold Germany in check and to raise Paris with Washington.
However, Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy and has pushed Europe into its own economic policy, thus fighting the proposed French economy.
The result: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, EU-enemy front National has just won a decisive re-election and thus turned the ruling socialists in place of three.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the voter votes - a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a split in the right spectrum would automatically mean benefits for the left.
What does Le Pen do with their newly gained popularity among the white French of the working class?
It would like to use the EU elections next year to avoid an anti-EU, anti-Community currency block in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties cut off well in these elections, and this is very good possible, then for the first time such a block could dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point to which I would like to go: in the future, the growing resistance to the EU and the single currency will be brought together to abolish the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will rather become something like the 'Europe of the (sovereign) nations', favoured by General de Gaulle.
Germany and a few of its satellite economies may hold the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect Britain to distance itself from this project in the hope of grumbling into the United States.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific region suggests that Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where does Scotland stay with all of this?
We can decide to be a region of (in the latter consequence) small England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which includes telling Berlin and Brussels what they can do where they are going.
I suspect Scotland could go quite well in a more loose European context, provided we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other countries that are similar is easier in a non-federal Europe of the nations.
Otherwise, we should consider equalizing Norway and maintaining our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is, remarkably, the most successful political movement against austerity policy in Europe and has won a spectacular majority in 2011 due to the rejection of the proposed (and made) cuts to be held by Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to decide now on independence, only to get a saving policy imposed on Berlin and Brussels.
Early Puberty: Growing up faster
African American and Hispanic girls tend to achieve puberty rather than their white age associates, as surveys show.
Physical changes do not directly mean puberty yet
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe epidemic obesity is a trigger of early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is less pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be concerned if her daughter grows breasts and shames when she is seven or eight years old?
At the annual conference of the Children's Medical Association American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, paediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz stated that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and represented a new norm.
“I spend a lot of time calming my parents down,” Kaplowitz explained.
Obviously, evidence of development, such as growing breasts, sham and axel hairs as well as body odor, shows up in girls earlier.
However, there was only a slight shift in the age of menarche (the first rule bleeding) over the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
“When the development of the breasts begins, it takes at least two to three years to the menarche,” Kaplowitz said, also author of the book Early Puberty in Girls: the essential counsellor on dealing with this common problem,
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty progresses.
It is controversial, which is actually the beginning of puberty, but it is \"frozen\" when the breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth stroke of eight years before an age.
In most cases, the process slows down or stagnates, something that a child doctor can closely monitor.
In the case of rapid advances, tests may be indicated by an endicronologist in order to eliminate serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatment methods for delaying early menstruation and defense of another consequence: premature aging of bones, which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and thus small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for medication or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is reluctant about drugs, but he admits: “The suppression of puberty can alleviate behavioral problems and girls’ feelings of being different from their peers,
The other big problem is understandable: parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period.
“They care about the risk of pregnancy or how they handle the hygienic side,” Kaplowitz said.
“It was a shock, ” recalls a woman whose daughter had ten days.
Although there were first signs and we had talked about menstruation, it was emotionally unprepared.
She came scared and excited from school home because she was the first in her circle of friends.
There are many widely published theories on the causes of premature puberty.
However, there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media are key.
Boys, like girls, enter puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported the implementation of a 2001 study on girls aged between six and nine years, creating a link between fat and entry into puberty.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country African American and Hispanic girls tend to achieve puberty rather than their white age associates.
There are different explanations for this.
Globally, early puberty seems to be influenced by all possible things, from economic conditions across the climate to genes.
Another mystery: Although boys grow facial and sham hair before, the trend towards a full-blown earlier puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference stressed the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and sham hair is even common in babies and young children.
“We need to be careful how we identify the real beginning of puberty,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at the Goryeb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to be advised by their child’s doctor about how they should talk to their child.
“This may mean that you have to conduct a conversation earlier than expected,” says Kaplowitz.
If you stay calm, the child usually reacts well.
Girls who bloom early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it occurs earlier than thought.
Jumbo manufacturers argue in view of large orders about seat width
Between leading aircraft manufacturers, there has been a debate about the width of seats in the tourist class on long-distance flights, indicating the tone for a bitter collision at the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute revolves around the seating width offered by passengers on long flights in the tourist class - not always those who are trying the most for airlines, but this designated space is the key to the efficiency claims of the latest aircraft from Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus demanded a standard of industry this week that prescribes a seating width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in the tourist class, but the U.S. Erzrivale Boeing says that the airlines should decide.
The debate comes at a time when aircraft builders are competing to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long-distance aircraft and expect record orders at the event from 17 to 21 November.
How the rear part of the aircraft is designed - in particular whether there are nine or ten rows of seats - is crucial for the economic results indicated to deliver the new mini jumbo design.
Boeing claims that its modernized \"777X\" is 406 people at tourist-class seats, which are over 17 inches wide and thus allow 10 per row.
Airbus explains that the competing version of the A350 transported 350 people in 18 inch wide seats in the tourist class, with nine per row.
Airplane giants often distribute hives via technical details through advertising in the specialist press.
Now Airbus is calling for the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X with over 100 orders is expected to make the race, directly to the public.
Recently, the company presented an advertisement that could be the start of a new ad war and showed donors a picture in which three people huddled together in a restaurant, with the title: “If you accept this,”
“Boeing proposes long-distance flights in seats that are closer than regional turbo props,” says Airbus Sales Director John Leahy.
In view of changed eating habits, people are getting thicker, but aircraft seats have not radically changed.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined the modern long-distance journey, and the end of the century, the weight of the male average American increased by ten percent between 40 and 49 years, according to the U.S. Department of Health data.
The waist circumference of the male average American in the 21st century is 100.8 cm, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus says that his rival adhered to a seating concept from the 1950s when the average body scope of the newly baptized \"Jet Set\" was narrower.
According to Airbus, studies have been conducted that showed that an additional inch (2.54 cm) per seat increased sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing is arguing about the figures from Airbus to the seating measures and says that it is not at the discretion of the manufacturers to decide how airlines make the balance between air fares and establishment.
The company also explains that according to investigations, the experience in the aircraft depends on more than the seating width.
“It really is important to give airlines flexibility so that they can do what they think they have to do in order to be successful,” explains Boeing’s cabin expert Kent Craver.
They don't want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, there is more freedom of elbows, but for manufacturers, it is increasingly becoming a subject that can affect sales.
Behind the debate is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least $700 billion at list prices over the coming decades, which could have a lasting impact on the US or Europe's export balance.
As Reuters first reported in July, the seat layout is the driving force behind the debate around the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest two-motor long-distance designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 77-300ER.
The statements of Boeing on the results partly depend on the comparison of the 777X with its ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increased costs per unit are still lower than for currently used machines with ten seats per row.
“Boeing is therefore asking for more seats in its aircraft to make it more competitive to our products,” says Kevin Keniston, Head of Passenger Comfort at the European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say that full cabins with ten seats per row at existing 777s indicate that many passengers opt for the tighter arrangement, which could be related to cheaper air fares.
“The 18-inch seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from an economic point of view, the Airbus offer is controlled by the threat from the 777 - says Mary Kirby, expert on cabin equipment, founder and publisher of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats, but a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
The world-traveling jet sellers even wear tapes in themselves to measure the setting up of the competition.
Even if they offer comfort, all manufacturers also offer jets with high-density design for cheap airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with ten-seater rows, but according to its own statement no one has yet sold.
To date, Airbus has stressed the importance of increasing the adaptability of cabins and offered wide seats for some jets at the corridors.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that the reputation for a new industry standard is likely to be spoiled, but could distract from the wave of 777X sales.
New anti-Nicotin vaccine could make the smoke fun
Scientists have developed an anti-Nicotin vaccine that could destroy the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotinism for a lifetime.
Further experiments are needed before human testing, which may take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results were good.
“We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can once help millions of smokers who have tried to stop and tried out all the methods available on the market, but had to experience that their nicotine addiction is stronger than those approaches,” Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified so that it contains the genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a constant flow of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before reaching the brain, causing a smoker to not experience nicotine high.
In trials, vaccinated mice, to which nicotine was administered, maintained their normal activity levels.
On the other hand, mice without vaccination would have taken a time, explained the researchers as a sign that nicotine had reached their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The vaccinations had to be given so often to maintain antibody levels that they were expensive and impractical.
However, the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be significantly lower, as it turns liver cells into antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine could, if he was quite sure, be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, thus preventing nicotine.
More likely, however, smokers would use it to stop.
“They know then that when they start smoking again, they feel no pleasure because of the nicotine vaccine, and that helps them to put off the habit,” he explains.
British scientists said that the results were interesting, but at the same time they warned that further research was needed.
Tripodi contended to be influenced by obeid
Against the former Minister of the Labor Party Joe Tripodi from New South Wales, an investigation is initiated by the State Corruption Supervisory.
The former NSW Minister contends to have amended the rules on maritime leases at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who owned hidden holdings in three land plots in a state-controlled country.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC Independent Commission against Corruption) has extended its investigations on whether the obeisance has influenced various ministers of state to extend lease contracts at Circular Quay, where the obeis operate two restaurants and a café without any tendering after their expiry in August 2005.
Now it is determined for the accusation that Tripodi knew of Obeid's hidden interest in the property after Tripodi had pronounced former Deputy Chief Lynne Ashpole accordingly on Thursday.
In years of discussions that began in 2005, the government had pushed for public tenders for lease contracts.
The tenants were opposed and also wanted longer durations.
In 2009, the lease contracts for the companies at Circular Quay, which provided the obeisers with $2.5 million annually, were extended without a public call for tender.
Tripodi, who was port minister from February 2006 to November 2009, had originally expressed himself for public tenders.
But he objected to the changes made at the request of Obeid, who, as Tripodi confirmed, had pushed for a reform of the maintenance arrangements of the government.
One of the ICAC’s telephones presented showed talks from August and September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had moved to the port ministry after he had worked under Obeid in the fishing authority.
\"While the subject discussed in these telephone talks was the preparation of commercial liability schemes, Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy asked Tripodi.
“No, ” replied Tripodi.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it definitely wasn't.
Definitely not between me and Mr Obeid.
Israeli fighter planes attack target in Syria, according to official sources
Israeli fighter planes had attacked a target in the Syrian port of Latakia Thursday night, confirmed a senior government employee against Fox News.
The official did not explain what the objective had been, but said that it had been at least one.
According to Associated Press, the target was Russian SA-125 rockets.
At least twice this year, Israel has already carried out air raids on rocket supplies in Syria.
Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subjected to “efficacy test”
In the context of extended measures, the government is considering an \"realisation test\" for foreign workers with 457 visas.
Should the test be introduced, it would be used as a criterion to prevent the 457 from being used to occupy unqualified jobs or as a backdoor for the addition of family and friends to Australia.
Today, a proposal for discussion was published by the government after former Labor Party MP Maxine McKew, who had condemned the government's comments on foreign workers because they could be viewed as insulting by the neighbors of Australia.
“Extreme statements such as ‘foreigners to hire themselves behind’ and ‘set up Australians first’ are a very unpleasant relapse in times when trade unions demanded a protected labour market - she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, it was said that white workers should be protected - and if some in the region were to name an echo of this historical artifact, I wouldn't be surprised.
The discussion proposal outlines twelve measures which were once taken by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Minister for Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who had been discussing human smuggling in Sri Lanka yesterday, has implemented five of the recommended changes, the others are still being considered.
If the \"efficacy criterion\" is taken over, then a person requesting a visa could be examined in the light of whether the application is real in cases where the applicant is related to or personally connected with the holder or a relevant person of the supporting company,
In addition, companies could be obliged to account for the number of 457 visa holders, after in the past companies that initially wanted to support only a small number of workers eventually set up hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old sri-lank asylant probably died of a heart attack after arriving this week with a refugee boat on the Christmas Island.
The destroyed nine - year - old son of the man who came to Australia with him has been cared for by a grown cousin who was also on the boat since his father died on Wednesday.
Australian authorities took the man to the Christmas Island Hospital where he died.
A study was announced by the UK Government to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
In the work of HS2 Ltd, it is proposed that high-speed connections between Scotland and the North of England be established as early as Phase 1 in 2026.
Minister of Transport Baroness Kramer said that the project \"will bring Britain closer together\"
Scottish Minister of Transport Keith Brown said he was very pleased to work with the British government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands.
After completion of Phase 2, there will be links to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government corrected the estimated costs for the construction of the high-speed road between London and northern England from 32.7 billion pounds to 42.6 billion pounds.
The British government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to look for further route capacities and travel time improvements for northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a trip of three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: \"Our goal for HS2 is a truly national road network that brings Britain and its cities together closer together,
We go ahead with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits.
Without it, we are facing a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it is also about the connection between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is improved thanks to HS2.
The Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael commented: “Today’s announcement is a good news for Scotland”
In the name of the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Carmichael to \"unmisunderstand\" himself for the Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Brown said: “The high-speed rail connection has enormous economic benefits for Scotland, but at the same time Scotland’s economic power also provides an argument for fast rail connections across the UK.
That is why we are pleased to work as a partner of the British government and to examine the options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland that creates benefits for everyone and complements the Glasgow-Edinburgh link that the Scottish government is already planning.
I look forward to examining the investigation report with the British ministers next year and to taking the next steps together.
Provisions on electronic equipment in aircraft shall be provisionally in force in Australia
Australian flight passengers must continue to turn off tablets and smartphones when starting and landing, despite efforts in the United States to loosen the regulations for such devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows US airlines to change their requirements so that passengers can read, watch or play e-books on their devices during critical flight phases, as long as they are in \"air mode\".
During most of the flight passengers are already allowed this, but many people find it annoying that they should not read their e-books at the start and landing.
However, Australian companies do not follow any direct plans to amend their rules to ensure that the US airlines are able to carry out a large number of work.
The CASA Aviation Authority also stated that the announcement would be considered, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases in Australia still apply.
\"The CASA has no specific rules on the use of electronic equipment in the aircraft at present\" has been announced.
The issue is subject to provisions which, according to airlines, must maintain safety at any time and that passengers must comply with the safety instructions given by cabin personnel.
Virgin has already conducted talks with the CASA about an extension of his Wi-Fi maintenance system on flights and explains that it is open to change, but it must be initiated by the legislator.
“We would welcome a review of CASA’s approval of electronic devices, because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience after we now offer (wireless entertainment) during the flight,” said one speaker.
Qantas explained that the current regulations will remain up to date.
“Our current guidelines provide that electronic devices should not be used when starting and landing, and we do not currently have any plans to change this,” explained the company.
The FAA regulations apply to US airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations that can benefit passengers, and will certainly look closely at the FAA decision as well as the reasons behind it.
The decision is different in US companies depending on the age of the fleet.
They must demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference through mobile devices, and change manuals, training materials, hand luggage programs and customer instruction.
“After confirming the tolerance of its fleet, an airline can allow passengers to use portable, lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at any height,” the FAA announced.
In rare cases at a bad sight, the crew will show the passengers to turn off the equipment during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier equipment be stored safely under the seat or in the compartments above the seats when starting and landing.
Before the Revierderby against Schalke, co-operated BVB trailers with light rockets had provided ugly scenes in the Veltins arena.
Borussia Dortmund then announced hard consequences.
Before the Friday game of the Bundesliga against the VfB Stuttgart, the Ultras responded with a silence - first.
It was an unusual, almost spongy acoustic, which offered itself to the viewer until just before the appeal of the Bundesliga game between the German vice-master Borussia Dortmund and VfB Stuttgart in Signal Iduna Park.
Most of the guests were listening with their songs.
On the other hand, the Southern tribune, where the most faithful of the faithful - and loudest - BVB fans, initially presented themselves exceptionally silent: no songs, no battle calls.
The capo podium, otherwise coordinated by the common fire, remained unoccupied.
And on the front of the tribune, a large flag with a heading “Section Stadium Ban” was waving lonelyly.
Only as a goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller as always as the first BVB player entered the place, burned up short-term cheers.
When his teammates followed, there were loud vocals and wailing scarves - but not everywhere for a long time.
There was nothing in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the Southern court.
Also that stadium speaker Norbert Dickel once again recorded the positive experiences of the last days - Derbysieg, victory over Arsenal, contract extension of coach Jürgen Klopp - did not make for celebrations.
Only five minutes before the apple, the capo climbed its podium - and the tension so far tangible with hands revealed itself in a loud scream, as thick as usual the mood on the ranks of the stadium asked.
The last thing was as always the southern court on the line - and finally there was again as usual the loudest place in the stadium.
And at the latest, when the loud call \"Derbysieger stands up\" came with a pomp from the southern court, everything was as always.
The silence before was probably a reaction to the events of the past few days.
Immediately before Revierderby at FC Schalke 04, some of the accompanying BVB trailers had fired light rockets into the audiences and onto the square - and almost touring Roman pasture fields.
The game was delayed due to the chaotic scenes.
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had received the tops of the Dortmund Ultras then in his office - and they believe Watzke's words, this was a rather uncomfortable appointment for the fan representatives.
“There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra movement,” announced the BVB-Boss on Thursday evening at a panel discussion in Frankfurt.
As an immediate measure, Watzke prohibited the Ultras from doing a choreography for the home game against VfB Stuttgart.
“I have forbidden that,” he explained.
We cannot give up the zero-tolerance policy on pyrotechnics.
In addition, the Ultras were shown various possibilities of punishment - until Tuesday they now have time to decide for one.
Otherwise, says Watzke, the BVB will impose a penalty by the end of the next week.
“This will be cutting - insured Watzke .
One may be anxious about how the reactions on the southern court will turn out.
Pfandhäuser trees in Singapore, as the crisis has arrived in the middle layer
Janani Amirthalinga, in a Pfandhaus in the Bendemeer Shopping Centre in Singapore, will exchange a golden bracelet, a ring and a pair of earrings to pay the school fees of her daughters.
“My husband and I just bought a house, there’s all my money in there, ” says Amirthalinga.
Although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars each month (about EUR 1,730) as an administrative employee and also works her husband, the monthly family income is not enough, she explains.
In fact, demand in parts of South East Asia - where household debt is increasing - is so great that ValueMax, where she made her exchange, became the third Pfandhaus listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Donating jewelry is not only a quick way to get money - 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirthalinga - but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Typically, Pfandhäusers in Singapore demand an effective annual interest rate of 17 percent, which is just over 15.4 percent, which the United Overseas Bank requires, a local creditor with a branch in the same shopping center.
However, Pfandhäusers offer the advantage that there is no need for a review of creditworthiness or evidence of income, which is why loans are possible faster than in banks.
For this reason, millions of people in the region turn to Pfandhäusers, after families feel pressure due to increased living costs and increasing household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to a loose fiscal policy in the developed economies, families with lower and medium incomes are looking for Pfandhäusers to compensate for the difference in stuttering economy.
This week, the rating agency called Standard & Poor's growing household debt, mainly through rising mortgages, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore, according to the Agency, have the highest household debt in Asia relative to gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 percent of GDP, an increase of 60 percent still in 2008.
Economicians also worry about the high consumer debt in Thailand, which this week has just come out of a technical recession.
On Thursday, the data showed an ongoing export weakness and a decline in consumer demand.
“In the end, this means that, given the rising costs, people in the middle to lower segment (the income scale) will try to supplement their income wherever possible,” says Song His Wun, economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historical highs at the gold prizes over the last two years have reinforced the trend towards putting personal objects away, as people take the opportunity to turn the family's jewelry into cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the objects in the 200 pawn houses of the city state are gold.
People say: “The gold price looks good, let’s get along with our grandmothers gold chain and get back next month,
The largest Thai pawnhouse operator, EasyMoney, has experienced a 20 percent customer growth in his branches in recent months.
The growth in the pawn business is so strong that ValueMax, the branch operator in Bendemeer and 15 others in Singapore, wants to expand not only into neighbouring Malaysia, where the company operates four houses, but also outside Asia, according to Yeah Lee Ching, Managing Director of ValueMax.
The company financed the 60 percent of Singapore's 66 million dollars, which it took this week with the stock market in Singapore.
While some creditors were in the crossfire due to high interest rates, Yeah explains that Pfandhäusers not only bled cheaper interest rates than other lenders, but also did not directly raise the debts.
“Customers borrow items they already own, and the need for personal valuables does not increase the level of budget training,” she explains.
The mortgage business is increasingly accepted socially as short-term, secured financing.
Nor are all people who use mortgages in financial difficulties.
Rich people from Singapore also come to the branches of ValueMax to pledge gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Customers come to us from every social layer.
“These include beneficiaries who, in the short term, borrow something for a business or investment, or small companies that have to bridge bottlenecks in the cash flow,” says Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
NSA sucks data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
The intelligence revealer Edward Snowden has a fundamental interest in helping Germany to clarify the ever-brissing NSA spheres.
Following the presentation of the Green-Bundestag deputy Hans-Christian Ströbele, his surprising meeting with Snowden in Russia focused on the conditions under which ex-secretary staff would testify to a German prosecutorship or an investigation committee.
Snowden referred to his complicated legal situation, said Strobele to the ARD magazine \"Panorama\"
Rescue package over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian health care
The Australian government relies on the harsh conditions associated with the rescue package of over $325 million Australian dollars for the Tasmanian health care system to ensure that the government of the state cannot waste the money.
Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take “unpromising measures” to address a crisis caused by an ageing population of the island state, a higher rate of chronic diseases and system restrictions.
Funding for a period of four years was decided upon after government consultations with independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.
“The government has created an emergency rescue package that we believe addresses the unique challenges facing the state,” said Plibersek today.
The 325-million-dollar package comprises 31 million dollars of emergency aid for electoral services.
Other 2600 operations, including orthopaedic procedures and treatments for grey star, should remove residues.
In addition, there is money for daily clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better care for stationary stays, specialist training, mental health services and the introduction of a system for electronic recording of health data in local hospitals.
\"These investments are in line with the ideas expressed by my hospital staff that they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system,\" said Tanya Plibersek.
The minister insisted on a strict reporting and accountability of the Tasmanian government.
The state would have to maintain the current level of funding in order to receive money from the Commonwealth, and report monthly on where the additional funds were spent.
A three-member Commission shall be established and shall ensure that the State provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie said today, the 325 million dollars would be of little benefit if they were not accompanied by real reforms that would bring the public Tasmanian health system to a more sustainable course,
Nevertheless, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he first expressed to the Prime Minister in early May.
“I am confident that federal aid will make a big contribution to taking the state’s public health system away from the worry list,” Wilkie said.
According to the government of the state, these electoral benefits will largely meet the recent cuts.
But the health - policy spokesman for the opposition at federal level, Peter Dutton, believes that today's announcement is only a \"pflasher solution\"
“We are therefore in a position today because the Labor State Government has withdrawn 430 million dollars from the healthcare system,” he said to ABC TV.
It can't be that a state government almost pulls half a billion dollars out of the system and plugs into the Commonwealth 300 million and then does as if it were good news.
Dutton called on Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux' adaptation of Denis Diderot's novel convinces with exceptional production equipment and contemporary details, but it is also more expensive than necessary.
The action in France of the 1760s tells the touching story of Suzanne, a young nobleman sent by her family to the monastery.
When she rebels, she is confronted with the extreme cruelty of an extremely sadist superior and becomes the object of erotic fascination of another.
The film never slips into a lust or a sensational desire, and this is its problem.
The solemn seriousness with which the film is told also makes it a painful butt shirt for the audience.
Syria has destroyed its ability to produce chemical weapons, according to a monitoring group
Syria has destroyed important facilities for the production of chemical weapons and poison gas ammunition, declared the global chemical weapons surveillance group on Thursday, while severe collisions occurred in the north of the country near one of the sites where potentially toxic substances are stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the beginning of the civil war three years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) arrived one day before the date of the meeting.
November 1, which the Damascus organization based in The Hague had set up to destroy or inoperate all facilities for the production of chemical weapons, including all machines for the mixing of chemicals to poison gas and for the filling of ammunition.
The conclusion of this process, which basically represents the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at the destruction of all Syria's chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still has to start destroying the existing weapons and supplies.
According to assumptions, there are about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons in the country, including mustard gas and serine.
The announcement came at a time when on Thursday battles took place in the city of Safira, the experts say there was a production facility for chemical weapons and deposits, as the Syrian Human Rights Observatory, based in Great Britain, reported.
The activist group, which is pursuing the number of dead by a network of activists in Syria, stated that 120,296 people died on Thursday.
Of these, 61,067 were civilians, including 6,365 were children.
On the side of the government, 29,954 of them belonged to the army of President Bashar Assad, and 18,678 were government-friendly fighters and 187 Lebanese Hisbollah militias.
Also among the dead were 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 fighters of the opposition, many of them foreigners.
On 25 July, the UN estimated the number of dead in this conflict to be 100,000 since March 2011.
This number has not been updated.
The conflict forced about two million people to flee the country.
Assad's troops have been fighting in Safira for weeks against the rebels, many of whom have connections to al-Qaida groups.
The observatory said there were losses on both sides on Thursday, but didn't mention any details.
The battles highlight the danger posed by chemical weapons inspectors, because their mission to free Syria from its toxic weapons arsenal is a race against time in the midst of a deadly civil war.
According to the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, the team is convinced that it has seen all the major production and mixing/filling facilities mentioned by Syria and has experienced their destruction,
Therefore, no further inspection activities have been planned at the moment,
At the beginning of the week, the inspectors had explained that they had completed the first round of the reviews and visited 21 out of 23 of the sites indicated by Damascus.
As a result of security concerns, the visitors to two facilities were not possible, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPWC stated that the two sites had been “set up” according to the Syrian statement ... and the objects of the chemical weapons program there had been moved to other mentioned facilities which were inspected,
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, to be approved by the OPWC Executive Committee next month.
“I draw the hat from the bravery and courage you showed all when completing the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organization,” said Ahmed Uzumcu, Director General of the Monitoring Organization in a comment published by OPCW.
For three years now, the main Sunni Muslim rebels in this civil war have been fighting against Assad's government and its security forces, which include many members of the Alawites, a division of Shiite Islam.
Regarding further developments, the leader of the observation group, Rami Abdurrahman, said that on Wednesday there was a strong explosion in an air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion was unknown, he explained.
Angry on Judgment of Bali Bomb Army
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who were killed in the 2002 bombing attack in Bali reacted angryly about the verdict for the last of the instigators who were put before the court, since Umar Patek was supposed to be shot in the state.
Patek, who was on the run for almost ten years as one of the most sought-after people in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to a 20-year prison sentence for his role in building explosives for the bombing attack.
He could be released after 15 years of imprisonment.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder for attacking two nightclubs in the popular Kuta tourist district, where 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many others were injured.
In addition, a claim was made in a number of terrorist-related charges, including a wave of explosive attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecutor had demanded a life sentence, even if it could have applied for the death penalty for the man who, because of his reputation as a master bomb builder, was also known as \"Demolition Man\".
The decision has awakened painful memories of June Corteen, a mother from Perth, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the desolation caused by Patek and his co-spirators almost ten years ago.
With tears fighting, she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really mean, he should follow in the footsteps of the other guy.
“You should put him in front of a shooting order,” Corteen said to AAP.
I have to live every day with the fact that I won't get another grandson and I'll never see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was similar to the ground floor when on October 12, 2002, a huge bomb exploded in a small truck parked in front of the nightclub shortly after 23 o'clock.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar, where just 20 seconds earlier a suicide killer exploded a backpack filled with explosives.
After the attack, he fell into the coma and die three times for a month, while he was on a life conservation system.
Hughes said that Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the Jemaah Islamiah terrorist cell, Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra, who were responsible for the bloodbath and were executed four years ago.
Really, this guy should get the death penalty first of all.
To let him live - no, there is no reason to let him live.
Getting 20 years after killing 202 people and injuring many hundreds is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to stand in court.
In January 2011, he was captured in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where U.S. forces killed the former al-Qaida chief Osama bin Laden almost four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent said that secret service reports had given evidence that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of rebuilding the link between South East Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaida.
“He didn’t ask himself,” Corteen said.
Until recently, he has shown no regret at how much suffering he has inflicted on other people.
The judgment went before the 10th anniversary of the attack this year, which will be celebrated in Bali and Australia.
“There will be many tears this year,” Corteen said.
Patek can still appeal to his verdict.
FAA: Air passengers can now use electronic devices in aircraft (but do not conduct phone calls)
Travelers can now listen to their electronic devices from departure to landing and use their electronic devices for reading, working, playing, music and watching movies, but not by phone, according to the new guidelines issued on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States.
However, passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
How quickly they would implement, from the airline concerned, FAA employee Michael Huerta said at a press conference.
Airlines shall demonstrate to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new Directives and that they have updated the flight staff training manuals as well as the arrangements for stowing the equipment in accordance with the new regulations.
The FAA stated that it had already received plans from some airlines that wanted to expand the use of portable electronic equipment in aircraft.
Among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue.
“Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve the extended use of electronic devices very soon,” the FAA announced in a statement.
Passengers are currently required to turn off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.
They can only start them again when the plane reaches a height of three kilometers and the captain gives green light.
When entering the landing flight, passengers must turn them off again and not start them again before the plane has landed.
According to the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are secured against electronic interference could allow passengers to use the equipment even when starting, landing and rolling, the FAA said.
Most new transport aircraft and other aircraft that have been upgraded to higher altitudes for use of Wi-Fi should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the professional association of professional flight attendants, welcomed the changes.
\"If the new regulation is implemented safely, and we are working closely with the airline in this respect, both sides will benefit from it, commented Glading.
We are, of course, sorry to have to feel like supervisors on this subject.
Nevertheless, Internet connections to surf, exchange of e-mails, text messages or download of data under three kilometres remained prohibited, explained the Authority.
Passengers are invited to put smartphones, tablets and other devices in flight mode.
So there's still no \"Words With Friends\" the Scrabble-like online game played by actor Alec Baldwin 2011 on his smartphone when he had to leave a public jet of American Airlines because he refused to turn off the device while the plane was parked on the takeaway.
And heavier devices such as laptops must continue to be stolen, as there is a risk of injury here if they fly through the cabin.
Cell phone calls during the flight are also still prohibited.
The regulatory competence for telephone calls is with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not with the FAA.
FAA may impose bans on certain electronic devices when starting and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker said from the National Transportation Safety Board, security experts for national traffic issues on CBS News, cell phones would still be considered a risk.
“Handy is really a problem, not only because it could cause potential disruptions in navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that transmission from the air can also interfere with transmitters - Rosenker says.
A Branch Advisory Committee, launched by the FAA to investigate this issue, recommended last month that the government allow a wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, the pressure on the FAA has increased to ease restrictions on use.
Critics such as the Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri felt that there were no valid reasons for the ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of the devices has become omnipresent.
In some studies it is said that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore the shut-off of the device.
The FAA began to restrict the use of electronic devices by air passengers in 1966, after reports of disruptions of navigation and communication equipment by passengers with VHF radios, which at the time were the latest technology trend.
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed in such a way that the FAA approves that they do not cause electronic interference.
Airlines have been providing Wi-Fi for passengers for several years when the flight height is reached.
Fliers adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more sensitive to interference.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the greater use of electronic devices according to the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices generally emit much less radio radiation than previous generations.
E-Readers, for example, only give off minimal radiation if you wrap around.
But when downloading or sending data, the transmission values are stronger.
Amazon.com is one of the proponents of locking restrictions on device use by passengers.
In 2011, company employees invited a passenger aircraft full of Kindle E-Readers and made a test flight to identify problems, but none could find out.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using devices.
Douglas Kidd of the Passenger Association National Association of Airline Passengers said he believed that the interference from the devices was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other committee members said there were only isolated reports of pilots speaking for a disruption of aircraft systems by the devices, and most of them were very old.
The Committee recommended, however, that the FAA allow pilots to order the shut-off of the equipment by passengers when landing instruments under poor visibility conditions.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as a reasonable adjustment for travellers who today would be extensively equipped with technology.
“We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience does not contradict safety,” said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Re-released by air rescue service of the North Sea Bohr Island
A bird flying by air rescue service to the coast, which had been found exhausted on a North Sea boar island, was again released into nature.
The Water Rall was flown last month with a helicopter to Aberdeen, where it was picked up by the Scottish animal welfare organisation SPCA in its rescue centre in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the centre, said: \"This water hall was probably a winter train bird from northern Europe, which was stopped by the strong winds over the North Sea,
Apparently, the exhausted bird sought refuge on the drilling island.
He added: “He couldn’t fly any more, so we were contacted with the request for help,
In her release, the water hall was again fit and healthy.
Is Europe's elite ready to do business with Great Britain?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy to a table and defining what would change to our relations with the EU for the sake of prosperity and employment in the UK.
To this end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey among British economic leaders and asked them what they think about Britain, the economy and the EU.
YouGov interviewed over 1,000 business leaders, who represent the sizes, sectors and regions of the UK.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We found out that the vast majority of companies are now exporting outside Europe and focusing on countries that are modernising and growing while the states are stagnating in the EU.
They wish that, on the government side, new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil are favored, rather than with the long and strenuous process of reforming the obscure EU institutions.
In their view, the majority of economic leaders believe that the control of these key competences should be recovered according to Westminster, from antitrust law to product legislation.
There was general dissatisfaction over the internal market, as, according to the companies, the costs of the Brussels rules would now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe's trading zone, even 40 percent of the major companies agreed with the ones that are traditionally the most European-friendly.
Finally, and this is probably the most likely to say, our survey of economic leaders revealed that a clear majority of the UK wants a course towards change in the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not politics.
This knowledge, which is found in companies of all sizes and leading corporations, shows that the economy is pushing for a “sensible change” that brings the issue of action back to Britain.
It is a lot - a change in the agreement and better conditions for Britain would lead to a 16 percent change of opinion in favour of remaining in the EU in a popular vote.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this survey shows that the UK economy is behind his plan for renegotiation of British conditions for EU membership.
It also shows that companies expect a marked shift in power relations back to Britain from a renegotiation.
A better deal for the UK economy is possible and increasingly necessary after the Eurozone is now moving towards a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the result of our survey shows, which means a stronger focus on business and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulations.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom refers to pipeline in Bulgaria as the beginning of a new gas era
The start of the construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria is one of the largest European energy projects, explained the Gazprom Board.
“Today’s event is a milestone: the construction work on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream Gaspipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun,” said Gazprom’s CEO, Alexei Miller, in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element for energy security throughout the European continent.
South Stream aims to ensure more diversity in Russia's export routes through Europe.
A contract dispute between Gazprom and its counterparties in Ukraine, where the bulk of Russian gas is stored for Europe, creates an increased risk in conventional routes, as can be heard from official sites.
Miller said that the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were always eliminated.
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream at reduced rates when the whole project is underway in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction works in other subordinate countries are expected to begin on the planned route to the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic metres of natural gas.

Hearing before the Royal Commission: Two YMCA employees accused of charges against Jonathan Lord for sexual offences
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) were charged with sexual offences related to children before 2011 accusations against the child care worker Jonathan Lord from Caringbah were made, as the Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse of Children.
However, in the opening statement before the Commission, the YMCA had stated that “in the organization, there has never been an incident of sexual child abuse,
Managing Director Phillip Hare was asked about a case in which a YMCA employee had been accused of child pornography offences, and another in which a sports teacher of YMCA Caringbah Hall was sentenced to him for abuse in 1991.
Hare said Gail Furness, one of the Commission's assistants that he knew of the first case but did not know the second one.
He admitted that the opening statement of the YMCA to the Commission was also inconvenient in the claim that \"there have been external reviews of the YMCA in which the YMCA was recognised as being at the front of child safety,
However, evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA was informed that it received the second-lowest assessment of four possible in a quality audit by the Department of Education and Communities (Education Ministry) in August of the year.
Hare, who started with 21 at YMCA, admitted that the management failed, from me down, in the attitude of Lord and did not ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report violations of the Child Safety Guidelines.
Lord had been sentenced to twelve boys for sexual offense at the beginning of the year during his two years of activity for the YMCA.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
However, Hare argued that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented employees from reporting Lord's violations regarding the safety of children.
The employees said they had observed violations, among other things, that Lord was alone with children, she privately cheated as a babysitter, let her sit on his lap, told one that he loved it, and allowed children to play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, the head of the board and who had asked for child protection training because she was concerned about his behavior, said that the head of the children's service Jacqui Barnat, who was the head of the YMCA Caringbah, was “very shy and most of the time very inconvenient.”
The managing director said that he would not accept statements from employees, according to which they did not trust to report their superior.
Instead, he said, rather, their friendship with the Lord affected their judgment, which is why they had not reported it.
Hare explained that he had informed the Executive Board of the YMCA NSW that the lesson that the organization had to draw from the \"Jonathan-Lord incident\" was not about reporting by employees, and the Management Board agreed to it.
Hare said that the decision to force employees to sign confidentiality obligations shortly after the occurrence of the charges was made by the managing director of the YMCA Children's Services, Liam Whitley.
He said that in order to prevent contamination of evidence, what had been \"overwhelmingly\" and poorly implemented.
The YMCA NSW had not been a safe organization for children between 2009 and 2011, when Jonathan Lord was employed there, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, expert on sexual child abuse, explained to the Commission.
He explained that there were “serious problems” in the recruitment, review, deployment, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing was postponed until December 20.
Tony Blair said he would take advantage of the chance to return as a British Prime Minister, but admits that a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview this evening on the fifth anniversary of his departure from office, the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic issues.
Since his resignation in June 2007 after a decade as head of state, Blair has largely avoided expressing himself on British politics, and his comments are mostly limited to foreign policy and his role as ambassador to the Quartet of Peace Founders in the Middle East.
On the question of whether he would like to return to the Prime Minister's office, Blair was quoted by the Evening Standard from London as saying: “Yes, sure, but it is unlikely that this will happen, so ...”
When the horse show experts in Scharen found themselves in Cardiff to shorten the horse of the year, they were aware that a hard competition was imminent.
But nobody was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The Knirps, who is not even in kindergarten and only took his first steps a few months ago, and his Shetland-Pony Toffee came loose through the three rounds and won the first prize - leaving 30 adult opponents behind.
The inseparable couple, both equally large, were praised for their appearance, behavior and style in the annual competition, which is organised by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
In his appearance in competition against men and women with elegant melons, he had put his plate hat in a cheeky angle and led the two-year-old toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural abilities in dealing with the pony that lay far above his age.
And Toffee got top notes for his performance and personality.
Fenton had received Toffee last March as a gift for his third birthday and has been practicing with the Shetland Pony ever since.
His mother, Donna, 30, said: \"Fenton and Toffee are a great team,
They had to step against the entire field and went out of place with Goldpokal and Rosette.
It was only the second time he took part in a competition with Toffee, and we were all excited when he won.
Complete strangers in the arena thought him to be so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been performing horses for over ten years.
Howells said: “The whole audience was like electrified, and everyone fired and clapped him,
He ran on sand the entire length of the arena and although he looked so tiny, he did fantastic work.
Fenton is crazy about animals - he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens to care for.
Just as he started, it won't take long until he's on the \"Pferd of the Year\" and I'm sure he'll be good cut off.
A spokesman of the annual horse show said: “Fenton is only three, but he knows how to deal with his pony,
Together they're a great team.
The jurors then assessed Fenton and Toffee as to how well they had beaten and presented themselves in the lead ring.
They pay attention to good cooperation between Pony and Führer - and there Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton's cute clothes contributed their part to it, which was really perfect for the occasion.
Chinese newspaper to be \"reformed\" after call
A Chinese newspaper, which had called for the release of a reporter who had been accused of defamation on the front page, was to be reformed, said a press regulator.
The New Express, based in Guangzhou, had printed a rare public call for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to falsify reports about a state-owned company.
Now the New Express will be subjected to a comprehensive rectification, explained the regulatory authority.
The \"Rectification Order\" was issued by the Office for Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television in Guangdong.
Preliminary investigations revealed that between September 2012 and August 2013, the New Express, which belongs to the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several incorrect reports on the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The editorial management of the New Express was unordered,” the regulatory authority announced in a statement.
She said that it was decided to \"resolve an administrative penalty for Chen Yongzhou and to withdraw his reporter's license\"
In addition, “Yangcheng Evening News Group has been advised to complete the correction of the New Express and to identify the relevant New Express controllers and to check the management team of the New Express immediately,
Chen had written several articles for the New Express in which he reported alleged financial irregularities with a manufacturer of construction machinery called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the title page and stood behind his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared in the state television and admitted that he had published false reports for payment.
“In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion as well as the entire news industry and its ability to gain public confidence,” he said to the state news channel CCTV.
I did it primarily because I was out on money and fame.
I realized I was acting wrong.
Following Chen's apology, the New Express published an apology on the title page and declared that you failed to verify the reports correctly.
Several well-known suspects have recently made confessions on television.
Experts say that confessions are still routinely forced, despite a change of law at the beginning of the year in which authorities were forbidden to force someone to accuse themselves.
Drug tunnel with private rail between the United States and Mexico discovered
One of the most refined tunnels for drug smuggling between the US and Mexico, which was completely equipped with lighting, ventilation and electric rail operation, has now been discovered.
The U.S. authorities described the 120-fold 90-centimetre tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages they had ever found.
The tunnel, which runs over a length of almost six football fields in the zigzag pattern, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
In the area there are countless invisible warehouses, which makes it easier to hide loaded trucks with drugs.
The tunnel had been closed before drugs could be transported, the authorities explained.
In the discovery of the tunnel, eight-and-a-half tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine had been secured, according to the Court's records.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers were charged with the possession and intended sale of marijuana and cocaine.
They threaten prison sentences between ten years and a lifetime in the event of a term of guilt.
In Nogales, Arizona, Schmuggler relies on an extensive underground network of disposal channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage that has been discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the biggest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in Central Mexico in October, which presents the drug cartels with the challenge of quickly bringing their product to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a passage of almost 640 metres with rails, which ran from a kitchen in a house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love each other
Actor Orlando Bloom and Model Miranda Kerr want to go separate paths in the future.
In an interview, however, Bloom said that he and Kerr still love each other.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of the two-year-old Flynn.
Actor Orlando Bloom has expressed himself for separation from his wife, the top model Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with U.S. journalist Katie Couric, who was to be broadcast on Friday (local time), Bloom said that “life sometimes does not go the way we plan or hope to do,
Kerr and he still loved himself, emphasized the 36-year-old.
“We will support each other and love each other as parents of Flynn,
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010, and in 2011 their son Flynn was born.
Veganism, according to Lexika, is subject to vegetarianism, but is quite different from it in a very significant way.
Because while vegetarians allow themselves the consumption of Sahnetorte, Ice or a strong Edamer, these slag eggs are not on the menu of a vegan.
Milk, cheese, egg, in addition to the absence of meat and fish, the vegan leaves off from all consumption of animal products - honey is also ignored.
What remains may be asked, but when viewed more closely, the vegan diet is characterized by a considerable amount of chance.
“Broadings are very popular,” explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the local Reformhaus, who has a variety of special products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the store in Domgasse.
For 13 years the native New Zealander lives vegan, in Lampertheim he (almost) finds everything he needs to live. “I turned my diet around and became a vegetarian.”
The next step took place around the turn of the century, and I became a vegan.
“The conviction came not only because of the diet, but because of the choice of shoes, but also because of the choice of shoes,” says Proctor, who prefers ordinary leather.
He recognized that it is also in other everyday interests without animal products.
First and foremost, vegan is an ethics.
“I don’t want animals to die for me,” says Proctor, saying the maximum of vegans that extends to the entire consumption behaviour.
Instead of grieving burgers, stirrers or rubber bears, the vegans quickly discovered entirely new products, the enthusiasm increased.
“It’s a double bonus,” says Proctor today, “in fact vegan doesn’t represent its absence, not asceticism, but it’s an enrichment - the assumption that food conversion reduces the selection of food options, leads Proctor back to the power of habit.
And this is exactly what led some to fail so well in common.
“The addiction factor is a very crucial factor that leaves a lot of fast giving up, similar to smoking,” Proctor makes a comparison.
And turn to this: “Certain tastes are not to be attached to the animal“
Often it is the spices or type of preparation that make up the flavor.
“But you can also produce the same effect in a different way,” the vegan explains.
For example, Proctor brings aubergines, champignons and a few vegan sausages to a barbecue party.
He is aware of a balanced, varied diet, in which it should be tasted in a decent way.
Of course, you want something between your teeth, that's legitimate.
“It’s supposed to taste, but it’s not just to reduce animal food,” Proctor says.
Health damage to eating disorders, another widespread assumption, he did not suffer.
For me the conversion had a positive aspect.
I don't take any foreign cholesterol and have an increased amount of vitamin.
There are high-performance athletes that feed exclusively vegan.
“My blood values are good, I often let myself check - tell Proctor.
In particular, many Vegansimus critics warn against the lack of vitamin B12.
“As animals are fed with feed instead of grazing on the pasture, it is questionable whether in the meat you buy in the cooling trough the vitamin B12 portion is high - proctor.
There is also the possibility for vegans to take the coenzyme in the form of tablets.
“My B12 values are in order,” he explains.
Wide paths would not have to go proctor for food procurement.
After all, basic food is available everywhere and every supermarket now has soy milk and other products.
I'll find everything I need on the spot.
Only occasionally I buy something special.
“Many people overlook that only the finished products are expensive, but so it’s also known to be ‘common’ finished products.
In any event, the preparation of vegan dishes was far cheaper and less time-consuming than generally accepted.
“There’s a lot to discover in the kitchen, with a few small buttons you can get good, if not partly better results,” Proctor says.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and carbonic acid instead of egg, with its vegan cheese cake, Proctor was also able to bring his brother-in-law to a standstill.
Family parties give the vegan a new spice.
This has a new significance for dynamics when you cook together.
“The situations that can arise are as different as the people themselves,” says Proctor.
Of course, scepticism has already been introduced to him.
Don't you like my food anymore?
“Should I feel bad now because I drink milk - with such questions one must act as a vegan with a fingertip feeling.
“I don’t reject people, I’m part of this society - Proctor doesn’t want to eat enclaves.
And more precisely, the everyday world does not seem as vegan-friendly as expected - and the vegan does not seem as restricted in everyday life as commonly assumed.
Fast food is also allowed.
Pommes are everywhere!
“Many dönerläden offer falafel, or just a vegetarian yufka,” says Proctor.
In a pizzeria he weighs on pasta dishes, or just orders a pizza without cheese, all a question of habit.
The restaurants are so slow on it.
“When I started feeding vegan 13 years ago, everything was much more difficult - the New Zealander can find a development: “You have to talk to people, make them aware of it,
“If enough demand comes, they may be inclined to supplement the menu,” he hopes.
Vegan restaurants develop, such as the Compuse in Mannheim or the Café Vogelfrei.
Proctor wishes that other restaurants have at least a vegan dish on the menu.
Basically vegan dishes are there for everyone.
Everyone can eat them, so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive.
“In contrast, meat dishes are exclusive, in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others,” Proctor states.
“If you want to avoid food scandals, then veganism is a safe way to make the most of it impossible from the outset,” says Proctor.
Purchasing vegan products could be a bit difficult at first.
Especially if one learns to understand that animal additives can also be included in peanuts as dyes, one seems to leave quickly the courage with the observance of ethics in so many hurdles and traps.
Not only for this reason, Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen have written a book: “Veganissimo - Animal Ingredients and their Alternatives - explains the many ingredients that are added to food and also cleaning products.
“After and after you develop a scanner view and know what signs and logos you have to pay attention to, it’s sometimes better to do small steps than to stay standing or to stoop - know Proctor.
Veganism, he is an important moral sign that hits consciousness.
Perhaps he doesn't quite manage to put away his habits, but at least he can teach consumers to question his habits critically.
The stock market operator Nasdaq OMX keeps its customers breathing.
Trade in Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon German time.
In a communication, the operator was responsible for technical problems.
The other eleven U.S. options markets, including two of the Nasdaq OMX, continued their business unhindered.
The recent incident continues a whole series of smaller and larger panels with the stock market operator.
It was not until Tuesday that the Nasdaq indexes were not calculated for an hour due to data transport errors.
In August this year there had been two pans alone in one week.
First, the U.S. Investment Bank Goldman Sachs had sent massively faulty purchase orders to the option markets due to technical problems.
Then the stock market operators needed almost a whole day to look through the orders and delete them.
Two days later, half of the total share trading in the United States came for several hours due to a computer panel at the Nasdaq Stock Exchange.
In addition, the last year the Facebook stock market opened up.
The Nasdaq systems had not grown the flood of purchase and sales orders, later established the stock market supervision SEC and condemned the company to a record penalty of $10 million.
Constance: Radler drives 63-year-olds around
According to the police, the accident occurred when a 26-year-old man on Thursday evening, at about 22 o'clock, was on the left footpath from the station square towards the marketplace, with a women's bike.
When suddenly a 63-year-old man stepped from a local on the road, the cyclist, according to the police, could no longer brake in time.
During the following collision, the pedestrian was pushed against the wall of the house, went to the ground in the course, and drew a 15-centimeter square wound at the head.
A rescue car team brought the injured person to the hospital for medical treatment.
British police give Assange an extradition notice
The British police today handed a delivery notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard said that the 40-year-old Australians had been sent a call to stand up, which prompted him to appear in a police guard, and added that he should not comply with it, threatening him to be arrested.
Assange threatens the extradition to Sweden for the charge in a sexual offence after its possibilities under British law have been exhausted since the Supreme Court rejected its opposition to the extradition at the beginning of the month.
Fearing that Stockholm would deliver him to the United States, he had sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on 19 June and had asked the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard, “a 40-year-old man has sent an invitation to join a police guard at a time we chose,” said a spokesman.
He continues to violate the terms of his release on bail.
The message did not comment on the delivery of the police call.
Assange fears that he will be delivered by Sweden to the United States and charged there for possible espionage charges after having published over 250,000 diplomatic messages on the WikiLeaks disclosure website.
Drivers who have been rushed between legs at 210 km/h and hot drink receive £1000 penalty
A driver was sentenced to a fine of £1,000, because he was driven by up to 210 km/h and a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped on May 27th with his Mercedes Benz at the A120 at Braintree.
After the police stopped him, they discovered the drink cups between his legs.
In front of Colchester, Howie was known to be guilty without the necessary care and attention.
He received seven points and a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also sentenced to pay the costs of £90 and a victim's surcharge of £100.
Tax on foreign property owners against London's speculation bubble
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally calculated the CGT measure, but is still waiting for the final decision of Chancellor George Osborne, who had imposed a stamp tax of 7 % on apartments in the 2012 budget, costing more than two million pounds, and annual fees for buyers holding apartments as a company and not as individuals.
Already, the income from the stamping tax for residential property in the areas of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, which were at 708 million pounds in the 2012/13 tax year, now exceeds the proceeds for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the North-East, North-West, Yorkshire and the Humber region.
Cook said: “After the increase in stamp tax on high-priced dwellings and the introduction of related legislation against circumvention, it is difficult to claim that high-quality real estates are too low, regardless of the effects of the obsolete municipal tax system,
\"But this step could make some foreign investors more resilient as to the purchase of real estate in London, or hold owners off to sell it, he added.
First-class properties - the top five to ten percent of the housing market by price - in the prosperous London Southwest belt, which extends from Fulham to Wimbledon, have increased by the record value of 11.8% last year.
The prices in Central London showed an even annual growth of 5.6% but were overestimated by an emerging domestic market, where the southwestern part of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) experienced an upward trend, according to Savills.
Scientists have been able to shed more light on the connection between the tails of a dog and its mood.
Previous research had shown that happy dogs with the tail were weighing more to the right (from the point of view of the dog), while in the case of nervous dogs it was the left side.
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive these subtle differences and react to them.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trent, said: “It is well known in humans that the left and right brain halves react differently to stimuli that produce positive or negative emotions,
Here we have tried to see this in other species.
He also noted that in dogs, just like humans, the right half of the brain is responsible for the movement of the left side and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the feelings.
In order to learn more about how dogs react to the lateral tails of their counterparts, the researchers monitored the animals while watching these films of other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the four legs and analyzed the behavior.
Probably we will soon understand why the tail moves in one direction, once in a while, in the other direction
Professor Vallortigara said: \"We showed the dogs movies with dogs - either a natural version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects, and we were able to control the movement of the tail more to the left or to the right,
When the animals saw a otherwise unexpressed dog move the tail to the right (seeing from the perspective of the weaving dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But when the tail inclination was mainly to the left (again from the dog's perspective, which is weeding), her heart rate increased and they looked restless.
According to Professor Vallortigara, the dogs do not communicate deliberately with each other through these movements.
Rather, he is convinced that the dogs have learned from experience in which movements they should worry about and when not.
He said: “If you have different encounters with other dogs and the welding with the tail in one direction is more linked to friendly behavior and the right side is more likely to produce a less friendly behavior, then you react on the basis of these experiences,”
The researchers say that the findings could help dog owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand the emotions of their animal.
John Bradshaw, expert on dog behaviour and host doctor at the Faculty of Animal Health at Bristol University, explained that this was not the first study to examine whether left and right for dogs was important.
Last year, a University of Lincoln team found out that dogs turn their heads to the left when they see an aggressive dog, and to the right when it's a satisfied dog.
Another research at the University of Victoria, Canada, stated: “Hunds are more likely to go to a robotic dog when his “swance” is tethered to the left rather than to become restless rather than restless, just as in the Italian study,
According to his statement, the differences could therefore touch that the dogs in the various studies did not interpret the animals in the movies or the robotic dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help, he explained.
“There is indeed considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brain halves are used for different purposes, but many of the details still have to be determined, and dogs do not make any exception,” Bradshaw says.
But since their behavior is easy to record, it probably won't take long until we understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction, sometimes in the other.
Move Arctic Monkeys appearance in Glasgow because of Alex Turners disease
The rock band Arctic Monkeys has moved to Glasgow after her lead singer was infected with throat inflammation.
The band from Sheffield was supposed to play in Hydro on Friday.
However, due to the disease of the lead singer Alex Turner, the concert must now be moved.
The announcement of the band came after she had had to move to the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys announced: \"After deciding to cancel the show at the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and at medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys must also cancel the show at the Hydro in Glasgow on Friday, November 1st, \"
“In Alex Turner, an inflammation of the throat has been diagnosed, which is why he can’t, unfortunately, occur.
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will take place on 20 November, which was moved to 21 November in the Hydro in Glasgow.
Keep all tickets valid for these shows.
We apologize to all ticket holders for the inconveniences caused by this.

Pope Francis appoints first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will for the first time call new cardinals of the Catholic Church on 22 February, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope and they are also those who choose a Pope, so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor.
Currently there are 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal, who has reached an age of 80 years, can no longer participate in the Pope's election - which is due to a group of 120 - electoral cardinals.
In a statement in which the message was announced, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman of the Vatican, said that a meeting of all cardinals would take place before the ceremony was held to appoint the new cardinals, also known as the Consistorium.
“Papst Francis has decided to announce in advance his decision to convene the Consistorium in February so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from all over the world can be planned,” said Lombardi.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of elective cardinals would probably have fallen by February.
He explained that a Pope usually appoints as many cardinals as necessary so that the number of elective cardinals will be 120 again, and as many cardinals as 80 as he wants.
The Consistorium next year is therefore significant because it was the first one since Francis' election in March this year, says Valero.
At present, there is a certain overhang on the side of Europe and, in particular, Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new Pope will appoint Cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance,” he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
The cardinals will also be the first to be appointed since the formation of the Council of Cardinals founded by Francis, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world, who are commissioned to find ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything alone.
“Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him,” Valero said.
He explained that it was \"good possible\" that Francis asked the Cardinals for advice.
But we haven't been in this situation so far - that's all new.
Valero said that the bishops from large places would typically be called to cardinals, but Franzisku's \"full surprises\" are so we don't know who he appoints,
GM calls new pickup trucks back in the USA to repair seatrest
General Motors calls back almost 19,000 of its brand-new Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks with construction year 2014 to solve a problem with the manually adjustable seat loan, according to a notice from the U.S. regulatory authority for vehicle safety on Friday.
For some of the cars, there may be a defect in the mechanism for resetting the front seat.
For this reason, they do not comply with the Federal Directives on vehicle safety in the case of headrests.
“If driven from the rear to the vehicle, it is possible that the head restraint does not properly protect the occupants, so that there is an increased risk of injury, was read in the message on the website of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).
The recovered models were manufactured between 1 August and 10 September.
The delivery of GM trucks began in June and is the main model launch of the leading US car manufacturer since the insolvency-related restructuring of 2009.
GM informed vehicle owners about the defect in the first half of October.
The NHTSA was unable to verify the notification letter due to the 16-day Government Shutdown, which had a negative impact on car sales in October.
The sale of the Silverado and Sierra trucks, which were redeveloped for the 2014 model year, increased by 20 percent in the first ten months of the year, said GM on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks.
The GM share rose by 1.4 percent on the New York Stock Exchange to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
Controversy of a Obama voter
I have twice elected President Obama in the hope that change would be possible
He says Obama has made commendable efforts to defeat the Republican blockade tactics
The blockade policy does not excuse Obamacare's website problems, the drone attacks
Obama's memoirs about the 2008 election campaign are a sad reminder of what would have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student at Harvard Medical School in the second year.
I am currently reading a terrible sad book.
It's a book I've believed in, it would open me up and give me hope during the sad second year of my medical studies.
It is called \"The Audacity to Win\" (Mut to Win) and describes the memoirs of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential election.
When I'm done with my patient downtime writing and going to bed in the evening, the book leads me back to a time when the politics was able to breathe millions inspired and a talk.
The election was held as a victory for the earth and news speakers in order to bring the historic significance of this hour to the fore.
My classmates cried for joy and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on their way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama moved to office in 2008, he had 82% approval.
And then I'll close the book.
Switching back to the present is an evil awakening as if one were being torn out of a dream.
It is hard to remember these optimistic times - they seem to be a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I first gave up my vote, something has actually changed.
But it's just nothing I could have imagined.
I recognize the great and versatile things Obama has achieved, from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for Health Insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the forced disappearance of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I also believe that party political blockade tactics have sparked too many aspirations with which our nation should be brought forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closing of Guantanamo Bay to name just a few.
But after I defended the Obama government to colleagues and acquaintances countless times, I ended my explanations.
I have reached a point of political despair.
The Republican blockade policy cannot explain why you allow the hearing of foreign heads of state or the killing of innocent children by drones in overseas.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on the private lives of Americans and why whistleblowers are punished, revealing state misconduct.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen, was murdered without proceedings, and why the public funding and expenditure limits will be removed during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the results of a report stating that the White House's efforts to restore the media are the most “aggressive ... since the Nixon government”
And most recently, it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in which more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if it's what I should have expected.
Whether I should have understood with 18 that government work could have contradicted the previous political campaigns.
Clearly, this is not a predictable course, since an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre are shaping the public debate.
But if I look at the above examples, they seem to have been largely elected by the government itself.
And that's what bothers me most.
I chose Obama again in 2012, not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and unexplained alternative, he seemed unable to determine his direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfill the hope we had heard for so long.
But with the decline of the consent values for Obama to under 45% this week, the return to 2008 by this book has become even harder.
It awakens in me the longing for the many promises that have dissolved in the air.
This week I read a section in the book describing how Obama had to face a heavy loss against Clinton in the elections in Pennsylvania.
In a meeting with the election assistants after the decision, he told his employees that they would have to come back to course and follow the purpose of their case.
“I want us to find our magic again,” he said.
We have to remember who we are.
It's five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't give you any more approval.
The views expressed in this comment are exclusively those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has conflict of interest in parental leave
The billionaire and MEP Clive Palmer say that Prime Minister Tony Abbott was in a conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave because his daughters became pregnant and could therefore benefit from it.
The mining magnate, who is in a judicial dispute over the payment of $6 million to CO2 tax, raised the claim when he wanted to wipe out questions from the table as to whether he was in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which are important for deciding whether to delete or cut CO2 and mining taxes.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and the daughters of Abbott would personally benefit from the laws.
“He’s in a big conflict of interest when it’s about paid parental leave, because when one of his daughters gets pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether she gets a vacation or not,” Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Election Commission of Palmer declared with 53 votes the lead after the renumber officially the winner of the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax.
Palmer called for a review of the voting count process so that it could go faster.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote?
“We need a better system,” he said.
Why should we not have a system in which to march, enter the data into a computer, select it immediately and then have the result at 6:30 in the evening?
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils when marking the ballot.
Are you using them because you can then erase the results if you don't like them?
Today, matching with pencils is incredible.
The Electoral Commission has examined the options for an electronic election and recently published a joint bill with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, declared that his policy was an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new office very seriously.
A public office is concerned with the public service.
“We do not seek any reward except for history, that we can serve in a critical time of this community,” he said.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two dealers from its foreign exchange department, two of whom are familiar with the situation; this is another indication that the worldwide public investigation into the alleged manipulations in the currency market is rapidly moving.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they are working with the authorities in the world's largest financial market investigations, on which $5.3 billion per day changes the owner.
The two dealers would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the extended investigation that the scandal is about the Libor interbanking business.
The Bank, which did not comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received information requests from authorities.
“Our investigations on this issue continue and we cooperate fully with the FCA and other regulatory authorities,” said the Bank two weeks ago.
Last month, the related persons indicated that the RBS had forwarded the records of emails and instant messages sent by and to a former dealer to the UK Supervisory Authority, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This dealer, Richard Usher, had left the RBS 2010 and is now to have been left by his current position as European head of the Forex-Spot trade with JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of the European Spot Trading at Citi, was left this week, and Matt Gardiner, former leading currency dealer at Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week at Standard Chartered.
None of these traders were accused of any misconduct.
Bankers belonged to the instant message group of Usher at Barclays and the Citigroup, the situation said nearby people.
UBS announced this week that it has taken steps against some of its employees, after the Swiss regulatory authority Finma explained that they are investigating an alleged manipulation of the foreign exchange market in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities worldwide - the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Competition Authority Weko, the FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - are currently dealing with allegations that bankers should have agreed on transactions in the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also initiated internal investigations or received information requests from authorities, said familiar persons with the situation.
Banks scan instant messages and emails from several years in search of cases of misconduct.
The news about these investigations has put the dealers in a standstill area, which in recent years has been one of the most profitable trading units of investment banks, but this year was under pressure because low volatility in currencies limits the chances for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the affair and said that it is almost impossible to manipulate the expanded and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true.
A leading dealer noted that despite the enormous daily volume of foreign exchange trading, fragmentation of liquidity between the different trading platforms and the increasing use of internal platforms by banks led to the fact that “with very low ticket prices, one can already influence the market”
The message came out on the same day when Credit Suisse announced that this week she had terminated a dealer of her London Exchange Traded Funds office after he had caused a loss of almost six million dollars at the end of last year.
The Bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with them.
“We are sure that the dealer has acted alone and that the matter has been restrained,” said Credit Suisse.
Painted the fence on the Bechtle base
A group of the citizens' initiative, Schweizer Wiese, has refined the construction fence on the Bechtle base at the spa promenade in Bad Herrenalb.
In addition, she cleaned and broadened the footpath, says it in a press release.
The planned cover of the decaying house in the rear part of the property had not been allowed for safety reasons, because the site is threatening to slip off.
Alfred Abel, who is currently managing the property, had agreed to make the painting action with his colleague Reinhard Domke from the BI.
Prior to the action of the BI, a transparent message with the message “We are for this purpose” had been applied.
However, this did little to disturb the 20 members of the citizens' initiative.
Your motto on the big poster was \"We are against ruins\"
So she wanted to point out the danger of even larger ruins on the Swiss meadow - should one day fail the giant project.
In a discussion with many passersby in front of the construction site, it became clear that some citizens believe that it will be much better to implement the project in the city, although not a few have the same questions about the dimension of the project presented as the BI.
But they start to resign because the city is further delaying these answers, it says from the side of the BI.
As was heard, the mayor's public statements also have an effect.
In May, at the municipal council meeting, he had said he feared the break for the thermal bath, the population should vote against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex on the Swiss meadow.
Some appear to be just too scared, others feel they are \"plumpening extortion\" in the population, according to the BI press release.
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all the helpers.
Rangnick Shelts for Schiris: Mane no Schwalbenkönig
As satisfied as Ralf Rangnick is with the current high-form of the Bundesliga table leader Red Bull Salzburg, the sports director of the \"bullen\" was disappointed by the arbitrators.
“There is currently a dangerous trend for Mane and Alan to be pushed into the Schwalbenkönige category, which he protected on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg.
The recent occasion for Rangnick's criticism was yellow for Mane at 3:0 against Grödig last Sunday, where Senegalese became a supposed actress for the hangover - which was, of course, none of the TV shows.
“A craziness of wrong decision - said Rangnick, the arbitrator Harkam referred to as ‘fullly challenged’.
In addition, Harkam would have contributed to the escalation between Salzburg-Coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig-Trainer Adi Hütter after the party.
He defended his German statesman: “I would have behaved the same as Roger Schmidt in every situation.
Schmidt himself does not want to have any contact with his colleagues after the shambles with Hütter.
I don't know why.
\"For I am the one who has been insulted, emphasized the 46-year-old.
In the face of the success race, however, Randnick agreed to a lobeshymne.
“There are only two words for this: Rightly good - he stated.
There's not much to put out.
Especially the way the team plays is impressive.
It's supposed to go on.
Framework changes in winter transfer time will hardly exist.
There are no great reasons to change something.
“With the desire to leave the club, a player has made it clear that he wants to leave the club.
Supreme Court Confirms Obama's Health Act
It is a great victory for the Obama government: the US Supreme Court decided today that the closely linked health law with Barack Obama is constitutional.
With five to four votes, the judges ruled that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act - it forces U.S. citizens to complete a health insurance or pay a penalty by 2014 - is constitutional in the context of the State's tax authority.
The Supreme Judge John Roberts struck the side of the four more liberal members of the Chamber, while the judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito, and Kennedy decided against it.
The Court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2700-page law and also considered that the provision of the health law, according to which states would either extend the access requirements for Medicaid or otherwise delete all state Medicaid claims, would not be constitutionally restrictive.
The lawsuit against the law was filed by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law had been rejected by all leading Republican presidential candidates, including the ultimate challenger Mitt Romney, in the 2012 pre-election campaign.
Norway: Norwegian place makes light with giant mirrors
With huge mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian village have brought light into their dark valley.
Due to the low degree of sunfall, the Rjukan, located in the Vestfjord Valley, is usually sinking in the shade of the surrounding mountains from fall to spring.
With three gigantic reflectors at 45 meters altitude, a century-long dream occurred on Wednesday.
“Finally,” Mayor Steinar Bergsland swarmed at the start ceremony in TV2 broadcasting.
Some of the people in the valleys had sun chairs facing each other, while others had sunglasses in safety.
Up until now, the sun-hungry had to drive with a cable car to a nearby peak in winter.
Ten years ago, local artist Martin Andersen presented the proposal to direct the rays into the valley with mirrors.
This basic idea, however, has been in place since 1913.
After several years of debate, the City Council finally adopted the 5 million crowns (about 615 000 euros) of expensive project.
A similar construction for several years has provided the Italian Alpine town of Viganella with winter sunshine.
Post hardly empty on Sundays
“Many citizens will not have noticed yet, the red points for Sunday lessons are still at different mailboxes of the core city and the city parts, but you can read the small print on the yellow containers of Post AG, you can quickly find out that the emptying of Sundays and holidays is no longer taking place,” FDP tells.
An application from the FDP confirmed this.
On Sundays and holidays only before the post office building in Ernst-Ludwig-Straße 36 and in Jakob-Müller-Straße 1 in Hüttenfeld will be emptied.
Whether there is still Sunday empty in Hofheim and Rosengarten will not be answered in response to FDP's request.
The social and youth political spokesman of the FDP, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to follow up here.
Sunday lessons are an important postal service right on schedule mail.
\"This thins this enterprise out radically and inescapably despite the increase in the price for letters on January 2013,
Thomas Bittner, chairman of the Liberal Group and the Stadtverbandsanstalt der Liberalen, supports his colleagues: \"What angers me is the fact that here, the emptying times are changed or even deleted,
Nearby, the post is miles away.
“At least the letter boxes in the districts of Neuschloß and Rosengarten have to be emptied again on Sundays,” says Bittner and Röhrenbeck unisono.
Even for the core city, especially not mobile citizens would have to be able to reach a letter box with Sunday lessons.
In the city parliament, Röhrenbeck asked whether the city administration was planning discussions with the post on this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the mail did not communicate with Lampertheim.
His knowledge, however, was also given a Sunday lecture in Hofheim.
Your party has spoken out for privatisations.
“Then decisions are taken elsewhere,” Maier said.
Frankfurt Park fees are expected to rise strongly
Parking in Frankfurt could soon be very expensive.
The city's Magistrate advises today in the morning about a presentation of traffic department Stefan Majer (Green).
According to this, parking fees are to be increased by 50 percent.
However, the price should not be increased, but the time interval of parking watches and parking lights should be reduced from 30 to 20 minutes.
In December, the City Ordinance Assembly will have to decide.
The IHK Frankfurt Retail Committee considers this \"no good idea\"
The parking opportunity immediately before the business is \"an unsurprising advantage for smaller dealers\"
The Verkehrsclub Deutschland believes that an increase after two decades is, in fact, reasonable and, for a long time, overdue.
Public transport is also becoming more expensive.
Freudenstadt: Quick Actions Overrumpling Hosts
With a narrow frame the gentlemen I of the TSV Freudenstadt had to enter the Schiller Schulturnhalle in Reutlingen against the TG Gönningen of the Swabian Alb.
The Älblers stood with an experienced team on the other side of the network.
Soon, however, it became apparent that, also due to age, they could not fully keep up with the rapid actions of the joyful cities .
The Gönninger did a lot of hard work with the hard and placed stops.
Repeatedly they missed the passes and attacks played by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz over the net center and were not in place during the block defence.
Two high first prizes clearly expressed the superiority of the joyful cities in all interests.
In view of this oppressive and game-determining performance, the third sentence was then somewhat lax and unsatisfied at the 3rd grade (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
There, on November 2nd, with the TV Baiersbronn, which was able to pass clearly in Nagold, there will be a much more powerful opponent on the field.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B class, the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt were opposed in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.
They delivered a fierce two-hour match.
Nervosity on both sides caused errors and points when taking the ball; even in the passes, the precision was sometimes a deficiency and in some critical play scenes, the superior prevented the view for possible score gains.
In this highly balanced meeting, however, Marcus Blasutto's TSV team was in line with the great physical commitment and a happy commitment of both teams.
Day of care in the small English cottage
For the fifth day of care in the aftermath of the Natura 2000 project above Hotzenwald, a group of dedicated participants met at the small English cottage in Ibach.
On that day, in the area of the hut, the view into the valley was to be cut off, thanks to suggestions from the population, said Mayor Helmut Kaiser.
Many hikers, according to Emperors, described this area as the glamour of the Schlugensteig, on which the landscape offers the ideal setting for magnificent views.
He thanked those present for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the day of care was an appropriate instrument to strengthen the connection between man and nature.
He offers every citizen the opportunity to put accents in nature.
At the same time as the tourist aspect could also be considered ecologically.
Friederike Tribukait explained this ecological aspect by the Department of Nature Conservation of the Government Bureau of Freiburg following the welcome by Landrat Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the patronage and wished the action a good success.
According to Tribukait, the tourist aim of the wide view is to preserve the old allmendweid field with its specific protected habitat types by opening and connecting to the still existing pastures.
Certain species, such as rare butterflies and grasshoppers, cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areas.
You need these free connections to maintain the species.
Tribubait said that at this point they would not fail to break a lance for the planned biosphere area.
In this planning, the current measure is not only seamless.
A biosphere area also offers the opportunity for sustainable economic and environmental development on the basis of the internationally recognized Unesco status and thus a continuous complement to the life project and the previous days of maintenance for the future.
After these various versions, Revierführer Christoph Wehle and Life Project Manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the helpers into groups.
The larger trees had already been beaten in advance, if necessary the forslepper was ready to be retrieved.
A group of helpers should take care of the release of vacholderbüschen and the care of a drying stone bar.
The aim was the free view at the vantage point.
Löffingen: Köpfler still only candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the Baarstädtchen Löffingen with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a trend-setting school, children's, youth and senior policy, as well as its own urban activities, has not yet reached a second mayoral candidate.
As the only candidate for the succession of senior mayor Norbert Brugger, the 46-year-old bank buyer and business owner Dieter Köpfler from Löffingen, has been established.
The application deadline expires at 6 p.m. on Monday 11 November.
Google, Samsung, Huawei sued for Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of previous Nortel patents, filed an avalanche of lawsuits on Thursday for patent infringements against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, the company that was offered by Nortel during the insolvency auction.
Rockstar, the consortium that had bought Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringements before the U.S. Court of Appeal in Texas.
Rockstar is located in the joint ownership of Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of patent infringement in seven cases.
The patents involve technology that brings search terms into line with relevant advertising on the Internet, so the complaint that thus meets the core of Google's search engine business.
Representatives from Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately reachable.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC produce mobile phones that work with Google's Android operating system, which is in sharp competition with Apple's and Microsoft's mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial bid of over $900 million for the Nortel patents.
Google increased its offer several times and lastly offered $4.4 billion.
After it was offered to Rockstar's Nortel patents, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a business that was also partly motivated by Motorola's library of patents.
“Although Google has failed with its attempt to acquire the patent at auction, Google has violated the patents and continues to do so, according to the letter of appeal.
Rockstar demands a high compensation from Google, as it claims that Google's patent infringement is intentional, according to the accusation.
Egypt defends first freely elected president
Mohammed Mursi deposes the term of office, but his day of triumph should not mean the end of political disputes in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammed Mursi promised a \"new Egypt\" when he was the first freely elected president of the country and thus succeeded Husni Mubarak, who had been expelled from office 16 months earlier.
With his entry before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi also became the first freely elected Islamic president of the Arab world and Egypt's fifth head of state since the fall of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He laid the oath before the 18 men dressed in black robes of the court, who had his seat on the Nile and was found in an ancient Egyptian temple.
“We are striving for a better future, for a new Egypt and for a second republic,” said Mursi at the ceremony, which was broadcast live on state television.
“Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundation for a new life, absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability,” said Mursi, a U.S.-educated engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group, who since its founding 84 years ago had mostly been used as a forbidden organization by the respective government to visit.
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building when Mursi arrived in a small car convoy shortly after eleven o'clock.
Only a few hundred followers had gathered in court to cheer up the new president, and unlike the presidential prunk from Mubarak era, traffic was stopped only temporarily, so that the car convoy could cross the normally lively road that connects the city center to the southern suburbs.
As an uncharismatic, replacement wheel, the brotherhood has mocked his personal prestige since his victory and a Friday speech, in which he not only presented himself as the candidate of the Islamists but all those who wanted to target the efforts of the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian Mubarak.
\"Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional, and modern state,\" said Mursi, dressed in a blue suit with red tie, to the judges in the wood-tipped chamber in which he placed the oath of office.
Later, Mursi moved to Cairo University, where he was supposed to hold his accession speech.
He was officially welcomed by an army chapel, which played the national anthem, which he listened to in havoc.
The military leader Feldmarschall Hussein Tantawi was present.
Upon his arrival, he was welcomed by hundreds of people in the university's largest hearing room with speakers of \"The army and the people are a hand\".
The University of Cairo, built in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, has developed into a high-ranking Islamist group in the 1970s.
On Friday, Mursi made a symbolic oath on the Tahir Square, the birthplace of the uprising, which led to the end of the authoritarian rule of Mubaraks last year, and he vowed to reclaim presidential powers that the military council had taken over from the head of state chased out of office.
But with the removal of the official oath before the court, and not as usual before Parliament, he bows to the will of the military, indicating that the struggle for power will continue.
Mursis' speech on the Tahir square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Falkenberger Discothek provides two great evenings
The new season in the Falkenberg Discothek - Blue Velvet - has begun.
On this Friday evening it is called \"Pump this party\" on the morning Saturday evening we continue with an Ü 25 party.
Fat beats and cool sounds are promised by the organizers of course on both days.
Workers fell from ladders: seriously injured
On Thursday, a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg fell from a ladder and was seriously injured.
The man from Lamprechtshausen wanted to replace a defective heater on the outside façade of a guesthouse.
As he got up to the ladder, he slipped away, and the man fell on the concrete floor.
He suffered serious injuries and was brought to Salzburg with the rescue helicopter, Christophorus 6.
Violent in South Africa: twice life imprisonment
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the perpetrator was sentenced to twice a lifetime on Friday.
This was reported by the SABC transmitter.
The victim was later killed by the consequences of the serious injuries.
Johannes Kana had already been found guilty at the beginning of the week of the crime.
The act had caused abstinence throughout the country.
The 21-year-old had raped Anene Booysen in February in an industrial site in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
14 hours the doctors fought for the victim's survival, but in vain.
The view of the young people was so terrible that the nurses and sisters needed psychological assistance.
Kana had been in a bar during the process of having been in the office of Booysen at the time of the trial.
He also managed to beat and rape her, but he decided to be responsible for the girl's death.
The police had initially been out of custody by several perpetrators, but released two suspects because the evidence against them was insufficient.
The prosecutor also stressed during the trial that she was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
Rape is almost everyday in South Africa: about 64,000 ads are available every year for sexual violence.
These are almost ten times as much as in Germany, but with 82 million people, they have significantly more inhabitants than South Africa (50 million).
However, police and women's associations in South Africa estimate the dark numbers in sexual violence to be between 10 and 25 times.
Jumbo visits the Black Forest ham
Jumbo looking for the best ham in the world: For the TV show \"Galileo\" visited the Pro7 star Bonndorf.
At the beginning, the speaker makes it clear: The most important thing for the ham is the pork cows, turbomast is not a good condition.
Can ham you get in any supermarket be a quality product?
Jumbo explains the operation of the company \"Adler\" in Bonndorf as head of the big ham factory in the Black Forest.
\"Germany's favorite hams - as Jumbo announces the Black Forest ham.
Only with hair protection and kittel, he comes inside the factory.
Jumbo also has to disinfect his hands before he can reach the micro.
Jumbo facet for strengthening at fast-biting in Waldshut
\"I'm going to be working on huge quantities here - the TV makers, black forests ham as a mass product are amazed.
16,000 cows per week speak for themselves.
Weight, fat content, color: Uli explains what quality matters.
Most pigs are slaughtered at six months.
Television with level?
Details such as the ph-value of the flesh also play a role.
The darker the flesh, the higher the ph value.
“I’m excited if you measure Roberto Blanco what happens then, so Jumbo is cynical.
Here the level of private television is presented in pure culture.
But watching is still worth it.
The viewer sees that the dismantling of the cows is still manual work.
Because: Black forest ham is traditionally found without bones in the shelf.
The secret of ham is the spice mixture with the salt.
Smoking tower and smoke fire, Jumbo optically reminds of a submarine
The trick: Tanning branches provide the special taste of Black Forest ham in smoke.
20 days in smoke make the ham almost black.
\"Now the disc in the Jumbo disappears - he announces the test feed.
“It’s really delicious, so it’s the conclusion of the TV star.
This will enable everyone involved to live.
You thought travel agencies belong to the past thanks to the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to resist the trend.
The company has increased its profit prospects for the whole year and expects record revenue from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The travel company now proceeds from a adjusted annual profit before taxes between 325 and 340 million dollars, compared to 305 to 315 million dollars in its previous forecast.
If the current target values are reached, this means an increase of 12 to 17 percent compared to the record profit of $290.4 million over the period 2011/12.
As Managing Director Graham Turner announced, Flight Centre achieved eight percent profit in the first half of the year and booked a strong start in the second half of the year, especially in the Australian and British private business.
\"Since the beginning of the year, our ten countries have been profitable, and some of them are well in the direction of record year revenues before interest and taxes, he said.
These include Australia and the United Kingdom, which are typically among our strongest sources.
In Australia, the leisure industry has recovered in the second half of the year, which is a slightly weaker market for business trips.
It was similar well for Flight Centre's leisure business in Great Britain, while business customers were also less willing to spend.
The US business recovered from the more seasonally weaker first half of the year, so a profit is expected for the third year as a result.
Flight Centre shares rose by 3 cents to 38.20 dollars yesterday.
Schools are held to greater focus on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In courses on English literature, students will have to treat at least a piece of Shakespeare, a 19th century novel, romantic lyric and contemporary British novels from 1914 onwards.
In the exam you will also find “unseen texts” input to encourage more broad reading.
The combined course from English literature and language is abolished.
From 2015 onwards, students will have to conduct an independent GCSE examination for language, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Ministry of Education will publish the new lesson plans for English and mathematics tomorrow, the first subjects to be radically remodeled.
Other core compartments will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the Audit Supervisory Authority, will announce a reorganisation of the GCSE structures, including a new funding system and less course work.
In a summer speech, Minister of Education Michael Gove said that there is a “wide consensus that we need to reform our audit system in order to restore public trust, while stressing that the GCSEs would become “require, more ambitious and stricter.”
Studies show that less time is spent on mathematics in English schools - 116 hours a year or three hours a week per school year - than in most other countries.
On the other hand, Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours a year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours.
While there will not be a formal requirement to spend more time on mathematics in the hourly schedule, coalition circles say that the comprehensive math test, combined with a stronger weighting of the specialist in rankings, is likely to encourage schools to spend more hours.
The curriculum focuses more attention on \"problems from real life\", including financial mathematics.

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Talk Forum
At the next Ecumenical Talk Forum on Monday, 21 October, in the New Museum of the Castle, the topic \"For Hell with Hell - Theological Considerations for Today's Dealing with the Last Things\"
The speaker is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenical Talk Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Evangelical Churches Salem, Salem Castle and Lake Constance Cultural Office.
Johanna Rahner wants to go into the forum of the question of how people today measure the \"last things\" after death.
If people had known too much about it in the past centuries, putting on those images of heaven and hell, which to this day shape our ideas, the contemporary prophetic teaching of hope for completion would rather be drawn by some embarrassment or even speechlessness.
“The greater hope is that Christians have been driven out by religious criticism,” says the speaker.
They have “supplied us with so many question marks that the exclamation marks seem to have come off us”
Johanna Rahner continues: \"But the crucial challenge remains the trouble of death,
The question is related to that desire, which “is dreaming that in the end everything may be good”,
Johanna Rahner, born 1962 in Baden-Baden, studied Catholic Theology and Biology at the University of Freiburg from 1982 to 1989.
She graduated in 1997 from Dr. Theol., also in Freiburg.
The Habilitation for Fundamental Theology and Ecumenical Theology followed in 2003 at the Westphalian Wilhelms University.
Since 2010, Johanna Rahner has held a Chair of Systematic Theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel.
Geislingen: More than 100 young Catholics from the Kleine Heuberg confirm their faith in the firm
In two religious services 101 15- and 16-year-olds of the soul care unit Am Kleinen Heuberg have been confirmed.
In the morning, the group was accompanied by Laudato-Si, in the afternoon of the Youth Choir The Spirit.
With the reception of the firm's sacrament, the young people said Yes to their baptism and asked for the power of the Holy Spirit.
In recent months, under the direction of Diakon Reiner Dehner and the assistance of numerous parishioners, the firmmen have prepared themselves for the big holiday.
In different projects they met various tasks of Christian community life and together they experienced the Youth Day in Untermachtal.
Illmensee: Second mountain bike race excited participants
In wonderful weather, 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to take the round course across the hill chains around the lake.
This is shared by Ulrich Knobel of the organizing Illmensee Sports Association.
Among the participants were, in particular at a short distance of over 15 kilometres and 300 metres, also numerous anyone who wanted to practice their hobby once in a competitive atmosphere.
Two junior riders of the German top class were also at the start of this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation of good placements at the German Championships.
Both of these were expected to set themselves off from the field.
As in the previous year, Felix Bader was able to save a small time advance to the goal and defended his title as the overall winner of the short distance.
In place two, Pascal Treubel was again able to place himself.
With the ladies it was Theresa Duelli from the team nightmare that made it all the way up to the winning staircase.
Anne Adel from Illmensee and Leonie's drivers from Owingen came in place two and three.
An enjoyable development is the increasing number of drivers who live or work in the community.
Not only in terms of performance, the whole range of athletes was represented.
The age structure also ranged from ten years in the youngest up to over 70 years in the oldest starters.
In the main race this year were even more absolute topathletes at the start.
Four riders were able to set off from the regional top drivers.
This includes Philipp Pangerl, a mountain bike half-professor of the Black Tusk Racing team.
Pangerl, together with a teammate, was already World Champion in the Twelve-Hour Tour twice.
This year he became European champion in this special discipline.
With it also Roland Ballerstedt, who already calls two German champions in the Duathlon his own.
After 45 kilometres and 900 metres of altitude, the final eyelash came in front of the three-seas hall.
Pangerl was the first to cross the finish line.
Only one second after that, the Routinian Ballerstedt was able to secure the second place in the overall score.
At the same time, Hermann and Warthmann came to the goal as a third of the overall score.
Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest in the main race.
The second place was secured by Areane Blersch from Binzwangen in front of Natasha Werner from Stuttgart.
Sportsmen and helpers were very pleased with the smooth and well-organized course of the event.
On the way through mud, rivers and jungles for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical help to remote villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients
In the West African country there are not many doctors, only one for 5,000 people
Distinguish here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 of the “CNN Heroes of 2013”
You can vote for him or one of the other heroes in the top 10 to choose him as the \"CNN Hero of the Year\".
The winner receives $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years George's Bwelle saw his sick father lose consciousness and travel to hospitals that did not have the means to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon, in 1981.
At first he had only one broken arm, but then an inflammation spread to his brain and caused a hematoma to affect him for the rest of his life.
\"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon, according to Georges Bwelle.
We would've brought him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father in overcrowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer.
“It’s not easy, Bwelle comments.
You can leave the house at five o'clock in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, and you're not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has hardly changed since Bwell's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
On the other hand, the relationship in the United States is with a doctor for 413 people.
But even if there was a doctor for her, most Camerooners would not be able to make the visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and nearly three quarters of health expenditure in the country are private.
“The only problem they have is poverty,” says Bwelle.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
His father and so many of his countrymen suffered to see in Bwelle the decision to do something against it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team performed 700 free operations last year.
He became a doctor himself and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a non-profit organisation called ASCOVIME, which travels on weekends in rural areas offering free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped almost 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people force themselves into small buses and drive with the snorkeled medical equipment on the roof over unconfirmed terrain into the villages that need help.
Not always, everything goes smoothly.
More than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they will receive as heroes: a feast, singing and dancing and the best accommodation the place has to offer.
In these villages free medical care is really a reason for celebrating and bwelling - with its broad smile and its limitless energy - is happy to attend the joyful celebration.
The next morning the team will start investigating hundreds of patients.
“We treat 500 people per ride, according to Bwelle.
They come from a radius of 60 kilometers around the village - and that on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites, and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive groceries, donated glasses, or free birth certificates - a document required for school, but many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations with local deception.
The operations usually take place in a school, town hall or apartment; after the intervention, the patients get up and go into the recreation area to make room for the next.
The lighting for the OP and disinfection equipment is fed by the generator of the group, so Bwelle and his volunteers work until early morning hours on Sunday.
It is a strenuous pensum, but village musicians usually help to keep the team motivated.
“They are drumming all night so that we can stay awake and continue our work,” says Bwelle.
On Sunday the team will go back to town, tired but proud of the work done.
The group, a mix of Cameroon doctors and foreign medical students, has performed 700 free operations last year and knows that their work makes a huge difference to the people they help.
One man explained that the free operation of a lease that he had received now enabled him to work again.
“This changes the future of my family,” the man said.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon at the hospital, Bwelle also works in private clinics in Yaoundé at night.
With this second job he financed 60% of his non-profit activity, says Bwelle; the rest come from private donations.
“I really don’t know when to sleep,” says Katie O’Malley, who studied medicine in the second year at Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteered to work in Bwelles Group.
He is always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so that he can go to these campaigns.
For medical and health care students such as O'Malley, who come from the USA and Europe and support Bwelle, this is an opportunity to gain practical experience that they would never get at home.
“We can be in surgery where we help to drain blood or keep the instruments for Dr. Bwelle,” explains O’Malley.
This would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
Students usually pay their journey to Cameroon themselves and bring frequently donated sanity material.
But first they are in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes over the accommodation, transport and guidance.
“He’s no doubt a hero,” says O’Malley.
He dedicates his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroon people knows no limits.
For Bwelle, almost constant work is not a burden.
Help others to live a happier life and thus fulfill a promise he has given his father, gives him great joy.
“I’m so happy when I do this work,” Bwelle says.
And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do it to bring people back to laugh and to relieve the pain.

Excellent championed the battle
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingways Novelle, \"The old man and the sea\", Horst Janson is cut to the body.
Janson himself is an old hare in his metier, acting art.
The old man Santiago can't shape anything during fishing.
So the two just add up great.
It is almost meant to be able to see the folds in the neck of the old man of whom the fishing boy Manolo speaks.
If Santiago is tired of life bent on the chair, this is true of Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman is through and through a role of character that Janson masters excellently.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a courageous man who does not give up and ultimately wins the battle against the fish through his knowledge and also his willpower.
Janson is on stage on a wide scale as a solo performer.
He manages to focus attention on himself, so that his monologues are not a moment of boredom.
His efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the viewers forget that the sea is made up of only blue illuminated water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man act in the boat in front of the fishing village.
In the course of the performance, he puts the active scene into the light: Santiago's hut, the bar of singer Marie-Luise, which, with her songs and her magnificent voice, sings the life-feel of Cuba.
The four musicians play Cuba's rhythm and are guests of the bar at the same time.
Tourism: descent to the Romans
At about 120 metres in length, a sewer from the Roman period was obtained below Cologne.
If you visit Cologne, don't pass the Cathedral.
Around 157 meters, the two towers reach the sky and make it the second highest church building in Europe.
But only a few visitors, who marvel at the two filigree church towers, realize that there is also a lot to discover under the dome.
Rainer Schulze is an expert in the subject of Cologne's underworld.
Meeting point for its guided tours is the service center of Cologne-Tourism directly at the Cathedral.
The tour begins quite unspectacularly: “We start in the underground garage,” says Schulze.
In the seventies, the city fathers wanted a car-friendly city, and that is why the remains of the old city walls remained just what was not too big.
For this reason, most users of the park house also rush past the Roman remains today and just turn their car off.
However, who looks more closely, discovers an archaeological site separated by metal lattice rods in the Parkdeck D2.
About five meters of high ruins are seen from hand-teller-sized stones.
“There are remains of the Roman city wall that was built in the second half of the first century after Christ,” says Schulze.
Before going back to daylight again, Schulze lets the participants at the upper park level take a look into a dark 15 meter deep shaft.
This is the fountain of the old dome, which unfortunately is hardly seen.
Next station of the tour is the Pretorium, and here the participants get back down to the depth.
We experience here the office of the once most powerful man north of the Alps, the Pretor of CCAA.
What CCAA means, a visitor wants to know.
\"The abbreviation stands for \"Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium\", which in good German as much as \"City of Roman law and city of the Agrippinenses, founded under Emperor Claudius at the place of the altar for the imperial cult\" means \"
And the Pretorium is the former Parliamentary Palace, the centre of power of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
From the front room of the exhibition leads a tunnel access to the Roman wastewater canal, which has been preserved here at about 120 meters in length.
“You can quietly walk along the so-called Cloaca Maxima, if you want to, school up the guests.
A surprise still has Schulze.
After getting the key at the checkout, he leads the group to a 16 meter deep, walkable shaft.
“We are now in Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath,” he explains.
The Jewish community built her bathroom deep into the ground to get to the groundwater that was essential for the ritual washings.
To this day, in the lower end of the Mikwe, whose origins date back to the eighth century, different water levels can be read by changing levels of the Rhine.
The Mikwe will be part of an archaeological zone on the town hall square for which construction work will soon begin.
But until completion, a few more years will pass.
Bone almost hacked off: new edition of rocker process
A bloody attack in the rocker environment is re-rolled after more than four years.
A trial against two 30-year-olds has begun in front of the Frankfurt Landgericht (Oder) due to attempted beatings, hazardous bodily injury and damage to the property.
It is accompanied by strict safety precautions.
The defendants swear to get started.
They are supposed to have been active in the rockers scene and have been among the bandidos at that time.
In June 2009, the prosecutor accused them of striking and striking three men in a car together with unknown accomplices in Finowfurt.
All the victims were seriously injured, and a man almost lost his leg.
The victims should have belonged to the competing group Hell's Angels.
One should have been a high-ranking member from Berlin.
It was apparently a chase with several cars.
According to the charge, it was about revier fighting and a demonstration of power.
The two defendants were released in a first trial in early 2012.
A court judge said at the time that it could not be proved that the men were actually involved in the bloody feud.
The perpetrators had worn masks and had not been recognized.
The Bundesgerichtshof upheld the judgment after the review of the prosecutor's office and referred it back to the Landgericht for renegotiation.
One of the defendants is currently in open execution due to another offence.
The start was mainly about the reconstruction of the processes at the Tatnacht.
As a witness, the commissioner of the investigation was invited.
At the centre were cell phone calls from the accused and other persons who had been heard by the police.
It is difficult that rockers in court almost always adhere to a law for them rather - and do not say so.
This also applies to the victims.
In the first trial, only one of the victims had been unpacked.
Attorney Stefan Golfier of the prosecutorship Frankfurt (Oder) said on demand that new tracks have appeared since the last trial.
For the process, eleven more days of negotiations are scheduled.
The throwaway society doesn't think
The night was long, the music was loud and the mood was good, but at some point it was going home.
Only: Hunger is noticed in the bushes of the people on the passenger and back seat.
Of course, one or another cocktail or sect may be responsible!
What's closer than going to the next drive-in to give yourself a little bit?
I admit, I like to be with you when you go to fast food-holes late at night or early in the morning.
A few pommes, a cola, a burger - and then nothing like going home and going to bed!
But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco gangsters are noticeable.
Because what is missing is that with constant regularity one throws his fast food bags out of the car window?!
Especially on weekends are discarded paper bags on street edges and on parking spaces.
\"Why,\" I ask myself.
Are the people too deaf to take the bags with them back home, respectively, to the next garbage bucket?
It's not just that the paperwork is ruining the landscape.
Tützen have already covered transport facilities such as roadmaps and thus caused accidents.
What this word actually means, however, does not reflect what it means, probably it does not even know what it means.
When you're on the road in the evenings, just right with several people in the car, you know how a back bench can look like through the evenings: Clamots, bottles and other garbages are going to storm.
There would be a few bags more or less but nothing - unlike the road where no one wants to trample on the food remains of others.
I already see the day coming when cities and communities will be blundering the way - and the fast food chains for their bags will have to take care of Pfand.
Obama’s detractor in Health Policy
After harsh criticism, yesterday President Obama made a withdrawal from his often repeated, clear promise: \"If you like your health insurance, then you can keep it\"
After hundreds of thousands of her insurer received a notice of termination, the Republicans accused the President in the last few days of having deceived the American public.
Yesterday Obama relativized his original promise.
“The vast majority of citizens who have a functioning health insurance can keep them,” he said in a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports on the terminations, Obama called on Americans who received such communications to look around on the free market for a new insurance.
Most citizens could thus receive better, more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or cheaper than predicted.
“They’re coming for a better offer,” he said.
The government described it as little surprising that the five percent of the people who have completed insurance had to look after another tariff, since their contract did not comply with the new standards under the Affordable Care Act.
\"I would like to say directly to these Americans that they deserve better\" said Sebelius at a hearing before the Energy and Trade Committee of the House of Representatives in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Act, stated that the launch of the online platform has been “miserable” since October.
“I’m just as frustrated and angry as everyone else too,” she said.
I'm determined to regain your confidence.
This statement of a sebelius brought to a consultant sitting behind her at yesterday's hearing in the House of Representatives was taken up after a dispute with Republican MP Billy Long from Missouri, and it was about whether she should be obliged to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius repeatedly lamented the question of why the \"architectist\" of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily give up a state-funded insurance to decide for themselves a tariff at HealthCare.gov, which she now wants to sell millions of Americans.
Government in Jerusalem does not confirm attack on Syrian Air Force
An American government official who wanted to remain anonymous said on Thursday to the American news station CNN that Israeli fighter planes had attacked an air force base in Syria a day earlier.
The aim had been \"rockets and associated equipment\" of which the Israeli government feared that they had been destined for Lebanese Hisbollah, according to CNN.
Syrian and Lebanese media, as well as Arab broadcaster Al-Arabiya, had previously reported that the base point in the port city of Latakia had been shot from Wednesday to Thursday, and that the Israelis were responsible for it.
The Israeli TV channel 2 showed satellite images of the support point in Latakia, where Russian defense rockets of type S-125 Newa as well as a battery of SA-3 rockets, according to which Channel 2 has a range of 35 kilometres and can transport explosive heads up to 70 kilograms.
Uncertain The government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, the Reuters news agency quotes an anonymous Israeli government official as saying that he believes that Israel has carried out the attack, but is not sure.
A spokesperson of the Israeli Ministry of Defense said at least: \"We do not comment on these reports,
Journalist Ron Ben-Yishai, in Yedioth Ahronoth’s daily newspaper, emphasized that the Syrian regime had already, in part successfully, tried to deliver ground-air missiles to Hisbollah.
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons meant crossing a \"red line\" to which a military response would follow.
John Kerry, in an unparalleled admission that US espionage has gone too far,
John Kerry pointed out with an unexpected admission that the U.S.'s disinhibitive attitude towards its surveillance programmes, saying that in certain cases, espionage had gone too far,
The Foreign Minister also admitted that he, together with Barack Obama, believed in the responsibility of being switched to “autopilot” when the explosive revelations of Whistleblower Edward Snowden became public via the NSA's spy activities.
Through the leaked information, the U.S. government has come to a diplomatic storm of disarmament from the side of its allies.
In a speech delivered by video link at the Open Government Conference in London, Kerry said: “The President and I, as well as others in the government, have learned of some things that have just expired by autopilot simply because of the ability to do what still goes on during the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War and, of course, on 11 September,” he said.
He was then the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that US espionage has crossed a border, but also stressed that no rights have been abused.
He said: “In some cases this has gone too far, ”
The President is determined to create clarity and therefore conducts a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel it, abuse takes place here.
I assure you that the rights of innocent persons in this process will not be affected.
Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force of good and that many lives had been saved through its monitoring operations.
He added: “We have to deal with a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves into the air,
There is a radical extremism in the world that is prone to kill people, blow into the air, and attack governments.
So, what if you were able to catch this and stop it before it happens?
We have actually prevented plane crashes, attacks on buildings, and the murder of people because we have experienced such plans in advance.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislators will travel to Europe to break up the concerns against the alleged American espionage and convince Europeans of the need to continue working with the USA in the anti-terror efforts, as explained by the Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said that this week he spoke with representatives of the European Parliament and other people and was concerned about their threats of not participating in anti-terror organizations due to the frustration of the National Security Agency's surveillance.
“It is very important for the US’s national security interests that Europeans remain on board in terms of our joint efforts against terrorism,” said Murphy, who is a Democrat in the Senate for the first time and is the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs, in an interview in Washington.
I also go to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their anger over the NSA programmes.
Media reports, according to which the NSA has collected millions of telephone data in Europe, have burdened relations with some U.S. allies, although the Head of the Secret Service said this week that the reports were incorrect and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by Nato allies and exchanged with the United States.
Other disclosures quoted from documents passed by Snowden, according to which the NSA monitored the cell phone of Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state around the world.
James Clapper, head of the national intelligence services, defended the espionage among allies as necessary and explained that this was common on both sides.
In all the tumult Murphy said that his authority was preparing the visit of Congress to take place this year, and hoped that the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other participating Members will be published in the coming days.
He said the exact route is still being worked out.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the trip was to improve relationships, he also said that there would be some “first words”.
He said that European governments must be honest about the type of espionage programmes they have been using for years.
“We can change our surveillance programmes and thus better protect Europeans’ rights, but they also have to deal with the fact that we are not the only ones who are spying,” Murphy said.
While John Kerry is on a weekend trip to the Middle East and Poland to deal with the flu on the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as US surveillance activities.
A persistent injury on the spring joint threatens to prevent Nicolai Müller from using the FSV Mainz 05 FC Augsburg in the Bundesliga outplay.
Mainz bans the use of Nicolai Müller.
Tomorrow he'll try to train with the team.
So far, he was only able to do this individually.
“We’ll decide on his assignment in the short term,” said coach Thomas Tuchel.
The 40-year-old hopes to have his best goalkeepers with six hits.
Because the Mainzers already have to give up on the injured performers Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.
Australin's appeal against prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney who was sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket because she had falsely claimed to have been raped by a taxi driver has filed an appeal against the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty of false testimony by a provincial court in Phuket on 15 June after she had told the Thai police, a local taxi driver raped her in the morning hours on Sunday, 10 June, while two other men arrested her.
Later, however, the recordings of a video camera showed that she had safely reached her hotel after being separated from her Australian friend.
The police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until they managed to figure out the story.
Until the trial, she was on the spot in police custody.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison term in a low-security prison on the outskirts of Phukets, instead of in a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Rubgy League, who has turned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra with the request for help for his daughter.
Tunks said to the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was \"extremely concerned\" about the welfare of his daughter and wanted her back in Australia.
“We are concerned, of course, but we hope that she will be back at home as soon as possible,” Tunks said.
Bamford has appealed against the verdict and is against a deposit of 50,000 baht on free foot.
In Australian reports it was read that in the meantime it is taking vacations in the holiday resort Krabi in South Thailand.
On the side of the court it was heard that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and had been warned that the appeal could also lead to a higher penalty of up to two years in a prison for adults.
However, it is also possible that, after the recent murder of the travel merchant Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand might be trying to improve his acquired tourist image, and therefore it would be a free speech.
