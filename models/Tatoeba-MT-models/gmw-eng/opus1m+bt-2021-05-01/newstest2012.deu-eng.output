No liberating novel for Tymoshenko by Parliament
The Ukrainian Parliament today rejected the request to abolish those paragraphs in the context of a novel of the Criminal Code, on the basis of which the opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko had been sentenced.
The new regulation, which could have paved the way for the liberation of the imprisoned Prime Minister, was rejected by the Members at the second reading of the request for a reduction of the penalties for economic offences.
Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison in October for the conclusion of an alleged adverse contract with Russia on the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not yet valid, and in December the appeal of the defendants is to be negotiated before the court.
Timoshenko himself refers to the ruling as a political revenge of the regime and also in the West the trial raised the suspicion of the prejudice of the court.
The request, paragraph 365, on the basis of which the Prime Minister was sentenced to remove from the Criminal Code was supported by 147 Members.
226 votes would have been necessary for its adoption.
Libyan victory
The story of the Libyan liberation struggle or Libyan rebellion already knows its losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
Now only the winners are to be defined.
As usual, this region wins in the elections of Islamists, the question is only what - the moderate or the radical.
The National Transitional Council was known for the customary right of the Sharīa, of which one now has a certain idea with God.
Libya would go to the country without crime, because theft is short-lived.
Even women should quickly forget thoughts of emancipation, any religious apostates being executed, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, the society from each other's opposing tribes will in future be united by the Qur'an.
In short - in Libya an order will prevail, which would hardly be possible here and, above all, hardly desirable.
Only - our lifestyle is not the only and objective one, probably not the best and would hardly fit the Libyans mentioned.
Thus, it is rather disturbing that the Muslim fighters could be helped by the unbelieving dogs at all.
To their apologies, only the fact that NATO's air raids were directed not by any general from America, but by God himself, whose power was praised after every successful encounter.
The victors in Libya?
We only took part in a shooting change, served the interests of Islam, and our politicians disposed in the person of the dictator of a political ally, without any advantage.
After the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we preferred a military occupation of Libya.
As a result, the hyssies are a matter of concern - namely the expulsion of the crusaders.
Are the mineral oil companies getting the black gold at the spot price even without occupation?
The West can at last boast itself with the right of its selflessness in respect of the protection of human rights.
If this does not destroy the Scharīa representatives.
Start of a new crisis era
France and the rest of Europe in the focus of investors.
On Tuesday a statistical storm depth broke through Europe.
The individual countries published their data on their GDP for the 3rd quarter.
The Czech economy stagnated compared to the previous quarter, Germany and France.
However, the bond market is tearing down all records today.
The investors not only keep an eye on Greece, but also Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the European zone, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries published their preliminary forecasts on economic development in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP was expected to grow by 0.5%, which of France was 0.4%.
Both countries simultaneously corrected their data for the second quarter in which Germany recorded higher growth than originally expected (growth by 0.3% instead of predicted 0.1%), while France recorded a slight decrease by 0.1% (original figures only spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in this year's third quarter compared to the previous year.
However, in comparison to the previous quarter, gross domestic product stagnated and according to the Czech Statistical Office, the trend in growth slowed down economic performance.
The results are therefore worse than the analysts' forecasts.
The main events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in this year's third quarter compared to the previous year, however, compared to the previous quarter.
According to provisional and seasonal figures, the German economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter.
Throughout the eurozone and the EU, the economy increased by 0.2% between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which is consistent with the expectations of analysts.
The Greek economy decreased by 5.2 percent compared to the previous year.
The yield from their 10-year government bonds rises to 28.45%.
The return on Italian and Spanish government bonds rose to their critical limits.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries are also beginning to feel problems...
The return on Czech government bonds is below 4%, even if the situation in the region is worse.
In Germany, votes will be voiced, the ECB should become the creditor of the last instance.
The Czechs qualified for EURO
In Montenegro they won 1:0 and now celebrate their qualification for 200 million
The football selection has mastered the most difficult task all season!
Thanks to a well-placed Čech gate and a magnificent gate by Petr Jiráček, she won 1:0 in Montenegro.
With a great portion of luck, Czech football has thus been able to defend its luxurious lead from the home game and will again not be missing from the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the climb in a detailed report.
Little excitement in the first half and a huge portion of happiness in the second.
The Czech selection also won due to the closing weakness of the home team, a brilliant Čech's and the hero of the day Jiráček in Montenegro quite happy 1:0 and has thus triggered their ticket for the football EM.
They also put more pressure on Montenegriners in the second half of the Czech team due to the precise defensive play of the Czech team.
The peacocks of the party were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who shot two giant chances.
Thanks to an excellent Petr Čech, the Czech selection will be participating in the European Championships next year, and it is also happy that the local football team will receive a premium of about 200 million.
From the first few minutes on, quite combative football was played.
Both teams combined long and so was played mainly around the midline.
Even in the second half of the year, the pressure of the home team remained low, and the far-reaching cuts to the penal area were successfully resisted by the Czech defence.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country's core program.
They formed a living shield.
Some hundreds of college students formed a living shield around a core object in Iran.
With this gesture they wanted to demonstrate their support for their country's core programme before a possible Israeli attack.
The students had prayed in front of the object on Tuesday afternoon and then proclaimed death to the United States and Israel.
A few hundred students from the University of Iran in Isfahan formed a living shield around the nuclear technology center in Isfahan on Tuesday, where uranium is processed.
In doing so, they wanted to announce that they were willing to protect their country's core programme, if necessary, with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently noted in its report that Iran seems to have not given up all its efforts for a nuclear weapon for a long time.
In Israel, too, talks about a possible attack on Iranian nuclear plants.
Students had prayed at noon before the entrance to the complex and then proclaimed death to the United States and Israel.
According to the Israeli press, in the event of an attack aimed at laying the Iranian nuclear program on a large scale, the nuclear enrichment plant in Nathan's attack target would also be from the centre of Isfahan.
The menu of a greasy child: It doesn't breakfast and eats bread sausage
More than a third of children from 9 to 13 have problems with overweight, with 9 percent of all pupils and 5 percent of all children being overweight.
Current surveys showed - adipous children usually come from families with unhealthy lifestyles.
Once again, how important it is for the healthy development of a human being to be the environment in which he grows up and are the examples that surround him.
On the tables of adipous children, sausages are up to half more often on the table than in families where normal weight children live.
More than 19 percent of the overweight children had a chance to have a pomegranate for the evening bread on the eve of the educational campaign under the motto Adipotas.
In families with thickets, too, sport is not just one of the favourite jobs, but also the majority of today's students - only 15 percent replied that their parents find themselves at least once a week for active movement.
Survey among 900 children
The survey took place last year at the end of the school year, involving almost 900 children from primary schools across the Czech Republic.
This was already the second year of the action “Adipotas is not a coincidence - supported by the General Hospital and the Unilever Society.
So far, more than 12 thousand students from 4th and 8th classes have participated in the project.
Unhealthy food and lack of movement in the family are crucial factors that are responsible for the alarmingly increasing number of children with overweight or even obesity.
“For example, only half of the children surveyed suggested eating breakfast-second lunch-vesper evening bread in the mode five times a day - one of the main prerequisites for a healthy diet - is one of the survey results.
No breakfast and sausage for the evening bread
Experts point out that relative smallties, such as regular family breakfast time, are also important for the healthy development of a child.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23 percent of pupils' families were early.
And - in most families everyone eats for himself alone.
The worst was the finding that every tenth family is not frozen at all.
Breakfast is considered to be the cornerstone of healthy daily diet.
The survey test, among other things, brought to the day that in the families of overweight children you consume much more often unhealthy pommes.
And almost everyone - without regard to weight - drinks sweet lemonades every day (70 percent)
Although more than 40 percent of the children surveyed drive sport, only less than half of their parents do so - that is, only 15 percent.
Create your own menu
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to assemble their own menu from available options, according to their appetite and opinion.
“What Czech children prefer between 12 and 15 in puncto diet is far from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Among her favorite dishes were many flours, meat dishes and, of course, sweets.
“Alarming is above all the great popularity of sweet lemonades,” the final report on this survey emphasizes.
At lunch, i.e. the main court, dough goods were just before poultry.
The children didn't like the fruits of the hides at all, and also the popularity of fish and vegetable dishes as lunches was very low.
Return to Health
At the same time, however, the survey also showed that children are quite willing to change their eating habits when they get correct information.
‘In the survey group of respondents who filled out the questionnaire after the conclusion of the enlightening lecture ‘Adiposes is no coincidence’, the results of the project have in many cases been marked by a marked shift in preferences to principles of healthy nutrition.
This was obvious, for example, in the sweet limos, where many children began to give ordinary water priority.
The children also crossed a lot of frequent poultry or fish in the questionnaire as the main dish of the day and were willing to eat less garlic or sweet food.
Pros claim - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the introductory article on how stylists learn, I had a bit of beengone that this was a bit too much fabric for the beginning.
I didn't know what was coming.
Lectures by three professionals from the industry, the clothing of problematic figures and a seminar on how this is going “in the place”.
It's supposed to be worse.
The closer the test moves, the more information and practical tasks are ahead of us.
But even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is still fully occupied.
This time we discussed with director Alena (in the course no single man participates), how to attract a woman who has no ideal proportioned figure.
And that's what most of us are.
The one has one too short neck, the other one too youthful figure without proper curves and again others are clumsy.
It is up to the stylist to visually cascading wide shoulders, lengthen the neck, or to charm out the necessary curves.
We also got tips on how to dress a woman type like Jennifer Lopez - so with big bus, wide hips and narrow waist - pretty and figure bet, without it acting too provocatively.
For example, if the difference between waist and hips is so large that the skirt or pants really do not fit, you should at least cut a piece to measure.
You won't regret that, because good sitting clothes are simply unpaid.
In such a tailor-made skirt, you feel much better than in one of the barnacles that are always too high and slipping, in the waist, etc.
Younger figures may, in turn, allow themselves to wear clothing with folds, constructions, applications, embroidery or rafting.
With this amount of information and figure types, I am glad that I have a whole week of time to let everything go through my head thoroughly.
And yet I'm afraid it's almost impossible to do it in the face of the imposed homework.
Each of the course participants was assigned a promi for which she should think about suitable outfits - daily clothing and evening robes.
We should take into account the current appearance, fashion style of the corresponding star and its figure type.
I should like to attract Miranda Kerr, who may know you from Victoria's Secret campaign.
On the inside I'm happy, because that's a lot better for me than, for example, to attract Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, which in recent times has probably increased to the hundred kilos (well, that's a bit exaggerated), or even the young Selena Gomez.
We should cut the clothes out of magazines or search the Internet, print them out, and then edit them graphically.
In the \"Moodboard\" as the whole result is called, then our very personal style and our relationship to graphic design should be expressed.
It is very important to think about the graphic side of the styling as well.
The stylist not only physically attracts the models, but also designs the so-called product page in the journals (according to specific specifications, such as trend handbags, coats, etc.).
The stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us of this.
But that's only Sunday.
This means that a stylist must have a good overall overview.
The Saturday lecture, filled with information about figure types, was equally spiced by three visitors from the industry:
by stylist Jan Pokorný, by fashion creator Jakub Polanka and by fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is illusion and that a stylist should be able to take advantage of it.
And enchanted stylist is able to work with a single piece of clothing in quite different ways.
The magic word means variability.
For example, you can wear a trenchcoat as usual over the jeans, such as a t-shirt or coat, but you can also wear it on the naked body, wear mittens and wear it as a dress.
It's enough to climb the sleeves or collars and the whole look looks quite different.
“Play with it,” he stressed.
But most of all, I found the following advice: \"First you have to know the rules perfectly,
“Then you’ll have to hurt her, ” Jakub said.
Finally, I realize why we need to pave all these lessons, what can be combined with what and why, even if you often get to see quite a different thing in fashion journals.
Not to mention fashion shows.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist must have prepared many more styles of clothing than he finally photographed.
So you have to be prepared for a fashion story with ten pages (speak ten outfits) to style at least fifteen.
And also that the clothing in the photo in combination with other accessories sometimes looks quite different than in reality.
So you have to count on all of this when designing the outfit.
The fact that image and style sometimes make up half of the success confirmed us as well as Jan Pokorný.
That's where you just need to see Madonna, a not just brilliant singer who made the image and marketing a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the services of a stylist are more reserved.
Also well-known personalities often consider this to be spent money (the main thing is that I bring something as I look at it is second grade).
And if anyone can be styled by us, then we should expect him or her to force us up a completely different (smaller) size than he or she really needs.
Then you only need to google to make sure that the boulevard press writes, the corresponding promi has returned to or taken off, etc.
Jan and Mario put us to the heart on Sunday, not to believe that a stylist only needs to focus on fashion and then build the outfit together.
In his work he must communicate primarily with the people he styles and he must be a woven psychologist.
People appreciate it without offering themselves and standing up for it.
“If any manager orders us to look at their wardrobe and to add pretty pieces, then we can’t clean her up all the closet and say - my God, that’s terrible.
“You have to find at least a few commendable things to which you recommend what you can wear to that end, ” says Mario.
He also showed us in concrete terms what such a so-called \"place bag\" must include.
So there's a bag that's tied to the waist and that's where you carry all the necessary property.
In addition to such clear things as scissors, unroller for hair removal or safety needles, it also contains such utensils as a nylon thread (which helps the stylist photograph products, such as handbags or hats), special clips with which the back of the clothes are cleaned, if they are too large (stick needles or other clamps are forbidden to make the fabric go uncut) and natural sewing.
In order not only to listen but also to try something practical, we learned how to wear shoes properly.
Even when photographing in the studio, where the floor is just, you can damage the sole of the shoe, swung the outside.
We glued and glued...
You can't even touch the shoes with the scissors, so you can't damage them.
So you really have to be skillful.
Mario enjoyed me by praising my \"creation\" without restrictions.
The skill mentioned is not exactly my strength.
All of this was only the fraction of what we got to hear at the second weekend course.
One thing has become clear to me in the meantime - to dedicate oneself to styling on a professional level is not a child game.
V Need for Speed: \"The Run\" - the illegal race across America
Review
The original carefree ride is caused by a series of completely avoidable, dilettant errors to routine travel to the early layer.
While it was possible to fulfill the ambitions in large part, what does it benefit when obviously no one has any desire to do a little more.
Even before he got to the charging tables, the new part raised high expectations with the subtitle \"The Run\".
However, he promised to move the already-yeard series of games “Need for Speed” again into a new dimension and in the playable demonstration examples, he did not seem to be just one of many action racing games.
We were also curious about how the fitted passages appear, in which the main protagonist climbs out of the car and continues on foot.
But as you're already accustomed to NFS, the end effect is much different than expected.
Sure - potentially it is quite decent arcade racing, but overall the game is masked by some superfluous mistakes that are present in this series for more or less a few years.
So it's actually no longer a mistake, but rather a sign of a basically incomprehensive flaw of the game developers.
The adventure starts very well.
For the first time it is introduced into history, whose main character, Jack, has certain problems in person; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, so on the west coast, the task is to be the first in New York.
The basic idea includes a number of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into ten stages and more than fifty individual races.
This means that each race is performed on a different route and that the individual stages take place in different, sufficiently diverse and interesting environments.
You don't have the impression that game would always offer the same thing again.
Some environments are still very nice to look at, although the technical level of the graphic does not exceed that of the previous parts of the series.
So nothing world-moving.
But the journey through the desert, through the autumn landscape or high above through deep snowy landscape was visually very pleasant.
Again and again, untypical elements bring a little variety into the individual races.
In the desert, for example, one is surprised by a desert storm that greatly limits vision.
In the mountains, on the other hand, you have to take care not to be shaken by an avalanche.
By the way, the individual races are built quite well after each other.
It's just a few, but they're enough.
For a while you try to overtake the prescribed number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then you have time to pick up (classical race against the stop watch), then you expect another personal duel with a single opponent.
And that's what the police want to mess up the whole thing.
A novelty is passages in which Jack leaves the car.
This is more about certain interactive animations in which Jack flees from someone and where the player needs to help by pressing the right button at the right moment.
So nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are far fewer passages in the game than one would expect (concretely only three).
Finally, this is more of an advantage, because at least this element has no chance of becoming boring - it belongs in context to the above-mentioned elements that make the game more varied.
The driving model screams in the footsteps of the previous parts.
That is, from today’s point of view, it does not rip out trees, on the other hand, one could not say that it would be bad.
If you are looking for realistic simulations, you have to look around elsewhere.
But an action-loaded racing model will continue to be quite fair even though you might find better in the competition.
So far, everything is in the best order.
Real problems only arise after some time.
In contrast to the driving model, the collision model is not quite O.K.
From a game of this kind it is hardly to be expected that it calculates complicated deformations and collisions, but if you have practically no impact on any object idea of how the car behaves, then obviously not everything is all right.
Typical example: In the case of narrow overtakes or advances on approaching cars, one only easily gets into the other car at some points, in other, almost identical situation, but gets into the sled and turns wild pirouettes.
Or drive the cart to scrape.
Thanks to the restart system, it doesn't matter anymore, but it's annoying.
The restarts are solved in this way: if you have total damage or lands far away from the track, then you throw the game back to the last point of the track.
Only - in each race you have only five restarts.
If you've taken them out, everything goes from the front.
So the restarts are more like a tool, in case something doesn't succeed, but you shouldn't be left behind.
Sometimes, though, it doesn't even help to restart, so nothing helps to learn from the critical section of the head.
It is very unpleasant that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some curves have to be passed in very specific ways, otherwise you simply don't fit through.
On the other hand, \"civil\" cars are always found in the same configuration, no matter if you come first or fifth, five seconds earlier or one minute later.
This is especially annoying in situations when it is seen that the contrahent is passing two opposite cars in front of a playing car, but until you get there yourself, the cars are already in such a position that you have to drive them around or brake them.
And it doesn't matter when you get there, because everything is designed so that it comes to this situation always close to your nose.
The Contractors have further advantages.
Throughout the game there are a few places where you are always taken over by the same opponent at the same place and here again with no regard to the time.
The most crazy is to finish the game on the long bridge that you pass in opposite directions.
The contrahent must obviously get a devil out of here.
And if he's in front of you, he'll take a look, of course, so that you start driving your own car there a few times in Klump.
Clearly - you just want to make the game more exciting and exciting but this intention is so clear that it quickly avoids the joy of playing.
And that's a shame, because despite a simpler driving model, the game is generally quite entertaining and sometimes also so action-loaded that you almost no longer know where one's head is.
And in principle, no matter what is “to blame” the concept of fifty unique routes, the arrangement of the races in a way that no boredom can occur, or something completely different...
An unusual idea is also the car change during the race.
You must not overlook the gas stations on the line, because you can change the car right here, although in most cases the car is enough that you have just got it.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for the urban areas, the strong American limousines for straight highways and exotic super sports cars for technical rides, for example on the Serpentines in the mountain range.
Hand in hand with the mode of play history also goes the task-mode (requirements) - that is, the race in the individual localities you know from history.
Here there are not only medals, but also points of experience to gain for one's own profile, which together is for the tasks (expansions) and history.
In order to reach the higher driver level, various items must be locked up: starting from the car, up to the backgrounds for the profile.
This is simultaneously associated with the Autolog online function, which compares, among other things, its own achieved results to those of other players and also provides for further collective functions.
One of the more incomprehensible snitches is a situation in the last race of history.
Here you come by car into a subway tunnel (mainly), where you walk in the dark on the rails for a long (mainly).
On the Tacho you can see numbers between 150 a 200 km/h (usually because of this), but there is a subway coming at once from behind and driving uncompromisingly to scrap.
In our editorial work we will still have to argue for a long time about whether this was a blackout of the game designers or whether the authors think us to be so stupid.
The technical side is nothing overwhelming but at least the visual overall impression is in most cases quite appealing and here and there even brilliant.
It is all the more excruciating that at some exciting moments, the frequency of image recovery is slowing down and this is sometimes quite dramatic.
However, this is particularly true of accidents with a greater number of participants, where a continuous FPS is of no benefit anyway.
The sound playback is as far as O.K. and the soundtrack is taste-making.
A soundtrack a lá was created in an effort to address a young audience as broad as possible, but who buys such a game already because of the music?!
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run? The feelings are rather mixed.
If the game were not masked by the totally unnecessary mistakes mentioned, we could have claimed with the breasttone of conviction that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But that's how the game doesn't work.
A great pleasure for yourself, but you should be prepared to face this mistake with the power of airport light bulbs.

EU Ambassador Vicenová:
The Czechs have the reputation of negativeists and Euroskeptics
\"The Lisbon Treaty has made the balance between the individual institutions felt from the lot,
I would not have expected such a hard war to end,
\"It will take five, six years for the waves to be smoothed and all will have become accustomed to their new role, and Milena Vicenová, the Czech ambassador to the European Union, started quite loudly at the Faculty of Law.
How seriously she takes the motto, comprehensible and open about Europe, was already shown in the first part of her lecture, in which she managed to describe the individual institutions of the EU and their mutual relations in such a manageable and understandable way that she could have favoured so many lecturers of the Faculty of Legal Affairs of Karlsuniversity.
Ms Vicenová also praised the new permanent chairman of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy:
\"In the beginning, criticism was made that he was too inconspicuous - a gray official who had not grown such a role, but I must say that it has swallowed all the breaths of how well he accepted the matter.
\"It is a person who is willing to listen patiently to and communicate with twenty-seven Member States and who has a clear idea, above all, of how to proceed with the EU.
She then explained the new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy as an answer to the question: Who is this - the European Union? What number should I call - as an important step towards agreeing and improving the readability of EU policies towards countries such as China or India?
No one wants to ban us our oil hats quargel
Ms Vicenová also dedicated herself to the agenda according to which the European Union lived and thought about living in the near future.
The Czech Presidency, two years ago, described it as a success.
The Czechs had mastered the financial crisis and the gas crisis and had also organised the Eastern Partnership Summit.
The case of the Government during the Presidency referred to it as a major negative that has severely damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
Czech representation in the EU is currently in full control.
In the words of the ambassador, it was not only during the Presidency but also during the subsequent crisis, which has not yet been overcome, quite hectic.
And the seven-year budget of the EU still needs to be approved, which makes the matter much more complicated because of today's economic situation.
Whether it will be a slim and economical budget, which will give priority to sectors, which countries are more and less funded - all of this is now on the agenda.
The ambassador also recalls her own slogans, which she came to Brussels with: \"Consulting about Europe\"
“If I don’t like something, then it’s terrible curds, foreign words, and professional jargon that nobody understands.
How should I, as a citizen, actually know whether in Brussels we really think of crumbs or round cucumbers and various large bananas or whether we really want to ban the quarries?
She would have liked to use the EU's soil to get more Czechs in European institutions.
Europe of two or different speeds in view
According to the EU ambassador, the Czechs are called upon to be Euroskeptics who perceive more the negative than the positive sides of the matter.
All the worse is the weak representation of Czechs in European institutions.
This is due to many factors, including the restraint of our candidates, their inability to write motivational letters, and, last but not least, the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, it also highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, the so-called V4.
“Believe me, when a pole or Hungarian comes to me and a Slovak is near, the Frenchman next to me says: “Hey, what are you putting the heads together - this is your V4 again - and in doing so makes a pretty sour mine.
According to Ms Vicenové, in the future, the EU expects, in particular, strong rules for Member States' budget policies.
As much real as a European Federation, it looks at the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds.
\"We have the countries of the Eurozone and the countries apart from the Eurozone here.
\"We have the Schengen area and we already have the Institute of Enhancing Cooperation,
\"At first it was said that only the countries who want it and those who don't want it should stand quietly apart,
\"There will be more and more such institutions, which ultimately lead to a strong \"Europe of different speeds\" waiting for Mrs Vicenová.
In this respect, it also appreciated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in the enforcement of the principle that all issues with an impact on the whole EU must be discussed by all Member States and not just by the countries of the euro area.
Brand Story:
The innovator IBM enters the second century of its existence
If one wanted to find a suitable word that most accurately characterizes IBM's strategy, then that would probably be the word \"long-lived\"
For the general public, IBM is the synonym for technological revolution, one knows it as a modern company, although since its founding a century has passed.
The basis for this longevity was already her first boss - the visionary Thomas J. Watson sen.
He already represented the slogan, and countless worldwide problems could easily be solved if people were willing to think a bit.
His slogan \"Think\" became a trademark in order to play the life of the future giant (and at the same time the title of the company's internal magazine, which was started to be published at IBM in 1935).
This was also the basis of Watsen's thoroughly prepared corporate culture.
“For us from IBM, this long-term thinking means a continual movement towards the future.
IBM survived and was therefore successful for a whole century because it remained faithful to its principles and did not fear to change everything else around.
This allowed us to transform technologies, business and society over the course of our first century.
We hope that we will create even more in the next hundred years - said Samuel J. Palmisano, the current director of the company on occasion of the anniversary.
Immune system
Watson has been working in the thirties of social care for his employees - in a similar way to that of the entrepreneur Ba in Czechoslovakia: The IBM people had paid as one of the first U.S. employees, insurance by the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms as workwear and a thoughtful pay system for the best newer and dealers.
The long-term relations of IBM with their customers are equally sophisticated.
From the beginning, the company was ingenious in talent promotion - as one of the first companies worldwide raised any discrimination - and was able to choose accordingly.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan to replace Palmisan at IBM's top next year by a woman - by Virginia Spacetty.
She has been with IBM for the past thirty years, so far she has taken over the position of chief of the Vetriebs, Marketing and Strategy.
IBM makes so-called online brainstormings in recent years, from which many future strategies and innovations grow.
No wonder - there are enough ideas, in the company almost half a million people are busy.
An institution with a good reputation
Their inexhaustible position in business guarantees the company a strong image and this to the inside and to the outside.
“From the beginning IBM had the concept of an institution rather than a mere technology company,” said Economist Professor of Harvard Business School and author of a book on IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
“IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems using technologies,” added George Colony from Consulting Company Forrester Research.
As the company itself emphasizes, it is a difference to be present on the market only or to form it directly through this presence.
IBM - in the states of its logo called \"Big Blue\", has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in one century.
It is one of the most versatile technology companies at all - IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in an incredible range of products - from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all the American technology companies, IBM owns most patents and five of its employees were awarded the Nobel Prize.
Among his most famous inventions are e.g. bank machines, credit cards, financial swap, string code or even the diskette.
IBM was the second largest technology company (equal to Apple) this year with around 220 billion dollars of stock (market capitalization), with Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
The Preview Forward
Not all products and innovations met the taste of today's customers - unfortunate were, for example, the attempt with their own OS/2 operating system, the online service prodigy or even the IBM PC jr computer.
“Business is based on the forward movement, so one should not emotionally bind to the past,” says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That's why IBM has no problem building its foundation walls on different platforms - and if they don't work, they also leave it again.
Unlike the opponent Microsoft, which stands and falls in principle with its operating system Windows.
Promising technologies
Most of IBM's profits involve services, software and hardware in one fifth of each.
In 1990, hardware with a more than fifty percent share was the most represented.
Since 2000, IBM has sold little profit discarding assets worth 15 billion dollars, but at the same time it invested 58 billion dollars in the purchase of forward-looking technologies.
In these investments, IBM continues after 2008, when the recent financial crisis fought for the first time like a storm over the world.
Also here IBM remained faithful to the legacy of his first boss Thomas J. Watson, who increased his investment in the middle of the major global economic crisis.
So far, it seems that IBM is crossing today's crisis without prejudice.
The value of IBM shares has increased by 120 percent since 2008 and the company's profit has grown continually.
IBM's corporate slogan is: everything can be changed - only the values can't be changed.
That is why it is also expected that this flexible giant will master the next crisis.
IBM history: From cheese cutter to global flights
The company IBM (International Business Machines) was founded a hundred years ago in New York and initially had a rather complicated name - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM only took over in 1924 - originally it was a trademark name for a branch in Canada and South America.
The foundation stone for the later company IBM laid the fusion of four companies whose history dates back to the 80s of the 19th century.
They owned technologies such as the famous tech card watches to register the start and end of work.
As architect of this new company, Charles Ranlett Flint, who had also chaired the Supervisory Board until 1930.
And it was Flint who appointed the head of the competition company Thomas J. Watson to help him manage the company.
This leader then even put IBM's founders in the shadow - Watson's ideas are based on today's invincible culture and identity of the company.
Watson managed the company until 1952.
IBM, began, as the name already tells us, with the manufacture and distribution of all possible machines for trade - from sausage and cheese cutters, to cashews.
In the first four decades in which Watson led the company, he doubled its sales to nine million dollars and the company gradually expanded to all continents.
Watson was so indispensable for the company that he spent the entire forty years in the head chair, but then he was replaced by his son Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence and also developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, NASA's technicians and computers helped guide NASA's flights into space - Mercury and Saturn, and in 1969, the famous human flight to the moon.
Meanwhile, IBM developed the first computer family with the same computer architecture in 1964 - the IBM System/360 series.
A classic PC, which determined the computer standard of that time, came on the market in 1981 under the name IBM 5150.
Twenty years later IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, but on the other hand she bought the consultant part of the PricewaterhouseCooper company and thus entered the business with high added value with consulting services and services.
The strategy that IBM has been paying off over the last three years is the concept \"Smarter Planet\"
It embodies the intention of using technologies wisely in previously not even planned areas, e.g. to improve the situation in transport and urban administration.
In the trading sector, IBM recently launched the Smart Commerce platform to help traders manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
IBM established a branch office in Czechoslovakia in 1932 - as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe at all.
Today IBM ČR also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The Central Centre for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague and there is also a world-level research team that deals with the technology of voice recognition.
Darina Rychtářová about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta - this donkey you can keep, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) says - now is the end!
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) had become the lover of the protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), Darina remained still hoping that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and come home.
But now it is finally over with patience and for the rest of life it has set clear rules.
“Josef can come home, but not more than my partner,” explained D. Rychtářová.
When Darina Rychtářová offered the singer I. Bartošová refuge in her own house, she probably wouldn't even have dreamed how this goes with her husband.
When Iveta went out again on her drones after 30 days and back to ƿíčany, Josef went straight with her.
Yes, he even publicly announced that he loved them.
In time, Darina resigned, and it even seemed as if she wanted to reconcile with her unfaithful husband again - but now she finally gave him the walk pass.
Rychytář doesn't care who his wife is sleeping with
If Rychtář Iveta should leave Bartošová in the future, then he will certainly not receive open arms at home.
“He is the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to make his days in our common home, then I will not chase him out “
“However, not as a beloved, lost old donkey, but as a person to whom I still have certain ties, Mrs. Rychtářová betrayed her, but she also said that she had already separated herself emotionally from him and was alone in mutual resistance.
The fact that Darina has locked the back door to him so far bears Joseph with dignity.
\"I respect my wife's decision,
“I stay with Iveta, nothing changes about it.
\"My wife wants a paper marriage and I respect that,
“The company continues, I care about the repairs, the garden, the property, I make the purchases “
“With Darina I am very normal, but we just don’t share the bed,” said J. Rychtář (the leaf) Blesk.
If Darina wants to find a new love, then he doesn't want to stop her.
“We don’t sleep together, so I don’t care if she has a friend or who this is.
I realize that this is my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and that is why I assume every responsibility.
The worst female incompetent: How about you?
When men are urged to call some typical female incompetents, they shake out of the sleeve without exception.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, in which we let a few unsitly reviews pass again, which make the men get the blood in the veins?
Shopping search
Do they prefer their spouse to be shopkeepers?
Do you need to buy at least one hader every week?
Do you like to go shopping and it may be a bit more for actions?
Then in your case, it's probably really a weakness.
Some women are at least aware of this and try to control their shopping life halfway.
But hand on the heart, which woman already thinks it would be like to bumble through a dress shop in search of a well-sitting upper garment and not try all (in all possible color combinations) in the cabin?
Even though shopping is a hobby for most women, for men it is often pure hell.
Think about how many times they've told her husband - you better stay outside...
Permanent dissatisfaction
“I’m not too thick, ”
“I would have to take at least five kilos - I should start jogging or doing gymnastics,
\"If I ever like you,
Is that something familiar to them?
Yes?
Then you are also among the women who are quite possessed of what they look like.
This does not mean that you should let go, but many men react allergically if their wife is constantly sorry about her appearance.
The stronger gender is united - with increasing frequency of complaints, women are increasingly more intolerable.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It's a battle against windmills.
Wash windows, tiles and dust, shake the tub - and do this at least twice a week.
Chimp with her partner, because he tramples on the clean tiles again with dirty shoes, you shake the kids, because the straight-cut sink is already dirty again and because the glass door at the living room cabinet has fingerprints already again, but where does polishing make so much effort?
If you suffer from this kind of deviance, then you should know that you must not exaggerate and that the order and cleanliness of family life are not the first thing to do.
This immeasurable mold of purity can ultimately damage relationships and, above all, peace in the family.
Stiles
“Smooth gyms come in the laundry basket “
\"If you really want to put on the old socks tomorrow,
“You don’t just throw a wet towel on the floor, ”
If your partner is exposed to such a tirade, don't be surprised that it brings it to the palm.
It's not a bad idea, they just want everything to have its order.
If the men knew this, then the women may not need to get too much to eat.
Klatsch and Tratsch
Some women like to clap and toss, then there is tossed behind the back or even slandered, or one avoids alliances.
Women are now focused on relationships, so they like to highlight such issues as - who, where, with whom, how and why.
Well, each of us women has a bit of harmless clap and treat on stock.
Hand on the heart - that's probably all women's own.
But this is not to be confused with clasts of gravest calibers, to which nothing and no one is sacred, which certainly despise everyone in their surroundings and which are a major danger especially to women's collectives.
Jágr and Voráček helped Philadelphia with their assistants to win
Jaromír Jágr, the ice hockey stormer, played with two assistants in the NHL's five-year victory at Philadelphia on the Carolina ice, making it again the most productive Czech player in the NHL.
In both cases Claude Giroux, who was added an assistant and was named the best player in the match, took advantage of the overview of the thirty-nine year-old ice hockey star.
Jágr's fellow player Jakub Voráček also recorded two assistants in the same game.
Jágr claimed after the game that he had prophesied about Giroux a great evening.
\"Just before the game, I tell him that today he has a hat trick,
I felt that I was doing something like that,
“Hin and again, such a feeling is overcome,” said Jágr, after which Giroux achieved a goal at the first shot of the flyers.
A little later, the second hit also had \"a Czech trail\"
Voráček fought the puck behind the gate of the Hurricanes and presented it between the circles to the successful Maxim Talbot.
A second before the first third, the home player Patrick Dwyer made a short-hand, but the second third then again belonged to the flyers.
Concrete Giroux.
In cooperation with Jágr, he made his third hit, after which Wayne Simmonds led his shot to the fourth goal.
“I love playing with him,
“I don’t want to say that he is the best player in the league, but he’s definitely one of the best three - Jágr honored his center.
“I wouldn’t have thought I was playing with such an ice hockey player at the conclusion of my career, like him,
“That’s great to me, ” she says.
“I cut my game at “
“All the years in the NHL, my fellow players put their game on me and now the spider is turning around - smiled Jágr.
Carolina was still making the drama - through the hits of Tuoma Ruutua and once again Dwyer, who was passing out of a penitentiary, came to a goal.
Matt Read, however, prevented any further complications in which he was successful in excess of two against one.
\"Excellent prongers still in our zone\"
“He caught the puck, I took a ride, and (Read) moved to distant pussies,
“I tried to meet him and I’m glad it worked out,” Voráček described the last hit of the party from his point of view.
By this victory Philadelphia was at the top of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defence player of Montreal Jaroslav Špaček broke up against Buffalo in the game and broke out in the second third because of an injury on the upper body.
In addition to their experienced Beck, the Candiens also played an unlost part in the Penalty shooting 2:3.
One of the prison committees was unable to transform Tomáš Plekanec.
More than the lost points hurt the coach of the home team probably the high disease-related failure in the defensive - the game they played only ended with five defence players.
\"That's bad.\"
“We only finished the meeting with a single experienced player, the rest were young players,”
“But nothing can be done there, so we have to get done,” Jacques Martin said.
“In each change one wave of attack after the other and we had nothing to do with it,
“We would have made the game easier and had to get the puck out of our third,”
There were still reserves here - P. K. Subban, one of the defence players.
The Czech goalkeeper Ondřej Pavelec defended thirty shots from Tampa Bay and thus contributed significantly to the 5th victory over Winnipeg.
At the gates of the jets, which ended a series of five defeats, five different shooters participated.
Development of travel prices since 1989
Until 1989 there were only five approved state travel agencies in the then ČSSR: Čedok, sportsurist, CKM, recrea and autoturist.
The travel agencies sold mainly only trips to the socialist Eastern bloc countries at that time, and in the West only selected ones were allowed to do so.
And so Czech tourists traveled to the Baltic Sea (in the German Democratic Republic - the GDR), to the Soviet Union (Sochi on the peninsula Crimea on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania on the Black Sea and to Hungary on the Balaton.
A slight exception was the period from 1962 to 1972 when one was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia took a pro-Western course and therefore travel to Yugoslavia was severely restricted.
A great paradox of those socialist times was that it was not even allowed citizens of the Eastern bloc (so also the Czechoslovakians) to travel freely within the socialist countries.
For example, if a citizen of ČSSR wanted to travel individually to Poland or even to the Soviet Union, he needed a letter of invitation, otherwise individual travel was not possible.
Even then, the travel agencies also offered trips to the West, but then one had to buy huge snakes or stay in the sleeping bag in front of the travel agency, or at least have good acquaintances in the travel office.
That's how things haven't been going for a long time.
The so-called foreign exchange commitment - the condition for a trip to the West - was granted only “politically reliable people - the others were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, so it would have been impossible to impose the necessary funds (Western currency) for a trip to the West.
The vast majority of Czechs therefore spent their holidays in the inland, no wonder that the Czechs bought countless weekend houses and dazzles - a habit that persists to this day.
The 1989 total revolution followed a travel revolution of the Czechs on foot.
While a holiday in the GDR or Bulgaria was the measure of all things until 1989, the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their foreign holidays in countries around the world last year.
A huge paradox, which is no longer known today, is the fact that one could not travel to the most popular country in the Czech Republic - Croatia until 1989 at all because it was part of the Yugoslavia at that time.
Right from the beginning of the 90s of the last century, the foreign exchange obligation was lifted to neighbouring Western European countries, which created a huge wave of short visits, especially to Vienna in Austria and Germany.
For a long time, the Czechoslovakians were simply unable to get enough of their trips to the West, and everyone wanted to have been there for at least a few days.
For example, the Czech holidaymakers slept in the park while traveling to Paris in the tent, because who had already had the money for an accommodation in the hotel or in a pension?
A typical feature in the foreign travel of Czechs was at that time a suitcase room filled with preserves, beer and permanent sausages, etc.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the freely interchangeable Czech krone - after decades our tourists were finally able to buy the western currency freely.
Our level of life and this also increases average wages, which led to another important moment in 1997.
As a result of increased demand for travel, the travel agencies began to prepare regular trips by charter flights after 1997, which made flight trips incredibly affordable thanks to the possibility of negotiating quantity discounts.
At the end of the 90s, the Czechs, with the exception of the USA, had already had unsolicited payments with all the highly developed countries of the world, which made traveling even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of post office travel came in 2000 when, thanks to the high demand of the first direct charter flight to an exotic country, it was completed in Thailand.
Since then, every year direct charter aircraft with Czech passengers fly in distant sunny countries; this year, 12 exotic destinations fly directly from the Czech Republic.
To the 100 Tsd. Czechs travel annually in exotic countries!
Another significant moment in the era, which marked our post-revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the United States lifted the visa obligation for Czech tourists, making our country definitely one of the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008, the Czechs spent more than half of their vacation abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history they spent more than 15 Tsd. CZK per capita for a single vacation stay.
The Annual General Meeting is to find a new chairman - again threatening a duck.
For almost five months, Czech football has not been a chairman, threatening that the successor of Ivan Hašek at the head of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) will not even be known after the extraordinary General Meeting on Thursday in Nymburk.
To this day, there is no agreement as to which electoral order is to be elected.
And without it there is no vote on the three potential successors at all.
Three interested parties would like to manage Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
In June, Hašek resigned from his role, calling upon his colleagues to come to terms with and find a strong personality that could lead football in the future.
Only - in the era after Hašek, the old quarries between the two chambers of association broke out again, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was shown to be clumsy and clear on 16 September when the new chairman was to be elected.
The delegates to the Annual General Meeting had otherwise come to the Volkshaus in the Prague district of Smíchov, because the negotiations did not lead to any outcome and not just the election itself.
For one could not even agree on who is actually entitled to vote in the full collection - only the statutory representatives or also the officials equipped with an authority.
In this single point, at least partial agreement was reached, including the recommendation of the Institute for State and Law, which, in the opinion of a representative on the basis of powers of authority, did not take place.
However, the disputes surrounding the electoral order continue.
The Executive Committee also no longer brought clarity into the matter, whose meetings, whether ordinary or extraordinary, are in principle nothing else on the agenda.
Even though the views on choice changed a few times - the neural point remained the same.
The question is, how should we proceed in the third round to avoid a path situation?
\"The point of dispute concerns whether to proceed in accordance with the Statute, or whether to find a completely different model, Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-presidents of the FAČR, who represents professional football in management.
The third round of the candidate who receives the greater percentage of support in the chamber for which he is applied, according to the set-up model.
Moravia is allegedly willing to respond to the compromise that the candidate who receives the higher number of votes from both chambers wins.
The Czech side, in turn, is on the condition that the winner receives at least a two-thirds majority in this percentage voting count.
“Then the two front rounds no longer make sense, this mode would question the whole two-chamber concept - Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, which it is best not to turn to the electoral order, but to choose according to valid statute.
Surprisingly, Tomáš Paclík agrees, even though it turns out that the electoral order of all candidates is most likely to be met by Pelta.
“My wish is that it will be chosen as far as the statute is concerned,
“This does not make any sense of substitutes, as at the last Annual General Meeting,” explained Victoria Plzeň, the owner (the football club) who applied for the first time and, in particular, delimited Pelta in his opinions.
Pelta, however, remains optimistic.
In his opinion, the new chairman will be known in Nymburk and he believes that the candidates will also work constructively in the future.
\"The possible qualification of the national team for football EM today would certainly contribute to calming the moods,
“If football is only on the euphoric wave, then there is a greater willingness to cooperate,” says Jablonec, the official, who has the greatest experience of all three adepts, who have both professional and regional levels.
Rajchl's more reserved.
“I hope for an agreement, but the situation is unfortunately divisive,”
“This is not a matter between the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are some efforts to justify the rules for their own purposes,
‘That is why a new blockage at the Annual General Meeting is not excluded,
“I hope, however, that the healthy mind will ultimately win,” said Rajchl.
Only - a lot of time to agree on all sides no longer remains.
Some negotiations are supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether football generality will be complete until the qualifying game at all?
The charter aircraft, with which Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl were to fly to Podgorice, could not even start in Prague in the morning due to a technical disruption, and this was a fiendish search for a replacement variant, as a part of the executive committee was still at the venue of the barrage brain game.
Finally, the meeting at ministerial level, which is supposed to take place on Wednesday, is crucial.
Josef Dobeš, the Minister for Education, Youth and Body Education, would have liked to have united the split parties within the largest sports association in the country.
There is much in the game: state grants, the trustworthiness of Czech football and also the upcoming ČSTV General Meeting, which will give Czech sport the new direction according to the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclík is in the fight for the position of president because he does not see suitable candidates
If Tomáš Paclík, the head of the Pilsner footballers before the extraordinary general meeting, could have made a strong candidate, who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new chairman of the Czech Republic's Football Association (FAČR), he would not have taken part in the struggle for this top position at all.
\"If there were a good candidate, I would fight for him and give up the election\"
“But in the current situation it was not possible to find such an adept,” said Paclík ČTK.
The main reason for Paclík to go into the duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl is thus to prevent the alleged favorite of the election, Pelta, from reaching the top of the FAČR.
Paclík also stresses that in the event of his victory, he intends to perform the position of chairman only one year, i.e. until 2013, until the date of the ordinary general meeting.
In the position of president, he would have liked to see an experienced top manager, who is not too much involved in the football business.
\"I spoke with some people in question, personally,
\"It's hard to believe that some people told me they didn't want to identify themselves with Czech football at the moment.
\"Such views would have changed, he suggested.
Most of all, Paclík claims the connection between Pelta's and the chairman of the Pilsner District Football Association Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial reputation who is considered a powerful lobbyist behind the scenes, with the ability to influence delegation votes at general meetings.
For Paclík, it is unacceptable for Pelta to have the position of chairman.
\"In his victory, today's state would be preserved, and in Czech football it didn't progress at all,
“Berbr’s support, a clever businessman, was double-skilled in football,” stressed Paclík.
He also points out that Pelta's name had fallen from Pelta some time ago in conjunction with telephone hearings to investigate in a corruption affair, but it did not come out of the Pelta.
“I don’t know what prestige a victory of Pelta should bring to the football “
“And how would we stand there in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA,” said řekl Paclík, the former spokesman, “he will sell the Pilsner football club if Pelta becomes chairman, but he sees something more late.
However, if Paclík wins in the Thursday election, he can imagine a future cooperation with Pelta.
Similarly, another candidate - Rajchl, who had supported Paclík before the October Annual General Meeting, who ended up with a fiasco.
\"He (Pelta) would be the first to go to whom I would \"
\"He has great abilities,
“I could well imagine him, for example, as head of the national team,
“But I don’t think he is able to lead the association as a manager”
“I don’t put my nose in matters of which I don’t understand anything,” said Paclík, who in September had made sure that he was at the head of the Dagmar Damková after the appeal of the Arbitration Commission with Lu toěk Macela.
Paclík himself claims that he feels the role of Chairman of the Association grew.
He is also head of Pilsen, who, with his support in May, celebrated the first triumph in the League in the past summer.
“I have the power to change something in the football environment and to contribute to a certain cultivation of this,
\"In order to limit the influence of certain interest groups that tend to influence disciplinary and vocational commissions, which continue to exist in difficult situations, Paclík claimed that he did not make a helm out of his antipathy, for example, to the Sparta chief Daniel Křetínský.
As one of his priorities, he saw the strengthening of relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympia Committee, with which he would lobby with the political leaders to ensure that more money flowed from the lottery tax into sport.
\"This is one of the crucial things that the new chairman should devote himself to,
“If it comes to taxation of gambling, as the political parties declare, then I understand their argumentation, but then they also have to say very clearly and clearly where the money goes,” he said.
Its connection to the Pilsner club also does not seem to Paclík to be a disability, although he himself emphasises that the chairman of the FAČR must be \"overparty\".
Pelta, in turn, is connected with Jablonec, Rajchl with the Prague Dukla.
\"This is not just ideal\"
“I don’t think it makes much sense to transfer my shares in the Pilsner club to a third person in order to return after a year and a half,” Paclík made clear.
Pelta promised new statutes of the FAČR, which will exclude a patt situation in the future.
Two days before the Annual General Meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the Chairman, Miroslav Pelta, promised to make it strong in the event of his election that the FAČR will receive new statute, which will in the future exclude disputes about the electoral order from the outset.
The official from Jablonec is confident before the Thursday negotiations in Nymburk and believes that the election campaign will certainly defuse any success of the Czech election.
Pelta had already promised before the unrealised election in September, he wanted to focus in the event of his election on the national team and the profiting of financial resources.
He only decided on the last moment to participate in the election before the last Annual General Meeting, so the two-month break allowed him to defend his ideas about the leadership of football and to present it in a broader context.
“People at all levels are dedicated to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the chairman to be known on Thursday,
“He feels that it is high time that the association is being led by someone,” says the man, who is primarily associated with the Jablonec club, who has been working with Sparta and the Executive Committee for many years.
That is why he also believes that he has sufficient experience to lead the Czech football team.
He is convinced that today's problems with the election are responsible for the euphoria that existed at the time of Ivan Hašek.
“Pleads were approved at the Annual General Meeting in June, which were not as perfect as all had accepted.
If they hadn't allowed different interpretations, we would have already had a chairman in September - Pelta said.
He used the revision of the main document of the Civil Association as a lock-in for the delegates.
“If I become chairman, I will accept it personally and am willing to take personal responsibility if it does not work”
“This is a fundamental thing that he cannot be without,” Pelta claims.
Furthermore, he does not attempt to limit himself to his counterparts.
He had previously announced that he could imagine working with Jindřich Rajchl, whom he recognized for his legal education and he well knew that his counterpart would be his first deputy.
Even Tomáš Paclík had not attacked him for a long time, which in turn left no dry thread on Pelta.
In football, he has been moving for over a year and can already point to certain successes,
\"His attacks, however, were decreasing, and many people were shocked by his election campaign.
“For this reason, too, many of his real character now doubted Pelta’s address to his counterpart, who probably remained faithful to his proclamations, which he had already expressed in September.
In his opinion, his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lowest playing classes, to the national team.
And this one was supposed to be Czech football.
\"I would also strive to end all affairs - from the Causa Bohemians, to the afterhalls of the corruption scandal of last year\"
\"Just after that, I would fall down on negotiations with the private and state sector to ensure sufficient funding for the whole football industry,\" said the forty-six year old candidate ČTK two months ago.
At that time he also promised that his entry into the top of Czech football would not mean personal cleansings.
“I had to start by familiarizing myself with the work content of all employees,” he said in the direction of Strahov, where, due to the long anarchy, there is typically nervousness.
Despite the recent disastrous scenarios accompanying the upcoming Annual General Meeting, he believes that the delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing on Thursday.
\"If really the only controversial point should be how one chooses in the third round, then we will get over it \"
\"The footballer needs credibility and who wins it only by having a new leader - Pelta remains optimistic two days before the possibly decisive day of his functional career.
Rajchl promises that FAČR will start working hard under him
If the previous deputy president, Jindřich Rajchl, was to be elected as the new chairman of the Czech Republic's football association at the Annual General Meeting on Thursday, this would seem to miss the mood of many people in the association.
Rajchl promises to start working hard in the event of his choice.
It intends to introduce system changes and make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to resolve the Bohemian case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, increase money in football, and otherwise continue the work that the previous chairman Ivan Hašek started.
\"As chairman, I would like to dedicate myself to football as a whole,
Starting from international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, through national selection, professional football, up to youth performance football,
“I don’t want to say that I want to do everything by myself,” Rajchl said in the conversation for ČTK.
\"I am a team player and would therefore like to distribute the competences of the Executive Committee in such a way that each member is committed to a certain area,
And I'm going to distribute hard tasks so that football can progress in every segment with miles,
Many would not be disappointed about this because instead of criticizing the work of others, they had to start working really hard on their own, he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, consideration has been given to not being able to do anything at all.
“I’m known to work 20 hours a day, ”
“But I need to know that it makes sense and that people are behind me who don’t throw a button between my legs and question every step that I’m taking,” he said as an explanation of why he has hesitated.
“Many people told me that I shouldn’t give up because others would otherwise do so “
“That’s trust that you can’t play,” he said.
In fact, he is also motivated to continue the work he started under Hašek.
“In two years we have managed a great deal of work, and I don’t want to just throw that away,”
“The processes have been started, probably only in a few years, and I would just be afraid to see someone stop,” he said, expressing his concerns that in case the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta, would be elected, the situation could return to the times before Hašek.
“I believe in systematic action and this is something that Mirek Pelta does not bring “
“Behind him, there are people who would make football so that he would only be there for the chosen,” he said.
I guess you can put a few things in front of me, but not that I'm participative,
“I try to be objective,
“I want football for everyone, because it’s all right then and not just the selected one,” Rajchl noticed.
He also contradicts the claim that he is only a chairman of the Czech Republic.
“Even if some people claim the opposite, I really intend to do the best possible for Moravia,
\"For example, it is time to consider whether the League should not be divided into a Czech and a Moravian part, the winners of which would then be added to the first League,
“Then it could not happen that today only three Moravian clubs play in the league, which is a problem especially for young players in Moravia,” says Rajchl.
Because the head of the Pilsner club Tomáš Paclík has joined the fight for the position of chairman, Rajchl does not trust to assess his chances of being elected.
“I feel a strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me as its deputy chairman and now recognizes that there are clear successes behind me,” said Rajchl, who also sees the saving of tens of millions of crowns for unprofitable contracts, the agreement of television contracts and the negotiations for the lottery law as his success.
On the other hand, he partly blames himself for the fact that the association does not draw on a single strand.
While he says from Pelta that \"he is disqualified from the outset to give the Czech football a new confidence, he considers the second rival, Paclík, to be a strong candidate who really has something to offer to the football team.
“No one can question that he has done excellent work in Pilsen in just one year,
\"If he were elected, he would probably continue the things that Ivan Hašek has initiated and also the staff occupation in the Commissions would obviously not change in principle,
He certainly would not want to turn things in his favor - judge Rajchl about his rivals.
Europe's most beautiful pools
Jumping into Blue
By Julia Stanek
Planschbecken in Ufo-Optik, Prunkpools in Budapest: Whoever travels through Europe can experience his blue miracle - and after a city tour or hike, rest the tired legs in spas.
A book shows where wellness in the water is most beautiful.
If Iris Meder went on a search trip in the past one and a half years, one could not miss her luggage: her bath suit.
Lying on the water, she looked up high in artfully designed domes, she swam against marble putts waiting for them at the edge of the basin, and amazed at acribically restored youth-style swimming halls.
She liked a bathroom, she took it up in her notebook, along with interesting details about the construction and history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools discovered architecture historian Meder in this way - and now presents them in their book \"Badefreuden\" which has just been published: folk swimming halls in Munich, historic swimming palaces in the Black Forest, \"Hardcore concrete buildings\" in the Taunus.
Through 13 countries she led her journey to the most extraordinary bathrooms in Central Europe: in addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and each visited a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true bathing culture enthusiast.
With sports they don't have much at their hat, Meder says - only in the water is different.
Angry only that swimming fans have to find themselves with blue tiles and chlorinated tanks, while joggers can breathe in the captivating fragrance of fig forests or enjoy a cheerful bird swiss in the park.
“I asked myself one day why swimming pools must always be so ugly,” says Meder, who lives in Vienna.
“So I started to collect beautiful bathrooms “
Water surface doubled architecture
Therefore, in the spring basin and essential sauna oils - the wellness factor in baths is so great because all senses are served, Meder says.
And if the builders have given themselves trouble, swimming halls can be a real eye-catching experience: “One has a water surface in baths,
\"On the one hand, it is transparent, but on the other hand reflects the beauty of the entire building,
Everything doubles visually: high vaults, colorful tiles, springboards.
On 190 pages, the small-format picture band “Badefreuden” imparts valuable knowledge about the history of historical wellness oases in architecture and culture, but above all makes it a pleasure to jump to the blue.
Remarkable specimens were discovered by the pool collector Meder in her research in Hungary.
In addition to the magnificent spas, such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi Bath in Budapest, she found a nitrate-containing water in an original Karsthöhle (Höhlenbad in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a thermal bath, whose basins are filled with alkali-containing water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
Spectacular views, on the other hand, offer many heated outdoor bathrooms in Switzerland and Austria: While you have the whole city in mind from the Zurich roof bath, you can view the snow-covered Arlberg in the outdoor pool of a bathroom in St. Anton - and: In the steam bath there is a window from which you can observe the driving on the ski slopes.
Perhaps the most exceptional pool design awaits guests in the long run: The Aquadome Ötztal looks like a Ufo just landed in the Alps.
Out of three open bowls, it evaporates in winter, while in the background the mountains of the Ötztal reach the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool, the pool collector Meder rose the smell of chlorine into the nose.
Many thermal baths smell like sulphur, in the Árpád-Bad in the Hungarian Békescsaba it smells so much like heating oil, which one hardly believes to have landed in a health bath.
The smell comes from the alkali-hydrogen carbonate-containing healing water, which is almost black and whose slick sticks one to the skin as soon as one can slip into the pool - a wellness experience of the special kind.
In one place Iris Meder was also disappointed in her search for beautiful resorts: when she wanted to visit the outdoor and solar swimming pool in the Czech bath of Luhatschowitz, she found a secluded terrain.
The bathroom, designed by the architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902, has now been closed.
When Meder took a look through the weathered windows of the red and white yellow youth-style building, she saw weeds between the tiles grow.
On the other hand, the decline has been countered in a magical swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
Three phases of construction are already behind this bathroom; not only can one discover neo-Roman elements, which come from the times of its construction in 1844, but also a Moorish hall in Alhambra style, which was added around 1900.
Since the careful modernization of 1995 the Palais Thermal is the favorite pool of the pool-king Iris Meder - not only because it originates from the Black Forest.
“It’s already a performance to merge different styles into such a great unit,” says Meder.
At such a palace, the dive in the thermal pool is apparently only side-by-side.
Agricultural Speculation
Deutsche Bank lets raw material business shine through
By Christian Teevs
Is the Deutsche Bank giving up its business of agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the poor of the world.
In January, the head of the Group intends to draw consequences.
Hamburg -
According to a study, it is not acceptable for German citizens to see that banks speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn.
Two thirds of the respondents even demand that the Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions get out of this business because it exacerbates the problems of the poorest in the world.
This is the result of a Forsa survey commissioned by the Foodwatch consumer organisation.
The study was based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In this, the author Harald Schumann shows that the bets on the global commodity markets drive prices up - and the banks therefore bear a share of the global hunger problem.
The campaign of consumer protectionists is specifically directed against Deutsche Bank-Chief Josef Ackermann, even though big banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, commodity betting was designed to secure traders against price fluctuations.
But now most experts agree that the sugars have disconnected from supply and demand - and make profits at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike US competitors, Ackermann responded to the criticism: he promised to check the allegations and said that no business is worth putting the Deutsche Bank's reputation to the fore,
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the claims from the Foodwatch report.
By the end of the year the examination will be completed, the results will be presented to the Management Board of the Deutsche Bank - and the recommendation on how to deal with it.
At the end of January, the Bank's lead will then inform them of its consequences.
In the end, a reduction in the raw material business could occur, or even the complete decline.
Ackermann bastes at his image
Foodwatch Chief Thilo Bode welcomed the message, but at the same time confirmed his criticism of the financial sector: “The betting on rising prices of food shows particularly dramatically how ruthless banks today are damaging the general well-being,
Ackermann is now particularly under obligation as the top bank lobbyist.
“The Deutsche Bank must remove all the investments from its portfolio, where money is used for betting on food prices,” Bode said.
\"Whether Mr Ackermann is about hungry people or about the Deutsche Bank's reputation,
Ackermann's insight comes at first glance surprising, but it is clear that the Group Chief wants to give a perfect picture of him a few months before his departure from office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the CEO will not change to the Supervisory Board unless planned.
With a turning away from controversial agricultural speculation, he could improve his image.
And in order to make possible losses, he hardly needs to shave - that would ultimately have to do with his successor.
Each second would terminate raw material plants
Foodwatch is trying to keep pressure on the manager.
To date, more than 30,000 internet users have already participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Institute Forsa surveyed 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Just 11 per cent therefore consider it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer facilities where prices for food are betting.
Many bank customers would also face personal consequences if they learned that their bank was involved in such transactions: According to each second, the survey would terminate all the investments in which money flows into raw material speculation.
43 percent would withdraw from such a bank, 49 percent said they thought about ending their account and switching to another institution.
21st house in Vienna
The Moved Pavilion
Von Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architectural history with heights, depths and happy end: The Austrian world exhibition pavilion of Brussels in 1958 won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, stood empty and came to pass.
Now it will be reopened as an exhibition house.
When modern post-war architecture is swarmed with clear shapes, glass halls, courageous swings and new building materials typical of the belief in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwänner is a striking and famous example for the Brussels World Exhibition in 1958.
The Grand Prix d'Architecture for its light and floating steel glass construction was received by Schwänger's pavilion at the time.
To this day, the construction is considered a milestone of contemporary architecture.
He made known to the architects that he also built at the next world exhibition of Austria's Pavilion.
With his legendary BMW four-cylinder house plus bulky side construction in Munich, he finally became internationally famous in 1973.
After the World Exhibition in the Swiss Garden at the Vienna South Station, the pavilion planned to be a temporary exhibition building had been set up, rebuilt, and in 1962 a 20th century museum was opened - the \"20th House\" was called.
But the building was neither spatial nor technical as a museum - no walls for hanging art, no good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used for so long until contemporary art in Vienna got a new house.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and came down more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has converted the pavilion, he is now called the \"21 house\" and is in the future used as a museum of contemporary art.
Tuesday evening, the Belvedere Museum, to which the house belongs, opens the first exhibition there - a lucky case in every respect.
The new beginning of Agnes Husslein-Arco, which became new director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, a professional art historian with considerable career, among others, in the youth as an ice-collar runner, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as the founding director of the Museum of Modern Salzburg, made a strong effort to rebuild with politicians and monument protectors, acquire public funds and private sponsorship funds, and established the use.
Besides contemporary art, the works of sculptor Fritz Wotruba were to be exhibited by the Foundation, a café and a bookstore, and an office building had to be built for that purpose.
Strict supervision, small budget
For the execution, Krischanitz was the ideal occupation.
Not only because Joseph Olbrich's secession in Vienna had grown sensitively and expanded and won the competition, but because he studied at the Technical University of Vienna at tails and the pavilion for him was an “unhappily important place” where he had considered the exhibitions “almost every weekend”.
He knew the original design, and he knew the problems of the building, which he already lost when moving to Vienna and his re-use of generosity and ease.
There were far greater problems in the actual reconstruction: the building was “an energy locker” Krischanitz says.
The window profiles of the glass facade were replaced, glass fiber reinforced insulation glass used and the glass roof replaced with special safety glass.
Cold bridges steel carriers have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings have been renovated.
Two lower floors brought space for the new use, a lowered light pit between house and street ensures the exposure, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the light tail pavilion.
The original exterior doors have remained, the house has been removed in the old red-brown rose protection color.
And the cinema room is even quite the same as it used to be.
And all of this under strict supervision of the Memorial Authority and with little food.
“A material that is good and cheap and also liked the Memorial Protection Office often had to be found,” Krischanitz says, pointing to a rough ground in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and reconstructions, the building remained flexible and light.
It was difficult with the Pavilion, which therefore came from Brussels, Krischanitz recently said, a typical Drop-in-the-City story.
Such an architecture is always in the wrong place, and still wants to raise “a proper consciousness”
In this case, however, the 21st house is not in the wrong place, because it has entered a city-building lucky case: around the Swiss garden the completely newly planned \"main station district\" with office and residential houses is just created.
And another lucky thing may still happen: The 21st house could be reinforced by another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca of Habsburg bought the Berlin Temporary Kunsthalle, and as you can hear, she is already negotiating with the city for a neighboring location in the Swiss garden.
Rail plans winter crisis package in millions of heights
The train has invented a crisis plan to prevent train failures in winter.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
That costs millions.
According to a newspaper report, Deutsche Bahn also spends over 70 million euros this year in the fight against winter-related train failures and delays.
The \"Picture\" newspaper reported on a group-internal crisis plan in advance, with a total investment of around 300 million euros by 2015.
This should improve the availability of vehicles and rail networks even in extreme weather conditions.
It was planned, among other things, to double the internal and external staff for snow removal on railways and railways to 16,000 persons.
The aim would be to free rail stairway up to the start of operations and 90 percent of the operating loads within four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, Bahn-Chief Rüdiger Grube had warned of train failures and delays in this winter after a peak meeting with government and industry.
Last winter, the railway had considerable problems in passenger transport, as it lacked reserves, among other things, due to difficult weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for approval from the Federal Railway Office for years.
There is also a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway also makes it possible for years to have axes of ICE trains tested much more frequently in the workshop after an ICE at the Cologne Central Station had an axle break.
Deutsche Bank pays millions of penalties in the US
After the tumult for Chief Josef Ackermann, new Ungemach comes from the USA: The Deutsche Bank has to pay a million fine there.
As if the problems were not enough for the Deutsche Bank at home, the industry giants are now also bringing its past into the US: the Frankfurt Institute is paying for a comparison of 145 million dollars (106 million euros) to settle disputes because of the plethora of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It's about the sale of mortgage papers.
The NCUA Financial Market Regulator proposes a whole series of large banks to have led cooperative banks with false promises to buy the financial products; they had downplayed the risks.
Such papers lost strength during the financial crisis and pulled the banks into the depths.
“We are pleased that we were able to resolve the issue without the parties having to move to court,” said a Deutsche Bank spokesman in New York.
The bank had no fault with the comparison.
This also applies to the Citigroup, which committed itself to paying $20.5 million.
The NCUA chairman Debbie Matz welcomed the encounter of the two money houses.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. cooperative banks and is taking action to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA tries to replace the resulting million-severe damages.
The now closed comparisons are the first of their kind.
In the summer JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs were accused of having been banned by the regulator.
The mortgage papers in question are so-called Mortgage-backed Securities.
These are based on household loans.
When the U.S. real estate bubble broke in 2007, this was imposed on a large number of financial firms.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the U.S. Investment Bank overthrew Lehman Brothers.
Even though the events have been behind us for a few years, the banks in the United States are currently blowing a sharp wind.
Investors and supervisory authorities have filed countless complaints to obtain reparation or to make mistakes.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the largest lawsuit.
It proposes 18 international large banks to have overvalued the two US real estate funders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in mortgage transactions in the volume of about $200 billion.
The Deutsche Bank also has to file a complaint from the FHFA, this is about several transactions worth a total of $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority requires that the Frankfurters stand straight for \"substantial losses\" without, however, calling for an exact sum.
The Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as nonstop and declared its intention to defend itself.
Warren Buffett increases with 10 billion at IBM
Finanzguru Buffett invests heavily in IBM IT companies.
Since March, he has bought up shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
To date, the large American investor Warren Buffett had always declared that it was not necessary to invest in IT and computer companies, since the long-term development of the companies was only bad to predict.
Now, however, he has read IBM's Annual Reports and changed his opinion on investments in the industry.
He had to understand much earlier that IBM was primarily offering services and providing computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered a knight's strike in the financial world.
As a result, the IBM IT Urgestein may now call itself \"Sir IBM\".
Because Buffett now revealed in the U.S. economic broadcaster CNBC that he has bought IBM shares worth 10.7 billion dollars since March.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway has thus risen to one of IBM's largest shareholders with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that not even IBM had known anything about the engagement so far.
He praised the management, which even in the economic crisis was still responsible for proper profits.
“You’ve done a great job,” Buffett said.
IBM has been relying on lucrative IT services for some time, such as the operation of data centers.
The more than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consulting and powerful corporate calculator.
Buffett had avoided technology companies to date rather.
He says he's just investing in companies that he understands.
Instead, Buffett intervened, for example, in a freight railway, in the case of a lubricant manufacturer or machine builders.
His holding Berkshire Hathaway also owns some 80 of his own subsidiaries in a number of large corporations such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Municher's return.
In the 1960s the 81-year-old took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway and expanded it into one of the most valuable companies in the world with smart investments.
Nevertheless, his lifestyle is modest.
He is therefore a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost indeterminate sense of money-earning has given him the nickname ‘Oracle of Omaha’.
After becoming acquainted with the Buffett investment, the IBM share increased by one percent in advance.
“Big Blue, as IBM is also mentioned, is worth more than 220 billion dollars on the stock exchange, and is thus one of the world’s most valuable technology companies along with Apple and Microsoft.
With Microsoft, Buffett said, but he doesn't want to get in.
Founder Bill Gates was a close friend.
The threat is tangible
After the discovery of the Zwickauer Zelle, Turkish media in the German state of law doubted.
A newspaper even speaks of a \"bloody ideology\" that now revives.
The murders of eight Turkish tribesmen and a Greek small businessman between 2000 and 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
This message is being responded to with fear and anxiety in Turkey and within the German population in Germany.
Because for many German Turks, this has returned a long-held ghost: since the fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence with right-wing extremist background against Turks.
The fact that foreigners are hostile in Germany has never been questioned.
However, the discovered right-extremist network reveals extents, the dimension of which is not yet visible.
“Relives the bloody ideology,” said the Turkish newspaper Haberturk, entitled “The Internet Edition of the Turkish Newspaper.
On the other hand, the newspaper \"Sabah\" stresses that one of the perpetrators should have been a V-man of constitutional protection, and is concerned that German authorities could also be involved in the right-hand radical swamp.
The Turkish community of Germany responded with a reminder to the victims of racist violence in front of the Brandenburg Gate on the weekend.
Only two weeks earlier, together with German and Turkish politicians, the Turkish community in Berlin had thought of a celebration of the fiftyth anniversary of the German-Turkish application agreement.
In happy colors, the fellowship had been staged - as a story of success.
Like an eardrum, some Turkish media report: \"Germany's gift to the fiftyth - is the title of an article in the Turkish Internet platform \"Haber X\" that references the backgrounds of the murder series.
The German edition of the \"Hürriyet\" cannot be taken for granted.
“It starts to stink,” says Ahmet Külahci’s column title.
He stressed that people had been murdered, that taxes had been paid and that their work had made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany.
The action of the police in German-Turkish Internet forums is extremely critical and the subsequent success of the investigation will be discussed.
The authors wonder why the German authorities have not been much more concerned about looking for suspects in right-wing extremist circles.
Some of them show themselves ready for drastic means, at least rhetorically: “If there is still a sloppy here, the migrants will have nothing but self-defence and armsification,
\"This will probably be the best self-protection,
“The quality of the education and the appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network depends very heavily on the internal peace in Germany,” writes \"Selen.
What it means when inner peace in Germany is in danger illustrates the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s.
The photo of the fire ruins of Solingen is deeply anchored in German and Turkish memory.
For no other event showed the Turks living here more clearly that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans that distrust and distance can lead to violence in the right.
However, the attacks sharpened the feeling of our being on the Turkish side.
Do not repeat past errors
In the Turkish press, the failure of German politics after the attacks was particularly reprehensible: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After Solingen's fire attack, he sent a programme of condolences to the Turkish Presidents, but was represented by his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel at the Cologne funeral - Kinkel was in his speech at the time how many charges the local Turks were making.
In a way, the value of a person is calculated according to the amount of his taxes.
The current reporting of Turkish media once again shows how deep the distrust of many German Turks has been in the state of law ever since.
In addition to the efforts of extensive clarification and re-evaluation of the extreme right-wing terrorism in Germany, it needs open words this time.
The Scandal Bank of the Curision
Europe's most adventurous bank is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS went almost bankrupt in the financial crisis and since then, from one crisis to the next.
Now it's supposed to be a German.
Axel Weber probably didn't think so.
After his spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank, he was announced in July that he would enter a nearly as spectacular new job in 2013: President of the Board of Directors of the Swiss Grand Bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step.
Axel Weber was delighted to be public, praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS, whether it was their newly gained solidarity and made friendly comments about the future colleagues.
“The UBS has created the tournament “
“I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel,
But already in September it became clear that everything would be completely different.
A UBS dealer in London had bypassed all the bank's security systems and had sunk about 1.7 billion euros.
UBS CEO Oswald Grübel, a banker not only famous in Switzerland, had to go.
Since then, the President of the Board of Directors of the UBS has also been regarded as being attacked - and all ask: When will Axel Weber finally arrive?
Weber was already known to advise the bank from February 2012.
And he takes over the Board of Directors already in May - not only in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber this will be hard.
He's not a banker, he's a business professor and a banker, and he would certainly have needed a start-up time.
He then takes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just once again proved that it has long earned the title of the “largest scandal bank of Europe”.
Because the UBS is on the one hand huge - until recently it was the largest asset manager in the world - and, on the other hand, has slid from one scandal to the next for years.
Nothing seems to save the once proud Swiss bank.
It began in the financial crisis.
Until 2007, the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the secluded and solid, but also outsourced Swiss asset manager had combined it with ambitious goals: it also wanted to become a very large number in investment banking.
In 2007, UBS managed more money-capable customers than any other bank in the world with 1.6 trillion dollars.
On the other hand, as an investment bank, she was promoted to the league of the largest banks in the world.
That made an impression.
The former banker and later long-standing bank professor in Zurich Hans Geiger says: “My students always put the UBS as a pattern of a good bank at that time,
“From today’s point of view, it’s a question: How could I be just so confused? ”
He was so crazy.
In 2007, it was first revealed that something was wrong in the UBS.
In the middle of the year, Chief Executive Officer Peter Wuffli resigned surprisingly, which until then was considered a highly intellectual and as a genius banker.
A few months later, they knew why he had gone.
The bank's investment share had become saturated with subprime papers and had to write down billions.
In order to protect this, the UBS announced a capital increase of say and wrote 13 billion francs.
In fact, she found investors, however, who, some of whom had been strangled by the nose until just before, an intangible Asian State Fund from Singapore and an Arab State Fund, which was so limited that one did not even know his name.
But that was only the first blow.
It was worse in April 2008.
The bank had to announce new billions of losses, President Marcel Ospel, President of the Board of Directors, in 2006 and the second-best-paid Board of Directors in Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: UBS faced the collapse of the financial crisis and had to be rescued from the state in the face of its misinvestment.
The National Bank bought the UBS for zig billion problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a forced change bond over which it could become co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shaken - for she noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it hosts so large banks.
Finally, the balance sheet total of the 2007 UBS was more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see graphic).
“Once again, we could not save the UBS,” says bank researcher Geiger.
The second was followed by the first disaster.
A few months after that, UBS capitalized on the tax dispute with America and declared itself willing to release the data of capable customers who might have been deducting taxes with the help of the bank.
In addition, she agreed to a payment of 780 million dollars - as a repayment of unjustified profits from these transactions, including penalty.
This made the UBS more or less open to help with tax recovery.
At the same time, she lost something that had ever been her capital in the competition for rich customers: the Nimbus of vulnerability.
After the scandal, the Swiss banking secret was no longer the same.
It followed the resignation of CEO and Board of Directors.
And the Exodus of Customer Money.
Within a few months, the Bank had lost its credibility in both central business areas: in investment banking through misspecifications and in asset management through the assistance for tax recovery.
And just when it got a bit quieter again, just as you thought, now the UBS will get back to you, then this ugly dealer story follows: a single dealer consumes 1.7 billion euros before the bank realizes that something is going wrong.
And it turns out: With the risk management in investment banking, it obviously still doesn't work.
\"With the Adoboli case one has to find that risk control has changed too little - says Martin Janssen, economist and financial professor at the Banking Institute at the University of Zurich.
The financial board of a large German bank is also certain: “The problem with UBS is that it does not have the risk control in mind,”
But it was the very idea of caution, with which the Swiss bankers had long since joined to become guardians of the great wealth of the world: no too great risks, security for money - even beyond the Alpine Republic once allowed the world to collapse.
The treasures of Swiss banks have become a symbol of unshakable reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli for especially noble chocolate.
The headquarters of the UBS in Zurich still fits the cliché of the Swiss private bank - it is just a little bigger.
Already the location is classic.
The bank has its headquarters at Zurich station street, which leads directly from the main train station to Lake Zurich, which is framed by the snow-covered peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are beautiful, the store rents are among the highest in Europe.
Jewellery like Tiffany's can be found here between Swiss traditional shops such as the Confiserie Sprüngli.
For centuries, Swiss banks have resided here: from the National Bank to the Palace of Credit Suisse to elitaire private banks such as Julius Bär.
The reception hall of the UBS enters through a heavy turning door.
Inside the walls are marble-dressed, thick leather armchairs, alongside the bank logo a large sign to the “safe”
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: safety.
This idea of the Swiss Bank has pushed both Swiss big banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but eventually - or betrayed, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He would rather not read his name in the newspaper, and finally, like all Swiss bankers, he does business with the two big banks as well.
The UBS has become much too large, he finds - especially in investment banking, where the fishing axes have also spread.
The Swiss would have nothing to say.
“And if so, they have long adapted to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons,
In fact, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed the UBS, gave it high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution has lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the Swiss big bank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster became visible.
“On Wednesday, the government coalition of the small seven million country decided the greatest rescue action in the history of its nation,” writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book “The UBS Crash”
Up to 68 billion francs or about 45 billion euros, politicians agreed to save the big bank in the face of bankruptcy.
How could it be?
Speaking with Swiss bankers, they see the problem, especially in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three large Swiss banks joined together to form a huge group.
There was a bank that was already too big during the merger for small Switzerland - and continued to grow.
In doing so, the two different predecessor banks of the UBS added up: a rich but sleepy bank with a focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer but even more internationalized bank.
Suddenly, the internationalized investment banks got a lot of money with which they could run a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with this rise of the UBS: Peter Wuffli, head of the UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors.
“I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team,” says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
“Wuffli, the highly intellectual, modest, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the abdominal man, who has worked from the teaching of banking to the very top,
But Ospel ended up relying on Wuffli.
And Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake in the end: “He thought his models were reality,” says Geiger.
\"This is a tragic case\"
Tragic, maybe.
It's clear: Suspiciousness came before the case.
UBS employees clearly remember the executive meetings, on which Group Chief Wuffli repeatedly issued the same parole: Goldman Sachs came from the throne.
The American Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
It led the \"League Tables\", the rankings that documented the success of banks of that time.
That's where the UBS wanted to go up.
Some steps have already been successful.
In foreign exchange and stock trading, she played all the way up.
However, business consultants who were commissioned raised a weakness: in the international interest rate business, in the banking language \"Fixed Income\", there is a huge distance to the largest banks.
UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS turned into an adventure that cost it almost the existence.
Hungry after growth, both the bank itself and a hedge fund established before it invested in American subprime facilities.
It developed into a massive machine, which packed and extended securities on American mortgage loans - but also held risks.
Even when other banks were looking for a long way out.
“In the summer of 2007, when the American real estate market was in flames, UBS bought it there,” says bank expert Geiger.
So big the euphoria, so deep the case.
One manager had to go after the other as the attempts to clear up were more difficult than expected.
Posts at the UBS became the seat of the castle and are still wobbly.
Whoever leads the big bank now has a nearly impossible job.
It needs to find a strategy for a bank that has lost all nearby business models.
Banking researcher Geiger already has an idea: end with investment banking, focus on asset management, return to the Swiss roots.
The bank does not want to go (yet).
But the investment banking is supposed to shrink strongly, so much is already clear.
Next Thursday, the new bank leader Sergio Ermotti wants to present his future strategy.
In fact, the 51-year-old Italo-Swiss was only thought of as a transitional solution when the bank separated itself surprisingly from predecessors Gübel.
In the meantime, he has endured: he is expected to carry out the business of the UBS permanently, the Zurich Bank announced on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to get the investment bank back to its stand in the mid-nineties.
He's leaving 3500 places.
But that won't be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions Axel Weber is certainly already asking himself.
To date, he says only that he and his wife will first find an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe burdens US stock exchange
The threatening recession in Europe has given the US investors the courage at the start of the week.
The change of government in Athens and Rome remained unbeatable.
The dredging industrial production on the continent sparked hopes for a stabilization of the debt crisis in the germ.
The general relief on the change of government in Rome and Athens could not be enforced.
The euro fell against the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass has been in the past week as half full, not half empty - but now the problems were pushed back into the foreground, said Mark Luschini from Janney Montgomery Scott.
In particular, financial values were on the sales records.
The Dow-Jones index of the standard values noted at the trade end with a minus by 0.6 percent at 12,078 points.

Industry in the 17 euro countries has significantly reduced its production and is moving towards the end of the upturn.
The companies produced two percent less in September than in the previous month, as reported by the Eurostat statistical office.
This is what the US investors scepticalally said: “We are not an island but dependent - Steve Goldman said about Goldman Management.
Europe will not be able to free itself from a recession so quickly, and there will also be further signs of the weakness of banks.
The investment legend Warren Buffett only confirmed this caution: It is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything for an end to the crisis, he said in a CNBC interview.
That is why it is too early to invest in European government bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett introduced a decade-old principle over the piles and entered the U.S. technology industry.
His investment over more than ten billion dollars in IBM was based on the company's share price and led him to record almost one percent higher against the trend in trade at first.
The paper closed almost unchanged at $187.35.
Buffett paid an average of 170 dollars per piece according to his own data and now holds 5.5 percent.
The share price of his investment firm Berkshire Hathaway lost 1.3 percent.

Smart crows spread in cities
Many species are considered to be “problem birds”: however, from the cities the highly intelligent animals can no longer be displaced, experts claim.
One likes them, the other wants to get rid of them very quickly: crows have been part of the cityscape for centuries, but in many municipalities residents complain about the dirt and noise of animals.
A means of combating the \"problem birds\" has not yet been seen.
Seeds were no longer to be obtained from the cities, experts said during the first crowing symposium in East Frisian empty.
There, experts from all over the federal area discussed possible distances.
You are looking for alternatives in the cities
Naturalists also brought back the problems in cities to the land runoff of the particularly protected seeds: the chemical use in agriculture is increasingly destroying the traditional habitats.
Hunting, growing cultivation, and the fall of typical breeding trees made life difficult for birds.
Cranes are protected by nature.
There are large colonies with more than 600 breeding couples in the Westfälische Soest, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
There, in 2005, a controversial project on the mass killing of crows in the district had provided for negative-slags.
Critics had called the catching of the animals in bird traps and the beating with buds as particularly brutal.
“The normal displacement, the glare, does not bring anything,” stated the city planner Werner Klöver from Leer.
Injecting nests with water or falling trees often have adverse consequences, said the environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
“The animals are moving, large colonies are splitting up and spreading in other places,
Magnification is only possible as an exception to hospitals, old age homes or schools.
“We have to live with them, we don’t get them away anymore,”
Without the surrounding country, the problem in the cities could not be solved, said Mayor Wolfgang Kellner from Leer.
It can be thought of as a combination of moorings of animals from sensitive living areas and lock-offs in order to re-site them in other places.
“Info boards instead of chain saws,” the psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens, on the other hand, pointed out, for a completely different treatment with the animals: “We can finally bear a pickle in the face at best self-consciously,”
In Schleswig-Holstein, Jürgens had co-founded the Krähen-Lehrpfad in Ashberg, informing us about the life of the highly intelligent seeds.
The project is already being adopted by tourists.
Jürgens also had his own opinion on the criticism of the noise of birds: \"There is a lot of communication, they have much to say,
The intelligence and skill of animals are legendary: seeds not only use tools to get to a delicious bite, but as a tool they even produce their own tools.
Behavioral researchers at Cambridge University recently tested on four seeds, as far as the intelligence of birds is concerned.
In an experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to use stones to insert a gear in order to reach a moth larvae.
Without much training, they realized purposely what size and shape a stone must have in order to make the platform collapse.
In a second attempt, the peepy crows had to solve a knife problem.
In a vertical cylinder, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a moth larvae.
With the beak the birds could not reach their prey.
However, the researchers had laid down wire pieces for them.
From this all four animals formed a hook, with the help of which they then nailed the bucket at the handle of the tube.
Three of the four seeds have even succeeded in this.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal at EM 2012
The hopes of the Bosnians and the Turks for a coup remained unresolved.
The favorites Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland are also at EM 2012.
In the Playoffs, Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have solved the latest tickets to the 2012 European Championship in Poland and Ukraine.
Guided by the twice successful Superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53th), Portugal beat Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and, after the 0th of the play, made the fifth EM division perfect in a row.
The Czechs reached a 1:0 (0:0) in the play-off replay with the outsider Montenegro, after the play (2:0) had already been a clear thing.
Nothing more had also burned Croatia against Turkey at 0:0, Ireland got a loose 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24th), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) reached the next hit for Portugal.
The former Wolfsburger Bundesliga-Profi Zvjezdan Misimovic with a transformed trade meter (41.) and Captain Emir Spahic (65.) had twice shortened for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic saw the yellow-red map (54.).
Bosnia had already failed Portugal in the Playoffs at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.
In the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal gained a start to measure.
Ronaldo chased a free shot of about 30 meters for early leadership into the stitches.
A good quarter hour later, Nani showed his wide-ranging quality and met at 2:0 from 25 meters.
The Bosnians, who did not take place in the first half hour, had their first clear chance by Torjager Edin Dzeko.
The ex-Wolfsburger from the English table leader Manchester City put a headball at the lower edge of the latte, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33.).
Jiracek meets for the Czech Republic
After that, Arbitration Judge Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding was at the heart of the project.
After an attack against Heroer Postiga in the Bosnian penitentiary, Strong decided on Schwalbe and showed the Portuguese the yellow card (36.).
On the other hand, Stark gave a controversial trade meter after an action by Fabio Coentrao, who certainly transformed Misimovic.
But after the break, the vice-european champion of 2004 made everything clear with four hits.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek ended the last doubt in the 81st minute.
This makes the European champion of 1976 the fifth time in a row to the EM.
However, the team of coach Michal Bilek with the Bundesliga-Legionaires Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nürnberg) also had luck and had to overcome a fear second in the initial phase.
Finally, Petr Cech, with a reflex at the last moment, prevented a possible ownership by Tomas Sivok (9).
Montenegro had its greatest opportunities when the Duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic shot just barely past Cech's gate in the 40th minute from the turn of the penalty limit.
After the break, the quartz had to save the Czechs for the already beaten world class gate, and again the storm of the FC Seoul had dropped (50).
Finally, the gate was clear.
Turkey therefore missed the football winner of Zagreb.
Four days after the 0:3 in Istanbul the Turks in Zagreb did not come out above a 0:0.
While National Trainer Guus Hidthink therefore has to clear its seat on the 2002 World Cup's Bank, the Croats may be pleased about their fourth participation in an EM final round.
Before 31,000 spectators at the Maximir Stadium, the Turks had almost got a dream start.
In the seventh minute, Selcuk Inan met only the pussies, attacker Kazim Kazim was unable to lower the crash in the gate.
But after the horrors, Croatia became more and more control.
Even after the break, the Croats didn't burn anything.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic of the VfL Wolfsburg, who took place from the 62nd minute for the Dortmunder Ivan Perisic, the Bundesliga Legionaries Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were still in service.
Trapattoni drives to EM
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated the first EM participation since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward led the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already made a preliminary decision with the 4th success in the play, in the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) equally for the guests.
From the beginning, Ireland pushed for the pace, but had to wait until the 23rd minute before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.
Only at the last moment did the Estonian Hinter team prevent the possible leadership.
But it was time in the 32nd minute.
After a failed defence by Lainmann Pavel Londak, Ward was in place and pushed the ball to 1:0 over the line.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China
Europe's largest software manufacturer SAP will invest billions in China in the next few years and will almost double the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, around two billion dollars (about 1.5 billion euros) were expected to flow, the Dax Group announced on Tuesday.
“We will create additional research and development facilities and hire employees accordingly,” announced Co-Chief Bill McDermott at a customer fair in Beijing.
The workforce is currently expected to grow from about 2500 to 4500 employees.
The number of branches of the world market leader for corporate software will double from five to ten or eleven.
To date SAP is present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
Around 4000 of the world’s more than 176,000 SAP customers are sitting in the boom country.

Mass slaughter on a personal level
A story of World War I, which tells about nineteen fates, begins Peter Englund’s new book, “Beautiful and Horrorous,” with a long list of the main characters who come to your heart.
Here is a tip on how to proceed: Cut out this page carefully and make it your bookmark.
You will get to know these people very well in Englund's romantic narrative. And these principals will function as your GPS, as a lighthouse in these few moments when you like Englund's men and women are lost in the fog of war and robbed of your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which determines the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He wrote an unusual book, which he does not describe unfairly as \"a work of anti-history\".
It contains only a few big names, important contracts or famous battles. There are hardly any ambassadors, rushing reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It's less a book about what happened, he explains, but rather, \"a book about how it was--It's about \"feelings, impressions, experiences and moods.\"
“Beautifulness and horror - almost the war experiences of 20 more or less inconspicuous men and women on both sides of the war together, from schoolgirls and botanists to mountaineers, doctors, ambulances and office workers.
Some of these people become heroes.
Some become prisoners of war, lose limbs, become crazy or die.
Each of these lives flatens up like the votive candles in a church, some come along while others disappear.
Englund's book deviates from the usual history books.
It also corrects the notion that the First World War was only the devastating war of position on the Western Front.
“Beautifulness and horror - wanders with expert views of other war sites: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book fall bee baskets, a celebrated Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt, Tsetswings are an inescapable problem.
This is almost a moving book from the beginning.
The war floods the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a hurricane Katrina, who smells like Kordit.
Imagine you're a woman who's home with her children and hears gunfire in the distance. Are you staying or taking the run?
Who ever comes?
No one can understand what is happening or why this war is ever going to take place.
“Following facts - such as Englund notes, “words with assumptions, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors are furnished,
“Beautifulness and horror” follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German ship sailor.
Her stories were mainly taken from memories, letters and other already published material.
Their life reports can be frightening or touching, but they are extremely alive in Englund's collection of small moments that are lost in detail.
Many of them act of lack and help themselves.
In the story of a German schoolgirl, he says: “Replacement, replacement everywhere”
“Replacement coffee, false aluminum, false radishum, paper associations, wooden buttons”
He tells more about the replacement dinner in Germany.
He describes “meat made from pressed rice and baked in hammeal fat (and lastly served with a false bone of wood), tobacco made from dried roots and dried potato shells, shoes coated with wood,
There were, as he noted, “837 registered food substitutes allowed in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes,
Some stories act of honor and bravery.
An American recognizes his own urge to be wild and says about the war: “It is felt that despite everything that was intended for men rather than sitting in the chair, with the evening leaf or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whiskey in his hand, and so to do, it meant such a facade civilization and as if there were no barbarians behind his own reinforced and sloppy shirt,
Conversely, a British soldier recognizes that he is likely to die and no one will take note of it or take care of it.
“If one takes distance from the thought of sacrificing oneself, one wants to think that this is happening in front of an audience,” he writes.
Instead, it is as terrible as \"a condemned man who has been hanged in secret\"
Other observations deal with the old Europe, which falls apart, and with new types of terrorism.
“The conflict became increasingly an economic contest,” says Englund, “a war between the factories.
He catches the arrival of what he calls “a new species in the bestiary of the still young century”: “the word turned and ideologically convinced mass murderers in a suit that beats while sitting behind a desk,
People behave in an unforeseeable manner and there is just as frivolous behavior as heroism.
Englund talks about the soldiers who actively tried to get into a prostitute with a sexual disease to escape the front line.
“The grotesque expression of this can be discovered in the trade with Gonoccok eggs, because soldiers bought and lubricated themselves on their genitals, hoping to get to the hospital in this way,” he writes.
“Those who were really desperate would rip him in their eyes, which led them to blindness for the rest of their lives.”
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves, Englund's poetry becomes supple and yet unobtrusive and adapts perfectly to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, he captures the way in which the war - once uncontrollable forces disintegrated: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred -
People are beginning to wonder why their leaders are bringing them to battle.
The best books about World War I were usually more distorted than Paul Fussell's \"Great War and Modern Memory\" or novels such as Erich Maria Remarque's \"In the West Nothing New\" as extensive history books.
Englund's band joins an unconventional hall of fame.
His book has the most devastating end I've ever read in a book.
I'm not going to give it anymore.
But it is as if he had taken this page away with his book with the main characters in front of the nose and lit it with a stringed wood.
After an early mistake, a minutely planned assault
Hundreds of police officers were involved in wearing some of them's bet helmets.
It was decided for the night from Monday to Tuesday, because at that time there are hardly any people in Zucotti Park.
The operation was kept secret and only a few senior officials were informed, and everyone else initially believed to participate in an exercise.
Police President Raymond W. Kelly was among them in the middle and his presence underlined the fact that the operation was full of challenges.
The incidents of recent weeks, such as the use of pepper spray against protesters, which violated the rules of the department and gave the householders a huge increase in public sympathies, were no longer allowed to repeat.
And so the police action was carried out to remove protesters from Zuccotti Park after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared these by observing occupations handled in other cities.
A disaster exercise had taken place with a look at Zuccotti on Randalls Island.
Officials reinforced the so-called chaos training - measures to combat terrorism, including the rapid displacement of a large number of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training unit took place Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to move into the park came, in the last minute, someone who was familiar with the orders, who spoke for a declaration as \"training\".
“The few police officers involved in my knowledge did not know it was about Zuccotti Park,” said someone who wanted to remain anonymous.
“The only ones who knew it was about Zuccotti Park were the high-ranking officials of the resort,
One reason for secrecy was a lesson that the city had learned.
On October 14th, officials wanted to clear the park, but then they went back when hundreds of protesters came together after they had learned of these plans.
Officials of various police units were involved in the operation of Tuesday, including commissions from all over the city - hundreds of mobile officials who are usually used in highly criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that during the day many people enter and exit in the park, almost like Pendler, so that 1 o'clock at night is a good time to go in.
“It was appropriate to do this if the lowest number of people in the park are staying,” he said.
Rescue cars with Jupiter lamps and loudspeakers were available before departure at Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near Manhattan Bridge.
The lamps and the pre-recorded news that droneed out of the speakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
When public officials entered the park in their light blue windjackets, many protesters simply rallied their things together and left the place.
The police said that by 1:45 a.m., no tents would be touched to give protesters time to pack their belongings and goods together.
Other teams of officials were seen collecting around to intervene, arrests in the park should become necessary.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, spokesperson of the police president, said that this had happened to their own security.
But many journalists claim that they wanted to stop them from observing the police actions in the park, and they said that the treatment of officials was very harsh.
Mr. Browne said TV cars in Church Street could have taken photos on the west side of the park.
When the police moved westward through the great confusion of the protesters' personal affairs, including suitcases, artificial grasses and bags with clothes, their employees followed the city cleaning, which had been abandoned.
Some protesters who refused to go were dragged outside. Pictures of this appeared on the Internet a short time later.
A core of protesters moved near the kitchen area of the camp in the centre of the park position.
Some built barriers and the police continued their methodical arrests.
About 10 people in the camp's epicenter banded together on their arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Civil protection officials were called to cut them apart.
As Mr Kelly said, no arrests in the park were carried out until about 3:30 p.m.
The room was closed after 75 minutes according to the police's statements.
Mr. Browne said that 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests came, as he said, because of \"unpredictable conduct and resistance to arrest\"
The most prominent local official was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the highest uniformed official in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, chief of the police department, was also there.
Despite his presence, Mr Kelly did not take the operation, as Mr Browne said.
In case they were to access, a second group of officials were waiting on the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street.
In Cortlandt Street, a street block north of the park, and in Pine Street, a block further south, barricades were built.
It could be observed how from these locations the police continued to extend the circle around Zuccotti Park.
One place was observed as several officials, many of them with signs of protection, drove persons outside.
About 28 people were in the northern circle.
Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
At 5 p.m., a protester jumped south of Pine Street on the roof of a police vehicle and other protesters left the air out of the tire of a police bus.
In one place, the crowd threw a piece of plywood.
In the end, an official and a protester came to the hospital.
Trade union of operators will file proceedings against the city for dismissals
The union, representing hundreds of schoolteachers who lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday, as the dismissals are not necessary and discriminatory due to their inappropriate influence on schools that teach poor students.
The complaint is probably the last possibility that the Trade Union, Council 37, is still open in its efforts to reverse the redundancies.
Six hundred and seventy-seven school assistants, care coordinators and other employees who were among the worst paid employees in the city and lost their jobs on 7 October, described the union leader as political revenge for refusing access to a health fund that was held by the working groups with which the budget gap was to be closed.
This charge was rejected by the authorities categorically.
At a hearing of the City Council, Dennis M. Walcott, director of schools, said last month that the redundancies were part of the budget that was adopted in June.
A member of the City Council shot back and explained to him that nothing specified in the budget would be dismissed by school assistants.
Officials of the City Council 37 said they had and warned the Ministry of Education of a complaint. On Wednesday there will be a press conference to formally announce the submission of the complaint before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
Mr. Walcott and the City's Ministry of Education will act as accused and eight dismissed workers will count as complainants, all of which are colored or Latin American women, like most of the helpers who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesperson of the City's Ministry of Justice, said that the city did not submit the complaint and thus its individual allegations could not be commented.
According to a draft lawsuit filed by the New York Times, the union has focused on the number of redundancies at the schools in the poor districts of the city to support a complaint for inequality treatment. It claims that poor schools have lost more helpers as they are chronically underfunded.
It shows that while there were no redundancies on Staten Island and few redundancies in the schools of the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school assistants in District 23 lost in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 helpers in Districts 8 and 9 were released in the South Bronx.
With the determination of the loss of five out of eight school assistants employed in public school 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the complaint states: “This is not a neighborhood of well - meaning parents who can organize donations to catch budget cuts,
P.S.: The budget of the 36th district was reduced by 3.26 percent this year. In addition, funds were lost when the city changed its method of calculation for extra funding for each school registration.
The union also complains that the leaders of high schools were led into error by the language in a memo that approved the dismissal of the care coordinators.
The memo used the English word “excess” to describe the action, even if “excess” (German: translate) in the United States usually describes the change of a teacher from the salary list of a school to a pool of available workers paid by the central office.
“Sixty-six care coordinators were dismissed, not translated,” states the draft motion for a resolution.
Mission ended, Congress ready to agree on Libya
Finally, it looks as if Republicans and Democrats in Washington were already trying to agree on the uprisings in Libya.
All that was needed was the success of the revolt, the arrest and murder of the long-standing dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the end of the American interference.
On Thursday, the Committee for International Relations of the Senate adopted a resolution, which is supported by President John Kerry (Massachussetts) together with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), praising Libya for the successful rebellion and the US troops for their courage.
“This resolution honors the courageous people of Libya who started rebuilding their country,” said Kerry.
\"It is a confirmation of the support of its democratic efforts by two parties,
The language may sound innocent, but to date, nothing was simple in the Libyan debate.
This summer, legislators of both parties and the White House argued over the choice of a series of resolutions to approve or disapprove of the role of the U.S. military in the Libyan Mission of NATO.
In June Kerry and McCain presented a resolution that approved the limited use of military forces in Libya.
The law was rejected in the Senate by a broad margin group of both parties, and no vote was taken.
But on the same day, this law passed in the Senate. Furthermore, the Chamber passed a decision to reduce the funds for American operations in Libya.
As a result, the U.S. mission went into a kind of legislative purgatory - with a congress that was open enough to criticize Obama's action in the context of the mission, but not angry enough to finally pull him off the ground below his feet.
Then the inconsistency of Congress was overtaken by the events.
Tripoli fell in August among Libyan rebels and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on International Relations \"gratulates Libya’s people for their enormous courage and extraordinary endurance in their self-liberation, and praises the men and women of the U.S. military and their coalition partners, who support military operations to protect people in Libya, for their extraordinary courage and professionalism,
The resolution also reaffirms \"the national interests of the United States in a successful and irrevocable transition from Libya to democracy\"
Will the new measures receive full support from the foreign relations body or will they divide the legislators as did the June Act?
The last version is about the resistance of Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the top Republican of the committee.
Lugar's spokesperson said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to Kapitol, it is up to the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional amendment that calls for a balanced budget, a top priority in almost every congress legislature period of Republicans and some Democrats.
The measures under the direction of Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget or other area currently in force in the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have so far tried unsuccessfully to bring their amendments to the vote, although they have often tried enough.
Goodlates amendment is only one of 68 constitutional amendments presented to this Congress and covers a wide range of topics.
Some are double - the same law was presented to both Congress and the Senate - others are only slightly different.
In the Senate alone, there are at least 15 versions of the budgetary amendment and another dozen that would ‘control federal spending’.
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their clients - especially beginners from the Republicans who want to polish their resume - the possibility to boast that they have written such a measure.
The Budgetary Control Act, adopted in August, requires both Senate and Congress to vote on a change in budgetary compensation.
In March 58 senators voted for a non-binding resolution that supports the idea of such a change.
In addition to the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions that members of Congress can make, while Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wants to remove the limitation on two term of office of the President.
The Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a number of changes that guarantee, among other things, the right to good education and health care.
A change that forbids marriage among same-sex persons is just like a change that prohibits burning flags, a recurring template.
Some legislators also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if two-thirds of the states reject them.
As diligent as the members propose changes, they move faster than in recent years.
In the 111th Congress, legislators submitted 77 such amendments. in the 110th Congress 66.
The pace fades in comparison to that of the early 1990s in which members regularly proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, so the figures that the Senate Library makes available.
But they were not much more successful than today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 but was actually proposed to Congress in 1789.
“Finded, but not defeated,” said Giffords in the first television interview after the assassination
Ten months after an armed man from a distance had shot at her during an election in Tucson, Republican Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) performed Monday evening on national television. She sang alone to the Broadway piece \"The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow\" and said that her desire to recover was greater than that of returning to Congress.
When she appeared in the ABC News “20/20” together with Diane Sawyer, she ranked for words and needed help when going.
The broadcast showed the heavy slow recovery from the damage caused by the bullet dividing its skull, pierced the left side of its brain and crossed its head from front to back.
Three months ago she returned to Congress surprisingly to give her voice to the debt brake.
In her first TV interview after the attack in January, where six people were killed and 13 were injured, Gifford smiled, laughed and sang - and described her healing as \"severe\"
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gifford replied (41): \"Goodbye\"
The interview with Gifford and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an one-hour “20/20” special that was recorded shortly before the publication of the couple’s new book: “Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope”
The special has been pursuing Gifford's recovery since the assassination of January 8.
In videos that Kelly recorded in the first few weeks, she was seen in the hospital bed, with cold shaved head and a long scarf over the forehead.
She can only lift one or two fingers if her husband encourages her to do so.
Months later, Giffords sits in a wheelchair while therapists show her how to perform simple movements.
A nick with his head.
A tick with the lip.
And then, their first words: \"What\"
After a few days, Giffords whispers another word: \"Toast\" You want her breakfast changed.
Videos played in the ABC show show show that music played an important role in Giffords' recovery: one can see how the congress delegates sing along with the therapists to Cyndi Laupers'Girls Just Wanna Have Fun and Tom Petty's Free Fallin.
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who spends two hours daily with therapy, said she cannot remember the day of the attack.
Her husband said that on March 12, he had read a daily article about the assassination when he interrupted him and asked for the first time about the six people who had been killed during the assassination.
The suspected shooter Jared Lee Loughner sits in a prison in Missouri and is necessarily treated medically while he is waiting for his trial.
“Many people have died,” said Giffords Sawyer.
‘Hard heart, heart, heart’
In the course of his wife's recovery, Kelly Sawyer said, \"I was hit\"
“So, I would say, ‘Gabby, you haven’t been defeated, ’ said Kelly.
You were only hit.
And you will endure and you will recover and you will come back stronger than ever before.
Forces feel more compassion than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that collected millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
A hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines gathered around him.
The crowd in black smokings stood up and applauded.
“The soldiers and soldiers were seen as heroes,” said David Saltzman, who organized the donation action in spring.
A senior military officer on the Gala, who was observed by the chief of staff and then chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
“They were introduced like orphans,” the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers meant it well.
I know.
But it was no respect, it really wasn't. It was pity.
The scratches of contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and the most distant, sometimes admired American public.
The troops are being overcrowded with praise for their victims.
But praise has its price, say servants.
The public is increasingly acting as if it were harming people in uniform.
“We were by no means victims,” said Brigade General Sean B. MacFarland, who would command troops in Iraq and soon go to Afghanistan.
“But apparently the only way to support that is to push us into the role of unhappy souls is to “
The issue is extremely sensitive to military leaders who do not want to appear unrecognizable or in conflict with the public they serve.
They also recognized that the rage that the returning troops had against in the last few years of the Vietnam War was much worse.
As a result, discussions about compassion take place in silence and private relations between war veterans.
After his two sons returned from fighting with the Navys, Colonel a.D. Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would look at them with a sense of reverence as they had defeated rebels and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if a “worshipful, violent veteran was hiding below the surface,” said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and had taken over a high-ranking state post in Washington after his return.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some of the respondents asked subtly whether he was able to stand up to the pressure of a demanding post in Washington right after his return from the struggle.
\"If you talk about your service, you have to keep the negative impressions against it,\" said Cancian to his sons.
The lack of clarity of the military is partly rooted in the Americans' lack of interest in the war.
A country that has little experience with the military and sees little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan is rarely seen as a praise.
“We as a nation no longer appreciate military heroism as it was absolutely common in World War II,” said Lieutenant General David Barno, who had ordered US troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public focuses largely on the suffering of a servant.
troops find recognition for the number of attacks they have endured, the number of friends they have lost or for the severity of their injuries.
Military faces the growing pressure to fight violent rape
This week an important hearing decides whether 28 women and men will be accused of non-intervention in the case of rape before the military court.
Should it not be, hundreds of applicants are ready for the next hearing.
Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and was pregnant in the 11th week when she was raped by a soldier's colleague at night.
It was in October 2008 and she just returned to her barracks in Miramar north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when she met a male colleague who carried a 12 pack of beer.
He asked her if he should accompany her to a drink in her room.
“My alarm bells went on,” Lyman said.
But the Texaner raised her concerns.
I thought, \"What, he's 19.
He's from Texas, she said.
\"I wish I had heard my stomach feeling,
Few minutes after they went to Lyman's room, the man came after her, pushed her down, and raped her, claiming.
This week, on November 18th, Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel were anxiously waiting for a trial with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, in which it is decided whether an action brought against former Minister of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be brought before the court.
The complaint claims that Gates and Rumsfeld did not oppose the widespread rape within the military and in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
In February of Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., filed the complaint at first comprised 17 plaintiffs, who, however, rose to 28 in the following months: 25 women and three men, all claiming to have been raped or sexually abused by soldiers, and that the military failed to detect, condemn, or provide a reasonable justification for the alleged attacks.
Burke says she's following the supreme military leadership, since the problem is starting there.
“The military is hierarchically constructed,” she says.
\"Who are the individuals in the position to exterminate the culture of retribution?
Burke also says that since February she has contacted nearly 400 other survivors, many of them could be part of future lawsuits.
Their strategy: Instead of all the plaintiffs, so to speak, putting their eggs into a basket, they will, if necessary, file many more complaints in order to maintain the pressure.
The Defense Team for the Ministry of Defense, headed by state attorney Neil MacBride, has filed an application to reject the lawsuit.
The files of the court, which have been available in Newsweek, detailed the defence strategy, primarily that the military cannot be charged with violations by current or former soldiers to which it has come in the armed forces.
In the light of a 1950 Supreme Court law, the so-called Feres doctrine, the government is not liable for injuries committed by soldiers in the active service.
“The alleged damage occurred during the applicant’s military service,” the document states.
The Department of Defense rejects any comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not allowed to serve in battle, the distinction is unique in name: modern wars have only rarely clear fronts.
In Iraq as well as Afghanistan, teams of soldiers are increasingly playing important roles, particularly in contact with local women in the war zones.
The result: between these two wars 150 soldiers died, two-thirds of them in combat.
It's time for the military to be upgraded, says Burke.
And she is not alone in her struggle: three more complaints are pending besides her.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans' Legal Services Clinic is preparing a lawsuit against the four most important military academies for suspected promotion of a woman's hostile atmosphere.
Independently, the non-profit Vietnam Veterans of America filed a lawsuit against the military, focusing on the diagnosis of personality disorder, the rape victims received to release them from the service - a usual procedure according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
In December, her group filed a complaint against the Veterans Administration (i.e. the administration of war veterans) in which she accused her discriminatory practices in dealing with claims for benefits for persons who claimed to have been sexually abused in service.
Nine laws were passed independently by a mixture of senators and representatives of both parties to the Congress, which offer a number of points of reference.
In 2010, according to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (i.e. Office for Prevention and Reporting of Sexual Abuse) of the Department of Defense, 3,158 sexual abuses were shown.
But most abuses are not reported at all, and according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this figure takes into account about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases that occur each year.
The report, published in March, also examines the criminal prosecution rates: in 2010, 20 percent of the recorded cases in the military were brought before court, only half as many as in civil law.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case describe their attacks as just the first of a series of dreams.
In Lyman’s case, she reported the suspected rape of the military police less than an hour after the incident.
That night, she says, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape of a whole series of police officers, doctors and commanders.
She had a rape set and the blood of her attacker, which came from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge. During this hearing, she was asked about the sex she had had before the assault with her friend.
Six persons expressed themselves as characters in the name of the alleged perpetrator, who was finally released.
“I still remember the day when the verdict was read out,” Lyman says.
“I thought the woes would be going on. I ran out of the courtroom screaming “
“They brought me to the psychiatric department and I remember that when I came out again, I said to my commander, that was not his procedure. That was my procedure.”
Lyman was asked to visit a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder and declared it unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was unjustly dismissed, so that she did not receive any support.
Whether or not the complaint, the Lyman and the other plaintiffs have filed, is purely speculation, says John Turley, professor of law at George Washington University Law School.
Nevertheless, he noted: “I think they should move forward, ”
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine, which is criticized since it was first questioned.
I am a contemporary critic of the Feres doctrine.
The military is a decade behind because they do not have the same incentive and the same deterrence that brings liability.
He adds: “The chances are against them... but it is important for them to try it.”
These things will only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing does not follow its path, Burke, the lawyer of the complainants, will start with her hundreds of other complainants for future cases.
“We will continue to fight the military in this respect until reforms are made,” she says.
Or until we die, whatever happens first.
Walls have eyes: How researchers watch you on Facebook
Before he became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was only one of many boys who sent their anti-Emigration opinion online.
On Monday, Breivik, who had agreed to have taken his first public hearing in court at an amoc run in Norway in July, where 77 people were killed.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is by far not alone in cyberspace: he spent a lot of time on his attack before his computer and chatted with some of the millions of nationalists who support extreme groups on the right side of social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how do you find them?
That's easy - you just have to log in to Facebook.
“We found that it was not hard to come to them,” says Jamie Bartlett, the chief author of a recent report by the UK company DEMOS on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook's hiding of personal data is so encyclopaedic, says Bartlett that researchers simply need to use the advertising tool of the site to determine their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy - as marketers have done for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans of right-wing groups all over Europe and then visited them with additions, but instead of linking with a new band or a new diet product, the Adds invited users to a survey in which they were asked about their level of education, their attitude towards violence and the assessment of their own future.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to question more than 10,000 supporters of 14 extremely right parties in 11 European countries - without having to leave their office once.
“It’s a rather new method of research,” Bartlett says.
Some of the results are hardly surprising. Online advocates of right-wing groups are mostly young, male and angry about immigration.
But in a kind of surprising distortion, “those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more reasonable, democratic and less violent than those who sit behind their computer screens,
DEMO's work is just an example of how Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Ideas factories, medical researchers and political scientists use the page to study everything, from health issues to social trends, such as text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding three content per day on average, Facebook’s Datasupernova generates a research boom that has increased the number of scientific works with the name of this page in the title by almost 800% over the last five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is the fact that you can study through this page people you usually do not reach with your clipboard on the street.
\"If you tried earlier to question people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them,
“They had to inform the party first and they would never have been granted access to it,” Bartlett says.
“With Facebook, all of this falls away - you go straight to them”
Others say that the site offers an opportunity to identify and solve social health problems.
A current study by Dr. Megan Moreno from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who discussed their full-suspect on Facebook tend to be significantly stronger at problem drinking than students who swear on this topic.
Moreno suggests that equal level students, for example residential consultants, monitor the page and help a student when they post too many status updates.
“You can’t solve a problem if you haven’t recognized it,” said Dimitri Christakis, Morenos Ko author and head of Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children’s Research Institute in Seattle, Washington Post.
“We have found a way to identify endangered children that would not have been found otherwise,
Facebook also constantly taps the data of its own population.
The data team of the site has created statistics on relationship status and Valentine's Day, election participation in the mid-term elections 2010 and a National Happiness Index (where first and foremost, data that only Facebook has access to - Masters of digital freedom have long known that the site should make its large data base accessible to others for research purposes.)
But the users of Facebook know that the site they watch, whether they want it or not. To play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, you allow the site to carry out its own personal data.
But what if users of Facebook become part of a survey that they don't even know about?
While researchers have strictly defined guidelines on how to collect their data offline, everything is allowed online.
“I don’t think that many users have thought at all about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles,” says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, on a 2006 study in which he examined the public pages of students on Facebook.
\"As far as she is concerned, it was only about her and her friends,
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a researcher is absolutely honest.
On Facebook it is impossible to know how much of the information is true in a user profile and in contributions.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things - says Selwyn.
Thus, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn thinks that a clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools anyone can use.

‘Calt and inhumane’: Anders Behring Breivik appears before a public court for the first time
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who stood two amok runs in which 77 people were killed in Norway this summer, described himself as a \"resistant\" in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo.
“I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a temple knight in Norway,” he said in front of a courtroom with more than 500 people.
“I object to the court because you have received your mandate from organizations that support Hassideologies and because it supports multiculturalism,
“I recognize the laws, but I don’t confess myself”
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he “did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which he can express his views,
For the same reason, he denied Breivik, who gave a pre-written speech, the permission to turn to the members of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered that the police retain Breivik in investigation for 12 more weeks, he had no access to the media for four weeks. He said that the authorities will closely control all visits and the entire correspondence over eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and victims participated in the hearing.
Some came in the hope of seeing Breivik in the eye, others wanted to confirm that he remained behind Castle and Riegel.
All of them participated in the goal of getting everything out of a way.
“I thought he was cold and inhumane,” said a survivor of Utoya to Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
“It was unpleasant, but for me it went a bit further after I saw and heard the suspect,
Breivik wore a dark suit and a blue tie and worked quietly and professionally throughout the hearing. He looked at journalists and survivors in his eyes when he entered the building and left again.
Despite Breivik's bizarre remark that he was part of a larger “resistance” movement, the judge concluded that he was not mentally ill and said that there was no evidence that he would have been complicated.
It may seem to some that the attacks of July 22 was apparently the work of a single extremist and not that of a group of radicals.
But does this automatically ease the grief and confusion that an entire nation still feels?
“I wish he looked like a monster, but he doesn’t,” said a victim’s family member.

7 lessons of the interview with the deceased Steve Jobs, which was shown in a theater this week
After Steve Jobs' death on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, who created technology genius as a great modern inventor.
What Apple fans may find most revealing in the recent job interview, which was discovered this week before special film screenings on the important markets, is how much this creative head has understood business processes and workflows.
He was certainly a designer, dreamer and self-assigned hippie, but he was also an acribic organizer who eagerly based on diagrams - a man who believed that many executives suffer from “a disease of thinking - that a really great idea makes up 90 percent of the work... [but] there is a huge amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product“
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series “Triumph of the Fachidiots” about the break-up of the personal computer. And he spent more than an hour with jobs in which they conducted one of the rare, detailed conversations.
At that time, it was 10 years since jobs had been pushed out of Apple. And he was already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, and was looking forward to the broad adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringley's interview was used in specialist diodes, he says that the copy templates of the interview were missing during delivery.
Only after Job's death did a full VHS copy be discovered in the director's garage.
This easily revised film material forms the basis for the 68-minute film “Steve Jobs: The lost interview - which comes into the Landmark theatre this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who is known to be disguising detailed interviews, jobs here seem surprisingly zealous in explaining his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
Over the course of the interview, there are four longer breaks between the question and the answer - 10 to 15 seconds of midwives in which jobs clearly weigh their thoughts and strive for accuracy.
There are also moments in which jobs' perfectionism comes in days when he seems impatiently responding to Cringely's questions and pushing him to take on topics or side actions of greater importance more quickly.
Before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone recorded, the lost interview appears somehow mysteriously far-reaching when jobs evaluate what other companies do right or wrong in their opinion and represent their own vision of the future of the computer.
It is one thing to read posthumous ratings of the career jobs'. But seeing jobs here as the coveted dreamer who is on the jump to greatness is something very different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could be and should be.
Shortly after he did all of this here, he pulled out and did it.
A Quick Look at Seven Remarkable Sequences of the Lost Interview:
How he learned to run a company:
“During all the years in business, I always ask, “Why are you doing things,” and the answer you always get is, “Oh, it’s just done.”
No one knows why he does what he does.
I found out.
Jobs continues its efforts to rationalize the accounting at Apple.
Convinced how costs were recorded - usually one began with standard costs - which were counted on mere guessing and which were then adjusted by deviation - he developed an automated factory that ensured that business costs could be determined up to the smallest.
How the Pope is Specialized:
Jobs tells of the \"Blue Box\" he built with Steve Wozniak, a device that could be used to sneak into the phone company and take long distance calls.
Much has already been written about the device, but Jobs enthusiasm when he describes the Blue Box as an act of self-empowerment is contagious.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a chargeable phone, making a call and then connecting from one AT&T network to another, while dragging as many satellites as possible.
“We sent things around the globe for half a dozen times, and when you popped into the phone, it came out in the phone next door a minute later,” says Jobs kichernd.
“We were young and we learned that we can build something ourselves that can control trillions of dollars of infrastructure around the world,
We both didn't know much, but we could build this little thing that could control a gigantic thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don't think there would be Apple without it.
Jobs continues to tell of a glorious strike that Wozniak and he almost withdrew when they wanted to speak to the Pope in the middle of the night via the Blue Box in the Vatican, while they were so well able to imitate Henry Kissinger.
Since several members of the Catholic Hierarchy were called up in the middle of the night to speak with the American diplomat, the two had to be loosed before the pope himself came to the phone.
How he fell in love with technology (and unprepared Bill Hewlett called):
At the age of 12, when he was looking for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he looked for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after her 20-minute phone call, jobs were given a part-time job at Hewlett-Packard for the summer.
“This had a remarkable impact on me. It was the only company I had seen in my old age and it shaped my views on what a company was and how well it treated its employees.”
Later, jobs became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw “the first desktop computer ever produced.
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen with brown tube and I fell in love with him.
I would climb up at HP as a teenager and hang on this machine and write programs for them.
How to Improve Innovations:
Several times in the interview, Jobs talks about how to spontaneously invent new products.
As early as his career, when he built a few boards, he was asked by a customer to assemble the whole computer.
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had to think through the assembly as well as the delivery of the finished equipment.
Later in Apple, he recalls the problems he had in developing a computer mouse:
“I remember perplexing arguments... They shouted to me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] and I stood up, went out and found a manufacturer “
Ninety days later we had a mouse that we could have built for $15. That was incredibly credible.
About large enterprises that leave behind:
Long before he revived Apple, jobs looked ahead to the ways in which so many industrial giants with their visions in pride and lost control of their shares.
“We say you’re working at IBM or Xerox, so make a better copyper or printer, and “
They own the stock monopoly, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [there are such people] who ultimately run the companies and the product with which people are pushed out of decision making.
The product genius, which has led to this monopoly position, is eradicated by the people who have no concept regarding good products vs. bad products - craftsmanship necessary.
That happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the whole computer industry.
One could have been ten times bigger, it could have been Microsoft's 1990s...
You got the defeat from victory.
About Innovation as an Art Form:
“There’s a lot of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product...when you develop this great idea, it changes and grows...
You'll learn a lot about his refinements.
You have to make votes, certain things you can't, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You have to remember 5,000 things, these concepts, and bring them all together...
Finally, it goes on to taste, it goes beyond trying to separate yourself with the best stuff that humans have created and then trying to bring these things together into what you are doing.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists claw.
We are always shameless in stealing great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people who work there were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who are by chance the best computer scientists in the world.
If it had not been the computer industry, they would have created fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas are dining with opponents of health laws, as court accepts
On the day when the Supreme Court gathers behind closed doors to discuss the politically divided question of whether to hear a challenge to President Obama's health laws, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, took part in a dinner sponsored by the firm that the case will be represented in court.
The incident took place last Thursday when all nine judges met for a hearing to discuss the petitions for examination.
One of the cases to be dealt with was a complaint brought by 26 states against the far-reaching reform of the healthcare system, which was decided by Congress last year, a law that became the key issue for conservative activists everywhere in the United States.
The judges agreed to the hearing. In fact, a 5 1/2 hour basic discussion is expected in March, which is likely to trigger the 2012 presidential campaign, which will be in full swing at the time when the court decision is announced.
The lawyer who stands in court and will claim that the law is to be kicked will probably be Paul Clement, once General Attorney under the government of George W. Bush.
Clement's firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that supported the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, an old-fashioned group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the economic associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, that challenged the law.
Another sponsor was Pharmaziegiant Pfizer Inc., who is financially involved in the outcome of the process.
The dinner took place in a Washington hotel a few hours after the court had consulted the case.
The service included Mitch McConnell, the head of the Republican Group in the Senate and a declared opponent of the health reform
The guests of dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: The two judges have been attending events of the Federalist Society for years.
And that doesn't violate moral rules.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct, which governs the actions of the lower federal judges.
If they were, they would probably fall under principle 4c of the Code, which states: “A judge may take part in beneficial events law after law and other organizations, where the judge may not be a speaker, guest of honour or, according to the programme, a guest of such events,
Nevertheless, the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms related to the case as well as to a company with a massive financial interest in this was sufficient to alert moral and governmental activists.
“This amazing break with morality and the contrary to the Code punishes the actions of some judges lying, the court adheres to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, President of the Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the United States.
‘The judges won and served with lawyers during a benefit event with floating proceedings at the court’
Their appearance and support for a donation action for this event undermine any claim to impartiality and are not acceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little consideration for critics who say they would mix court affairs too easily with groups headed by the agenda, such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
On the other hand, the conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was general state lawyer under the Obama government when the first lawsuits first came before the court.
Their critics urged Kagan to withdraw from the hearing of the case because she was too committed to the defense of the law to be unbiased.
Kagan doesn't make any institutions to do this.
Boeing draws record order of 18 trillion dollars on land
Airlines Emirates orders 50 two-way aircraft of the Boeing 777 type with an option to 20 more aircraft.
In addition, Boeing sells six Boeing Dreamliner to Oman Air, a store worth more than 1 Billion Dollars.
It is really a rare news that a company receives an order over 50 pieces of its products.
But it's a big business if the airline manufacturer's company is Boeing Co. and the total list price for these 50 aircraft is at a record sum of 18 trillion dollars.
The customer of Boeing is equally unusual: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines from the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth 450 trillion dollars in the next 20 years.
Boeing announced his biggest contract for commercial aircraft on weekends, measured by the value of the order: 50 two-way Boeing 777 jets.
The hammer message came from the Emirates airline from Dubai.
The airline also announced, as Boeing announced in 2011 at the Dubai Aviation Show, an option on the purchase of 20 other aircraft that would raise the total list price to 26 trillion dollars.
On Monday, Boeing Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8, the so-called Dreamliner, which greatly improves the fuel consumption and comfort of passengers.
The list price for six of these planes is more than $1 Billion.
“This is absolutely positive for Boeing,” said Neal Dihora, the stock market manager of Morningstar.
\"The quality of these special customers is very high\"
Many Middle East airlines own oil producing countries.
So they not only have the money to pay the aircraft. Rather, an increase in oil prices, which usually harms airlines, as this is one of their biggest cost points, is not so harmful as the country earns at a higher oil price.
This is important because they tend to cancel or postpone aircraft orders less than other airlines when oil prices rise, Dihora said.
“They have a natural security,” he said.
The order of Emirates confirms Boeing's leadership position on the market for large-scale aircraft and helps to keep the Airbus competitor SAS in check, which attacks the predominance with the A350.
Boeing's victory on the aviation show comes four months after Airbus announced that it would postpone the introduction of the largest A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
The introduction was postponed to gain more confidence after the customers demanded a higher burden of use and reach.
The Boeing shares rose by 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexican President's sister seems to lose her choice in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that drug dealers have supported Fausto Vallejo by the PRI in the race for the governor's post.
President Felipe Calderon's sister apparently lost her application for the office of Governor of Muchoacan during the violent state elections. She said on Monday that drug dealers would have influenced the race in favor of one of her opponents.
According to the preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo won the race for the post of governor in the western state from the institutional party of the revolution, the PRI.
“The intervention of organised crime throughout the electoral process and especially yesterday’s day is alarming, not only for Michoacan but for the whole country,” said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview one day after the election on Sunday.
\"You threatened our candidates, our employees in the polls ... you have occupied electoral booths, built road blockades ... and commissioned people to vote [for the PRI] \"
The PRI ruled for seven decades in Mexico until it lost its presidency in 2000.
But they are striving for a return and victory in Michoacan is an important step in these efforts.
The PRI hopes for a victory in the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have just beaten Claderon, who was still in the polls before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate of the conservative Partido Acción Nacional PAN of her brother, refused to acknowledge Vallejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left Democratic Revolution Party PRD, the current governor, came to place three, a heavy defeat for the split and luckless left leadership for the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to recognise the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of Morelia's capital, denies connections to drug dealers and urges the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels that specialize in marijuana, heroin and amphetamine.
It is the home country of President Calderon and he chose Michoacan to launch a military-led offensive against drug dealers in December 2006.
The violence is still taking place.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election for Luisa Maria Calderon during an election, and many candidates came out of the local elections out of fear.
For the PRI, a victory strengthens the party, no matter how reluctant the elections in Michoacan appear.
The man who is likely to be represented by the PRI in the race for the presidential office is Enrique Pena Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said: “I think this victory will give us a courageous look into the next year,
ADB pushes Asia for help in the rescue of the eurozone
The Asia Development Bank (ADB) calls on India and China to support the rescue of the eurozone in its serious debt crisis in order to prevent a long-term downward trend that will slow the growth of Asia's economy.
Rajat Nag, director of the ADB based in Manila, said that the two world’s fastest growing economic nations must do all they can to accelerate the recovery of the currency block either through the International Monetary Fund or through direct mutual agreements.
He warned the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China), who are “leadless” of the difficulties in Europe, and said that financial support from the European leadership and resources of Asia will help prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
“We’re all sitting in the same boat,”
“So anyone who can help Europe out of this crisis,” he told the Financial Times in an interview at the edge of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
‘Asia may be protected to a certain degree, but it is not immune’
\"If, therefore, China and India can help, then with all means,
In recent months, Europe's monetary union has suffered a severe debt crisis.
In recent days Italy's interest costs have increased dangerously and the Prime Minister has resigned both from Italy and from Greece.
The emerging serious debt crisis in Europe raises fears that the global economy could fall into recession and called for the leading emerging economies to join forces to support the euro area.
Mr. Nag predicted that any support from Asia will be channelled by the IMF, but said that mutual agreements - such as the purchase of bonds from the EU Rescue Fund, the European Financial Stabilisation Facility (EFSF) - would offer greater bargaining power to European partners in Asia.
Anand Sharma, Indian Minister of Commerce, said that “India will do everything in its power to help the eurozone, as its own economy is now suffering from declining exports and the drying out of foreign capital flows.
“No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent,” he said.
\"We face major challenges and we need to maintain a high growth level,
“It’s not an option, it’s an assignment, because where else we find work for our millions of young men and women,
Others argue that developing economies like India have no cause to help rich Europeans when they face major economic challenges themselves.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at the U.S. Brown University, said that it would be politically very difficult to sell the 1.2 trillion people in India help for Europe, of which more than 800 million live from $2 or even less a day.
“At some point they will find out that the Greeks are going to retire at 50 and spend holidays at the beach, and then they have a problem,” he said.
Lee Howell, managing director of the World Economic Forum, similarly asked why India's reserves should be used to keep the numerous and well-paid public service employees in Greece, with jobs in poorly managed, lossy facilities such as the railway.
Mr. Nag said that the crises in the Eurozone will have \"significant domino effects\" across Asia.
The ADB forecast with an economic growth of 7.5 percent in Asia for 2011/threats \"the risk of degradation\" due to the threat from Europe.
He said that vulnerable emerging markets would have to create ‘crisis plans’ to protect themselves from a downward trend and a significant capital shift in their words.
Urgent warnings from the Pentagon against possible cuts in defence
Minister of Defense Leon Panetta called on the Congress on Monday when he warned that automatic budget cuts would weaken national security unnoticed, thus triggering a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon halls to the war scene in Afghanistan and the civil fliers.
The Pentagon is already thinking of cuts of 450 trillion dollars over the coming decade, but now fears that further cuts will be needed by 600 trillion dollars or more if Congress cannot reach a conclusion in spending.
“The impact of these cuts would be devastating to the Ministry,” wrote Panetta in a letter to Republican senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that a failure by Congress to reach a budget agreement, which will lead to such a seizure, would result in 23% general cuts and a halt to numerous new projects.
“Such a high reduction, carried out in such an unsuspecting way, would make most of our ship and construction projects impossible - you can’t buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously harm other modernisation efforts,” Panetta wrote to the senators.
\"We would also be forced to separate ourselves involuntarily from a large part of our civilian personnel and, as the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would have to rely on the security of citizens in order to achieve the goal,
\"These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and seriously damage our alertness,
The cuts were finally made to meet the combat forces - said Panetta.
\"While wartime quotas are not directly affected by the seizure during the anti-terror campaign, the serious intervention in the basic budget would adversely affect the war effort, Panetta warned.
“Personal settings have been reduced, which would lead to delays in the settings and attitude monitoring that support the war,
\"The staff's salaries would be reduced, which would lead to late payments to wartime traders and the legal and political support would be disturbed,
The two senators answered Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details regarding the potential impact of automatic cuts on the Ministry of Defense.
\"The consequences of a seizure by the Ministry of Defence would lead to a rapid decline in the United States as the world's leading military force,
“We are vehemently opposed to this draconian action,” the senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published Panetta’s letter.
“This is a result that we cannot live with, and there is certainly no need to push ourselves up.”
‘The seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and its entry should not be allowed,
Whether Panetta's letter and senators' new warnings will increase the pressure on a compromise in the budget or strengthen demands to exclude the Pentagon from cuts remains to be expected.
Panetta has increasingly unblemished the possible cuts, although he has been able to gain many years of experience with the budget in Congress and the White House before coming to the top of the Pentagon, and knows that he is faced with difficult decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Minister of Defense painted a dark picture of what might happen - a military with shell, but without core.
\"It's a ship without sailors,
\"It's a Brigade without ammunition,
“It’s an Air Force squad without properly trained pilots,
“It is a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers capable of fulfilling the mission,” said Panetta in his opening address in the Pentagon.
“It’s a struggle that lacks morals and alertness and is unable to capture it with potential opponents,
“It really makes you angry,” she says.
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta cited new details of how reductions create “significant operational risks: delays in times of crisis, conflicts and disasters, serious restrictions on our global capacity for use and maturity, leading to unacceptable risk in future war operations,
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defence projects could fall victim to the strike, including those already tested and already in the early planning phase.
This list also includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomb aircraft, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Littoral Combat Ship and the new ground combat vehicle, the Army and Marine need to replace the Humvee.
If you stop the further development and testing of the F35, this would save up to 80 trillion dollars in the next 10 years, but the advocates say that it is an important next step to upgrade so that possible dangers can be banned by China and other opponents.
How to Denounce a Lie
A look at the current headlines shows how thoughtful and widespread deception and lies are in daily life.
The presidential candidate of the Republicans, Herman Cain, is busy becoming a master of the accusations of sexual harassment by several women. Both sides are lying to each other.
Penn State's leadership is accused of mine, as it is alleged that reports of sexual abuse by a retired football coach boy have been kept.
Last week an open microphone was heard when French President Nikolas Sarkozy told American President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
The New York Congressman and Internet Exhibitionist Anthony Weidner became a fool when he overturned denials that were quickly refuted by unsurpassed evidence.
The former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of the breach in campaign financing, which is related to the suspicion of an extramarital affair.
And then, of course, no one who has experienced it has caused the media circus, President Bill Clinton, when he lied to Monica Lewinsky during his second term in the Oval Office regarding his sexual relationship with Monica.
Stories about foaming in school and college exams are widespread.
There were incidents in which teachers gave their students the test answers so that they were able to do well in their performance reviews themselves.
Mentors who should teach the contrary send a message that lies and shame are okay.
How much deception do we experience?
As studies prove, we lie between 10 and 200 times every day.
However, many of these lies are considered to be emergency lies.
Another study shows that strangers lie to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
To recognize or \"discover lies\" is one that is important for every person to learn, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from a game of society, such as sharads, in which it is the goal to call you, the disillusionment of deception is a serious field of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities that have carried out extensive research projects, especially in the fields of psychology and physiology.
One result of the research is that most ancient myths have been disproved about lying.
Lies look into your eyes.
They stutter, strain, rot, and tickle not always.
However, it must not be concluded from this that these liars are difficult to detect and detain.
A trained liar can penetrate into the truth by learning something about the structure of the assertion, the fine facial expressions, about questioning and timing.
I have spent several years examining the scientific results of the comprehensive and constantly growing field of deterrence, and it is clear that the disillusionment of deception is a modern ability that is easy to learn and helps us in the right direction in our complex world, especially if the setting up or questioning of persons or negotiations or administration is one of our own professional responsibilities.
Good liars are very good at estimating other people, awakening their interest and mastering their own emotions, and they feel intuitively how they are perceived by others.
Thanks to the research we know that extroverted people lie more often than introverted people, that men are more often \"self-oriented\" lies than women whose lies are more \"orientated\" to others - usually they want to protect the feelings of others - that married people lie to their partners less often than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are mostly \"fat lies\"
We also know that when a person has been kidnapped as an offender, others feel less guilty of having lied to that person.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First, by observing the normal behavior of this person.
This is called \"baselining\" the starting position.
It provides a reference point for later evaluation of changes.
Observe the attitude, laughter, the voice quality of their trial person.
You should know better when someone normally always trips by foot, so that they don't charge him wrongly if he trips by foot during a meeting.
Then pay attention to accumulations of striking verbal and nonverbal behaviors.
Consider these accumulations as alarm bells that shrill, not as evidence of detaring.
People who are deceived may starve when they try to remember their story. Perhaps their feet point towards the door or they lean towards the exit, change their position in a significant way, or show a “voluntage after the interview - this deep, relaxing exhalation and the change in attitude when all the hard questions are over.
Questioners often falsify that an interview is over, just to keep an eye out after this relaxation after the interview.
Also pay attention to the language of your test person.
Scott Peterson's extruder is famous when he used the past form when he claimed that his murdered wife was still alive and triggered a national search for her.
Deceptive people can also use a distant language: “I had no sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky — or when you repeat a difficult question in general.
The most common verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use “qualifying language” when answering a difficult question: “Now... to tell you the truth ... as far as I know ... according to best knowledge and conscience”
This makes the answer more perceptible than relevant, which often causes the alarm bells to shrill.
There is no magic means of disarming lies, but one can learn skills, thanks to which a deterrent is possible.
Thanks to these skills, anyone can become a victim of fraud, both in private and in professional life.
Controversial plan of an oil pipeline is revised after risk caused by delayed US approval
A few days after the Obama government threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada into the Gulf of Mexico, with annoying trade unions and at the same time calming environmentalists, the pipeline building companies are trying to re-plan the project so that one can return to normality.
TransCanada said on Monday evening that the planned pipeline will be redirected from the ecologically sensitive area of the Sandhills in Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Nebraska Parliament building.
Alex Pourbax of TransCanada said that the company is still confident that the pipeline will eventually be approved, even if with a different course.
This was followed by an announcement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs last week, after which a decision on a federal permit for the project would be postponed until the new possible course was reviewed, which would avoid the area of the Sandhills in Nebraska and the Ogallala Aquifer, a large underwater supply.
“This is a real step forward,” said Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, to Fox News.
The new environmental review, which the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has arranged, may delay a decision by 2013, following the elections next year, even if officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
In a written statement last week, Obama declared that the decision was a task of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and promised his support.
The 1700 mile pipeline was connected to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would pump 700,000 barrels of oil a day from Alberta Province to the refineries in Texas.
To do this, the pipeline would have to cross six states.
Environmentalists hate them, but labour markets love them, because they appreciate that the pipeline creates 20,000 jobs.
But the legislators of Nebraska, who oppose the plan, weigh the laws to force a departure from the region of the Sandhills and Ogallala Aquifer, a main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study on the impact on the environment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs found that the project had little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy economy stated that the chief auditor of the Ministry requested a separate probe of the review procedure focusing on two questions.
One is whether a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a consultant to Hillary Clinton in 2008, is in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company commissioned to carry out the original study was an inappropriate choice as it is linked to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle indicted, as she allegedly forced a grandchild out of fear to break up
A New York family claims that the Disco-Diva Patti LaBelle in the lobby of her Manhattan building had suffered a Tobbit attack, which would have put her little daughter in fear of being scared.
The tirade of the \"Lady Marmalade\" singer made the 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so afraid that she suffered from \"personal changes, sleep disorder and increased fear of strangers,\" said her family before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was on November 10 last year when stage worker Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, wanted to break up a kindergarten and Genevieve to a family trip.
While Kevin Monk got the car, Roseanna Monk went to the lobby in her building on the Riverside Boulevard with the luggage and Genevieve on her arm.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and put her daughter down for a moment.
\"Someone appeared to me and said, \"You know what your daughter is doing right now, I said, \"Yes\" and went to take her back on her arm, she said.
LaBelle warned the pregnant woman.
“She said in an aggressive tone, “You shouldn’t put your daughter near the door,” said Roseanna Monk.
“I told her, “I don’t care what you say or think,”
She became angry and began to chimp - she used the F-word and the A-word and became very loud...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and started to pour water from the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve would be hysterical.
“I said to this woman, “See what you’ve done to my daughter,” said the child’s mother.
LaBelle fell on the mother, who still carried Genevieve on her arm, and had to be held back from her company and pulled to a waiting car, said Roseanna Monk.
The baby screamed so much that it had to surrender, she said.
Later, the LaBelle family asked for an apology in writing, but received no answer.
LaBelle's lawyer and representative did not respond to calls asking for an opinion.
The lawsuit is for an unspecified compensation, but the family attorney, Sam Davis, said he didn't charge honor and the family plans the money they get to donate child cancer aid.
“We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her behavior,” Davis said.
“This type of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially when placed on the arm by a child gardener, who is carrying an 18-month-old baby,
Climatic contradictions slowed the economy
In the first year, when Mario López Valdez is in government, unemployment and black labour increased in Sinaloa, while foreign investment declined and the economy stagnated.
In 2011, the economic history of Sinaloas will be remembered. It is the first year when Mario López Valdez, who described himself as the initiator of change and raised great hopes regarding economic growth, is in government. However, as a result of the climatic contradictions, the main economic indicators did not speak of growth, but, on the contrary, the main economic indicators deteriorated.
The low temperatures in February not only caused losses in millions of heights in agriculture, but also placed close limits on the growth of the state economy and caused a general decline in economic activity by 3.6 percent in the first quarter of the year. This mainly accounts for the historical decline in agricultural development by 31.16 percent, which had a negative impact on other economic sectors.
According to a report published by the Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Susterable (i.e. Mexican Council for Sustainable Agricultural Development), 582,000 hectares of agricultural land were damaged, 78.03 percent of which were completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07 percent were partially destroyed.
The decline in economic activity until November has continuously increased unemployment in the Mexican state. Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía observed a rapid increase in unemployment in the first quarter of the year because from January to March, 55 053 residents of Sinaloas had no employment, which corresponds to 4.53 per cent of the working population. In the second quarter, the unemployment rate increased to 5.28 per cent and from July to September to 6.19 per cent, resulting in 74 000 unemployed people in Sinaloa. These are 18 969 more than in the first quarter.
Lower liquidity
The unemployment rate in Sinaloa in the year relies on several factors. Economic scientist Gerardo López Cervantes, dean of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the University of Autónoma (UAS), commented that the policies of public institutions indirectly explain the growing unemployment.
\"What we are currently observing is an increase in unemployment, which has several factors to do with, among other things, liquidity losses in the market due to the cuts in the legislation adopted to combat money laundering in Congress, because for those who accumulate prohibited dollars, it is not easy to let them work for themselves to invest them or use them for anything else,\" he said.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that growing unemployment is also a demographic factor.
\"The number of persons leaving the country looking for work abroad, especially in the United States, has fallen. On the one hand, this is due to the entry problems and on the other hand, because it is difficult to find work there.
Black Paper
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more serious if one takes into account the high proportion of black labour, which, according to INEGI, comprises 60.38 percent of those employed in the country who work without paying in the cashiers of social insurance.
The low wages, the lowest in all of Mexico, come to unemployment and black labour, according to the statistics of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican Social Insurance Institute) and the Secretaría del Trabajo y Previsión Social (Government of Labour and Social Care in Mexico).
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa was 5352 Pesos by September, which is much less than the general government average, which is 7375 Pesos.
Decrease in ADI
In addition to reducing economic activity and increasing unemployment, the biggest decline in foreign direct investment (ADI) in 2011 has been recorded in the last ten years. According to Secretaría de Economist (State Economic Authority), the ADI amounted to $630 597 from January to June, which is a shift of 87.74 percent compared to the $5 143 312 in the same period in the previous year.
The Secretaryía de Desarrollo Económico del Gobierno (Government Agency for Economic Development) has an overall investment of 17 280 000 pesos in 2011, which comes primarily from companies in the tertiary sector.
Debts
In July, in view of the economic crisis, the national government requested a loan of 3 000 000 000 pesos to be invested in reactivation of the economy in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities. The national congress approved an amount of 200 600 000 pesos, but by November no positive impact of the debt on any of the industries in the country could be found.
Reactions
For the representatives of the entrepreneurship, Mario López Valdé's first year of government made it apparent that he was invincible.
Miguel Loredo López, Chairman of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (State Chamber of Processing Industry in Mexico), said that no efforts were made in 2011 to harmonise the views of the different sectors, including the national government.
“The economic activity in Sinaloa was really very expensive this year. It needs to be worked hard to recover the land lost this year and we have to make a double effort in 2012. The efforts of all and, in particular, the progress of the government team already in good agreement have not been sufficiently coordinated,” he explained.
Long-term economic development
Loredo López said that events such as the frost at the beginning of the year made the country's economic development difficult and slowing down.
“The low economic flow is the result of several events, including frost. One of the most important impacts is a slow economy, which is not sufficiently moving to create an economic dynamic that could produce an acceptable flow of processes, products and services. That is why we will conclude the year far below our expectations,” he said.
Redefining vocation
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, Chairman of the Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana (Mexicana Entrepreneurate Association) in Sinaloa, declared that it was necessary to allow the state to engage in more dynamic productive activities.
“In general, we have observed that work has been done. We believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme for re-determination of the country’s economic vocation and line, because it is important to activate all material and human resources Sinaloas,” he said.
There's a lot to do
The Chairman of Coparmex stressed the importance of developing a future perspective that will guide the efforts of the government in better orbits.
“In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas, and economic development has progressed, but it is important to develop a long-term programme,” he explained.
He stressed that the current state power had made progress with the government.
“There are areas in which it can be said that the government has acted more extensively. What I can say is that it was worked and that the government is aware that there is still a lot of work ahead of it,” he said.
Arrest for 8 kg of marijuana
For five years in prison and 100 daily sentences, a population of Navolato was sentenced to eight kilos of marijuana.
The public prosecutor of the Republic announced that the drug retailer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was punished for a crime against public health - here the possession of marijuana intended for trade.
In accordance with the Act AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by Mexican military forces on 7 June 2010 in the surveillance of Cipriano Valdez road compared to security posts No. 80 in the village of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug retailer drove into a white van where he kept a black bag in a box in the car and on the passenger seat a small backpack in which the military found eight kilos and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the seized goods were handed over to the district judge and the punished person is still in the enforcement centre.
Debts for construction work
The social buildings provided for in the Hábitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 programmes run the risk of not being completed due to lack of resources or with great delay, Miguel Ángel López Miranda said.
The Head of the Urban Social Development Authority said that although the construction programs are already advanced, they are now in danger, since the State Government has not paid the funds allocated to them that exceed 11 million Peso for the three programmes.
He said that the total investment in these three programmes was almost 50 million peso, of which 25 percent fell to the state. Until now, only the Federación and the municipality would have contributed to the construction work, which is why a delay in the construction end would have been expected.
“12 million have to contribute, and although the year is already ending, they have not given us a penny, and that, although they had to pay us part of it already in July, he meant. “In order not to be too late, we have already started construction work, and they have already advanced far, but we need the money.”
He pointed out that under the government of Jesús Aguilar Padilla the state had not complied with its obligations, which is why the municipality had to borrow a 7 million loan at the beginning of its period of government, which corresponded to the amount the central government had to raise.
“This was the case with us in the last legislative period, because the State did not have sufficient economic resources. The programmes continued and this year we had to get the funds that the State had not spent to participate in these programmes.
Although the State authorities were obliged to pay out these funds , he commented that the Minister for Administration and Finance , was asked to speed up administrative work and to pay off the outstanding share as soon as possible.
“Fast 12 million have to contribute, and although the year is already ending, they have not given us a penny,
The Court approved the transition to digital television in Mexico for 2015
The conversion of analogues to digital signals has been among the most important changes in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) rejected the constitutional complaints filed by the Senate and the House of Deputies against the Presidential Decree, and by which the conversion of analogues to digital signals from 2021 to 2015 must be put forward, due to the lack of eight votes required for the legislative action.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his responsibilities when he issued the decree of the law with details of the switchover to terrestrial digital television.
This decision rejected the constitutional dispute raised by the Senate because it did not receive the required qualified majority of eight votes so that the court could decide on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality. Thus, the law remains in force.
In the action project prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, it was proposed to declare the decree on constitutional matters, since the radio and television regulations are the responsibility of the Comisión Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel) (Federal Committee on Telecommunications in Mexico), which is why the decree would contradict the hierarchical principles and the provisions of the law.
In favour of the project only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted on their own.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies filed constitutional complaints against the decree. After the lawsuits, the Minister Sánchez Cordero no longer applied the Decree of Law and initiated all activities for the establishment of digital transmission.
The Council of Ministers also rejected the action filed by the Chamber of Representatives without entering into the debate on the project, for which Sánchez Cordero was also responsible.
In his contribution, the Prime Minister said that he would not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the country government must not regulate the measures to be taken by the public administration under general rules.
\"I also do not believe that if one did so, the independence of the regulatory body would be affected, it also reminded us that for the planning of strategic policy areas, such as the telecommunications sector, the central government is responsible for constitutional reasons, because it is the head of state affairs.
The replacement of analog signals by digital is one of the most important changes that has taken place around the world in recent years, and it results in better use of the radioelectric spectrum, increased quality of the signal and more channels.
The removal of the changeover, she said, was a push towards the use of digitalisation, which was a decision in the public interest that not only had technical aspects, but it was a matter of economic, social, political and security aspects,
These matters, they emphasised, \"required the action of the entire system, in accordance with the principle of economic governance by the State, they included a group of characteristics which laid the Constitution in the hands of the central government,
She recalled that many countries around the world had already implemented the digital transformation, even though they had highly specialized facilities.
It could not be concluded that the government was incarcerated in the competences of Congress with the publication of the contested decree, because the legislation passed by the Legislative would comply with it.
Consideration is given to the possibility to count the ballot in Michoacán individually
According to the information provided by PREP, the difference between the first and second place in the election of the Governor is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes of a total of 6074 not yet counted.
The possibility of individual counting of the ballot is a reality this year in the elections in Michoacán, because according to the data issued by the Programa de Resultados Electorales Preliminares (PREP), the difference between the first and second place in the governorial elections is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes of a total of 6074 not counted yet.
In this sense, the President of the Consejo General del Instituto Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, reminded us that just last November 9th, the electoral body had adopted a number of regulations to harmonise local regulations with the reforms of the states in electoral matters.
It should be remembered that Michoacán had not adapted his political constitution or electoral law or his law on electoral justice to the reforms adopted by Congress, so that they did not enter into force during this round of elections. Governor Leonel Godoy Rankel avoided their publication in the State Score within the time limits provided for by the argument, or objections to it.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) decided on the constitutional complaint filed by the local legislature and judged the State Commissioner's vote on constitutional reforms as invalid and illegal, since it did not have the right to decide on it or to file a veto against it,
María de los Ángeles Llanderal, in an interview on the possibility of individual counting of the votes, explained that, thanks to the adoption of the guidelines by the Consejo General del IEM, there was now the possibility that the local electoral authority could count the ballot in part or in full.
For example, under the following conditions, the votes contained in one or more electoral packages may be partially counted The results of the protocols do not match; the minutes of the voting count and calculation do not appear officially or it is not in the possession of the chairman of the electoral committee or there are obvious errors or amendments to the protocols.
In addition, the total count of the full-fledged ballots may be made if there is a difference between the alleged winner and the one in second place, which is equal or less than one percent, provided that at the beginning of the session there is an explicit request by the party or coalition president, who is the second of the candidates mentioned.
The vote count may also be taken in its entirety if, after completion of the proper calculation, it is found that the difference between the alleged winner and the candidate is equal or less than one percent in the second place, provided that there is an explicit request by a representative of the party whose candidate has become second. In this case, the electoral packages exposed to a partial count would be excluded.
It is worth mentioning that the Morelia elections are in the same situation, where according to PREP the difference between first and second place is almost 0.16 per cent, although the 129 votes of 923 total electoral protocols have not yet been counted.
His last will
His ashes will be scattered over the Zapalinamé mountains, confirming the family.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés rose this Sunday evening at Saltillo, his birthplace. On Monday the dead show and a death fair took place.
According to family members, the last will of the captain was that his ashes were scattered across the Zapalinamé Mountains.
After an honor, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital of Coahuila, along with the others who were killed in the accident in an airplane of the Mexican Air Force. The most nearest persons participated in the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At twelve o'clock in the afternoon, the headman's ashes landed on the wedding hall, located at the Boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza, and where the family members and friends came from.
At 5.30 p.m., his remains were examined at Saltillo's Technological Institute. This body show was prompted by his former fellow students from the technical abstudio and his American football team, Felipe Bacio, during his preparation for the Abitur.
“He wanted to return to Saltillo and that his ashes would spread over the Zapalinamé mountain range, which he had always said to his family and friends,” said Sandra Bacio Cortés, pilot’s sister.
From her point of view, the captain had fulfilled all his dreams and she believes that he was in the fullness of his life. “He was a successful man, exceptional as a father and as a son, a loving brother and he always stood up for his family,
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the village of Saltillo very young to enter the school of the Air Force of Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some couldn't believe it because they thought it would make him drowsy even on a truck. Nevertheless, he always tried to realize his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembered him as a good person. \"He had hardly arrived in Saltillo, and already the whole family wanted to welcome him, as on the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo,
The young man remembers that even at the age of seven he went to Zapopán to graduate his family member. Therefore, he knows that his uncle died when he did what he liked best: flying an airplane.
A final farewell
The superintendent of the Mexican Luftwaffe, Felipe Bacio Cortés, was approved with all honour under the direction of Governor Jorge Torres López. Her honor was given to him by the people and the government, the Mexican army of the sixth military area, the Mexican Luftwaffe, the head of the school and pupils of the technology education institute of Saltillo, where he studied in 1985, and in both studies and sports as well.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago, when the helicopter he had flown by, in which he was also sitting by Secretary of State José Francisco Blake Mora and six other persons from the same authority.
At 18.05 a.m., Bacio Cortés, a citizen of Saltillo, arrived to be handed over to members of the Mexican Luftwaffe, led by Major Jaime Martinez, on the front of the barracks. His family members, including his daughter Amanda and his wife, Cristina, his mother, siblings and other family members, students and teachers, were waiting for him.
The abandoned corpse was found on a plot at the Cadereyta NL
A few hours before the find, military personnel presented the media with eleven people who had been arrested in the same locality in connection with organized crime.
Three men were killed by shots in different parts of the body and a mercy shot in an abandoned finca in the village of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The event took place at the kilometre of 1.5 on the road from Cadereyta to Santiago at the height of the municipality of El Castillo.
Several passersby saw the door of the country house surrounded by a beige-brown wall rose in an all-round way.
As they looked into the house, they found the bodies of three persons inside about three meters, which they immediately informed the competent authorities.
One wore a yellow t-shirt and dark pants, without shoes; next to him was another dressed with a white top.
Nearly one meter away, the body of another person was with red t-shirt and blue pants.
All three were on the belly.
According to the information received locally, the three persons must have been murdered elsewhere, since no cartridge housings were found.
At the wall of the country house you can read inscriptions that write an organized criminal band to another, and several shots were found in the wall and door.
11 persons arrested in Cadereyta
The secretaryía de la Defensa Nacional (State Secretariat for National Defense) presented 11 persons, including a minor, who were part of a crime proceedings mainly in the town of Cadereyta, associated with kidnappings, murders, halconeo (human hunting) and secret funerals.
According to the information made public, eight people were first arrested in Los Alveros on November 11th and a prisoner was released.
Three real estates and one cell phone were secured. The arrested confirmed to be members of the criminal group “Los Zetas”.
On November 12th, at 6 p.m., the military found a car with two occupants on their watch rounds in the village of Rancho Viejo in Cadereyta.
In the inspection of the car, the military found a long gun, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Later, on November 13 at 2 p.m., one of her accomplices was arrested in the municipality of La Frauda, who tried to escape at the sight of the military.
They are charged with secret settlements in the places of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
On Wednesday Education of the New Italian Government
The designated Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present to him the new government which is to offer the crisis that led to Italy at the brink of economic collapse.
The designated Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present to him the new government which is to offer the crisis that led to Italy at the brink of economic collapse.
A message from the Presidency Palace announced that the Monti appointed on Sunday would meet on Wednesday with the President of the State, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm the formation of government.
It is expected that he will present a cabinet composed of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new Prime Minister will join his office.
Monti said he would present to the President the results of the talks with the political parties on government education.
\"I would like to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to deal with these difficult times, said the former EU Commissioner to the journalist.
Monti did not expressly confirm government formation, but his comments show that the obstacles have been overcome.
The “frame is now well cut - it added.
Monti has managed to form a government in less than three days, which is much less time than normal. Meanwhile, Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has driven the cost of debt to an unbearable level.
The new government, led by former EU Commissioner Monti, must adopt a hard savings package, which has been called for by the Europoliticians to regain the confidence that has been raised in Italy.
The pressure on the rush, which is on Monti, was reinforced by the swaying market situation, as a result of which the Italian State bonds were taxed for 10 years with 7 percent interest rates, which was in line with the situation in which Greece and Ireland were forced to apply for the European rescue shield.
After a meeting with Monti, Emma Marcelaglia, president of the Italian Industry Association Confiindustry, told the press: “We said we would support this government after all the forces,”
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.
The success prospects of Montis were considerably increased by the support of the PDL party of Silvio Berlusconi, who had to resign on Saturday due to the crisis.
“We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti are intended to bring good results,” said Angelino Alfano, Secretary of the Mid-Right Party.
The support of the PDL, the largest party of Italy, is essential, as so far many of its members have expressed themselves against a majority of technocrats-based government, which Monti just forms.
Support from Parliament
The new Monti government needs strong parliamentary support to implement the probably unpopular austerity measures.
Resistance to its efforts or the delay of reforms could once again lead to a devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks is aware of the fact that a failure of Montis is a disaster, as well as pressure.
Monti began on Monday with his debates with political parties, trade unions and business associations, as well as with youth and women's organisations.
Tuesday evening will be the end of the session.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who, in response to the crisis, set in motion an extremely rapid change of government.
After a short breathing towards the end of the last week, when it was announced that Berlusconi would withdraw, the uncertainty over the success of the new Prime Minister had again reached critical limits on the costs of the Italian state bonds.
Rescuing Italy with a government debt of 1.8 trillion euros would be too much for the current EU rescue screen.
Monti said that his government would have to wait until the next elections, which are expected to be held in 2013, despite the predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms, rather than prefer the elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that this should consist only of technicians, a reference to their concerns in view of the procedure imposed by the pressure of the financial markets.
Political sources point out that mutual distrust and disagreements between parties make the involvement of people from political life complicated.
Spanishs have more play opportunities than the Ticos
Of the 22 players from Spain, ten have over 50 international games on the buckle.
Costa Ricas has only one of the 22 called-in 50 games behind.
A huge difference for Costa Rica, when the 22 players from both countries are compared to each other for the friendly game that takes place today at 15.05 in the San José National Stadium.
While the World and European Champions, the number one on FIFA's monthly ranking, can look back on a considerable number of class A selection games, the three-color team only has the defense player Michael Umana as the only one with over 50 international games.
This number he reached last Friday with the match against Panama (0-2) in Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish players who play in the League de las Estrellas (Starliga) and influential clubs of the Premier League of England each year have the opportunity to participate in numerous home games (Liga and Cup championships) as well as high-ranking Europecups such as the Champions League.
In addition, the experiences with the Spanish Furie come with complicated Eurocup and the World Football Championships.
The Tico footballers, on the other hand, have few international encounters in the context of the Concacaf, which is on the FIFA ranking at the bottom.
We will see how the Spanish team draws their last register: the Torwart Iker Casillas, who reached a balance with the former Torwart Andoni Zubizarreta last Saturday against England (low 0-1 in London) with 126 foreign matches.
Casillas will play against the three-colored team today and Spain will play a new record of 127 foreign games.
Xavi Hernández, player of the Barcelona football club, owns 106.
Casillas and Xavi even received recognition last week from UEFA, along with others of the Iberian team who had achieved the magic number 100: the quoted Zubizarreta with 126 and the middle tower of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
The number hundreds is also approaching Carles Puyol with 97 games.
He follows Xabi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Cesc Fábregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
From the sides of the Ticos and near Michael Umana are the left side door Júnior Díaz with 48 games and the stork Bryan Ruiz with 45.
From there came only five in over 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
Those with the least play.
Less than 30 games occur in the Spanish team Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
From the side of the national team come on less than 30 games Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25, and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest does not even approach the 20s border.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar only records one and Ólman Vargas and Elder Nelson had not had their debut yet.
The historic gatekeeper of Spain is David Villa with 50 hits, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz has shot with nine most gates, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The quintett moved Costa Rica into its tour to celebrate its twenty-year existence
“Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that is realized “
In the exclusive conversation with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam says that the band is prepared to give one of their best concerts on the next Sunday at the national stadium.
For more than 20 years they were expected, but the band assures them that a dream will come true when they play in Costa Rica.
This assured the bassist and co-founder of the group, Jeff Ament, who gave Viva an exclusive interview from Brazil last week.
The band is located in the South American part of their tour to celebrate their 20th anniversary and on Sunday, the 20th, they make their only stop in Central America.
On that day they will perform at the National Stadium at 7.30 p.m. together with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
You read an excerpt from the conversation, whose full copy can be found in the online edition of La Nación.
For your costaric fans, a dream comes true when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Are you aware of what this means for your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that also comes true for us.
That's just the second time we've been playing in South and Central America, and so far it's been great.
I've only been to Costa Rica for a holiday. It's such a beautiful country that we'll probably stay there for a few days.
For us, it is exciting to bring our music there.
I ask you this because the fans of the band are completely out there. They experience the days before the concert most intense.
What do you say to your most enthusiastic fans?
Thank you for standing by our side all these years.
We took almost 21 years before we came to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we're sorry to have taken so long until we came here.
Some people even think that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Isn't that a bit of pressure from your visit?
Some of the greatest shows we've held over the past 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We played on a few giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope those who made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we want to play there.
We love this country, we like to surf and are excited about the jungle. Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you get to know Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are simply unimaginable.
My friends have always been surfing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Together with Mexico, the excellent areas are surfing. In this way, we have learned about people who love surfing.
With a look at the tour you offered giant shows with many songs.
What plans do you have for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played there, we don't set any limits.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from each album and offer our fans a good and versatile repertoire.
You never repeat your repertoire.
Why?
I think that's partly because we have nine records and we can play over 120 songs. Each one likes a different song, so that the decision we're going to play is not easy.
If we record two or three songs that we have not played before, we can better maintain our concentration and surprise them because they remind us of the reasons why these songs have pleased us. Otherwise, they could be forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and I believe, therefore also for the audience.
With this tour you celebrate your twenty years of history.
When you look back, is it hard for you to believe in your success?
Yeah, totally.
First of all, I believe that no one of us has imagined to play once in a great rock band, and that for more than 20 years.
We also continue to put on these blessings and find it great to be able to make music together even now.
We like and are excited about producing music.
We're lucky to be able to go to the places of the world we've always wanted to visit.
Things couldn't stand any better.
What did it mean for you to have actively participated in the birth hour of the grunge?
It has always been an honor to belong to this group of big bands.
We are good friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and quite unusual when a movement comes out of a group of friends.
Every now and then, a band emerges from a city, but it is already unusual for five or ten groups to come out of the same city at the same time.
We are proud of it and are honored to be part of the Seattle group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw soundgarden on their tour. We are still glad to be with them all and we are honored to be part of this risen Seattle sound.
It is also very unusual that a band like yours stayed with the same musicians for so long.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) came to us 13 years ago. That alone is much more time than many bands last.
First of all, I believe that we all appreciate being happy, still alive, and we also take care of each other.
We are all close friends, which is why musical ways have been opened that give each individual the freedom to experiment.
One trusts the other and his music. We couldn't do better.
Your relationship with fame has not always been easy. On the other hand, thanks to your success, you could always do what you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
The way we grew up made it easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure not to be on tour too often, because it is too easy to fall off this game with huge masses of people who love your music.
As long as people are reminded that they have come because of music, this reminds you that you have to pay attention to the music and what it has created without being a famous rock star, which has never been of interest to us anyway.
What memories do you have of your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote very good songs and at first it was great.
We were a band for three years who had never released a record until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
We were disappointed to have used it for so long. We are still good with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who built the band with us. When I listen to a song or see photos, I remember what an incredible person Andy was like and how he made me laugh. It was always a joy to go to work, laugh together and talk about music and football and many other topics.
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The domestic band Las Robertas are responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their works, especially Eddie Vedder, and therefore the band chose to open up?
Yes, the production sent us videos from several groups and this band liked us best. Therefore, we are curious to see what Las Robertas can offer live. That will certainly be exciting.
Why does Yellow Ledbetter always change her text when you play live?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.
He sings him, and I think he sings the first thing that happens to him.
Who influenced you as a bassist?
Of so many+
Among the first to attack me are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists who liked me.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grunt alive, even though it is no longer a fashion appearance?
I think we all don't feel very connected with the word grunge.
When I think about it, the bands I mentioned before, for example, Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others who came up at the same time. If they are still important today, I find this great because it is worth listening to this music and bands like Mudhoney now make better music than ever before.
At first her music was darker, now she is more positive.
Why?
That's interesting, because I think there are a few songs on the new album that might seem a bit easy to make. But there are also other songs like The End or Just Breathe, which are classified as very dark songs, although they also have something positive in themselves.
Both of them came to me the tears when I heard Ed playing them. They're very dark songs.
I believe that when you get older and something traumatic happened in your life - for example, when you lose a family member or a friend - your artistic creation and your music and these two songs clearly embody this for me.
But I also believe that one can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori returned to the hospital for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was transferred to a public hospital on Tuesday to investigate the muscle loss of his legs, informed his household doctor.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who is sentenced to 25 years imprisonment for violations of human rights during his reign (1990-2000), has several diseases, including lung cancer, which is operated and controlled four times.
Alejandro Aguinaga, a congress member and his personal doctor, told the television that Fujimori would investigate Neoplásicas at the Peruvian Hospital Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades for three days in order to establish the reason for his pain and muscle loss in the lower parts of the body.
Aguinaga commented that in Fujimori's view, he could be pardoned for humanitarian reasons. Nevertheless, he did not wish this because he thought he was innocent.
It has been operated four times on tongue cancer and has lost 18 kilos of weight. Other diseases such as severe erosive gastritis, a cyst in the abdominal salivary gland, kidney stones, high blood pressure and bleeding problems in the legs, have been reported by the doctor.
Fujimori has been a member of the Dirección Nacional de Operaciones Especiales de la policía Detention Centre since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 persons by the Peruvian army’s death squadron, who was secretly active during his reign.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations
An official settlement, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica and consisting of several ministers and entrepreneurs, will start their visit to Mexico on Tuesday to discuss trade between the two countries and political issues of the region
The next Wednesday, Mujica will meet with his Mexican colleague Felipe Calderón. This will be according to the Uruguayan president of the climax of his booked schedule with politicians, businessmen and a meeting with the collective of Uruguayns living in Mexico.
The meeting of both presidents in the city of Guadalajara, which is suitable for the exchange of information on all policy areas between the two countries, announced the Presidential Office of the South American country on its website.
According to local media, Mujica seeks support for Calderón's concerning the incident with France when French government chief Nicolas Sarkozy at the G20 summit in the French city of Cannes put the South American country on a list of tax havens.
In his discourse, Sarkozy threatened to exclude those countries which still act as tax havens from the international community, which was rejected by Uruguay and called on his ambassador in the European country.
Since November Mexico has chaired the G20, a group consisting of the most powerful emerging and industrialised countries in the world. Since January this year, an agreement has been in place on the exchange of tax information to avoid double settlement with the South American country.
In recent years, the Government of Uruguay has tried to speed up the concretion of agreements to exchange tax information in order to be removed from the \"grey list\" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) which has not introduced all international standards for cooperation in tax matters.
A free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay has been in place at a business level since 2004, which has contributed to a growing exchange of goods between the two countries.
The snorkeling installer enters the third dimension with \"Super Mario 3D Land\"
Super Mario has fought tirelessly for 25 years for the rescue of Princess Peach from the claws of the evil Bowser, but never until now in three dimensions: in \"Super Mario 3D Land\" he fights for the love of the girl in stereo technology.
The game that comes to the store counters of all the world this month was cut from the beginning to the properties of the portable Konsole Nintendo 3DS, with which can be played three-dimensional without any special glasses.
“Mario is the figure that has to say how stereoscopy works without glasses - assured Omar Álvarez, the person responsible for the press specializing in Nintendo in Spain in the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez explained that \"Super Mario 3D Land\" was the first video game by Nintendo, which was developed for this console from the very beginning, because so far, success articles such as \"Star Fox 64 3D\" or \"Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D\" were already existing titles.
The spokesperson of Nintendo stressed that although it is three-dimensional, Super Mario 3D Land is an affordable video game that allows a fast, smooth game.
Álvarez confirmed that \"Super Mario 3D Land\" included two games in one: The first part is \"easy\" to capture the less skilled users.
After that, experts can turn on the different game legs that become more and more difficult, a “second round”
In addition, users can choose in real time between an \"aggressive D\" or one that only affects the depth of the action. However, to overcome the obstacles, without becoming victims of the \"optical effects\", they must always be played three-dimensional.
This tour of Super Marios into the three-dimensional world also means the return of the figure to a portable console, which has not been the case since 2005.
With this video game Nintendo twinkles the fans of the Saga and repeats the success recipe of the last edition: The snorkely installer must overcome the danger of spiked platforms in order to free Princess Peach.
However, the player encounters news in the movements, the environment, the disguises and the enemies - and a \"playable\" Luigi.
Colom castles for delivery Portillos to the United States
The President of Guatemala, Álvaro Colom, announced this Tuesday that he would take over the extradition of former Governor Alfonso Portillo, so that in the United States he would be responsible for the conspiracy for money laundering of $70 million.
So the trial of the US application for extradition of Portillo ends so that it can be brought before the court.
In a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was based on the independence of judicial force and government, taking into account that a decisive court had already ordered the delivery.
He stressed that he had not intervened in court decisions during his government and had accepted all requests for extradition that he had been informed of.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín is delivered for murder and serious bodily injury, Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
The operation of Coloms is an act of government that takes place when all judicial and constitutional bodies have been exonerated to condemn the former President of the State (2000-2004).
According to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court of Guatemala, Portillo must be delivered if its legal situation in Guatemale is clarified and its human rights guaranteed.
Portillo was released for the defeat of 120 million Quetzales in the Ministry of Defence during his term of government. This trial preceded the extradition, but the minister objected and revived the case to the new.
Trinijove helped 6000 young people threatened by social exclusion
The organization has been set up to prevent the marginalisation of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of life of the Social Aid Organization Trinijove have led to important results: in this quarter of the century, 6,000 young people, threatened by social exclusion, were supported to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, over a hundred jobs created for this social group.
On the occasion of the anniversary yesterday at an event held in the former factory buildings of Fabra i Coats, where more than 300 people participated.
Trinijove was launched in 1986 in the Trinitat Vella district with the aim of helping young people with low education, without work, with drug problems threatened by the risk of marginality.
At yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu, many of the representatives of institutions and institutions who worked together with the association in those 25 years took part.
The participation of political representatives of different directions on electoral times demonstrated the impartiality of the work carried out by Trinijove.
Apart from the President of the Generalitat (Parliament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol participated in the celebrations of former socialist education minister Ernest Maragall and the former mayor and current left-wing city council Ricard Goma.
Fabra i Coats' large hall also attended the current Catalonian Minister for Social Affairs and Family, Joseph Lluís Cleries, and the Director-General of the Social Affairs of the Sparkasse La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas stressed that Trinijove was created in very difficult times and that today's times are no less complicated. But he added that the work done so far is a good foundation,
For the President of the Generalitat, Trinijove is an example that knows how to fight difficult circumstances and gives people hope in difficulty.
“The economic crisis is nothing new for the association and the work it does,” he explained.
Occupied house, in which giant parties were organized, was cleared
The house owners occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building on the street Balmes No. 51 (Barcelona).
The twelve houseowners left the building yesterday afternoon without resistance.
Everything points out that the nightmares of the neighbors of the house No. 51 on the street Balmes have found an end.
At noon yesterday, twelve people voluntarily left the building, which they had illegally occupied and in which they had organized huge festivals, which had driven the neighborhood to despair. The premises were made on judicial orders without police intervention.
After the rooming, the door lock was replaced to avoid a similar situation.
“From now on access will be checked, confirmed by the house manager.
The house owners, who had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the others were inhabited - took the entire electrical plant and part of the water supply. In addition, they had painted the walls and left behind all types of garbage, especially doses of alcoholic beverages.
On the three lower floors huge parties were celebrated, which lasted up to two days and drove the tenants to despair.
In addition to the building there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which also bore damage to it.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europe Press that her business had dropped by 80% since the start of the house occupation.
The owner of the discotheque pointed out that the houseowners made their unfair competition, because they sold the drinks at three euros, while in the discotheque they cost 10 euros.
In addition, the owner of the leisure room had been shown by the neighbors due to rest disturbance, while according to their statement the noise was not caused by the visitors of the disco, but by the householders, and in particular by the guests of the festivals organized there, and the more and more, according to the statements of the angry neighbors in the last few weeks.
The discotheque officer said that the harassment had been so great that she agreed with the owner of the building not to have to pay rent for the last nine months.
The Guardia Urbana (urban police) also confirmed that in recent weeks they have received more complaints from neighbors.
The president of the PP (Partido Popular - People's Party) at the Barcelona City Council, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had called for the building to be cleaned up immediately last week and the problems of civil coexistence as well as the setting-up of the district.
He explained that before summer, only one floor of the building had been occupied, but that in the last few months the house owners had been on all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments were on display. In some it had even come to thefts.
In this sense, he added that “it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to take action against the asocial actions in the building”
Yesterday another building in the Nou Barris district was cleared by the Catalonian police.
At 15.30 a.m., the police approached the Montral No. 35 street after receiving a call from a neighbor who had watched four people enter the building.
The four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
The architects, apart from the disputes over the honors, agree to the invitation to tender.
The urban call for the 16 goals opens up the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the now disappearing Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published its reproach on the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona City.
He was even compared in numbers with the Central Park of New York.
With the decline of the CMB in 1987, the park became, in the eyes of many, the upper border of Barcelona, because the capital of Catalonia is one of the few that spread not in the north-south direction, but up (mountain) and down (sea).
The classification Collserolas as a nature park plays with this idea.
As an example, the central park no longer served as a model, but Yellowstone with wild boars in the role of the Yogi bear.
As far as the city was concerned, in September the city issued a huge invitation, consisting of 16 competitions, for further access stores to Collserola.
No doubt a gate refers to the concept of a park.
Either that's the case, or someone's in charge of setting doors on the land.
The question arises by itself: Collserola, Park or Berg?
The call is not only from an organizational point of view, but also with regard to a reflection on the city the topic of conversation in the mouth of all the architects from Barcelona.
It is almost a recurring theme that two members of these old caste sitting in the elevator can access.
And exactly this fact offers the fabric for one of the rare similarities between what three architects from Barcelona think about, and some university professors who applied to the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The invitation to tender is appropriate.
It is necessary for Roldán to speak about the “front of the mountain” after the attack on the coast, to the extent that the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, which has not been carried out on the green apples, has not been carried out.
“One should assume the principle that Barcelona’s largest park is the beach.
Among other things, because he is well accessible.
Collserola is more complex, judges the architect, for whom the title of the \"Tore of Collserola\" is a \"lexical case\": it is not allowed to be presented as access to a park, but as a restriction of areas on which to deal,
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with city-building experience, considers the proposal to be an \"intellectual challenge - the \"some dangers\".
Risks resulting from the ‘uncertainty that is bringing about the creation of a public space today’, based on the experience of the 1980s, which had its ‘swanning singing’ in the area of the forum.
The first concern is the restriction of one's own to what may be built.
“To limit something always means to set the next step, i.e. to exceed it.
“You have to think about new urban planning tools, because the current [relating to the General Metropolitano (PGM) plan] can lead to a real disaster.”
Modol, who is closer to the question, means that Collserola's side, which goes towards Vallesana, can be understood as a park that is not towards Barcelona, for purely topographical reasons.
Modol recalls that there is already a study by Patronat de Collserola, which should not “opposite deaf ears”, although he is grateful to the city administration for giving his board the opportunity to contribute to this project from the very first moment.
He also notes that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the letter of guidance that allows architects to take part in the debate, although he says his “differences” should suggest that this technical profile should lead the multidisciplinary teams, “just the right one,” “We architects should be just one tool.”
Bayona points out that the answer to the question in the title of this article is complex, since in the terms of the tender, Collserola fails to see the global view of Collserola: “16 competitions have been written out in the cross-section, he says, “on the axis of the mountain sea. But there is no longitudinal perspective considering the area in its entirety,”
This has led at least in his case to take part in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the program and definition of a project for a gate would collide with that of the architect of the gate.
In his opinion, the city should absolutely guarantee that the strip is so equipped directly above the Ronda de Dalt in its entire length that there is a soft transition between the city and the green areas.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal, who comes free
After 72 days of silence, Casino Red's Plenipotentiary freed the mayor of Monterrey's brother from the trial that is being waged against him for suspected extortion.
After 72 days of imprisonment, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal is released after the representative of Casino Red has given him the trial against the mayor of Monterrey for extortion before the Second Criminal Court of the District.
After the assassination of the Casino Royale, Sergio Gil García, the owner of Casino Red, published a series of photos and videos on which Manuel Jonás is forced to pay him a sum of money so that the city administration approves the secret operation of the Wetthaus.
After the criminal act, the prosecutor opened a criminal proceedings against the brother of the panist mayor, who was arrested for 30 days on 2 September.
After four hours with the official of the ministerio Público 3 en Delitos Patrimoniales, he was taken to Casa de Arraigo 1 in the Barrio Antiguo of the capital.
He remained there 49 days after a second arrest warrant, after the Ministerio Público's officials had rejected the offences for bribery and organized crime.
On October 19th, he was transferred to the Cadereyta Detention Centre because he had supposedly bombarded Casino Red's owners with one and a half million pesos, but he stayed only a few hours in the middle security tract, since murder threats were against him.
The authorities allowed him to take part in the trial as a member of the San Nicolás de los Garza City Prison.
On 25 October, he was sent by the Secretary of the Second Criminal Court of the District, Jorge Yánez, a detention order, which stated that after nearly two months of investigation, there was sufficient evidence to speak to Jonás guilty of paying 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the Wetthaus in order to be able to open it in return.
This Monday, the representative of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez asked Judge José Luis Pecina to issue the penalty to the mayor's brother, which is why he will be set free in the next hours.
During the hearing, Ramiro Arias, the civil servant of Ministerio Público, García Gómez, asked whether he had resolved the damage and who the owner of the Wetthaus had expressed his forgiveness. However, the lawyer held the name back.
According to Case 197/2011, Jonás Larrazábal is free to speak. Neither can any objections to the trial be made, nor will any compensation be demanded.
Larrazabal Bretón was put on a free footing immediately after the hearing of the representative of the Wetthaus at 15.50 p.m.
The Secretary of Justice, Jorge Yánez, went to the San Nicolás de los Garza City Prison to inform Jonás that he had been excommunicated and his case put to the files.
He also informed him of the judicial order for immediate release.
The secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome announced details of the aircraft accident, where the Secretary of State Francisco Blake and seven others were killed.
The Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes - SCT (Secretariat für Kommunikation und Transport in Mexico) informed that the investigation results of the accident in which the Secretary of State Francisco Blake Mora and other seven people were killed indicate that the helicopter had been directly crushed against the ground with its entire uninjured structure without the pilot's being able to initiate an emergency landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary for Communications and Transport, mentioned that before the start, the pilot had confirmed that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
“The fact that the propeller wing had contact with trees at 25 metres altitude, with the helicopter losing the hull, seems to indicate that the helicopter had several ground contacts,
He also explained that the helicopter was built for 19 occupants, so he fulfilled all the requirements for the transport of the staff.
In addition, he said that no helicopter parts were found during the investigations in the area on which the machine had come down.
“In the search no aircraft parts were found at other locations, the whole structure concerned.
The helicopter was built for 19 occupants, so it fulfilled all the requirements for passenger transport.
The area has a slope of 7 to 30 degrees.
At present, it is priority to get the results as soon as possible, but it could take several months, perhaps even a year.
On the other hand, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (Secretariat for aircraft and auxiliary services in Mexico), assured that the helicopter had flown from the Estado Mayor Presidential at the time of impacting with flight speed and that the aircraft had fallen to a soft slope.
‘This information reinforces the assumption that at the time of impact it was a normal flight operation,
At a press conference, the Head of SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant points to consider during the investigation:
Visible flight:
In line with flight standards, it was a flight according to the rules of sight flight. This means that the team must have had sufficient visibility during flight and ground.
Weather conditions:
The AICM recorded suitable weather conditions at the start. During the further flight towards the border area between Mexico City and Mexico State, some deep hanging clouds rose.
Selected flight routes:
It is possible that the team had chosen a lower area with a better view towards the Cuernavaca valley because of the clouds.
Attack point:
The impact coordinates and the last radar recording of the helicopter agree. Perhaps there has not been a loss of control over the aircraft before the impact or a deviation from the flight route.
Dispersion of the aircraft's remains in a limited area:
The information available to date indicates that the helicopter was impacted from straight and lateral direction.
The pattern of scattered aircraft residues suggests that the helicopter was impacted on the ground with its unspoiled structure.
No evidence of fire or explosion:
The aircraft remains at the accident site do not close on fire or on explosion.
The last results of the investigation indicate several ground contacts.
On site studies, aircraft parts were found at an altitude of 9200 feet above sea level. The terrain is repulsive and has a slope of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter probably went to break.
Some information suggests that the helicopter may have had several ground contacts.
After a minute search in an area beyond the restricted area at the location of the accident, no scattered aircraft parts could be found, which reinforced the assumption that the uninjured aircraft structure had been sprayed against the ground.
MSS announces a research protocol for finding the gene for obesity
She is head of a research project on the discovery of the gene for obesity in children and adolescents supported by IPN specialists.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Mexico Social Insurance Institute) announced that it is conducting a research project to discover the gene for obesity in children and adolescents under the title \"Genetics of obesity in childhood and youth\", with which the genetic markers are to be found in conjunction with overweight.
Miguel Cruz López, Head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (Department of Medical Research, Focus on Biochemistry) at the Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI explained that an interdisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was built.
This team is supported by specialists and students of postgraduate studies at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and at the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The population is invited to participate in the study. Interested persons can come to the IMSS sports courts in the Valley of Mexico, where tests with children and young people are carried out every Saturday from 8 p.m.
He emphasised that the investigation began at the sports field of Cuauhtémoc (in the west of the state of México) and continued on October 8 at the sports field of Nezahualcóyolt (in the east of the state of México).
If the target of 500 to 600 surveyors is reached, the study will be continued at the sports centre of Independence (south of the capital district) and completed on the one of Morelos (North of the capital district).
He explained that the aim of the study was to identify the factors and the role of genetics in the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors of Mexican children and adolescents for the prevention of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the global day of diabetes, he stated that it would be aimed at filling three thousand children and adolescents aged six to 14 with the consent and supervision of their parents with nutritional questionnaires.
You will also be asked questions about their physical activity and their family history of disease to control risk factors that could lead to diabetes or renal failure.
It also showed that on these Saturdays the subjects were measured (weight, size, waist circumference), their blood pressure was controlled, and blood levels such as glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (inquiry of identification of genes related to infant obesity).
Cruz López stressed that this study would be carried out on the occasion of the health staff's concern about the alarming weight gain of young people.
“The health surveys from 1999 and 2006 found that in almost six years the proportion of fat boys increased by 77 percent and the girls with obesity by 47 percent. Overweight has also increased dramatically, the specialist of IMSS emphasised.
He stated that the search for genetic markers was justified because the genetic history of the population of Mexico differed from other peoples.
He stated that an (e) Mexican (in) an average of 65 percent of Indian-American, 30 percent of European and 5% of African descent, reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and obesity.
In general, he explained that the genetics of obesity were incapacitated in the inability to burn the excess of the energy (calories) taken to us, so that it was stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit to the examiners was in a comprehensive examination of the children, which would determine whether they had a degree of obesity or obesity.
It would even examine the occurrence of dark skin folds in the neck and the inner arm (acanthosis) that indicate the likelihood of metabolic disorders and pre-stage diabetes.
All information would be treated confidentially and told to the parents in writing by the doctors. The doctors explain to the parents all measurement results and propose changes in the lifestyle appropriate to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there were three fundamental factors that are responsible for obesity, obesity and other chronic diseases: lack of movement, that is, lack of movement in everyday life, spending most of the day in front of the TV and using means of transportation, rather than walking short distances.
The high calorie intake, that is, an increased consumption of sugared beverages and carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.), together with a high intake of fat and protein as well as the genetics to be analysed in this research project.
Asphalt from UNAM prevents blowholes
Rafael Herrera, researchers at the Faculty of Chemistry at UNAM Mexican University developed modified asphalts with polymers to make the mixture more resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
Considering the signs coming from the street floor, it would not be necessary to repair almost 200 000 hitholes if the rainy season in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (City Area of the Valley of Mexico) broke out, Rafael Herrera Najera, researchers at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at UNAM University, warned and assured that if the laying and maintenance of the asphalt cover were adequately damaged, the number of hitholes would be reduced or even completely avoided.
In his presentation, “Schlaglöcher from a technical point of view,” which he held on the occasion of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible developed modified asphalts with polymers in order to produce a mixture similar to asphalt, but which showed greater mechanical resistance both at high and at low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera said that this type of modified asphalt should be used in areas with extremely hot climates, such as in some cities in the north of the country, to improve the behaviour of the street floor and thus avoid the occurrence of impact holes.
He explained that the asphalt - the heaviest part of the oil - is a hydrocarbon compound, of which a part has a high molecular weight - the so-called asphalts - and the other part a low one - the so-called malthenes. Together, they give the street covering its characteristic tehelastic behaviour.
Tähelastic behaviour of the asphalt means that it behaves like a liquid at high temperatures of almost 180°C, at 120°C it is very tough and almost solid at 50°C, while it breaks at very low temperatures.
“This means that the resistance of the asphalt on the roads is not uniform, but changes one day depending on weather conditions and temperature fluctuations,” the chemical engineer performed.
The researcher of the FQ noted that the streets of Mexico City had mostly a flexible street floor, composed of six layers of material, of which the last three included asphalt.
Between the top layers lay a layer of asphalt, which consisted of small, asphalt-baked stones and then solidified stones.
Each single stone of this layer of wear has been bathed in asphalt.
When the vehicles are moved and forces are generated on it, this layer allows for a good distribution of forces in the street floor.
“If it were modified asphalt, the forces would be even better distributed,” said the chemical engineer.
\"On the layer of wear, he carried out, \"a last layer is being designed, the so-called carrying layer, consisting of tiny stones, i.e. sand, which was also bathed in asphalt.
Since this layer is in contact with the vehicle tyres, they need a greater mechanical force than the wear layer and they need to produce friction.
The most forces received and distributed by this street floor also requires an adequate thickness and the material from which it consists must be maintained.
The weather conditions, especially humidity and temperature fluctuations, are other important factors to consider, especially the water - he said - since it significantly affects the behaviour of the wear layer.
When the terrain is moistened, water enters the layer and is only difficult to recover. This causes a wave of all layers of the street floor and as a result the occurrence of blowholes.
When a impact hole arises, he said, \"the cover layer will first be worn off, while the wear layer will not be affected until after that. But the damage does not arise immediately, but it is a process that must be maintained at the first signs by appropriate maintenance programs,
The member of the Sisthema Nacional de Investigadores (National Research System Mexico) stated that the vehicle load was another important cause of the occurrence of impact holes. Therefore, the thickness of each layer of the road load must always be relative to the vehicle load and it must be ensured that this regulation is complied with to avoid frequent impact holes.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that there was still a lot of research to be done, for example, on asphalt emulsions, which were already on the market in other countries, and with which the blowholes could be repaired easily and without applying high temperatures.
What was missing from the candidate del Valle to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that had an effect on the fact that Melina Ramírez Serna did not receive the crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle gets his 14th maltitle.
Once again Valle del Cauca went empty in awarding the crown to Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied with standing on the winning podium, showing a silver crown and the band she shows as new Miss Colombia.
With the result received this night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico took the crown and cedar, the department already comes to 14 maltitles and Melina is joined to the legion of women from Valle del Cauca, who had almost held the crown in their hands. The proclaimed misses include Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Marica Ever (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The big question that many ask themselves today is, What was missing?
Because the result corresponds to the decline of a great favourite who had shown at every performance that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia. She was not in any way elected Queen of Police and Mejor Rostro Jolie of Vogue, who had also received the beauties of Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, and who took home the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that is considered crucial to the jury's decision to appoint them to the First Miss is that she had not convinced the answer to the question \"What book has most affected you and why\" which she had been asked by Martín Murillo Gómez by Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca answered the questioner:
“I read a lot, I think pretty much about the literature, I think it’s a way to civilize, ultimately I believe that the book, which was most influential for my childhood, ‘The Little Prince’, is a very profound book.
I am currently reading 'Schuld und Sühne'. It is a book of universal culture that we should all read. I am just reading a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called 'Leidenschaften'.
An answer that came to little counter-love, first because of the concept of 'civilizing' and second because it had not specifically explained in what way each of her book had influenced them.
But after the ceremony ended, Melina said that she felt calm and happy with the result: “The universe is wise, it happens what must happen.
And for all people, read a little 'The little prince'. It's a great book.
Among other things, it is said that El Valle's lover has been burned out.
A journalist from Bogota pointed out that the fact that she was the preferred one, who had all the coincidences and who had received all the prizes in advance (Gastronomic Competition Oster, audience agreement about the best hand-cut costume and Reina Madre), “the other candidates had made jealous, which stressed the queen who could not shine on stage,
And this was noticed in their first performance in the swimsuit on the beach of the Hilton hotel and in their two elevators at the coronation celebration.
Although she was safe with both of them, she lacked the strength and the momentum shown by the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the program Como en casa, at the RCN channel, said that the fact that Melina was crowned a miss shows that the candidate who wins the most prizes during the competition does not eventually become queen,
In addition, Valle got out of the way at the end of the press - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle was unable to convince the jury about her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the national beauty competition.
It will have its reason that two days before the international jury Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social affairs of her country.
“Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia. One must look beyond the physical and focus on social feeling, on having worked with it before participating in the competition in projects,” she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle had sinned with her defects of derracies and fibrosis, which were noted to her in the stomach area. But this is contradictory, because the jury chose her as a candidate for 'natural beauty' with a healthy body, good eating habits and responsible physical work.
The coach of the Queens, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina did not have the best body, that it was better to “but her problem with the fibrosis at the belly, which was not to be noted for me honestly, pushed her score on the last day,”
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of Cromos magazine believes that the mistake of Valle del Cauca's wife was the surgery she had undergone.
“The operations are ok, but Valle didn’t know how to make them work.
Her body has never been her strong side, and this place had to pay her,
Because of this prize, which will be awarded for the first time by the National Beauty Competition, a cruel prediction was created after the appearance in the bath suit, which was supposed to be true at night. It was showered that Raymundo Melina had given a comfort prize so that she could not have come into the crown's enjoyment.
Whether that is true or not, the fact is that from today Melina is entering her reign year, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent at the appointment of the National Beauty Competition Colombia in one of the international competitions.
However, as one of the queens, who had escaped the crown in spite of her overwhelming appearance for Cartagena, she will enter history.
So was the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A Lophoscopist from Cali entered the story when the man, who identified “Alfonso Cano,” entered the story.
The work of these officials plays a key role.
On the last November 4th, a lophoscopist of the CTI (CTI) investigation unit from Cali came in as the man who confirmed the identity of FARC's leader (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - Revolutionary Forces of Colombia): \"Alfonso Cano - by comparing fingerprints.
Of the seven lophoscopists in the CTI department, this week Eliazar González had willing service, a man from Puerto Tejada who has worked in criminal investigation for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in communities of Chocó, where he often had to go to the jungle for five days to reach the place where the bodies he was to identify were located.
In 2000 he settled after Valle over and after completing the required courses he specialized in lophoscopy, which is the examination of the skin that is exposed to friction, i.e. the hand and foot surfaces.
During the week of action against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was advised to pack clothes for at least three days.
Something big was waiting for him.
Friday night he flew from Palmira to Cauca in the helicopter.
He knew that he should identify two bodies, and that the suspicion was that one of the man who had led the oldest guerrilla in the world could be. Therefore, he should take with him the ten-finger print sheet of Guillermo León Sáenz (his actual name).
However, when he reached with the examiner the place on which the body was located, he could not identify it due to its physical appearance, because this did not resemble the images he had seen in the mass media.
He had no beard, was dressed like a farmer in the area, wore no glasses and was very much thinner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Armed with a lupe, ink, a plant cell and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the body to those on the print sheet.
He had really seen it: it was \"Alfonso Cano\"
The same night, this man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for telling the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that it was actually the head of the FARC.
By Search
For a dactyloscop of the Sijín in Cali, the appreciation that was given to President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González at a press conference on the use of \"cano\" was very important.
Many people don't know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an accurate science without error rate, which can be a key factor in resolving a crime.
Lophoscopists not only identify bodies, they also support investigations into murder and robbery and confirm the identity of the arrested persons.
In their arrest, many offenders present false identification papers or they have none.
We'll take them off the fingerprints and look for them in the database.
The researcher told us that he had to pull a piece of wall out of a house at a theft, because the thief had been uplifted with his hand at this point when he pulled out a safe full of jewelry and money.
“Walks are difficult because their surfaces are inappropriate for the removal of fingerprints. But in this case we could take the impression of the whole hand and identify the criminal who had participated in several thefts,” he recalled.
With the help of fingerprints, murder suspects can also be relieved or burdened.
A dead man was recently found surrounded by snuff bottles.
In the investigation, it was suspected that a family member could be suspicious, and in fact, a fingerprint agreed on the bottle.
Although this does not guarantee that it is the murderer, it is associated with the place where the offence was committed.
A CTI dactyloscope explained that “the fingerprints would be taken from the object with chemical or physical reagents,
When they appear, a plant cell or a band is used to take them.
After that, the prints are sent to the Asif, that is the criminal database, or to the person's office.
“The problem is that there are still many Colombians without ID papers,” said the CTI expert.
He said not everything was the same as it would be in the TV series SCI.
Just as not everything is gold that shines, not everything you touch is a fingerprint.
But it can still be used if you make a similar comparison.
The “emergencies” challenge the authorities in New York City
Hundreds of demonstrators pushed together in tents on the Zuccotti Square.
A large part of the area was followed by the space order and moved its location to a nearby park.
On this Tuesday, the members of the Ocupy Wall Street movement called out to New York authorities, when they again tried to enter the Manhattan Square with a judicial order after they had been cleared from the square in the morning gray and had tried to occupy another place on Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators pushed in front of the Zuccotti Square, on which they wanted to get access with a judicial order that allowed the “empores” to re-emerging tents at this site. Meanwhile, another part of the movement stopped at the space order and occupied a park further north of the city, where there were nine arrests.
“Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp on the square, we will find ourselves in another place and continue the battle with legal means to return to Zuccotti, with sit-in and peaceful demonstrations,” said Mark Bray, one of the spokesperson of the movement “Ocupy Wall Street”
Bray argued that the response of the “emergencyes” to the clearance of her tent camp, which had been directly ordered by Michael Bloomberg, mayor of New York, came to trial, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the violent space of the square and approved the tent by the demonstrators.
In addition, the empoors occupied a new park, which is located at the intersection of Central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and is owned by Trinity Church.
They could occupy the site for at least an hour, but after that the police met and arrested some of the demonstrators, although Bray cannot give exact numbers. He assured the news agency Efe that he had also seen several journalists with handcuffs among them.
The organization assures us that hundreds of people had found themselves in this place, at which also an arrangement of religious leaders had come in as a sign of their support for the members of the movement and to mediate with the police.
Meanwhile, the Zuccotti Square (an area in private property) remains closed in expectation of a judicial hearing, which is still in place for this Tuesday, and in order to analyse the legality of the space found in the morning gray.
Some of the demonstrators from the square carried photocopies of this judicial arrangement with them and distributed them. They even gave them some police officers who guarded the place, which resulted in “some small clashes,” as Bray reported, who showed some policemen had beaten demonstrators.
The judicial order prohibits the authorities from removing members of Occupy Wall Street from the place and the application of “laws adopted after the occupation and from prohibiting demonstrators from returning to the park with their tents and other items that they had previously used,
Mayor Bloomberg, in front of the press, makes it clear that the new opening of the square for public transport and the demonstrators was due to this judicial order. The demonstrators pointed out that the city laws did not allow them to re-establish themselves with tents and sleeping bags in this place.
The mayor personally defended the room of the Zuccotti Square, which was carried out in the morning grey, where nearly 200 people were arrested, and which was decided because the demonstrators were, on the other hand, violating the law.
Bloomberg explained that he had given the order to space the place because it had turned into “a place where people did not come to demonstrate, but to break the laws and in some cases to cause harm to other people, because “some business would have received threats, and residents feared “to ensure their quality of life”
“The room in the morning grey was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is basically interested in protecting the financial interests and not in protecting the interests of North American workers, added the spokesman of the movement, who accused the mayor of ‘not respecting the freedom of the press’.
The representatives of Occupy Wall Street informed them that they thought they would organize “great actions” for Thursday, together with community organisations and trade unions to commemorate the two months that the protests have been taking place since September 17.
Pamela Anderson is the Virgin Mary in the TV Christmas show
Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, it will appear on December 1st in the TV program \"It's a Russell Peters Christmas\"
The Canadian Pamela Anderson was the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary during a Christmas show of Canadian television.
Today, the private TV channel CTV announced that Anderson, together with the “crooner” (Balladensänger) Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities will appear on December 1st in the TV program “It’s a Russell Peters Christmas” and a very special Virgin Mary will take life.
Today, CTV spread pictures of the television program in which Anderson, who also appears for the spread on the Internet of a self-throated porn, along with her former husband, the drummer of Mötley Crue, Tommy Lee, appears as a virgin Mary with a doll in the lap that Jesus is to represent.
In the scene, Peters, a famous Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently worked as a moderator at the broadcast \"My Violent Torpedo of Truth\" by Charlie Sheen, appears as Jesus Child.
The Christmas program of CTV not only relies on Anderson and Peters, but also on Canadian singer Bublé, who married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato at the end of March in Buenos Aires, and who does not stand far from this controversy.
Bublé had recently called North American Kim Kardashian \"Hure\" at one of his concerts in New York.
Japan is reborn after the earthquake
GDP is growing by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and is ending the spiral of free fall from the beginning of March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, which is still in recovery after the destructive earthquake that led to a nuclear crisis and the worst disaster that Japan had experienced during World War II.
The government's first estimates in Tokyo rated the damage to property to $300,000, a blow that seems to weaken despite the difficult world economic situation.
After three quarters of the case, the figures for the gross domestic product from July to September finally ended this chapter: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% to the annual quota.
The value measured in the second quarter - in Japan the financial year begins in March 2012 - also means the fastest growth since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery can partly be explained by the machine sales for the reconstruction of the areas devastated by the earthquake and the following tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1% compared to the decrease by 0.9% for capital investments recorded from January to March, the first decrease after six months of unstoppable growth.
Nevertheless, the real recovery of the Japanese economy is not exclusively based on the Keynsian attacks that take advantage of the crisis to build or rebuild infrastructures.
Japan is awakened in particular thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable rose by 1%, driven by the growing expenditure on vehicles, travel and leisure jobs.
The Stigma of the Yen
Tokyo has entrusted itself to the domestic market after the yen - the Japanese currency - have entered into one of the ‘refuge currencies’ of investors fleeing from the eurozone debt crisis and the deceptive forecasts for the U.S.A., a privilege that is like a gravestone on the accounts of export companies.
With a tougher currency, products abroad are more expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of the major technology producers.
For example, Toyota and Sony brought their weak business results back to Yen from July to September.
While markets continue to besiege the peripheral EU countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government remains vigilant.
“It is necessary to consider the ongoing risks, for example the deterioration of some foreign economies, the effects of the floods in Thailand and the rapid recovery of the Yen, said yesterday of the Secretary of State for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
The perspectives are really not very striking.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated that in September most Member States had shown clearer signs of a slowing down of economic development.
The indicator predicting the turning points of the global economy revealed that the brake had been drawn at the largest economic potential.
For he dropped by four tenths to about 100,4 points compared to the 100,8 in August.
The euro area is even below this average value, which is 100, after it has fallen to 99,13 points by eight tenths.
Athens again raises doubts
Papadimos says that the austerity measures would be adopted, but the Conservatives will not sign a written agreement
With the high risk premiums of peripheral countries and wide-ranging uncertainty, Greece is also further lost in the labyrinth that results from the major European debt crisis.
The impression that the “consension” of the new Greek transitional government is a reaction to the pressure from Brussels rather than a genuine conviction of the political forces is slowly confirmed by facts.
During the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday pointed out that there were no alternatives to structural reforms and that the hundred days that he had agreed on were perhaps too short for their implementation, the leader of the Conservative Party Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would support the new austerity measures and would in no way withdraw his demand for new elections at the scheduled date, February 19.
\"The most important task of this government is the implementation of the decisions made at the October 26 summit - assured Papadimos yesterday to open a parliamentary debate that will be held tomorrow with the vote of confidence for the new government.
The first initiatives are a package of 24 employment promotion programmes, the reform of the disciplinary law for officials and new measures against tax collection.
Nevertheless, Samara’s statement does not raise the doubt about his attitude: “We have committed ourselves to supporting the transitional government, but otherwise to nothing”
The conservative leader went a step too far with his challenge of the EU and the IMF, the organism that must unlock the 8,000 million that Athens urgently needs, and he made it clear that he would not approve a declaration of commitment on the performance of the austerity measures.
But the European Commission, which is still irritated by the effects of the poker game with Papandreu referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand should not be remedied: Economic assistance would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties signed \"a clear written agreement not as soon as possible\".
The spokesperson of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, said that the inspectors of the Troika, too soon, were returning to Athens to discuss with the new government, which was necessary for the payment of the sixth section, in the amount of 8000 million euros, although there is still no final date.
The Greek knot still has threads for a while.
Queen Sofía: \"These are instruments for progress and hope\"
The Queen stressed Spain's \"predominant position on this kind of financing\"
Spain has achieved a dominant position worldwide in the role of microfinance,
The Queen Sofía of Spain reminded us yesterday that Spain has developed into the second donor of this international cooperation fund over the last two decades. That “Wesen” is why it is an “instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind on the basis of trust in human beings.
Yesterday, the Queen inaugurated the fifth World Summit on Small Credits in Valladolid. She was convinced that there was no doubt that this kind of business would be absolutely indispensable to achieve the millennium goals set by the United Nations by 2015 and, in particular, the goal of the number of persons who have to live with incomes of less than one dollar a day, that is below the poverty line.
Spain continues to work, while extending the beneficiary network to the last corner of the world, and it carries out this task responsibly, Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions from the summit, which lasts until Thursday, will ensure the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and, in particular, for women, as the main beneficiaries of these loans.
“We have experienced many successes, and “we face many challenges”
The summit on micro-credits is not only a forum for debates, but also a platform for the promotion of \"two basic objectives\"
The Queen stated that by the end of 2015, the aim would be to have 175 million poor families access to these financial services and that 10 million of these households would cross the poverty line.
The concept of micro-credits goes back in Spain and the rest of the world to the path initiated by Muhammad Yunus years ago, which Queen Sofia regards as an act of justice and recognition.
She described the father of this financial instrument as a “wonderful idealist who has committed himself to the struggle against poverty, and whose work she has known for 15 years when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to get to know the loan strategy locally.
A year later, the first World Summit in Washington followed this experience and further meetings on the Ivory Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006. At all, we have been able to observe continuous development, the Queen explained her commitment to this project yesterday to assess her as a “family head” in Valladolid and as a“presponsor of the poor”.
Finally, Queen Sofia ended her presentation by encouraging the present to participate in the debate and to seek solutions in the fight against poverty.
'Ethical commandment'
Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity is an ethical commandment for the entire democratic state.
In this sense, she stressed that it was a mistake to link development aid to times of economic boom, because it was a \"durable obligation\"
Jiménez believed that micro-credits were a “earliest and rigorous policy for the eradication of poverty” and that the governments of the industrial states should now work according to solidarity criteria, and not allow solidarity to fall victim to the crisis.
For Spain, micro-credits are one of the most important forms of development assistance.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, complained of the success of \"marginalized\" people, who were always standing in front of closed doors, \"hope\" and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the people in a city, which \"its gates, attached to the spirit of solidarity\" open.
The CDU proposes to elect EU Presidents on the basis of a general vote
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democrats (CDU on Monday, 14 November in Leipzig was for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and Chairman of the Christian Democratic Party, without real difficulties.
The future of Europe was not originally planned in the programme, but in autumn, in particular in order to satisfy those activists who appreciate the government's policies regarding the Greeks today and possibly Italy's tomorrow as too lax.
The European Commission's presidential proposal proposed by the Bureau was adopted almost unanimously.
Among the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against, ten abstained.
The standing ovation, which was the result of several minutes of intervention initially by Angela Merkel and several hours later by Wolfgang Schäuble, was no doubt open to any doubt on the part of the three European-led finance ministers.
The main idea of the chancellor is, like the requests, the following slogan: the response to the crisis is not less, but more Europe.
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because \"new millions of jobs depend directly on the euro\"
For the chancellor, \"the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe\"
This could be reflected by a strengthening of the European Union's review of the Lisbon Treaty on the budget policy of the euro area countries, but this could also be achieved by the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of a general vote to give a face to Europe,
However, this is in any case one of the proposed proposals adopted by the Congress, which clearly was by Wolfgang Schäuble Pate.
Certainly it is little probable that the 47 quickly agree on this revolution: Great Britain is opposed to the matter, and the leaders of the CDU believe to know that Nicolas Sarkozy is the same opinion.
However, the milestone is laid.
Similarly, in an overwhelming majority, the delegates rejected the proposal for the weighting of each country in the Governing Body of the ECB in line with the weighting of the individual economies, which obviously led to the initialisation of Germany's position.
The chancellor, who was considering calming the climate within her party, has therefore strengthened the points of reference to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. However, she has no longer tried to win her congress at the expense of the \"small\" or the European countries in difficulty, which would immediately criticize the arrogant Germany.
As far as Europe's application for the importance of the \"German-French friendship\" is concerned, Angela Merkel does not call France on the plan.
At least not directly.
Because this reminds us that Leipzig was at the heart of a bloody battle two centuries ago.
In fact one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does the fraud represent in the case of hospital messages?
According to the family aid UMP and government are now attacking the disease reports.
Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux on Tuesday, 15 November, to look for a family aid fund and to give a speech on the topic of the fight against social fraud and economic dependence on the state, which has always returned since 2007.
In order to accompany this attack, which is due to the desire to subvert the economy in a tough trial, but on the other hand, not less of an indicator of the right presidential campaign, the majority wants to focus on employee health reports.
First of all, with budgetary objectives: the government is looking at the introduction of a fourth day of career before taking into account a health report for private sector workers.
In good German, this means that without the specific company's permission, a sick worker would lose four days' wages, i.e. at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that, according to the daily newspaper Les Echos, threatens to raise anger, but would help bring in 280 million euros.
And the more symbolic characters that came with another measure: to give the state official an unrequited day of karenz in the case of illness (to date, unlike the three days of carenzdays in the private sector, there is no period of carenzial).
While these questions are in the debate, the majority of them are also admonishing the subject of fraud, focusing on the abuse associated with work absenteeism.
“Controls will be much more important, and they will be reimbursed if required,” Xavier Betrand warned on Sunday, 13 November, in front of the radio station RTL’s microphone.
As in other cases, the impact of this report on the reality of fraudulent actions in the field of hospitalization seems a little disproportionate.
In fact, since 2002, this has been the subject of permanent observation and political offensives, which have borne the most frequent fruit.
The French are no longer more sick than people elsewhere in Europe.
However, first of all, let us refer to the country-wide figures.
According to the national health insurance fund CNAM, more than 237 million euros were paid daily in 2006.
With regard to the Institute of Health Research and Documentation, the daily payments in 2008 amounted to 11.3 billion euros 5% of health expenditure.
This amount fell to 46% on maternity leave and work accidents and 54% on sickness leave, which is EUR 6.2 billion.
And therefore 2.5% health expenditure.
In 2010 only 14.5 days were granted to French people compared with 17.8 days in 2009 according to a study by the Alma Consulting Group.
An average value that obscures certain differences: another, published in 2007 by Monster.com, career planning website, showed that 75% of the 40,000 surveyed indicated that French workers did not take a single day of illness.
Another study, recorded this time by health insurance, makes it clear that 37% of the disease reports in 2010 were of shorter duration than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and a month, 15% between one and three months and 11% above.
Thus, compared with their European neighbours, French workers no longer tend to be unemployed elsewhere.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two researchers from the French State Centre for Science Research (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the global abscess rate (infirmary or otherwise) oscillates, between 10% and 11% in France as opposed to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud in the case of hospital messages is a disappearing small proportion in relation to black labour.
With regard to fraud, there is only a weak extent to be achieved here.
Enhancement of legislation since 2002 means that there are systmatic controls in the case of disease reports that exceed 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (public university for education and training of technicians and engineers) found, under 1.5 million controls, that 13% of the 285,000 completed short-term medical reports, which are in 37,050 cases, were \"unjusted or too long.\"
In the systematically controlled disease reporting cases of more than 45 days of duration, less than 1.2 million 11% were reported as \"unadjusted or unjustified\" cases, including 132,000.
In total, this makes 169,000 \"unjustified\" cases for several million workers who have filed a medical report.
A figure which represents only a weak advantage over, for example, that of black labour.
According to UMP's deputy Dominique Tian, author of a case report published in July on this issue, this represents between 9 and 15 billion euros of tax profit per year, that is, more than the total cost of daily compensation, and thus significantly more than the defraudation of the latter.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adaptation plan
Greece needs a new adjustment programme to catch up with its economy.
On Monday, 14 November, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos had announced before Parliament, in addition to the fact that his government had not been given a hundred days to carry out this task.
\"In order to continue efforts to strengthen the economy, we need support from our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme, said the Head of Government in his first public speech in opening the debate on Parliament's vote of confidence on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Euro Summit on 27 October was the ‘heading task’ of the new government, as the participation of the country within the Eurozone was at stake, as it added.
In line with this, M. Papademos has planned to reduce the country's state deficit by 9% of gross domestic product from today to the end of the year, after 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The rights reject the new savings
Antonis Samaras, head of the right wing, had given his consent on Monday to the already approved measures concerning an attempt to escape from the debt crisis, but it was anticipated that his party would not be prepared to accept additional savings.
“We will not vote in favour of new measures,” he said at the meeting of his New Democracy Party’s delegates.
He had agreed with the requirements of reducing budget deficits and debt, as well as fighting the waste, but he opposed any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, EU Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who had prevented IMF and EU from releasing the necessary EUR 8 billion loan without a written guarantee of all parties on their support of the planned measures, had replied that his speech was sufficient and that he would not sign anything under pressure from Außen.
Euthanasia and accompanying Freitod must be legalized, according to an expert body
Canadians live in refusal of death, as a report of the Royal Society of Canada
The panel said that governments, institutions of health care and doctors worked together to provide the best pain relievers and beyond cancer cases.
Canadian society lives in a refusal towards death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually agree to talk to their doctor about conditions under which they would like to die and meet dispositions for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts were involved, which are linked in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
This body recommends that the government amend the criminal law in such a way as to allow accompanied suicide and euthanasia where this choice takes place, in the case of patients who are considered to be able to make such a decision.
As a start, experts cite a recently published survey of the independent company EIU, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the globe.
Although Canada has placed itself on the 10th rank, the study notes that “medical death care in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid of cutting the issue of death“
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians have no access to pain-killing drugs, the experts ordered by the Royal Society of Canada tell us.
And despite the Canadian majority wish to die at home, eventually 68.6% of those in the hospital die.
All over the country, the rate of death in Quebec is the highest in 86% of hospitalised deaths.
In the delicate question of euthanasia and associated suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that the position of the federal government, which has already attempted not to make any changes to the criminal law on euthanasia and associated suicide, is opposed.
Now, however, according to the experts, who have equally inspected all those countries whose euthanasia and accompanied suicide approach have legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that such decriminalisation would lead to abuses in their application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or associated suicide by uncompetent or non-agreed persons.
On the contrary, there are far more cases of such transgressions in countries where euthanasia and associated suicide are not legalized, as yesterday Jocelyn Downie, co-signator of the report, confirmed in a teleconference.
\"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal,
“Also accompanied suicide is practiced in Canada, although here clearly illegal - explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians advocate euthanasia
Let us imagine that, according to an Angus Reid survey conducted in 2010, 85% of Canadians had already been killed in favour of euthanasia, as they believe that it would allow persons at the end of their lives to alleviate their suffering.
And 66% believe that the fact that euthanasia is legalized does not lead to the message that the lives of elderly or disabled people are less valuable.
With regard to those who have already committed an accompanying suicide, 41% of respondents feel that they should not be prosecuted.
As regards the maintenance or discontinuation of medicines in patients, the author of the report states that the situation is less clear.
Similarly, in their list of recommendations, they suggest that the criminal law should state that the suspension of the funds for which a legal rejection has occurred should not be considered criminal.
The expert body also calls for health professionals to be trained in the task of respecting a reduction of resources at the end of life, and to fear this without criminal persecution.
The panel said that governments, institutions of health care and doctors worked together to provide the best pain relievers and beyond cancer cases.
Finally, as regards the means already used in Canadian health care institutions, the board calls for pain relief or loss of life to be taken into consideration, at least because they did not help to reduce physical pain as well as euthanasia, and they are concerned with the same procedures.
Subject to other experts
Some experts in the field of health have already submitted reservations regarding the conclusions of the Expert Report of the Royal Society of Canada.
RA Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has described the attitude of the reporting experts as \"extreme\" among other things, as they do not set any limits on euthanasia in the final phase of health.
“This opens the doors for a situation in which a person who is living tired and older than 18 years of age asks another person to help him in his suicide, as RA Deschamps had seen yesterday a summary of the report.
RA Deschamps also stressed that the authors of the report seemed to place the individual's own responsibility over all the other values involved in the social effects of society.
But now, he says, there are \"guidelines and commitments in a society\"
Margaret Somerville, a specialist in health law, also expressed \"a strong resistance\" to the conclusions of the report, which she was titulating as \"pro euthanasia manifesto\".
Margaret Somerville, himself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, in particular doubts the reporting on the non-preservation of abuses in certain countries where euthanasia and associated suicide are legalized, such as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The king of Jordan calls President Assad to power
Damascus awards a \"comlott\"
Syria is now insulated
The Partisans Baschar al-Assads demonstrated yesterday before the authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The diplomatic pressure on Syria's Bashar al-Assads, however, which, thanks to Russia's support and the fact that the country's \"comlott\" has been rejected, has increased yesterday.
Two days before the end of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union intensified its sanctions against Damascus, although Turkey and Jordan, the neighbouring countries of Syria, had taken a position in favour of a resignation by President Assad.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was yesterday the acting Arab Prime Minister, who had asked President Bashar al-Assad to \"replace his power in Syria\" in which some forty civilians and members of the government were already killed.
“With Bashar’s interest in his country at heart, he would resign, but in addition, he should also create the necessary conditions for a new era of political Syrian life, according to the king of Jordan, neighboring Syria, in an interview with BBC.
The Turkish diplomat chief Ahmet Davutoglu had complained on his part that since the beginning of the year, the Turkish mediation attempts had not been successful.
“Those in the Middle East who are not at peace with their people and cannot be satisfied with it must go,” he explained, in an appeal to Syria, the neighbouring country to which Turkey is increasingly harsh.
The United States, on the other hand, welcomed the \"several dissension of the consensus against Assad and the machinations of the Syrian regime\" as a result of the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
\"International Community, United States, EU, Arab League and countries like Turkey have hit an ever sharper tone in view of the repressions in Syria, as observed by Mark Toner, a spokesperson of the State Department.
During this period, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the government in the region of Dar'a in southern Syria were killed, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights announced OSDH.
Two other civilians, according to this NGO, were killed in the besieged city of Homs in the case of \"shoe changes and heavy bomb attacks around Jobar\".
At a press conference, the Syrian Minister for Foreign Trade Walid al-Muallim felt that the country's tax towards the end of the crisis was still going to be taxed.
By the way, he has responded with emphasis to the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus from its duties, which, according to his assessment, constitutes a \"dangerous step\".
He added, under the pressure of Syria, that ‘the plots against Syria would fail,
According to the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently examining a \"protective mechanism for civilians\" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, the media and military observers to the country.
The French Foreign Trade Minister Alain Juppé had also expressed his support for the sending of UN observers to protect civilians from repression of the regime, that he was now encapsulated into his “Paranoia”.
A planned new meeting of the League is planned for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the plan on the rise of the crisis on 2 November, but in particular the controversial, expected withdrawal of military troops from the besieged cities and the liberation of imprisoned demonstrators.
The Russian Foreign Minister Sergej Lawrow rated the decision of the Arab League yesterday as “uncorrected” in order to prevent any sanctions against Damascus, although China had already urged Syria to implement the crisis exit plan.
Italy
Monti calls on the markets to be patient and Italy to be ready to sacrifice
Mario Monti, future Italian head of government, has called for a little more time from the markets to form his staff and implement a programme that would demand \"offenders\" to regain the creditworthiness lost during the last few months of the Berlusconi government.
The former EU Commissioner had held negotiations with the political parties before today's trade unions and employers.
It was his job to convene a cabinet in Parliament, which is relatively strictly composed of external technocrats.
“Monti spoke of an important programme with a number of victims,” said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many smaller parliamentary groups participating in the talks after meeting with the President-in-Office.
Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Deputies, had, on his part, waited too much for Mario Monti to vote on a vote of confidence until Friday to ensure that the new government had sufficient support.
The agreements will be filled in the presentation of a list of deletions presented by M. Monti, which will undoubtedly range from a dozen ministers to the head of state, Giorgio Napolitano.
M. Monti commented that yesterday's nervousness in stock market and bond markets called for their time.
In \"a democracy there are certain deadlines, in order to prepare a government and a government programme, he stressed the importance of ensuring that markets will show themselves to be transparent and understanding,
His appointment by the President was welcomed by the markets, but the unrest had increased again, especially after an unexpected decline in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The Prime Minister was supposed to establish a staff consisting of primarily technocrats, although he had stressed that he would like to involve \"politicals\".
The new government should only exist until 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections, he estimated.
According to Gianfranco Fini, the President of the Chamber of Deputies, the new government should be given the proof of confidence of Parliament by Friday.
M. Monti has since taken up his role has committed himself to working in all urgency in the sense of the goal of making Italy a \"new protagonist\" in Europe.
A spokesperson for EU Commissioner Olli Rehn had stressed that \"we are not changing our diagnosis of the Italian economy even taking into account the new government,
In particular, the EU, which is convinced that Rome will not achieve its budget balance goal in 2013, despite the savings plans that have been taken up in recent months, has requested new key issues.
Emma Marcelagaglia, Chief Chefin of Italy, who will meet Monti on Tuesday, is also aware of the need to stimulate the economy, since a country which has no growth to show that deficits cannot be respected,
M. Monti, who is known for his competence and independence as an EU Commissioner (1994-2004), stands for an \"epocheque change\" in Italy after 17 years of \"Berlusconism\", the \"Professor\" symbolises the \"professor's challenge of trustworthiness\" and \"other Italy\" as well as the guiding article authors.
The great unknown is the longevity of his staff.
President Napolitano would like to prevent preferred elections, since Italy has raised EUR 200 billion of government bonds from now until April 2012.
Russian scientists help the Iranian nuclear energy programme
A Russian scientist, Wjatcheslaw Danilenko, helped Iran develop an explosive capsule that can be used with a nuclear weapon, so on Monday confirmed an American NGO specializing in nuclear risks.
The Institute of Science and International Security ISIS is based on the report recently published by the International Atomic Safety Agency AIEA and other documents from this UN agency for the investigation of this scientist.
The AIEA last week had communicated its “serious concern” on the occasion of a possible military dimension of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to an in-depth study of the AIEA documents by ISIS, Danilenko, born in 1934, had apparently been working in a Soviet military nuclear centre in Tscheljabinsk (Ural) for over three decades since the early 1960s and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds produced by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991 he will have left the center to set up a company in Kiev that produces \"nano diamonds\".
The economic difficulties of his company had led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Before his return to Russia, he then participated in an Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002.
In its last report, the AIEA noted that Iranian development, a nuclear explosive system, had been supported by the work of a foreign expert, who was not only the most involved in this technology, but also, as a state member of the Agency said, had worked directly on the military nuclear energy programme of his country of origin, his entire career beyond necessity in this technology,
Anti-Islamic crimes and crimes have increased by 50%
Crimes and offences directed against Muslims increased by 50% from 2009 to 2010, whereas other racist or religious-motivated violent crimes, according to FBI statistics published on Monday, have either decreased slightly over the same period or have increased slightly.
According to this data, the total number of crimes committed against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. 49%, whereas a 13% increase in acts of violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crimes directed against Jews, and a 14% global increase in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of hate-motivated crimes has risen to 6,628 cases in very weak terms, including 47.3% due to racial differences and 20% due to religious differences of motivated offences, said the FBI.
“After a crisis in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and crimes rekindled,” said the Human Rights Organisation First Human Rights Agency, “the rise of anti-Islamic violence is particularly significant, so the organization added in a communiqué.
“Human Rights First had long emphasised that the violence directed against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be regarded as a serious violation of human rights,” added Paul Legendre, an organization’s representative.
\"The American government can and should do more to combat these attacks, he added that this could be done by improving the police attitude towards the \"hospitable crime\".
In the U.S. federal law, the “hospital crime” is a legacy from the era of civil rights struggle.
This legislation was passed after the death of Martin Luther Kings in order to punish violent acts directed against race, skin color, religion or descent and now also to involve criminal offences of sexual affiliation.
Twitter is changing the platform and is more and more similar to Facebook
The Microblogging website Twitter has introduced changes on Monday in the presentation of its platform to enable its users, in particular, to observe the activities of those who follow their entries, which makes the service more similar to that of Facebook.
The new tab \"Activity\" and another name enable more readable live tracking of the activities of other \"Twitters\" - the Internet user whose messages \"Tweets\" are being tracked and who are tracking your messages.
This allows them to find out whether they allow them to track their messages, whether they subscribe to new posts, favor certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter menu offer was tested before its general Internet dissemination on Monday, August, with a small percentage of users, the Twitter spokesperson Carolyn Penner announced in front of the French press agency AFP.
Twitter was known for its little instinctive functioning, equipped with something esotherically pleasing (RT to the referenced repetition of another person's contribution). followfriday pour recommender de suivre un autre utilizer) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ainsi a un public plus large avec un maniement plus comparable a celui des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
In the network, users discussed this innovation via certain “tweets” via the Internet.
“This is useless, intrusive and is too similar to Facebook,” writes @jemb123.
“The “activity” function will help me to better track certain elements of my Flux twitter,” said @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Entry into the Constitution of a \"Golden Budget Rule\"
On Tuesday, the Government of the Great Social Democratic/Christian Democratic Coalition in Austria decided to include a \"Golden Budget Rule\" in the Constitution to reduce public deficits and also to avoid any degradation by rating agencies in Austria's Top Bonity (AAA).
It was the social-democratic chancellor Werner Faymann who had announced this decision of the Council of Ministers, despite the fact that the government debt of Austria is 74.6%, far above the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the debt level of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
“If Austria’s ability to pay was not reduced to AAA+, we would have to pay three billion euros of interest each year,” argued Michael Spindelegger, Vice Chancellor and Christian Democratic Minister of Foreign Affairs.
Austria also made a request from the Brussels Summit of the eurozone Member States on 26 October: the Heads of State and Government at that time demanded the inclusion of the reduction of public deficits by the end of 2012, as well as a return to public account equilibrium in the Constitution or by adoption of an equivalent law.
The measure taken by the Austrian government is similar to the \"German model\" - since Germany was the first European country to include such a \"rule\" into the Constitution.
By 2017, the structural budget deficit should be reduced by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, and as of 2017, the structural budget deficit of the state should not exceed 0.35% of GDP, whereas regional states and municipalities should have balanced households.
The objective is to eliminate the budgetary debt under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Agreement in the horizon of 2020/21.
Stronger Yen
Noda threatens with a new intervention in monetary markets
On Tuesday, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned that Japanese power would again intervene in currency markets if Yen continued to rise.
“If we establish excessive volatility in the Yen exchange rate, we will intervene just as we did the last time,” said Mr. Noda in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the Yen was in turn close to the historical levels which the Japanese authorities had forced to intervene on 31 October.
That day Tokyo had sold massive yen against dollar to lower the Japanese foreign exchange value, which is to pay a new record value since 1945 against the dollar.
The yen, however, has risen regularly over it, baptized by purchases of investors who view the yen as a “refuge value” in these uncertain times of global economic downturn and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar fell below 77 yen on Tuesday, the euro fell below the symbolic lats of 105 yen near the levels that had fought the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis 2008-2009, the dollar noted around the 120 yen, the Euro more than 160 yen.
This blackmail of the Japanese currency damages the exports of the archipelago, as it increases the costs of the \"Made in Japan\" products and reduces the income value of Japanese firms from abroad, as they exchange them in national currency.
“Japan is fighting after the earthquake and the tsunami on March 11 which devastated the region of Tohoku (Northern East) for its reconstruction,” says Mr. Noda, who fears that this deploring of the Yen could already kill the weak upswing in the germ.
With growth in the third quarter of the third quarter, the third economic world power has regained its strength in comparison to the previous quarter for the first time this year, thanks to the leaping export increases and consumption of the households that have been bombarded by the disaster.
The Prime Minister estimates, however, that Yen's stockpiling does not reflect Japan's economic foundations.
The Finance Minister Jun Azumi, for his part, called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy committee on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to reduce the Yen.
However, Hirohide Yamaguchi, Deputy Governor of the Institute, has informed that BoJ has already initiated \"suitable measures\", thus making it clear that no additional currency lock-in is expected on Wednesday.
At the last meeting at the end of October, the Notenbank had increased its government bond purchases by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) to cover the 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros), which it had spent on various purchases of financial titles to flood the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
interest rates fast up, stock exchanges make detractors
The risk of the debt crisis is constantly untermining the European indicators.
Despite the new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy and the best growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of the weakened countries continue to increase steadily.
The stock exchanges, which are still concerned about the stability of the euro area, also drifted a little further into negative feelings this Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris the CAC lost 1.4% at 10 o'clock and fell to 3,064 points.
The dax in Frankfurt decreased by 0.4%, London by 0.1%.
\"Due to the new tensions with regard to the return on government bonds in the euro area in difficulty, the global stock markets continue to issue part of their recent profits.
“The capital investors are nervous and are only aware of the risk of infection,” says Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters Press Agency.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange, which, on the other hand, is suffering from the market participants’ renewed fear regarding the capacity in Europe that the debt crisis continues to continue, had closed with a brunt of 0.7%.
“Japan, as well as the rest of the world, has focused its eyes on Europe, and trade moves on a limited variation corridor, as long as investors have no evidence that the situation has stabilized, estimates Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This revitalisation of the concern about the future of the euro area is damaging the single currency which continues its bailout on Tuesday.
The euro has been moving at its lowest level for one and a half months.
By 10 a.m., the European currency was worth 1.3570 interpreters, so it accounted for 0.4%.
According to the stock market brokers, it was withdrawn after the CDU, a party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had gathered at the congress on Monday, had accepted an application which provides, in particular, the possibility for countries in difficulty to leave the euro zone without simultaneously leaving the European Union.
The Italian and Spanish rates are well below the 6% limit.
The loan interest rates of Italy and Spain are still at a very worrying level.
This Tuesday morning the return on Italian bonds reached 6.85%, which the Spanish titles reached 6.2%.
These tensions of interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel the fears of investors.
The future Italian Head of Government Mario Monti called for more time from the markets to restore the situation threatened by the debt burden in Italy.
On the other hand, the new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos had confirmed that the decisions taken on 27 October by the Eurozone Summit were the main task of his government.
Spain is on the vis-à-vis the markets, since on Sunday Parliamentary elections take place in the country.
The interest rates spread between the German and Spanish 10-year bonds has again reached a new, historic high.
Expected eurozone growth figures
Statistically, France recorded an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter as a result of household consumption, a little better than the expected 0.3%.
However, the Federal Statistical Office of INSEE had revised the rate of figures in the second quarter, with a minus of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of a stagnation.
In fact, it is the fourth quarter that is most disturbing to economic experts.
Germany had a 0.5% growth over the same period.
A first survey of the entire euro area is expected at 11 a.m., with the EU Commission warning of the risk of a recession.
Energy policy:
Facts should win over dogmas
If a topic is not to be addressed on the basis of short-term considerations or due to emotions, this is certainly the energy policy.
Availability and costs of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is reasonable to take an election meeting to take place, to reflect on this issue and on the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only bear fruit if it sins the total economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although 7 billion people are on this planet, demographic evolution is a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, should not have to give up a huge proportion of the world's population on a vital element.
At the same time, it is necessary to mitigate the shortage of fossil resources in order to continue producing constant electricity without forgetting the compelling need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a topic that has disappeared from the environmental debate, in order to combat climatic irregularities.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany continues to remain isolated from nuclear power in its decision.
This is not the case in Belgium, which undermines its decision to find a substitute source, nor in Switzerland, which intends to build only nuclear power plants of the last generation.
By contrast, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name only a few countries, continue to pursue their projects with determination.
The United States, for its part, after Fukushima, decided to add another unit to its park by resuming the Three Mile Island plant which had been shut down after the nuclear accident.
Although the German model is sometimes used as a model for renewable energy sources, reality contradicts the discourse.
The election in Berlin will be in the form of an increase in the price of electricity, an energy dependence enhanced by the increased withdrawal of imported gas, especially Russia, which will bring about an increase in CO2 emissions caused by gas and coal power plants.
The totality of these unsatisfied effects will already be noted within a few months.
The case of Denmark gives rise to reflection.
Denmark is, on the one hand, the European table guide to wind energy, which accounts for 30% of its electricity, on the other hand, the country is one of the strongest users of coal and gas, used interchangeably with wind energy; on the other hand, its CO2 emissions and its electricity price are 65% and 50% higher than the corresponding European average.
The stability of our energy policy makes our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill in contrast to our French households.
Since the price of energy in the globalised economy is a key factor in competitiveness and the stability of the industry on a national level, French companies benefit from the most affordable electricity in Europe.
Any significant reduction in nuclear power would therefore result in a strong increase in the energy price, which would be the noble statements about the reindustrialisation of our country and the defense of purchasing power for illusion.
Surveys showed that it is a price that the vast majority of French people are willing to pay just as little, as it shows resistance to the principle of this energy source.
On the other hand, our country's energy policy has enabled us to build an industry with 125.00 direct and 410,000 induced jobs.
Due to its strong export character, it brings a large number of specialized small and medium-sized enterprises to the international markets and makes them creators of countless jobs.
If France were to take the decision to withdraw from nuclear power, a large proportion of these SMEs would fall victim to it, and the annual EUR 6 billion in investment goods and nuclear energy exports would shrink more and more.
Which electrician would assign an EPR designed to function on sixty years if the decline of its producer is preprogrammed?
In order to solve the energetic equation, one must admit that there is as little a devil's work as there is a miracle to produce electricity.
The low CO2 solutions developed by the Areva company for the use of nuclear power and renewable energy testify to the complementarity of energy sources.
Maintaining the highest level of safety is an absolute imperative for nuclear power.
In France we have a security authority that carries out uncompromising and transparent checks in already existing plants such as the building in Flamanville.
Their work teams, which have made a name for themselves because of their professionalism, are to be possessed by the security idea.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three major crashes.
Only one single, in Three Mile Island, has entered under normal operating conditions, so he has no consequences for human beings and the environment.
In Chernobyl, the drama was raised by reactor construction as well as inexcusable human failure.
At Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident of two natural disasters has never been caused by the mass mass that caused the death of several tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will draw its lessons from this accident, as it did after the two previous ones.
As a fruit of this approach, as well as a cooperation between the security authorities of the French and German operators and designers of nuclear power plants, the EPR presents a draft which allows it to withstand such phenomena.
Since it is considered desirable for electrical engineers to build a nuclear power plant, a construction stop in Flamanville would be a fabulous gift to the competition of Areva and EDF by allowing them to travel freely to the position of leadership in the inevitable nuclear power development.
It is inconvenient and legitimate to look for the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be pointless to let emotions, dogmas and party maneuvers dominate a debate that also defines our country's economic, social and financial situation.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy, led by Nicolas Sarkozy, has been criticized from many angles - overloading police, court and administrative bodies by means of a policy subject to figures, compatibility of this policy with the status of a country of human rights - as France itself had titled itself.
Recently, the harassment directed against foreign students by the public side had marked the weekly shows, the Minister of the Interior had promptly announced (see Libération of 23 May) that France needed ‘no talents, masons or waiters from abroad’,
But this policy was only rarely analysed from the economic point of view.
On this issue there is a wide consensus between the right and the left.
On the right hand side, Jacques Chirac, who had stated in 1976 that “900,000 unemployed, including more than 2 million immigrated workers, should not pose a problem for a country, from the left side by Michel Rocard, who had stated in 1990 that France could not absorb the entire poverty of the world,
The only difference is in the degree of increase
The fear of the invasion of the national soil by Horden Polish Klumpner was divided in 2005 from both right and left.
Both camps saw immigrants as a burden to the economy and to French society.
The only difference is in the degree of generosity that the immigrants are willing to accept.
Francois Hollande, in his programme, is limited to banalities, which indicate that partnership development allows us to solve our migration problems.
This notion of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may have an impact on elections, but it is economically costly.
As the economic experts Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron present us in a recently published work that summarizes the latest findings regarding immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among the specialists on the positive influence of immigrants' influence on economic growth, wages and jobs in the immigration countries.
Immigration would reduce growth and damage the labour market situation.
Fears of the influence of migrants are based on the notion that they threaten to replace domestic workers, in particular those who are less qualified, by exerting pressure on their wages.
Experience shows, however, that immigrants are in fact much more complementary than local wage workers, as they are performing major occupations in sectors that are not technically charged with workplaces.
The low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that are less responsive to local wage workers who are more skilled among immigrants in dynamic sectors where training is not compatible with the job offer.
Positive wage effect
Just as a surgeon would have difficulties working in a country where there is a lack of anesthesiologist, this complementarity also results in a positive effect between the locals and migrants on wages and the domestic labour market situation.
Giovanni Peri calculated in this way that a 1% increase in the flow of immigrants resulted in a co-related, long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity of ideas added by immigrants as well as economic growth is acceptable (high proportion of native immigrants among American Nobel Prize winners; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also contribute net to social systems, in which European countries average about 1% of the total budget.
For example, the World Labour Organization estimates that a person who is immigrating to Germany over the age of 30 makes an average net contribution to the public budget over his lifetime (income minus expenditure) of around EUR 150,000.
Nicolas Sarkozy wished to introduce the missing intersections, with the teeth, at the start of his mandate.
However, these said teeth, which the immigrants were supposed to deter, achieved exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, remains to think through European democracy
Democracy is a valuable asset; it is also a sensitive asset.
The European continent should be able to remember who, after its invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, had passed over the tragedies of World War I, totalitarianism, Holocaust, Gulag, and Francos in Spain, Salazars in Portugal and the Supreme in Greece.
Some may have believed that it was enough to exercise the right to vote, in a direct way, to see democracy over their enemies for all time.
It has been known since Napoleon, the little one, that it was a feature of the mind.
The general right of elections, which constitutes the necessary condition of democracy, is not sufficient for this, and can be just as good as the 'repression instrument', as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot said at the time.
No, democracy requires far more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, separation and control of violence, training, education, economic and social community spirit, a case law.
The crisis in Europe, in which we are in, is an economic crisis, but it is also very and at least a political and democratic crisis.
The change of mind of the Greek True-Falsch referendum would in this respect have had a double indisputable character: once the need for a powerful return of politics, on the other hand, but also that of the disturbing feeling of their inability, their inaccuracy.
This ambivalence should be considered obsolete.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have shifted today, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, are no longer heading in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain in order to push for a success of the national referendum, which has been organized in accordance with the needs and in the wrong order.
A free sign for the European sole ruler or a leap with a connected eye into the void of nationalist withdrawal: a great choice for the citizen!
No, we want a collective task rather than a collective task, fully justified and constantly, an election and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - but they are no longer known where to end the list - because there is only one crisis, and this is the case in Europe.
It is all Europe that is facing the dictates of markets and rating agencies, which suffer from its powerlessness and its lack of solidarity.
It is all Europe that is humiliated at international level.
One is troubled by the transfer of sovereignty towards Europe - it is all Europe that gradually loses its sovereignty, and thus every one of the nations that joins it.
The urgency is to give people sovereignty back to the leadership of the European project.
For it is up to the whole whether Europeans can reduce the burden of their debts, free themselves from the markets and start a future through investment.
The departure from the crisis has European-level decisions on the condition that they cannot be taken without a total democratic right-of-way, without certainly bringing us to ruin.
After this proposal has been debated by Jacques Delors and the Socialists for a long time, everyone today urges European economic governance.
Agreed.
But this without political integration and a stronger democracy - as it suggests to the citizens - would be a new folly and a further deadlock.
We need to take up a new stage of European integration.
In order to create the Republic in France, it was necessary to create Republicans
The revolution of interests alone could not suffice here.
This teaching remains valid.
We must form a better integrated Europe at economic level.
This can only be achieved by creating a more politically democratic Europe, a truly European people's sovereignty.
We need Europeans to create Europe.
“Contactless - Chipcards become the general good
On Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris, the World Fair for Chipcards opens its doors in an optimistic attitude.
According to Eurosmart, 2011 should end with an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor chips (EC cards, SIM card phones), with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most important segment is contactless technology, which allows payments in public transport or settlement of purchases by simply holding the card to a reader.
Compared to the 320 million sold a year earlier, 460 million contactless chip cards should be sold worldwide!
Their market share should continue to increase in 2012 (580 million expected units) and represent over 10% of the global chip card market (6.925 million cards).
Europe is gaining ground in terms of contactless payment after a long time of the Asia-Pacific region.
Some 26 million visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept them.
In France, the beginnings are rather modest: only 400,000 contactless visa cards were distributed.
However, consumer markets are steaming.
Carrefour has therefore issued 2.5 million contactless Pass MasterCards this year.
In order to exceed speed, it is now necessary for banks to equip their customers with these cards.
\"Two large French financial institutions have committed themselves to systematically handing out bank cards to their customers, which are equipped with contactless chip in the future, announced Gérard Nébouy, Director-General of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payment by cell phone
However, this is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
A disappearingly low percentage of devices has so far been equipped with NFC technology (Near Field Communication) necessary to carry out these transactions.
‘They have been delayed,
\"But they should experience a real upward development at least next year,
“In 2012 we expect to sell from 80 to 120 million units worldwide,” explains Marc Bertin, Chairman of Eurosmart.
But the banks take initiative.
The Crédit Agricole announced yesterday the start of a test run in Caen, which will run from December to next June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees are to be equipped with a capsule that permits contactless payment.
The BPCE runs a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société Générale had also announced yesterday that it would prepare the market launch of an offer that would allow their customers contactless payment by mobile phone.
Terrorist Front understands, from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is troubled by the relations between al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long-suspecting relations between the al-Qaida terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and Nigerian sect Boko Haram seem to confirm themselves.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Minister Abdelkader Messahel himself confirmed that Algiers has now gained “certainty”.
\"The way in which both organisations operate and the relations between intelligence services indicate clear cooperation, he stated, without going further into detail.
Paris seems to be making a similar analysis.
The investigations into the abduction of two Frenchmen in Niger took place last January have promoted interfaces on days.
The Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory, who were killed in a restaurant in Niamey by followers of the Aqmi, were to be killed on the following day at the same time as several of their abductors on the occasion of an operation carried out by the French special units.
French and Nigerian investigators wanted to find several telephone chips in the debris at the site that belonged to the terrorists.
Terrorist Axis
The analysis of the phone calls conducted leads to several conversational partners stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigators are particularly interested in the numbers of two interview partners: one number leads to a Nigerian who had stopped for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram; the other leads to a man who is considered close to Aqmi and the sect.
“This is progress, but there is no need to wait for clearer evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem,
\"It is possible, however, to think,
“For years, it has been known that the sect has involved financial and intellectual support from Auβen and that it has become increasingly active - the Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo is mitigating.
In recent months, these “support services” have become increasingly obvious in their course, as have Boko Harem’s speech and modes of operation, which now indicate the addition of suicide killers and the use of ever more complex explosives carrying the same handwriting as those used by Aqmi.
The International Community, to start with Washington, has been putting pressure on Abuja since then to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
In fact, the Nigerian authorities have observed the grouping for a long time over the Community of Illuminates, which should not be given special attention.
Fast Success
Boko Haram, founded in 2002 in Maiduguri in the vicinity of a mosque, school, and fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf, which means as much in Haoussa as “the Western Education is a disgrace,” is pursuing the establishment of an Islamic Emirate in the Muslim North of Nigeria.
In this medium-sized region, the merger is experiencing rapid success.
It politicizes and demands strict compliance with Sharia, while its affiliated activists are fighting against the godless central government.
The activists first have churches, bars and authorities in the visor.
In 2009, Boko Haram's activists were particularly active in their increased attacks against the Commissioners.
However, Abuja’s reaction is as usual indifferent.
The army surrounds the city, one counts 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, who has been imprisoned, is killed in prison.
As a result, the sect becomes more radical and leaves its high castles in the north.
Last Christmas she became known as an assassination in Jos, who demanded 80 lives, then to another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram is blamed for a suicide attack committed in the secured police headquarters in Abuja - the first of his kind.
In August, the local seat of the United Nations became the primary international target.
The formation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which will lead from Mauritania to Nigeria and to Somalia, has been alarming to all security experts since then.
While Aqmi has occupied Mali and Niger, the Somali of al-Shabaab in Kenya, Boko Harem seems to be a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, Alain Juppé warned of Boko Harem at a meeting with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria and was ready to share all the clues.
The world with the Republican presidential candidates
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry rival in simplification and ignorance regarding China, Iraq, and support for Israel.
Can a crisis-stricken America lead a complex world with simple ones not to say: simple ideas?
If you listen to the Republican presidential candidates like this, voters could almost get this impression.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry, and their associates have repeatedly made their thunderous statements and their statements on außenpolitik, traditional republican focus.
Over China, Iran, and Israel aid fall - often in no way supported - slogans.
With regard to the appointment of the \"Grand Old Party\", the highest in the course of the course, Mr Romney threatened to quote the Chinese before the WTO, and to present them with the \"Wourning Manipulation\" theme in an America that has become the most irritated by the migration of entire industries to Asia.
He said it was stupid if this was to imply the initiation of a trade war.
Jon Huntsman, former ambassador to China under Obama and the only candidate who seems to have a mature vision of foreign policy, has almost shut off the air in terms of his emotions flattering gesture.
He had called for a hand-held but constructive exchange of talks with Beijing (also the current attitude of Obama).
But Huntsman is not heard as he stagnates into the depths of the polls.
Reagan's ebony
Romney had also pledged military battles against Iran if sanctions were to fail to stop the nuclear programme.
“If I were elected, I'd make an objection to Iran,” he would say.
\"If Obama is reelected, they get the bomb\"
He also promised Israel increased military assistance and accused Obama of remaining guilty of this partner against obligations.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, second-highest-placed candidate, has a shameful lack of knowledge of files on his part.
He recently called on the Chinese military threat to counter, as Beijing was trying to develop a nuclear power - and seemed to have taken into account the fact that China has been in the possession of military nuclear weapons since 1964!
Texan Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and calls for military battles against Iran, is on his side to be ready to serve the American army in Mexico against drug cartels.
The withdrawal of torture attacks against suspected terrorists from Obama in 2009 was also supported by Cain, Perry and Michele Bachmann's candidate.
It is far from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, an auβenpolitan heavyweight.
The current presidential representatives opposed, Reagan also had simple ideas and despite all this won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama was also an amateur himself and had to give water in his wine, which was the subject of anti-terror.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naïve discussion with Iran, the premature withdrawal of his “young people” from Iraq, his indecision in Libya, which also gave him the reputation of weakness.
However, this attack is not quite so unforced.
The population is more likely to appreciate the positive balance of national security among Obama, who turned Bin Laden off.
Since Iraq, it has been guarding against military interventions that lead to paralyzing.
And Obama is more surprised by arguing that America needs to be rebuilt economically to restore its leadership to new life.
North Stream, New Gate to Russian Gas in Europe
The North Stream gas pipeline, which runs on the seabed of the Baltic Sea and connects western Europe directly to Russia, was put into operation.
It is intended to provide gas for an equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to celebrate this event with shine and Gloria.
Over 500 invited guests, including four heads of state and government, have attended the inauguration of the new Nord Stream gas pipeline, which links Russia and Germany directly to each other under sea level last Tuesday on the Baltic coast under orchestral sounding.
The German chancellor Angelika Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his colleague Mark Rutte from the Netherlands have symbolically jointly turned the control of the valve, which transports Russian gas into the western European network.
With the new gas pipeline, 27.5 billion cubic meters of additional Russian gases are to be delivered to Western Europe by a first pipeline of 1,224 km long, which connects the region of St Petersburg with Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
A second pipeline, which allows a total supply of 55 billion cubic meters of gas - the equivalent of French total consumption - is to be completed at the end of 2012.
And the eventuality of the construction of a third line can already be connected on its own route.
For Gazprom, the timely and precise completion of this enormous building acts like a victory.
The project was highly controversial in Poland and the Baltic States.
The Nord-Stream pipeline will allow direct gas delivery to Germany, while avoiding any route through third countries (Poland or Ukraine) on the land route.
For this reason these two countries lose a little of their power: for them it will now be more difficult to put pressure on Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
Warsaw, the most involved in the debate, was not reluctant to compare the North Stream pipeline with a \"new German-Soviet Pact\" in connection with the alliance between Hitler and Stalin in order to compare Poland's occupation in 1939.
This means that the topic is politically too sensitive.
Western Europe has gained even greater security of supply by supporting this Russian project.
However, this is at the expense of strengthening European energy, as the project has struck a gap between Western and Eastern Europeans.
In less than five years Russia has completed its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, western countries, which have strong gas consumption and whose gas reserves are nearing the end.
\"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us organically, confirmed François Fillon at the inauguration of the gas pipeline by pointing out the degree to which the major gas contracts are also important from a political and economic point of view.
All of this explains the broad smile of the Gazprom managers represented in Lubmin with regard to gas supply.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also an outstanding technique.
The underwater pipeline consists of steel with concrete coating to protect it from ship's anchorage.
It rests on the seabed, at about 200 m deep.
During its construction, minefields dated to World War II had to be phased out.
“There were hundreds of mines that had to be removed or destroyed, ” said Jens Müller, spokesperson of the Nord Stream Society.
In addition, increased measures to protect fauna and flora had to be taken.
The line is a long snake made of metal, heavy like 242 Eiffel Towers, which is interrupted by nothing over the entire length: neither by valves, nor maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned off the coast of Sweden, but the project managers took away from it, as Sweden had little pressure on a Russian state society to be permanently located at the level of its coasts.
“In the case of a havaria, we close the gas throughput in less than a minute,” said Jens Müller.
In the case of a leak, the gas in the gas pipeline escapes into the air.
However, this case is considered by the constructors to be only a little probable, as the sweating seams were estimated to be stable by a leak per 100,000 years.
The state monitoring of the gas pipeline is ensured by both an underwater robot, which is controlled by a seaship for external observation purposes, as well as by a device that circulates inside the gas pipeline.
It has the shape of a cigar, measuring one meter in diameter, is inserted into the inside of the pipe and continues through the gas pressure.
After three full days of forward movement through the line at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device provides the most accurate information on possible deformations of the metal upon arrival.
The gas pipeline was designed to function for fifty years without having to be subjected to only the slightest repair.
The gas circulation is simply guaranteed by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the entrance, 100 bar at the exit point.
Five companies have combined their forces to achieve this project.
However, the management remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
The German companies E. ON and BASF are also joined here (depending on 15.5%), as are the Dutch Gas Union and the French group GDF Suez (depending on 9%).
These five companies have formed a corporate community called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
It has its seat in Zug in Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then rented the entire capacity of its gas transport, on a renewable twenty-year contract.
\"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, no matter how large the real-carrying amount of gas falls off - specified Jens Müller.
The financing of the gas pipeline construction was secured to 30% of shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
Total labour costs should be EUR 7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For example, for GDF Suez, the investment amount was 240 million.
However, minority shareholders are aware of recovering their expenses, as Gazprom alone carries the risk of liability.
The gas pipeline enters a sandy coastal line forested with pine trees near Lubmin from the Baltic Sea.
The 4.5-meter-high valves form the gas exit gates.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the incoming gas before it is forwarded to the German gas pipelines.
Last Tuesday, this terminal has been supplied with a million cubic meters of Russian gas per hour.
With full capacity this would be 3 million cubic meters per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a brand notebook.
From an Italian company founded about fifteen years ago, Moleskine now wants to give the letter a new style.
It has a flair of adventure, at candlelight with the letter given hours.
Moleskine's notebook is easily recognisable, with its black, rectangular cover, its rubber band, the egg-shelled sides, as it has aged over time.
The Moleskine notebook, as it is known today, was created in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, which is based in Milan, decided at the time to put a discounted design notebook on the market.
Maria Sebregondi, then expert consultant of the company, is responsible for introducing the new product.
The notebook was inspired by an old-fashioned production technique called Mole Skin (Mulwurfshaut), which describes a cotton bag, which is used, for example, for covering up upholstery benches.
This type of notebook was very much asked by writers and travelers.
“Moleskine has revived an old and almost forgotten object that until the 20th century was considered an icon of avant-garde artists,” explains Maria Sebregondi, now brand responsible at Modo Modo.
Success occurs.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales rose by 26% and decreased by 12.7 million pieces.
This is far from the usual production of the first years in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine passes the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to create a phantom image of the buyers, as the notebook inspires businessmen as well as students and professionals.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitan, cultivated and open-minded customers.
The small Italian company, which initially had 12 employees, now employs over 100 employees and has two offices since 2008, one in Milan, the other in New York.
The company distributes its notebooks in bookstores, on Internet portals such as Fnac, in small boutiques of the city centres and is aware of persuading its identity.
“We have followed the spirit and his new need for writing, which despite the upswing of e-mails,” said Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural character move is accompanied by the development of Moleskine: Recently, the brand has launched an exhibition called \"Detour\" in which architects and artists exhibited their own notebooks.
In August, at the film festival in Locarno, the company also launched a band of leopard patterns.
Moleskine benefited from his success and cultural contemporary spirit and understood it to diversify his products: bags, schedule calendars, fillers, computer covers... The brand shows the entire range of articles.
A success that brings Neider to the plan: In autumn 2006, Modo Modo was purchased by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, today's Syntegra Capital, and thus launched a new chapter in Moleskine's history.
Why does the unemployment rate of disabled people remain at such a high level?
Approximately 19% of disabled people are looking for a job.
Today, the \"15th week of work for disabled people\" begins
Despite a deliberate public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate in disabled people is always twice as high as the average average: 19% against 9% of the total population.
Disheartening?
“No,” said Éric Blanchet, Director-General of the Association Adaptation, who set out the ‘week of work for the disabled’.
‘The progress made within fifteen years is significant,
\"At that time, the unemployment rate was not double, but three times as high.
“Non-destotrotz remains to do a lot,
However, it must be said that many obstacles remain for disabled people before they get a job.
The elderly are more often affected: 37% are older than 50 years (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% of them do not have an Abitur and only 10,000 disabled are among the 2.3 million students with higher education degrees.
Finally, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% of disabled people compared to 38% in the overall range.
In short, there are so many criteria that make it difficult to get back to work, and which make up the “core of the problem,” said Christian Grapin, Director-General of Tremplin, a association founded in 1992 that helps companies to acquire disabled workers.
So much to the actual brakes.
Keep the unspoken, the mental attitudes that are certain but develop slowly.
A study carried out in April by the Association of IMS-Entreprender for the magazine La Cité stated that the surveyed managers have \"a weak level of knowledge of disabled persons, which is \"overrepresented\" by persons in wheelchairs, mentally or intellectually disadvantaged persons\"
The result is that the private companies with more than 20 employees still have a long way ahead to achieve the employment target of 6% disabled people, which was set out in a 1987 law.
These last figures from 2008 refer to a quotient of 2.6%.
“We’re now at 3%,” reports Pierre Blanc, Director-General of Agefifh, the organization that is responsible for launching contributions from companies that disregard this law.
The evidence: the number of paying establishments has decreased as well as the sum of the amounts paid between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
“The 2005 Act, which provides for increases in contributions, created a strong pressure on companies, Pierre Blanc stated,
\"But this improvement also reflects a real awareness, particularly in large groups of firms,
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of the establishments employ between 20 and 49 people with disabilities, while companies with 100 to 199 employees employ 82%.
Hazard: \"What a luck\"
Even before they offered their foreheads the “Blue Tuesday evenings (20:45 p.m.), Eden Hazard and George’s Leekens did not have their pleasure that brought them the friendship game.
It would be too far-reaching to claim that there has been a secret agreement between them, but the image speaks symbolic volumes.
Sitting side by side on the stage of the Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden Hazard could have made peace and would have liked to make peace.
Five months after the temperamental gesture of his attacking player against Turkey, the Belgian national coach had received nothing but praise from his person.
“I am very pleased with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is a Belgian,
“I want to look forward, ” assures the native Liller on his part.
As for the contrast between his portrayal in Klub and Nationalelf, \"It is a unity that justifies everything\"
“I am in Lille all year round, which is not the case in Belgium,”
\"It's time for me to get started,
Hazard will come to Saint-Denis, led Friday evening against Romania with regard to the match against France, to finally \"glossify\"
However, without abandoning the note of pleasure.
The French national team has fired since the age of seven, and he led his victorious campaigns between 1998 and 2000.
“I was always supported, so he confirmed.
This necessarily helps to reinforce the \"unique\" character of this encounter even more.
So much in advance: “Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be present.
“We have just crossed the road,
“If they are allowed to play, it means great happiness,
Lekens, on the other hand, was struck with kindness, \"Stolz\" (Stolz).
“The pride of carrying out a galaxy.
“Stolz, also to confirm, in its capacity as a ‘neighbour’, that France has again become a team on a very high level, and that little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
“Laurent Blanc has done damn good work - he said excitedly.
Although Belgium will be missing in the next European championship, the technician is very likely to see the plane share with the Blues (the French National Self) ... and indeed direction Brazil in 2014.
“We little Belgians come out in a big way,” he stressed.
“We’re planning one thing, the players are ambitious, they’re hungry,”
“You will notice this in the upcoming games - the game against France involved.
Portugal very confident
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento, with great optimism, faces the backlash against Bosnia (22:00 a.m.) this Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the play, both teams had failed in the matter.
\"At the end of these 90 minutes we will be a happy team and above all a happy country,
Paulo Bento already sees himself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no doubt that \"La Selecçao\" will qualify for the 2012 European Championship for his national elf, for which he has been responsible since September 2010.
For Portugal, that means, in fact, only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there's a match to play, and serve an opponent, Bosnia.
In view of the play (0-0) on Friday in the Hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the dice have not yet fallen.
Portugal clearly dominated the party for more than an hour, but the team was unable to print the matter the so important stamp that would have taken the pressure from it.
\"This is a good result, but it is a certain risk, since we have not achieved a outward gate,
At home, however, in their brightly radiant city of de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to strike through to an audience that might be equally on the game, even if the party was announced, of course, as \"very scarce,\" said the optimistic but clearly-sighted Bento.
“We expect a very tight match, but are absolutely convinced to win the upper hand,” said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
“We still have a 50% chance to be at the 2012 European Championship, but the successor of Carlos Queiroz relative.
The disunity on Friday in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to achieve and win a goal.
A disembarkation can already satisfy the Bosnians, who also need a gate.
“This is a good result, but it is a certain risk, since we have not achieved an outward gate,” regrets Bento.
“We will compete against a team that has high technical qualities and has players with many individual qualities,” he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese would have preferred to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians at the beginning in order not to give them time to think,
A good idea, provided that it is implemented this time in fact.
