The Prague Stock Exchange falls into the minuses against the conclusion of business.
After the steep fall in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange was able to correct the losses.
Transactions with the shares of ČEZ reached almost half of the normal daily business.
At the beginning of Tuesday's business, the Prague Stock Exchange was due to the break-in from Monday, when it decreased by another six percentage points.
This time the reason for the breach was on Wall Street.
In the Czech Republic, too, the reaction of the market to the result of the vote of the American House of Representatives, which it refused to support a stabilization plan for the financial sector there.
Case of shares in Asia
A dramatic case was experienced on Tuesday in the stock exchanges in Asia, although the indices were able to offset some of the losses during the day.
The index of Hang His stock exchange in Hong Kong lost almost four percentage points during the business day, but later became part of the losses, thus reducing the decline to about 2.5 percent.
The Index Hang Sing China Enterprises, which observed the movement of Chinese shares on the Hong Kong stock exchange, decreased by 3.8 percent, Shanghai's markets were closed.
The shares on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent but then reduced the losses to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange decreased by 3.6 percent, according to the index there.
“The timing for the rescue action in the United States is uncertain and will affect financial markets worldwide,” said the head of the monetary authority in Hong Kong Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, although it belongs to China, determines its monetary policy itself, that is, regardless of the Chinese Central Bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are moving at the same level as those in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, American legislators should return to the negotiating table as soon as possible and adopt the draft financial system support.
Otherwise, other countries would also be affected by the collapse.
A bloodbath of American shares
On Monday, the American House of Representatives rejected the plan to support the financial system for which up to $700 billion (almost 12 trillion Kč) should be spent.
The legislators thus ignored President George Bush's call to support the plan.
Bush's view is that the plan would address the fundamental causes of the financial crisis and thus help to stabilize the economy as a whole.
The American shares experienced a bloodbath on Monday, and the most important stock indices recorded the biggest collapse in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones Index dropped by almost seven percent, a similar collapse he had recorded recently in 1987.
The index had already fallen before the vote, but there was hardly any sign that the draft would not be passed in the House of Representatives, the index experienced a free case.
Congress Makes Consent: U.S. government may pump $700 billion into banks
The Supreme Representatives of the American Congress and the Government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of agreement on financial assistance for the American financial system.
It is to be agreed at the beginning of next week.
In discussions on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of financial aid for the American financial system, the US legislators reached a breakthrough of $700 billion (about 12 trillion crowns).
However, this does not mean victory yet.
The Members of the Congress must negotiate some more details of the agreement before they can publish and vote on the final version of the law.
The financial system support plan will be negotiated in the American Congress on Monday.
On Sunday this was said by the Chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services Barney Frank of Reuters Agency.
According to the Senate, the plan could probably be agreed on at least at the earliest on Wednesday.
According to economists, a communication on the adoption of the plan should be the first significant psychological factor for the promotion of financial markets.
Afterwards, however, there is a \"encouragement\" based on the complicated mechanisms of how to help markets in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We have made significant progress.
We have clarified our differing views on how a package to stabilize the market should look - said the Democrat Nancy Pelosi to Bloomberg agency.
According to her words, there could still be a final vote on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislators met with American Finance Minister Henry Paulson on Sunday to give the government fund its final form.
This provides for the purchase of unsolicited mortgage assets from financial companies that would cause serious losses to financial firms and endanger the stability of the entire system.
“We are on the verge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and which must also be effective on the market.
You have to continue the health plan, but I think we're on the finish, Paulson says.
A signal for Asian business
The global financial crisis is also clearly falling in the stock markets, which are falling significantly.
According to the words of Nevada's democratic senator, Harry Reid, the legislators were trying to reach a final agreement even before Sunday in Congress.
This is to reassure investors of business on the Asian financial markets, which are in the first time zone where a decision by Congress could affect the business on Monday.
Until now, however, it is not quite clear when both chambers of the American Congress will vote on the law, nor is it clear whether the negotiations could still fail on a problem in the last minute.
The legislators hope that it will be adopted in the next few days.
But the law will be subject to some changes.
The total amount intended to help the system is to be divided into two parts.
The initial 350 billion dollars will be made available as soon as possible, as President George Bush called for.
The Congress, however, can block the disbursement of the remaining money if it has the impression that the program does not fulfill its function, for another $100 billion dollars and later the final $350 billion dollar.
Bush is positive about progress in negotiations
Although the President has a right to veto in this decision, the Congress may vote on his veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program remained that was based on obtaining funding for the purchase of poor mortgage securities whose value has fallen because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to repay their mortgages.
“We have worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on Sunday on the law, the Senate then on Monday, according to Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
The American President Bush was also pleased with the progress.
His spokesman Tony Frotto said that Bush was satisfied with Saturday's progress and \"estimate the mutual effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy\"
Limitation of golden screens
The chairman of the Senate's Banking Committee Christopher Dodd, the managing negotiators, stated that the legislators had agreed on a responsibility for the money programme, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the conclusion of discounts and a timetable for financing the plan.
The new law should also restrict the so-called golden umbrellas for directors of the companies involved in the programme and set up a committee to be responsible for monitoring the fund.
This is to lead the Ministry of Finance.
“We have worked very hard to make a big move towards an agreement that works and is important for the market and for all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also expects a help for homeowners who have problems with repaying their mortgage.
The government should negotiate new policies for mortgages that it buys, with the aim of reducing the monthly costs for debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological help
The proposed plan is a good idea according to Patria Finance David Marek's main economy, but implementation will be very difficult.
“And that’s because you don’t know by what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets are purchased.
This will be crucial for how the financial sector and the government divide losses among each other, said Marek to the iHNed.cz server this week.
Whether the plan is adopted now or at the beginning of next week, Marek’s view is not decisive.
“It is much more important for Congress delegates to agree to support the plan and to adopt it as soon as possible.
The psychological importance of the agreement on the fact that it comes to adoption is the most important thing at this moment - stressed Marek.
Duel on Messrs Cut: MP3 player against cell phones.
We will advise you in your choice
While almost every mobile phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can call yet.
That's why, of course, it looks like it's better to buy just one phone.
Despite all this, there are enough reasons why you should become an independent player.
The choice depends entirely on the type of use and the requirements of the future owner.
Certainly, you will find it hard to buy a great expensive record player at home to listen to the latest album by Maxim Turbulenc.
Once such musical innovations do not appear on LPs, and from a qualitative point of view there is no objective reason for them.
However, if you have LPs with Art Rock, Jazz or Blues in the shelf, you probably dream of such a thing.
So it is also simplified with music on trips, i.e. with compressed music - music in MP3 format.
There are also price and quality categories here.
For one, it may not be acceptable to issue eight thousand crowns for one player, but a pink-float fan is probably heavy headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes between which there is enough room for everyone.
The selection is wide-ranging.
The battery life is also crucial.
Some good music players can play much more than just music, but what phones can do they don't even create meaning.
No modern device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions, the phone call and the simsen, it can play music and videos, both record it, it has a better, once a worse camera and may also be able to navigate.
And if you still include the smartphones and communicators, you have almost a small computer in your pocket.
It's a little miracle, because no fridge can grill and no TV photograph.
But the universality of cell phones also brings disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your mobile phone, the more often you will have to reload it.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy lovers.
Few mobile phones can play music longer than ten and a half hours, most of the time it is much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest) are significantly more powerful.
That's why you should expect cheap phones to stop playing music for more than a few hours.
If you call occasionally, you'd prefer to buy a charger for the office for safety - which is also true for more expensive equipment.
With MP3 players you will not have this problem, even the less good keep at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation with one charge.
Another problem is if you want to play music over the phone.
Unfortunately, only a small part of the devices has a USB lock, and not every mobile phone can be connected directly to a PC without any special software.
Of course, you can play music directly on a storage medium, but only a few card readers will be finished without reduction with the tiny memory cards used in mobile phones.
For players you do not need any special software until exceptions (iPod).
You only need to feed the device through USB port with music from your PC.
Most mobile phones and players create a music library themselves, arranged according to the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, the genre or, for example, the rating by users.
Some devices only form the tree structure of the address directory, similar to Windows Explorer, some can both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent phones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobile phones can do more
When selecting a specific device, check out the battery life, storage capacity, quality and type of sound and, of course, operating comfort.
Is for you music above all scenes and listen to them every day just briefly, for example, in the tram, then an arbitrary phone that plays MP3 files.
What can really be almost any cell phone.
You also don't have to specifically check which music formats a cell phone or player can process.
MP3 create all, and most music you get will just be in this format.
The format is one of the most widely used and most devices can also play music in the WMA format.
Less common is AAC (a format that Apple and its iPods use).
Better phones also enable the purchase of music online.
You only need to access the corresponding pages of a provider (or another provider) via mobile internet, and you can already purchase a song or album.
This service can already be a striking argument in itself for why one should set up a music manual.
Unfortunately, the offer of the provider is bad and is mostly limited to fast radio hits.
Prices are also not the lowest.
In general, however, it is assumed that this kind of selling of music (be it via GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
The cell phone wears the most.
If you like to listen to something, grab the phone in the jacket bag while the player is forgotten at home.
It is important, however, whether you are always wearing headphones or at least a wireless speaking device.
If not, you can access the integrated speaker that has almost any mobile phone, but only the least MP3 player.
The most important advantage of music manuals will be for many.
The cheapest usually costs less than three thousand crowns.
For three and four thousand crowns you already get a very decent walkman.
The biggest handicap will be for most that no normal headphones are present.
The best and technically matured phones with a 3.5mm opening for normal headphones cost up to fifteen thousand crowns.
The player's advantage is in easy operation.
The simplest - and not necessarily cheapest (see selection) - player can really use anyone.
A minimum of functions, the similarity when operating with the previously normal cassette recorder or, for example, the record player is obvious.
It does not threaten collision in the form of a wrongly employed mobile Internet and a subsequent audit for data transmissions.
What device should you grab now
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable storage media (type M2, microSD etc.).
Even if you buy a corresponding card, there are two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
The basic models usually support only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive can also read 8-GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, then grab Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Engeton or irriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you do not have to put more than 1100 crowns on the table.
Listen to the more demanding listeners, prefer to take specialized cell phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have independent control buttons for MP3, and the operating comfort thus comes to that of a single MP3 player.
The widest point here is Sony Ericsson, whose mobile phones from the series Walkman have the same user interface as the individually sold MP3 players.
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours) provide you with MP3 players from the above mentioned manufacturers.
The first virtual provider comes to the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe.
The mobile phone market in the Czech Republic is quite mature, the Czech suppliers offer virtually all services, as they are also offered by their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, something is missing here - a virtual provider that forces the classics at lower prices.
Maybe this one won't be waiting for a long time.
We have often reported on Mobil.cz that Czech mobile operators are working among the most expensive in Europe.
This also confirmed the telecommunication authority ČTă, which drew attention to the fact that the price of SMS is higher here than in the rest of the European Union.
According to the European Commission's final steps in the regulation of roaming fees, a paradoxical situation is likely to arise - for some customers of Czech mobile communications providers, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
How is it that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, it lacks the competition that really makes a combat message.
Perhaps it sounds paradoxical, but there are three mobile networks in the Czech Republic and a penetration of well over 100 %.
On the other hand, mobile operators like to skim over the fact that there is extremely much competition in the Czech market.
The President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority, Pavel Dvořák, has often said that there is no room for another supplier in the Czech Republic in the past.
It is probably true that a classic provider with its own network no longer has a lot of opportunities (it would probably not find any frequencies at all).
There is, however, another possibility - a virtual provider.
Especially the entry of virtual providers into the mobile phone market brought a clear price reduction, to which the classic mobile phone providers had to respond.
Before the entry of such companies as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile, there were similar voices on the UK market as in the Czech Republic.
However, it has been shown that there is room for such providers and that they can be truly successful.
By the way, you don't need to look for examples for a long time.
In February this we reported on the launch of the virtual provider Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this provider managed to win more than 100 thousand customers and thus become the five largest supplier in the country.
Behind Mobilking is the Penta financial group, which has U:fon in the Czech Republic, among others.
The advantage of virtual providers is that one can focus on a much more concrete target group.
In order to function effectively, virtual providers need far less customers than a classic provider.
They do not need relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network.
In the world, virtual providers usually profile themselves as low-cost firms - they offer cheap phone calls and SMS, which is often accompanied by a less extensive service offer.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors.
However, as the example of mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be a pretty good move to put on a non-cliché-like target group.
This provider is aimed specifically at men.
“Real guys choose Mobilking - the provider they like and whom they can trust,” said David Seibert, CEO of the Mobile Entertainment Company, the operating firm of this virtual provider.
It is difficult to say whether a concept similar to that in Poland could be found in the Czech Republic.
Vodafone Miroslav Čepický's press speaker also doubts: \"The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment based on most virtual suppliers.
In addition, it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the offer of services,
In the Czech Republic chancenless, the mobile phone providers mean
However, it is almost certain that if a virtual mobile phone provider conquers the Czech Republic, this will not be Mobilking.
“We are talking about an expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not seem to be particularly hopeful.
It will be more likely to enter the market of Mobilking in other countries in our region, as said in a telephone call for Mobil.cz Jana Studničková, the press spokesperson of the Penta financial group.
Indirectly, it confirmed that the current mobile telephone providers in the Czech Republic are not particularly disposed of in this regard.
On the contrary, they try to do everything to ensure that no potential competitor arises.
For a long time now, their interest in launching a virtual mobile phone provider has been showing the GTS Novera group, which wants to take a further step towards becoming a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the field of corporate customers.
“We are very interested in offering our customers not only fixed network but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this possibility with all Czech mobile telephone providers.
With some of them, we were already able to reach negotiations progress, according to the press spokesperson of the Pavel Kaidl Group.
Maybe better times are coming.
Non-official information indicates that the first virtual provider may be expected by the end of the year.
Until now, however, this is surrounded by an invincible wall of silence.
“At this moment we do not assume that there is room in the Czech Republic for a full-scale virtual provider.
The Czech market has great specificities over other markets.
So far we have not yet addressed a subject with a complex and serious project in this field - says in his statement for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sršeň from the press department of Telefónica O2.
Other suppliers also point to the specifics of the Czech market.
The press spokesperson of T-Mobile Martina Kemrová adds in rare agreement with the O2 statement: “We haven’t yet found a viable and both-sidedly beneficial project that could be further built on,
And she adds: “The T-Mobile network will hardly open up a virtual provider until the end of the year.
At this moment, we must already have a specific offer to be able to think in the short term,
Vodafone focuses more on meeting the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický says: “We are open to negotiations with potential virtual providers, especially in the area of sharing costs and infrastructure.
We consider this from the point of view of our customers as the best.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to search for a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile Internet,
The responsible authorities - with the suppliers hand in hand
It is easy to understand how mobile telephone providers operate, another provider was called more competition, this would result in lower prices and thus also a decrease in profits.
Why, then, should market entry be facilitated by such a competitor?
The fact that providers can draw on a strand when it comes to something also demonstrates the long up and down of U:fon.
The probably strongest pressure towards ČTÜ was at the time U:fon entered the market, from the company T-Mobile.
This also demonstrates the publicly accessible information from the ČTă websites.
Now, however, U:fon is an argument as to why you should not allow a virtual provider.
Martina Kemrová commented: “The competitive environment of the mobile market has recently been strengthened by the entry into the market of a fourth mobile phone provider.
Taking into account the character of the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that a new player would make high demands on the market itself and, above all, its services,
However, in view of this approach by mobile providers, the Czech regulatory authorities are surprised by the absolute disinterest.
This is not just the attitude of the ČTÜ, which unfortunately, in Czech, in contrast to the UK and other highly developed countries, does not have the competence to intervene in economic competition.
It has only the office to protect economic competition (UOHS).
This, however, was a typical attitude to this whole problem.
\"The entry into the market of a virtual mobile phone provider would then be possible after a contract between a mobile phone provider and a virtual provider has come about by renting the necessary infrastructure.
No such contract has so far been concluded, as the offer of potential stakeholders was probably not sufficiently interesting for the classic providers - in his reply to our request Kristián Chalupa from the Department of External Relations of the UHOHS.
Representatives of the providers would not be surprised by such a formulation.
This is more than a concern by an authority representing consumer interests and, among other things, by ensuring that no one abuses its position on the market.
In particular, when Kristián Chalupa adds: “Towards where virtual providers work quite normally, it is to be observed that their market entry has contributed to a price reduction in mobile telephone services,
However, the pressure on the correct functioning of the market and a price reduction are probably not part of the interests of the UOHS.
In this case, really shocking is the almost already touching agreement of the three mobile telephone providers resulting from their reactions.
The question of whether it really is just a coincidence lies at hand.
Just as the absolutely same price of petrol at the gas stations is certainly just coincidence and the result of a hard competition.
‘The Authority has not detected any signs of action directed against competition in this case, and therefore it has no reason to intervene in any way in the matter.
None of the suppliers have a dominant market position, so he does not have the appropriate increased responsibility for his trade on the market.
The necessary tools for opening the mobile phone market for virtual providers are probably also missing from the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority - said Chalupa in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many conflicting points.
There is, of course, an analysis of the relevant markets, drawn up by the ČTă, according to which telecommunications from the point of view of economic competition is a single market.
In such a market, of course, none of the Czech mobile telephone providers have a dominant position.
However, some legal experts offer a different view - for the market entry of a virtual provider, the consent of the network operator is always necessary.
And the mobile phone provider - logically - has the monopoly for its network.
This means that it necessarily takes a dominant position in a particular segment.
However, even if you are not involved in this argument, it should be at least a warning for the UOHS that three mobile telephone providers are strikingly similar.
In doing so, complaints from a number of interested parties (including the company GTS Novera mentioned) prove that they encounter very similar obstacles when negotiating with all suppliers.
The transfer of responsibility to ČTÜ is then a fairly common trick in telecommunications services, with which the UOHS distances itself from the whole matter.
This has already been observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, in the recently adopted Novel of the Telecommunication Act, it has failed to enforce the extension of the competences of ČTу in the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of experts have promised to improve the situation.
It is only too well known by the representatives of the UHOHS, but they probably have other interests.
It's okay when no one looks.
The functioning of any pseudo-virtual provider, of which there are several in the Czech mobile networks, remains unobserved.
It is companies that issue their own price lists for mobile telecommunications services, but which are only partially public.
Usually these are companies that operate in the field of multilevel marketing.
Own mobile telephone services include Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others.
The price lists of these companies usually only come to the chosen ones.
The joke of the matter is that the company acts as a classic business customer to the operator, who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, he then receives special offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile telephone providers prohibit the re-sale of a similar made-up.
“If there are cases that you describe, then it can be a violation of the contractual conditions with which we will then deal, which can lead to a termination of cooperation with the corresponding company, Martina Kemrová answered our question about this problem.
However, it is quite unlikely that something like this will not get around to those responsible for the mobile service providers.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned, it can be thousands of customers.
However, no operator opposes such action.
In other words, the activities of these companies do not lead to negligible profits, but, unlike actual virtual suppliers, they are not affected by the actual official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický points out possible problems: \"The law allows such types of speculation, despite everything, the services of these companies are only used by a very small percentage of customers.
They must also accept that the SIM card on their phone does not run on their behalf, so they cannot have full experience of how the normal customers of the mobile phone providers are,
That alone, however, would have to happen at least strangely.
In addition, another question arises for the UHOHS.
Before such an operation, mobile telephone providers close their eyes, why do they lock themselves against a virtual provider?
It is added that the UOHS has quite strong competences to detect such activities, and if it does not, it does not have to be satisfied with the provider's statement, they do not know about it and their terms and conditions would prohibit it.
If the Czech Republic is no longer the most expensive
As has been stressed several times in the text, the market entry of virtual providers has resulted in a marked decrease in prices in the various services.
In this context, virtually all countries where virtual providers have emerged have tried to prevent classic providers from producing virtually more or less.
The arguments used by them were virtually identical - a too small, or too very saturated market, problems in the quality of services, etc.
In the highly developed countries, however, the regulatory bodies have just intervened in these moments, which did not in any way try to safeguard the interests of mobile telephone providers, but those of their customers.
Whether through formal measures or non-formal pressure, they achieved that the first virtual operator was created, and this followed further.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies tend to like a hot potato all the time.
On the basis of our experience, we cannot escape the impression that ignorance in the competences in these cases is more than favorable.
But we don't throw the flint into the grain.
If the background information is voiced and soon a virtual provider appears, the Czech mobile phone market may soon be moving again.
If a provider permits the creation of a virtual mobile phone provider, the UOHS will not remain inactive when it comes to rejecting other interested parties (to discriminate).
And the Czechs will finally no longer call more expensive than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Find the best out
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new recordings of the national anthem Where is my home country on the occasion of the day of Czech statehood in a celebration hour.
The hymn was replayed by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo singing, in choral version and in an instrumental version.
Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka took over the vocals.
The operators of the hymn versions are Otakar Yeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to all four versions.
For Bělohlávek, the Czech national song is one of the most beautiful hymns.
Earlier he had said to Czech radio that he chose singers with young, representative voices that are distinctive and popular for the solo variants.
“From the beginning, I tried with both and then with the choir to keep a clear dictation so that you could understand the text well so that it would be consistent - so the conductor.
The Czech national anthem will be its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov můj first sounded in 1834 on the stage of the Ständetheater in the original Czech piece Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl, the music was from František Škroup.
It became popular, and people spontaneously accepted it.
The first verse of the song became an organic part of the national anthem after the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
One of the seven State symbols remained after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
How does the \"new\" hymn sound?
On Wednesday, the Prague transport companies also travel to a chip for the first time
Wednesday, October 1, 2008, will enter the history of Prague’s transport companies as a date on which the first passengers enter a subway, tram or bus carrying an electronic coupon in the pocket instead of a paper ticket.
These can currently buy about a hundred thousand people who own the Opencard chip card.
The passengers can buy a 30-day, 90-day or annual coupon (validly from 1 January 2009) and be able to play it on their chip card at the same time, in the information centres and branches of the transport companies at the Muzeum subway stations, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
The coupons have been available via the Internet on the pages of the transport companies www.dpp.cz since yesterday.
The service was used by more than four hundred customers until the afternoon hours.
Those who use Internet sales can really forget the output window in the subway stations where they had to wait regularly for their paper tickets in long queues.
You buy the coupon over the internet, it is recorded on the open card in one of the thirteen branches of the city library.
\"At these places, a switch with trained staff is also available to the traveller, advises the interested person on the Internet purchase and also shows the coupon on the map, according to Martin Opatrný's spokesperson.
In addition to the libraries, the electronic coupons can also be played on the opencard on self-service machines, which are installed in some subway vehicles.
What do such machines look like?
They are red, reminding of car drivers, the passengers may already have noticed them in the subway stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
“There are currently five of them in the city, but until the end of the year it should be eighty - Opatrný adds.
The coupon controls an automatic instead of the driver
Operating the machines that will work from tomorrow is easy.
You only need to insert the chip card, and the previously purchased coupon will play itself.
The electronic coupons will not only apply in the capital from tomorrow, but also in the surrounding area.
So in the suburbs and on the bus lines with the numbers 300 to 499, with which the inhabitants of the municipalities of the region of Central Bohemia mainly enter the capital.
“In the trains which are part of Prague integrated traffic, the train attendants have reading devices with which they can check the validity of the coupons according to time and zone,” explains Filip Drápal of the Ropid organization. This organization compiles the schedules for the Prague transport companies.
The suburban buses have card readers at the checkout at the driver's desk.
When entering, the chip card must not only be shown to the driver, but the open card must be placed in a marked position on the side of the checkout.
This controls the validity of the coupons recorded.
“If a passenger is going to check the validity of the coupons recorded, nothing is easier than asking the driver for this information,” Drápal said.
A passenger who does not travel with suburban buses and no longer knows when the validity of the coupon ends can again go to the self-service machines where the coupons are played on the card.
Here the information on the validity of its documents is displayed on the display of the device.
The Sudetes demanded a popular decision from the United States
The Sudeten Germans had asked the United States to join the Bohemian Forest in 1945.
This comes from a letter stored in the collections of the South Bohemian scientific library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
With such a desire, in 1945, some groups of Sudeten Germans would have turned to the U.S. President.
This is reflected, among other things, in a letter that has been preserved in a private archive and is now kept in the collections of the South Bohemian scientific library.
The Germans of Krumau ask the American President in the letter that he should not allow the return of the \"Sudettengaus\" - taken on the basis of Hitler's Munich agreement - to Czechoslovakia.
“We understand the situation correctly and really want to be certain that the American units do not enter German territory as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators, it is in a letter signed with the words “people whose fate is at the heart of the South.
Since the connection to Czechoslovakia makes the Sudeten Germans - in knowledge of the Czech national character - suspect that they would expect brutality, carelessness, inconsistency, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American President to take over the protection rule over the Bohemian Forest for today and forever.
“We can’t believe that without regard to the view of a quarter of a million inhabitants of this area, you’re talking to a foreign country that is trying to suppress and eliminate minorities, and has just contributed nothing to the victory of the Allies,” read the letter.
The reason why writers cannot sign is said to be the fear of revenge by the Czech oppressors.
If the U.S. President raised doubts about the attitude of Bohemian Germans, it would be sufficient if he were to initiate a popular decision in the Böhmerwaldgau as to whether the inhabitants would be part of the United States or wanted to live under the United States' protection rule.
Although the text of the letter may sound somewhat naïve in today's knowledge of post-war history, it does, in the opinion of some witnesses, draw a good picture of the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at that time.
Even though the Bohemian Germans had to at least imagine that they would negotiate their deportation from the Republic, only a few of them had such a possibility at all.
Some were waiting for the United States and Great Britain to negotiate a kind of autonomy for the Sudetes.
Still others believed they could just stay in Czechoslovakia.
It also confirms the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who comes from Budweis.
He was assigned to the Navy on the Baltic Sea in the war as Budweiser Deutscher.
When he came to British prison at the end of the war and he was taken to Holstein in a prison camp, dozens of other Bohemian Germans came to him and he was to teach them Czech.
“They believed that if they got home, they would pass the Czech way,” Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners of war who had lived in Czechoslovakia before the war were expected to be expelled from the Republic on the basis of the Beneš decrees.
Don't think - pay!
An emotion-loaded campaign is aimed at drivers
The most expensive action on road safety in Czech history.
In this way, the emotion-charged media campaign could also be characterised, which the Ministry of Transport wants to start on Wednesday.
The authority of Minister Aleš ƿebíček promises to deduct drivers from dangerous behavior behind the steering wheel.
The campaign for 150 million crowns will run on television, radio, cinema, the Internet, but also on flyers.
She's supposed to take the drivers from too fast driving and alcohol at the wheel.
And they also remember to dress before going on a journey.
The campaign mainly wants to talk to young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, not least, professional drivers.
And what's shown in the spots?
Especially stories of people who appeal to emotions.
The \"bloody\" slogan of the entire campaign also bears witness:
Don't think - pay!
The words \"don't think\" are on a signboard in capital letters.
And then, in a blood laugh, the word \"pay\" is \"pay\"
This should mean that one can pay for a moment of care with one's own life.
The spots will shock the viewers until 2010
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can see normal images with drastic recordings of accident victims.
It is promised that the number of accidents and the number of deaths on the Czech roads will fall.
The spots were compiled by the Euro RSCG Agency.
Sugar bread and pie for drivers
“The motto of sugar bread and pie is valid for drivers.
Sugar bread means that if they ride in red, they save time, for example.
The whip is then the threat of a penalty or an accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk, according to the traffic psychologist of the hospital Na Homolce Martin Kořán.
And that is why information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertising are necessary, says the psychologist.
Even less effective, in his opinion, are tables that draw the drivers' attention to a danger.
“If you pick up a static table that warns against danger, it will probably soon be left with the surrounding area, and the drivers will no longer see it,” Kořán says.
Olmert would return almost all occupied areas in exchange for peace
The President of the provisional Israeli government of Ehud Olmert spoke out for the return of virtually all areas occupied in 1967, including Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan highs if one could conclude peace with Palestine and Syria in exchange for that.
He emphasized this in an interview printed on Monday by the daily Jediot Achronot.
“We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) areas, if not all,” said Olmert to the newspaper.
“We keep a certain percentage of these areas, but we will have to make a similarly high percentage (Israeli) to the Palestinians, because there will be no peace without this,” he added.
He admitted that any return would include Easterusalem.
“The one who wants security in Jerusalem and especially doesn’t want tractors or bulldozers to roll over his legs, as it happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up on some of Jerusalem,” observed Olmert in an admonishment to two attacks in the city in July where several people were killed and dozens of people were injured.
According to the Premier, it will be necessary to find a “special solution for the temple citizens and sacred and historic places” located in the territory of the old town.
“The one who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work - he further confirmed.
Subtraction from Golan highs
Olmert spoke out of the Golan highs for a withdrawal of Israel, which he believes is an essential condition for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Syria.
However, this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
\"My proposal is not to make peace with Syria alone and on the basis of a deduction from the Golan highs, Olmert affirmed.
“The Syrians know only too well what they have to give up in order to get back the Golan highs.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship to the Hisbollah movement; they will have to give up the constant support they give to the terrorism of the (Schiitish) Hamas movement, the Al-Khaida terrorist network and the jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq, the Prime Minister.
Questions about the accident: Are stewards illegal on the bus?
The law does not know them, in a long-distance bus, the circulation is not permitted
In connection with the tragic accident of a bus of the Society Student Agency near the Italian Padua, the question arises whether stewards and travelers may walk in and out of the bus during the trip.
“If we were to comply strictly and formally with the law, then the activity of a steward would be contrary to the law on road transport,” said the spokesman of the Department of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The accident, in which a twenty-two-year-old stewardess died last week, was probably caused by the driver of the truck crossing the bus.
The young woman was at this moment at all trouble next to the driver, at the least safe place in the car, although she had two more seats available.
However, a bus may also have an accident or brake sharp at the moment when the steward wears coffee or newspapers.
It also plays a role in whether the bus is equipped with the vehicle letter after standing.
If this is not planned on the bus, the travelers must sit.
Student Agency's long-distance buses have no standing places; what Radim Jančura, director of the company, confirmed against Aktuálně.cz.
“We discussed this with the Ministry, and this did not at first agree with the movement of travelers.
Later this was taken back, and we reached a consensus that travelers may go to the toilet while traveling, if they have their seat, and he gave his point of view.
The law does not know a steward
\"There is no clear legal interpretation for the role of a steward - no legislation describes this role.
However, there is also no legislation prohibiting the carrier from providing services.
The law on road transport only knows the term vehicle companion; however, its rights and obligations do not define it, the spokesman of the Ministry of Hanzelka clearly adds.
On the other hand, the director of the Department of Road Vehicles of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorný, believes that the law covers this problem in a subsequent way.
\"It is important whether the bus also has standing places in the product approval.
That's all then, he emphasizes.
Buses are divided into city buses, where there are standing pitches and the maximum speed is limited, busses with standing pitches and a higher allowed speed and long-distance buses with the highest permissible speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
As in the plane, the expert says.
The BESIP company for road safety Jaroslav Hořín sees no fundamental problem in the movement of stewards on board a bus.
“In the case of a liquid vehicle there are not many dangers, the situation is comparable to the service on board an aircraft.
Even here is not sure when turbulences come, and the stewardess can kick its head,
“But if a bus breaks sharply, then the laws of physics apply.
Just like in the city bus or in a tramway.
The security of stewards must be clarified by internal regulations, he says, and he also believes that this problem is not completely resolved from the point of view of the law.
Jančura is willing to delete the services
Student Agency offers Stewards services as the only bus company.
The company employs about two hundred people in this function.
The Director does not consider her profession to be risky even after the accident.
“But as soon as I get the impression that the steward’s profession is risky, I’ll delete him.
Coffee and newspapers can get passengers on board.
That would also reduce costs - he thinks.
As an interest in security, the director of Asiana Alexej Litvin explains the lack of stewards in his buses. However, his company operates only a fraction of lines compared to Student Agency.
“We don’t have stewards’ seats, but we’ve been resisting from the beginning.
Sooner or later, this ends with some fatal accident - he had not spoken for Týden.cz a year ago.
That was an incredible tragedy.
A young stewardess from the Pilsen region, who had worked for two years for the company, died in the accident of a line bus to Naples.
The Slovenian truck was probably off the track without flashing and had blocked the bus.
The driver of the bus tried to deviate through a sharp maneuver, but collided with the right front part with the truck.
Jančura argues that the two seats for the stewards had been sold.
“These places cannot be reserved for remote connections, they are blocked,
Company wants to sue truck drivers.
With compensation for the young woman's family, the Agency will not wait for the court judgment, but will also expect a financial compensation from the guilty.
A law change?
Not in View
A more precise regulation of Stewards' movement on board a bus could bring about a legal regulation on which a thirty-member expert team of the Ministry of Transport has been working for more than a year.
\"This, however, has not yet reached a concrete conclusion.
Buses are also not necessarily on the agenda, but rather the point system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile phones on the journey - according to expert Hořín.
“The Ministry of Transport does not consider the stewards’ activity to be something that could significantly jeopardise the safety of travellers,” said Hanzelka, with the control of the safety of buses in the competence of police and the occupational safety authorities.
Düsseldorf's hopes rest on Frankfurt
In the letter from the WestLB Board of Directors to the employees of the house, it is not missing.
By bringing together units of the Düsseldorf monetary institute with the Frankfurt deca bank, “the central capital market house of the Sparkassen financial group” could be created, it is said in the letter that became known on Monday.
The WestLB introduced a \"competence block\" with sustainable yield into such a business.
Such a connection could be the decisive starting point for further groupings in the Landesbanken sector.
This is how it reads when a board wants to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times.
Because the proposed WestLB is still under tremendous pressure.
Not only by the EU Commission, but also by the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Institute, which only recently made it clear to the North Rhine-Westphalia State Government that it was time to find a solution to the future.
A connection between the Deka bank, which savings customers know about its investment funds, and the WestLB has been talking about for some time - also on Frankfurt.
While deca bank chief Franz Waas had known of the end of August when presenting the half-yearly figures, he saw no point in a merger of the house on Mainzer Landstraße with a land bank, such as the Helaba or the WestLB.
However, the Board of Directors of the Deca, each half owned by the Landesbanks and the Sparkassen Associations, has instructed the Board to hold talks with the WestLB on joint business activities.
It could be about the capital market business or parts of it.
The talks have of course, it is called the financial centre, just begun.
The Deka Bank, which is one of the most important employers at the Frankfurt Finanzplatz, with its 3000 employees, is not the first time to talk about consolidation in the Sparkasse sector.
In 2003, it looked as if the deca bank could merge with the Rhineland-Palatinate and the Helaba State Bank.
But there was nothing out of this triennial.
Soon the plans had become public, and the Hessian state government opposed Helaba's participation in them.
Even the two other houses did not then find each other.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz went to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart instead.
But there have always been games of thought about a connection of the deca bank with land banks.
Günther Merl, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Helaba, had, however, recently expressed himself against plan games about joining his house.
Regardless, however, the knowledge seems to mature that the different houses of the public-law sector need to be brought together.
Now that the Landtag election in Bavaria is over, the first thing to do is to link BayernLB with the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.
For the Helaba this is not necessarily a good message.
Should the pressure rise to further mergers, they will gradually go out to the partners for it.
In the south, she would only be a junior partner, even though the financial crisis has so far been much better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
In turn, the Sparkassen- und Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen, which is involved in the Helaba with 85 percent, set a line at the beginning of the year.
At least the North LB remained.
However, such geostrategic considerations are only one side.
On the other hand, the question is how the different business models of the individual houses fit together.
In June Merl said the crucial question of what business model should guarantee the future of the Landesbanks had not been answered by the German Sparkassen and Giroverband.
In the end, the West LB could also be disintegrated, although it is not desired to do so.
This is also the case in the letter from the board of directors there, that there will definitely be an \"total solution\" for the house.
How this can be done with the joining of individual entities with the deca bank under a hat will still be shown.
The second weekend of the meadow is known as the \"Italian weekend\"
For Elena it is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena is his girlfriend, and everything is different, he says.
Behind them, at the five-liter beer barrel of the Kaiser brand, there is a massively built beartiger and proves the about 200 oktoberfest traveler, which deep tones can produce his throat.
Elena first gives Luca a clap, then a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here, the bus park next to Puorta Nuova station, start at 23.45 p.m. four buses, \"destinazione Monaco, steta della birra - arrival expected 6.30 p.m.
Three buses are mainly reserved for Italians, only Brazilians travel on a bus.
In a corner of the parking lot, the South Americans sing beside their flag already, they have already celebrated at night.
And so loud, Marco Guarda says it's nothing for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with furcimitate lining and a glasses with wide silver irons, includes the buses.
For five years they have been going to the October festival, three tours are all this year.
At night, during the day on the meadow, at 2.30 p.m. back.
Night would only mean unnecessary spears, says Marco.
75 Euro costs the journey, the welcome drink with Kaiser-Bier, married to the Bavarian purity bid, health insurance and the German-speaking tour guide Marco has attended a language course in Frankfurt - including.
And already the buses roll in the night, on the Autostrada towards “Brennero”
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly, it will be quiet on the bus, the travelers sleep.
Well, they'll still need their powers.
In Brixen and Holzkirchen there are several other buses with Italian signs on the 8th motorway just before Munich.
When Marco's group finally arrives at the car park near Theresienwiese at half past seven in the morning, there are already 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco holds a last speech, explains the attack plan.
First, set up the yellow cup.
On it is left - Octoberfest - in Fractur, next to the internet address of Marco's travel agency: \"conoscersiviaggiando.it\"
Secondly, \"When the doors go up to the beer tent, it's called running,\" Marco calls in the morning.
“Run - run and occupy the seats in the rear part of the tent.
“Not in front, otherwise we block, and not distribute all yellow hats on the same benches, in the room,
The measure, Marco brawls, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget drinking money.
“The security people show that we behave well!
As soon as you leave the squares, they're gone.
Third, \"Today's evening item half eleven again in here - minds?
And it's going to the meadow.
On the way, a yellow cap binds to the trees, to signs and even to the election poster of a large Bavarian People's Party.
You want to be armed for withdrawal.
It is the second weekend of the meadow, known as the \"Italy Weekend\".
There is no precise information on figures; the talk is of 50 000 who are going over the Alps and entering the beer tents, ten percent of all visitors are supposed to be extra from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police are reinforced by seven police officers from South Tyrol, Italian volunteer helpers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which conducts a national statistics in which the Italians before British (about 60 operations) and Austrians (about 80) with about 200 medical services occupy the first place.
The farm is particularly popular with Italians.
Sleepless Nights for Believers of the Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system was relatively stable, emphasised Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück only during the past week.
How good that the politician used the word “relative” and also influenced that the German banking sector would not be spared from the crisis-related developments.
Because it has now entered the weekend.
The Munich real estate funder Hypo Real Estate (HRE) noted in the Dax receives a billion loan from a consortium of German banks to shield themselves from the turbulence on the markets.
One person familiar with the situation said to Reuters on Monday, the loans amounted to up to 35 billion euros.
The Hypo Real Estate should only interest the part that it also claims.
The money comes from both private and public-law banks.
Background are losses with the daughter Depfa.
According to a newspaper report on long-term projects for which he has lent money, the state financier had refinanced extremely in the short term - which is no longer possible due to the lack of confidence in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's bar reserve was reduced by 95 percent to EUR 2.37 million, and the equity ratio had also slightly declined from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
The current income and net income from financial transactions had fallen to zero compared to the previous year, the income from subscriptions to claims and certain securities as well as the resolution of credit business provisions fell by more than 70 percent to EUR 5 million.
Only because of higher revenue from refunds of downstream accounting costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa Group as well as from the reimbursement of interest in accordance with the tax regulations and from the management of the business for group companies, the profit minus was still moderated by around 16 percent.
After its privatisation in 1990, the former state financier had initially speculated with commercial property loans, which had then been distributed in the Aareal Bank.
Because they earned too little in classical state funding, Depfa had then become more committed to infrastructure projects and to financing community projects of private investors and the state (private public partnership, PPP) and internationally diverse.
On the value of the daughter, the Hypo Real Estate must now make depreciations that will have a “essential material effect” on the group’s profit and loss account, it is quite undetermined.
The fact is that the dividend has been deleted.
As early as 2007, it had been cut by two-thirds.
The Hypo Real Estate has been a major public and infrastructure funder since the Depfa acquisition.
It is more dependent than other institutions on the refinancing of the interbank market as it has no customer deposits.
With the collapse of the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, lending among the banks is again largely offset as the banks horde their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs a part - around 50 billion euros - of Depfa's credit portfolio for short-term refinancing each year.
According to the Hypo Real Estate, the Group's financing needs are covered by credit for a foreseeable period of time and the company is shielded from the influence of the currently largely functional international money markets.
From other sources it can be heard that thanks to the funds the refinancing was secured by the end of 2009.
On the other hand, HRE Chairman Georg Funke stated that the Hypo Real Estate Group will no longer have to use the money markets for a foreseeable period of time.
Bundesbank and the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Institute (BaFin) assume that the marketability of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now secured.
This stands to hope for shareholders and creditors of the bank.
But in view of the dynamics and inevitability of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even inconceivable that financing should not be fully used.
But the opposite is also true.
After the late Sunday evening of the meeting after the bank was still ahead of insolvency, the minimum temporary rescue could not calm the mothers.
The share price breaks by 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
On the other hand, the interest rates are quite good.
If the priority debt is hardly shown, the rates of the subordinate bonds are more clearly reflected.
In particular, the bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo are concerned and understandably the maturitys that go beyond 2009.
If hypo-real estate bonds appear to be a speculative investment alternative, their value must be considered as dependent on the stability of the international financial system, following the sharp deterioration of the banking crisis and the institution itself, which had only brought the crisis into the home with the adoption of the Depfa.
As long as the central banks, governments and less-influenced business banks are still ready to support the system, a temporary payment of pensions can be made.
Or it happens, what hardly anyone dares to hope at the moment - that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the fact that the reports translating with the Landing of the Lands, the probability of security has now become only a legitimate hope.
This is likely to prepare long-term believers some sleepless nights to decide whether to separate themselves from their engagement.
Short-term investors may, after all, use a final cut to form a loss bid for future payment tax payments on price gains later in the year.
Sylvana and the Secrets of the Bento Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, is to introduce himself to Tachibana High School on the first day of school, the girls begin to kick: German is totally kawaii!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas - in the new exchange log she tells about Japan.
“The first day of school in Japan.
I was excited.
I had a tree before school.
I live on the edge of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and drive 40 minutes by train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way alone, I didn't have to go.
The beginning of class at Tachibana does not seem as strictly defined as at our home in Lower Saxony.
From 8 p.m. on, the students trundled in until at twenty-nine a short meeting round begins with the teacher, the 'home room'.
But before the class began, I was on the line to introduce myself.
I'm not the guy who likes to talk to people, even in front of a class of 40 students.
Because I didn't have a school uniform yet, I put on an old skirt of my host's mother, including blouse, blue ankles and black leather shoes.
So in this elevator I put myself in front of the pull and tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - I'm called Sylvana, come from Germany and have a birthday in a week.
At the moment I was very happy that I had started to learn the language about two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class have all confused, tickled and grunted, and I have heard the word “Kawaii”.
I already knew that from my mangas.
It belongs to the surviving vocabulary of Japanese girls and means 'low, sweet'.
Then I quickly went to my place.
The girl next to me has quite a broad border, she found it an honor that the exchange student should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was pretty quiet, but when the Gong was sounding, I was bombarded.
Everyone talked to each other and kicked and asked me holes in the stomach - it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
During the break, all of them picked up their Bentos.
My guest mother had made me such a lunch box - that's a bit different from the old German break bread.
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, salad of cucumbers and algae, fruit and a kind of meat in the tofu coat.
I usually don't have a pale shimmer, what exactly I eat here in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely new.
It says everything's really delicious.
Well, up to the salty plums, maybe, bro!
The Bentos are not just lunch at Japanese schools.
It sometimes happens that a girl gives a boy a self-prepared bento, which she then makes particularly artistically - hoping to get to know the boy at the pause snack.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I'm excited if I can watch this.
'Why Japan?' my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school for a year in Tokyo.
I've always said:
“Because I’m fascinated,
After all, I've been reading Mangas for years.
And in order to understand the comics and culture in it better, I also started to learn a bit Japanese.
So it was perfectly clear to me that I had to travel here someday.
Because I also have a fable for tradition, customs and customs.
And it's a great deal of value here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I haven't felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen,
Rats also have feelings
A rat or a sheep flees in danger means that it feels fear too?
The neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced: many animals also have feelings.
Just how could one check if they feel the same if they behave similar to us?
For several years, famous scientists have been publishing their contributions in the Internet magazine, Edge.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents selected answers to the question in a series “What do you think to be true without being able to prove it “
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness, without me or anyone else being able to prove this so far where we cannot even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case we may hope at least because all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we turn to other species and raise questions of feeling or general awareness, we enter immutable terrain because the hardware is not consistent.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: it kills, flees or attacks.
People behave similarly, from which some scientists conclude a similar subjective experience.
I don't think so.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
On the one hand, the circuits associated with the human consciousness include the lateral prefrontal cortex (because of its participation in short-term memory and in the execution/control functions).
This broad region is much higher in human beings than in the other primates and seems to be completely lacking in other creatures.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness, which depend on the prefrontal cortex, including the knowledge of who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is therefore reason for the assumption that man is even different from the other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity is likely to lie in the linguistic nature of man: since a large part of his experience is associated with language, it often means consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness does not depend on language, it would certainly influence it, so that animal consciousness, as it may be, may well differ greatly from most of our states of consciousness.
It is therefore difficult to determine what consciousness may look like in other animals.
If it can be analyzed as something internal and subjective, neither because of the special hardware, based on our own experience, its research presents us with major problems.
Most of my statements refer to the content of conscious experience, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that might be more easily accessible scientifically.
One could examine the consciousness processes of animals without regard to their contents, and this is exactly what happens in studies of the short-term memory of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
But in this approach, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed, one relies more on the neural correlates of consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: both may be identical or not.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal cortex to the state of visualization.
What is the result for feelings?
I lead them back to the fact that an emotional system such as that of fear is activated in one's own activity conscious brain.
So what we refer to as “fear” is the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the brain-localised immune system (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) proves working memory.
Thus, feelings are closely tied to the regions of the cortex, which characterize primates and, in particular, humans.
Connected with linguistic nature results in fine grades of feeling, because with the help of words and grammar we can differentiate and categorize states in order to attribute them alongside ourselves to others.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that feelings arising from more primitive activities in the cortex and brain stem regions are similar to Jaak Pankseep, but they focus more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed very much during the course of human evolution, it could well be involved in cross-border feelings.
I can't contradict purely theoretically, but consider it to be unproven.
Pankseep argues that what appears to be fear among rats and people is likely to feel the same way in both cases: But how can one check whether rats and people feel the same when they behave similarly?
A sheep flees at risk if it feels fear too?
In my eyes, mere behavior-likeness cannot prove any equality of experience.
Although neural comparison continues to help: Rats and humans have similar brain strains, sheep do not even have a brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for feelings?
And even if you could prove this to people, how did you want to prove it in rats?
I believe that rats and other mammals, perhaps even sheep (who knows?), have feelings.
But I didn't know how to prove it.
And because their feelings are probably fundamentally different from those of us (because human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I rather explore emotional behavior than the emotional feelings of rats.
In any case, progress at the neural level is likely, if the same is needed in rats and humans.
As I do not explore language and consciousness in rats, nor do I have feelings, I do not know if they exist.
You may think that's short-sighted, but I'd rather get ahead than constantly running against a wall.
I'm just a practical emotionalist.
Uefa President Platini: Term of grace for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Wasjunik said that the preparations would soon be under the direct responsibility of the President and Prime Minister.
\"The government sees Uefa's decision in Bordeaux as a proof of trust in Ukraine and its ability to organise EM together with Poland, said Wasjunik.
“But this is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still much to be done in both countries,
In the timetable for building or rebuilding the stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, the two hosts are behind.
Perhaps even the number of EM stages is reduced from eight to six.
“We can’t waste time anymore.
We now have to work at the highest speed - said Ukrainian Association President Grigorij Surkis.
\"The UEFA will keep us constantly in mind,
An even more radical step was decided in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish Association PZPN has been suspended by the National Olympic Committee after numerous scandals and replaced by independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission met at the request of Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There was “the serious danger that the PZPN would not be able to act according to the rules,” said Drzewiecki of the Polish news agency PAP.
“We have assured Uefa President Michel Platini in a letter that the preparation for the 2012 EM will not suffer below,
Several firstligists had been sentenced to forced descent for manipulation in the past season alone, and finally even the start of the league had to be postponed in the short term.
Denied Dennis Quaid Succeeds
She wanted to promote a new film, spoke in the interview about privates - and now has trouble with the ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan outlawed her fiancée Dennis Quaid as a spouse.
The foam - and beats back.
Late Rosenkrieg at the ex-husband Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, both Hollywood actors are now wearing an unpleasant fight with each other - in public.
In an interview with the U.S. magazine InStyle last week, Meg Ryan had said for the first time about the reasons for the marriage failure: “I had been unfaithful for a long time, and that was very painful.
The extent of the fraud they have experienced only after divorce.
The reason for the soul triptease was Ryan's press work for her new film, The Women, which tells the story of a adultery.
Dennis Quaid’s reaction to his outing as an unfaithful husband was clear: “Unhappily - be it, the 54-year-old of the “New York Daily News” said that “Meg continues to recoup and recoup the history of our relationship,”
It is also regrettable that the 16-year-old son, Jack, is reminded in public of the pain and upheavals that mean divorce for every child,
While Ryan has been living alone since divorce, Quaid is married again and recently became father of twins.
And so close his admissions with the side bar: “My life goes on anyway.
I am happy that I have a wonderful family that is doing the best possible.
Prices for tickets and hotels fall
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, flights according to a current study were even cheaper up to 50 percent.
Flights and nights in hotels have again become cheaper - this is the result of a study by the travel and financial service provider American Express.
The company analysed its booking data from the first half of 2008 and found a significant break in the second quarter following a rise in prices in the first quarter.
After years of rising prices on the hotel market, the nights have already been approved in many places.
From January to March, prices in 41 out of 48 European cities surveyed increased by an average of 6.9 percent compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
The most significant was the trend in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
As a cause of this, American Express sees the weak dollar rate that has led to a \"declining desire for travel from American tourists\".
Also, financial positions such as Frankfurt or London were more affected by the decrease in hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city the hotel prices with an increase of 26.3 percent even keep the record in Europe.
Even in the case of flight prices, the trend in the first quarter was still up:
Because of the kerosene improvement, travelers in the Economy class had to pay 7.1% more on average than 2007, fuel-intensive long-distance flights even cost up to 29.2 percent more.
From April to June, prices for Economy class flights fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but in the business and first class prices were much lower.
In Germany, prices were even stronger than in other European countries:
From January to March prices had risen by 11.9 percent, and in the second quarter they decreased by 23.6 percent.
According to the study, prices have even been halved on German domestic flights.
On the one hand, the reason for the price collapse was the slowing economic growth, explains the company.
Demand in many segments of the airline travel market is crumbling.
On the other hand, the Open-Skie Agreement liberalizing air transport between the United States and Europe has increased competition pressure.
Signs of the tense situation were the removal of unprofitable routes with airlines, as well as the high number of airlines who had registered bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - these were 24 airlines in Europe alone.
HSV beats Gladbach 1:0
With a gate and simple methods, the Hamburger SV becomes a table guide.
At the borussia, Luhukay is still unable to find a functioning elf.
By Kristffer Klein enlarge break landing for national player Marko Marin.
The Gladbacher came into play only late and failed with a lever on the latte.
His message was precise, she went over his lips convincingly.
He simply knew he was right.
“We need the second gate,” said Hermann Rieger in the cabin passage of the Hamburg Arena.
Much was not going on in the catacombs, the half-time break was over and most sat back on their seats.
Rieger was HSV's physiotherapist for nearly three decades, enjoying a higher view than some festered actor.
And so his request also found hearing in responsible place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and raised the thumbs.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg's chief coach Martin Jol.
That command will have been heard similarly: Here with Gate two!
The implementation was delayed.
“There wasn’t everything nice to watch today,” Marcell Jansen later admits.
Bastian Reinhardt, too, would have wished it to be \"resisted\"
The 1:0 (1:0) Hamburgers owe the headball hit of Mladen Petric (11th); and the fact that very weak Gladbacher could not hurt the weak Hamburgers.
“It was a dirty victory, ” Martin Jol consummated.
The Hamburg SV will be 121 years old this Monday.
On Saturday afternoon, the spectators already celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the flash table on the video wall, which showed their association as class primus.
It will be a birthday without a real party.
“We know how to order this,” said Marcel Jansen.
He acknowledged that the table-by-text intermediate is more for the unpredictability of the League than for the dominance of its HSV.
The team, with their late commitments - the Brazilian Neves and Silva, the goalkeeper Petric and Jansen, who was disbanded from the FC Bayern - is slow, but they can't shine yet.
“We need more flair and more dribblings - called Jol.
After the vote, the vote was taken.
Wall Street's scary.
First news of the failure of the rescue package temporarily broke Dow Jones by 700 points.
This was the biggest loss of points within one day in his history.

No title could be added.
Bank Goldman Sachs's shares accounted for nearly ten percent.
Only a few days ago, Large Investor Warren Buffett had participated in the company.
As part of the rescue plan, funds are to be made available for the purchase of 'falsified mortgage papers'.
However, the sum should not be paid for a blow, but gradually.
In return, the State should receive stock options certificates from financial companies that could be triggered in the event of the corresponding price developments in order to reduce the burden on the government cash market.
Share rates in Europe and the USA in the downwards
The billions of banks in Europe and the US do not settle the doubts of investors.
The share price of the German Grossbank Hypo Real Estate drops and the dax goes down.

Dark matter affects flight from space probes
For many years, a mysterious phenomenon in research has caused a lack of advice: Dark matter affects the speed of space probes during so-called swing-by-manufacturing.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity could not be quite correct.
Almost 18 years of space, the \"Ulysses\" probe flowed through space.
Because of soon freezing fuel lines, you are now threatening cold death.
For years a mysterious phenomenon among scientists has caused confusion - the swing-by-anomaly.
The Swing-by is a flight maneuver of space probes where they receive additional vibration in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as the Earth.
This allows the probes to save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the sun probe Ulysses.
What has puzzled the researchers for years, however, is that the aircraft does not behave 100 percent as expected according to the old-fashioned law of gravity.
Rather, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes are expected to be faster or slower.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
They baptized him swing-by-anomaly.
Some experts fear that perhaps even the general theory of relativity Albert Einstein, which describes the attraction of matter by a curvature of space, might not be quite right.
American physicist Stephen Adler from Princeton Institute for Advanced Study still firmly believes that Einstein did not err, and tries to explain the swing-by-anomaly using the so-called dark matter that astronomers in the universe have made.
“Responsible for the anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be very close to the Earth,” he writes.
Space researchers only know about the existence of dark matter for about ten years.
It is obvious from her that there is an attraction that can be observed in other celestial bodies.
It itself, on the other hand, is completely invisible, that is, it sends and reflects no electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
After the calculations of the scientists, the dark matter, after all, makes up well a fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
In Egypt kidnapped tourists are free
After ten days in the hands of their abductors, the tourists in Egypt are to be free again, as confirmed by the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs.
The kidnappers from Sudan demanded several million euros of ransom.
Six hostages are to be killed in a shooting before release.
Five Germans were kidnapped in the south of Egypt.
Lone money negotiations are supposed to run already.
Time and again, German came into the sight of Kidnappern.
WORLD ONLINE describes the main cases.
European tourists in the Sahara are apparently free.
This was reported by Egyptian state television, Arab TV station Al-Arabiya and Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release, according to reports from the Italian TV station Sky TG 24: \"Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been freed.
We're just checking their state of health, but Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions were well up and safe, reported Egyptian state television.
The 19 participants in a desert expedition are already on their way to Cairo.
The background of a shooting remains unclear before the release of the hostages: therefore, according to an Egyptian security officer, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping before the Sudanese army killed six of the kidnappers surprisingly.
“The problem was solved.
They agreed to a ransom, the official said.
It was \"only about receiving the hostages\" when suddenly \"this surprise\" came.
On Sunday in the border between Sudan, Chad and Egypt, Sudanese soldiers had shot six of the kidnappers and captured two of them.
The hostages demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money was to be handed over by the German wife to one of the hostages.
The daily newspaper \"El Masri El Jom\" reported on a German mediator who delayed the release of the hostages because the Kidnapper feared for their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers want to release the female hostages after payment of the ransom.
The men should be kept until the kidnappers have a safe flight route.
The German Embassy in Cairo rejected an opinion on the report.
Abuse of the stepfather \"led to suicide\"
The years of abuse by her stepfather resulted in a woman's being killed was reported to a court.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, received a six-year prison sentence after he had endured eight cases of sexual abuse.
The criminal court in Truro learned that he regularly fettered his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession: “I feel responsible for her death,
The court learned that Ms. Randle died in her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she was a child living in Coventry, Trerise had tied her and tied her eyes before performing sexual acts while her mother was away to work in a restaurant.
Trerise and his wife were divorced in the 1980s and he moved back to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, the court found that Ms. Randle, who worked honorably for the National Trust for much of her time, was persecuted by the abuse which had been added to her twice a week.
Mr. Ramsay Quaife reported to the court that friends had said that Ms. Randle, who had been a zealous surfer and cyclist, had been “emotionally dead” since 2006 and had given up “his life”
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It is assumed that she killed herself by suffocating with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter’s stepfather, who wrote a confession letter that concluded: “I used to tie her and connect her eyes,
“I didn’t need her sexually.
I feel responsible for her death,
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: “They are an extremely alien fetishist and for their victim it must have been frightening, especially since she was only seven.
This unsatisfied story ends with the victim's suicide.
Worse still is the fact that it is very unlikely that the case would have ended before the court if it had not done so,
He added: “I take note of the effects, according to Stephanie’s father and mother, on her daughter over the years.
She would otherwise clearly have been a promising, successful and happy young woman,
Officials responsible for lost data are charged
The BBC has learned that the Cabinet Officer, who had lost highly confidential documents in one train in June, will be accused in accordance with the Public Security Act.
The man was appointed by the Ministry of Defense when he lost two extremely confidential documents in one train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
It is the weakest charge within the law and there is no indication of criminal intent.
BBC defense correspondent Frank Gardner said the action was a surprise for many in Whitehall.
He said, \"They thought that this would be dealt with internally at the Department of Defense and Cabinet,
The employee whose name cannot be named shall be accused in accordance with paragraph 8.1 of the Act, the clause dealing with the safe storage of information.
The royal prosecutor recommended that the official be accused by the Metropolitan Police of the highly sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Security Committee.
The documents he moved contained classified assessments of Al-Quaida and the capabilities of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken from his house to a secret place.
Building companies see B&B costs in mind
After the rescue of the Bradford and Bingley Bank, British housing companies could incur costs of more than 80 million pounds.
The government provided 14 billion pounds to protect the deposits of Bradford & Bingley's 2.6 million customers.
The interest on this loan is paid by all companies that receive money from investors, including the 59 construction companies
The Director-General of the Association of Housing Construction Companies (BSA), Adrian Coles, said that it was \"unbearable\" that the companies and their members would have to pay.
The 14 billion loan will ultimately be repaid if Bradford & Bingley's loans are cancelled.
But the interest accumulated in the meantime will be charged to the 700 financial undertakings each year to accept the deposits.
The programme for the compensation of financial services confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing companies were included in this number.
It is bitter that those institutions that behaved discreetly ... are now called upon to take over some of the costs of those institutions that were far less careful.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that each company would have to pay in relation to the deposits it would hold, and that the companies together would have to pay about 18% of the costs.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that interest on credit will amount to 450 million pounds in 2009.
This means that companies have to purchase 81 million pounds for the first year's interest rates.
Adrian Coles, Director-General of the Association of Housing Companies, informed BBC that he believed this was unfair.
It is bitter that those institutions that behaved discreetly during the real estate upturn are now called upon to bear some of the costs of those institutions that were far less careful.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the records were made in 1945.
“We will observe all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what alternatives there are to protect housing companies and their members from potentially significant costs,
The interest due in 2009 will cover the seven months from the end of September this year until the end of March.
In 2010, interest rates will fall for a full year and this could be almost twice as much.
Since construction companies are both side-by-side organisations without shareholders, their members will have to pay for the costs either by higher fees or lower interest on savings accounts.
Milk becomes five pence per litre more expensive
People in Jersey see themselves confronted with having to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy announced that it will raise the wholesale price of its milk by another five pence per litre from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two pence increase in February, and comes after investigations of a consulting company have been carried out.
Retailers should decide for themselves whether they want to pass on the price increase to their customers.
Prior to the increase in prices in February, the wholesale price of Jersey milk changed last year in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh is denied bail
A court in Bangladesh has refused a hearing of the former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which means that if she returns to the country, she could be arrested.
Their defendants said that the court denied bail regarding the charge 50 million Taka ($729,700) was extorted by a businessman while she was prime minister.
The case is one of several floating charges for corruption against them.
Sheikh Hasina's long-standing political rival, Kaleda Zia, was released against bail at the beginning of this month.
Sheikh Hasina was to return to Bangladesh in the next weeks, but her party, the Awami Alliance, demanded that the military-supported transitional government first grant her unlimited freedom.
Correspondents say that although their detention has been granted to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear as part of their release that they will be able to continue on their free foot if they return to Bangladesh.
Their lawyers indicate that they will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Supreme Court.
“The upper court has rejected Sheikh Hasina’s deposit bid because it says that she does not have to receive a deposit because she is already on detention abroad to be treated abroad,” said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
We will file a complaint against the upper court,
Their lawyers insist that they require bail to return from abroad to the country in order to prepare for the December elections.
It is expected that Sheikh Hasina will return home after 17 October, said an Awami Alliance party chairman on Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the army-supported transitional government took power but was released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Kaleda Zia deny all charges against themselves.
Fears of the Anti-Polio Initiative in Afghanistan
In the recent anti-Polio initiative in Afghanistan, almost 200,000 children have not been vaccinated because of the violence associated with the Taliban, according to the United Nations.
The United Nations has carried out a vaccination programme last week in six provinces.
However, they were unable to reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for safety reasons.
According to a UN spokesman, this was the case despite the Taliban's promise not to attack or hinder the thousands of staff carrying out vaccinations.
BskyB loses proceedings in the case of ITV
BskyB has lost its claim against the decision of the Competition Commission to reduce its share of the competing channel ITV.
The Competition Court ordered BskyB to reduce its participation in ITV from 17.9% to below 7.5%.
Previously, the Commission had claimed that BskyB's share distorted competition and enabled it to have an unfair influence on the ITV channel.
BskyB acquired its share in 2006 by successfully preventing NTL, now renamed into Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that the acquisition of the share of ITV by BskyB raised doubts about the independence of the ITV, which prompted the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
The Virgin Boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the Communications Office Ofcom have opposed the purchase.
BskyB argued that the pressure to reduce its share of ITV was an unreasonable and exaggerated measure, in particular because BskyB had announced that BskyB would give up its voting rights.
New investigation in the U.S. prosecutor's case
The U.S. Attorney General has commissioned a special investigator to deal with the termination of the nine prosecutors in the United States in 2006.
The occasion was a report by the General Inspectorate of the Ministry of Justice in which the actions of the administration staff were criticized.
The report criticized the officials of the White House, legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was driven by fears that the lawyers had been dismissed for political reasons.
The Special Inspector Nora Dannehy should now clarify whether the officers who were interrogated had lied to the investigators during the investigation in order to hinder the justice.
Serious allegations including criminal proceedings have not been fully investigated or clarified, said General Inspector Glenn Fine in his report.
The appeal of a special investigator with the power to force the witnesses to testify was one of his main recommendations.
The conflict began when in December 2006, the Ministry of Justice dismissed nine U.S. prosecutors from their offices.
At that time, the Ministry argued that the prosecutors would be dismissed because of poor work.
However, it was later found that the dismissed prosecutors had not been judged worse than many of their colleagues, which led many observers to view the terminations as politically motivated.
Some of these prosecutors were involved in the judicial persecution of high-ranking Republican congressmen, while others refused to investigate the accusations of electoral fraud by the Democrats.
US prosecutors are instructed to investigate and prosecute judicial cases for the government.
They may be dismissed at any time, but may not be dismissed for political reasons.
The then head of the Department of Justice Attorney General Alberto Gonzales has been shot at for the dismissals and has settled his office in the end effect.
A number of officials of the Ministry of Justice have also terminated.
In particular, the General Inspector's report referred critically to the role of Gonzales by showing the \"main responsibility\" for the dismissals, his leadership role \"to give up\" and in the process - apart from the interest
Other officials, including the former Chief Adviser of President Bush Karl Rove, were criticized for their lack of cooperation with the investigators.
Meat Loaf's epic song to be honored
The Rockstar Meat Loaf is to be honoured during the Music Award Award for its epic hymn \"Bat Out Of Hell\".
The singer, the next week in London will accept his special golden prize during the ceremony, said he was honored to be recognized.
The song, which lasts for nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the song on Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
\"Coldplay\" indicates the nominations for the award of this year, after it has come into the closer choice in four categories.
The editor-in-chief of the magazine \"Q Magazine\" Paul Rees said there were some songs that went beyond such matters as time and genre and \"Bat Out Of Hell\" were certainly one of them.
The song written by Jim Steinman required a strong voice delivered by Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental part that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was released in 1979 as a single in the UK and reached 15th place in the charts.
However, Meat Loafs, Bat Out Of Hell, spent about nine years in the charts and sold more than 40 million times worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose true name is Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered from serious health problems in recent years. One of them was an operation in 2003 because of irregular heartbeats after he had collapsed on stage.
In 2007, he had to cancel concerts due to acute throat inflammation.
Later he was known to have a cyst on his vocal cord.
Obscure street in town, often forgotten and possibly soon to sell
New York City has thousands of main highways, alleys, sidewalks and other bypass roads, some of which are famous and others just comfortable.
Nevertheless, even experienced taxi drivers and longtime residents find it difficult to say where Extra Place is, simply because most have never heard of it.
This tiny road is located in the East Village and runs north from First Street between Bowery and Second Avenue without reaching Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks more like a dusty street than after an actively used passageway.
There are no road signs either.
It is virtually impossible to find them on a standard street plan.
This road still has its admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that recently built luxurious buildings on First Street.
It wants to reinvent Extra Place to create a clean passage to the shops and boutiques expected in the new buildings.
Among the other worshipers is the long-standing neighborhood, which says that it is fascinated by the short street, simply because it is one of the remains of the past of the house block.
However, the City Administration Department, which is responsible for the protection and construction of the residential buildings and is responsible for the road, has no interest in obtaining them.
During a meeting of the Committee on Land Use of the Municipal Council this month, representatives of the City Administration and Avalon Bay designed a proposal for the purchase of the road by the construction company.
Nevertheless, the committee prefers that the street remain in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan to be presented in the coming month, Susan Stetzer said, the district responsible in the municipal council 3.
“Only very little space has been owned by the city and we want Extra Place to continue to belong to the city,” she said.
“There could be offers of how to repair and operate the road, what could be done by Avalon, but we also want public access to be guaranteed,
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that the small street would set up new ceilings and seats, which, among other things, are intended for a café that the company would like to rent space to.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the road was made public for the first time during the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokesperson from Avalon Bay, said that although the company wanted to use the road, it didn't want to have it.
“The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renovate and make it a public meeting place,” she said, adding that the city itself had proposed the sale.
Seth Donlin, spokesperson of the Building Protection Department said that it was actually the city's desire to sell the road and stressed that the department's task was rather to develop the real estates than to manage them.
Compared with his colorful neighborhood, The Bowery, Extra Place has retained something of its historical impression.
Some believe that the road was given its name in 1802, when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was divided between its numerous children and a narrow strip of land was not claimed.
The back door of the music club CBGB, the punkrock monument that was closed in 2006, opened to the extra place and the street is certainly most well known as a backdrop for the photo on the cover of the album \"Rocket to Russia\" by Ramones.
The patch was great, Danny Fields, manager of the Ramones, who had taken the photo in November 1976.
The road was full of scraps, lumps and parts of barrels, posters, sheets and ropes.
Some residents, including the bloggers who write about the Gentrification of the East Village, have rejected the idea of selling Extra Place, with the argument that this public property, as modest as it is, remains public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rarity - a virtually unchanged splitter of the city, which should be left at rest.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs the blog called \"Jeremiah's disappearing New York\" (subtitled with \"The Book of Complaints: A bitter nostalgic view of the dying city), published a part of the conversation of the city history about Extra Place, which was published in the journal \"The New Yorker\" in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote back then: “Extra Place is a small narrow dead end, which even remains dark during the day and is marked by rusty metal doors of the warehouses, closed windows and weeks-old newspapers flying by the rains.
With few exceptions, the street has looked just as recently in one evening.
A rat ran through the back of the street, not far from the door that led earlier to CBGB, where today there is a more expensive clothing store.
Graffiti were seen on the walls and an empty beer bottle was on the ground not far from a fresh bundle of aligned newspapers.
Some passersby said they rarely thought about Extra Place, but suggested that the road could be a little polished.
Fields, added that in his opinion, some people underestimate the excitement of the road in its current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in places that were dark, moist, and disgusting.
Discussion on bilingual education: education in English-speaking environments
In this issue of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of candidates for bilingual training.
Lance T. Izumi, senior academic assistant in California Studies and senior director in the Department of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book \"Not as good as you think: Why the middle class needs a choice of schools,
Addressing Hispanic voters is a complicated task.
Barrack Obama's proposals on education are a typical example of this.
Obama’s election campaign mentions that “the probability of African-American and Hispanic students successfully completing school is lower than in white students - what’s right.
In order to close this gap in performance, Obama's education plan recommends a bilingual transition phase in training for those who first learn English.
However, the question to Obama is whether his use of bilingual education, which places the emphasis on teaching in languages other than English, contradicts his interest in reducing the distance from school.
As an example, let's take \"Sixth Street Prep\" a primary school in eastern Los Angeles.
The majority of pupils are Hispanic and come from low-income families.
More than one third of the students, many of whom are only recently in the country, learn English.
Nevertheless, in 2008, amazing 100 percent of fourth grade students passed the state examination in math at a good level.
Also surprisingly, 93 percent of children from the fourth year of school were well rated in the English examination.
This amazing success has been achieved with methods other than those preferred by Obama.
School Sixth Street focuses on review and exercise, on continuous control of knowledge and an attitude that tolerates no exceptions.
In addition, the school practices the approach that training takes in an English-speaking environment. That is exactly the point Obama should consider, according to the headmaster Linda Mikels.
This approach places emphasis on the almost exclusive use of the English language in specialist teaching.
Mrs Mikels, who rejected the idea of bilingual education, told me that the school had a remarkable success with a student who had only recently come from Mexico. 12 months later, one could enter the classroom and no longer recognize him.
“It works,” she remarked, “it works for us.
Would Obama take a school like the \"Sixth Street Prep\" as a model for other schools with a large share of Latin American and other English-learning students?
The school's achievements would make the answer to this question easy, but the educational positions within its own party (the national picture associations have long supported the idea of bilingual education) and its own consistent support of bilingual education make predictions about Obama's response uncertain.
While agreeing on the point that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the subject by pointing out that people should stop worrying about the legislation aimed at only English.

The price of oil is decreasing as a result of further fears about the economy
The oil price fell sharply on Monday due to the fears that even the US rescue plan for the financial markets could not be enough to revive the economy.
In the morning session, the oil terminals on the New York Trade Exchange fell by 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel.
Since last Monday the price has fallen by more than $20.
Over the last two weeks, the freight markets have been shaken by the financial turbulence on Wall Street as well as by severe storms in the Gulf of Mexico.
After the prices reached their peak in July of $145.29 per barrel, they fell to almost $90 per barrel this month to rise again as a result of the enormous uncertainty in the financial markets.
On Monday, investors have already shown concern, although congress representatives had announced that they would have agreed on a rescue plan on the weekend, which should be the largest in history.
This message was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis was far from complete.
In the first final chapter of the growing crisis, according to a government announcement on Monday, Citigroup is to purchase the banks of Wachovia Corporation.
In the meantime, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the European financial group Fortis.
According to analysts at Barclay's Capital, despite the tense negotiations that took place on weekends and led to a rescue plan, it apparently failed to revive the mood in the markets.
As the economic situation continues to deteriorate, demand for goods, including oil, is expected to continue to decline.
In a communication to investors, Deutsche Bank analysts wrote that forecasts for global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates have become extremely uncertain.
We believe they continue to write that the goods markets will also be affected.
“From the perspective of goods markets, we are most concerned about whether the US virus is spreading worldwide, especially after China,
The analysts of the bank have corrected their expectations for oil consumption due to the weak economic growth for the coming year and their forecasts for the oil and gas price for 2009 have decreased by 20%.
Team record by second quarter series
Internal defender Shaun Ellis thought he'd seen everything, after he had lived more often than anyone else in the Jets jets jersey in the last eight and a half years.
Then he saw the second quarter on Sunday, in which the jets turned an unsuccessful game into a triumphal train.
“I’ve never seen anything like this,” Ellis said.
After a sloppy game between the jets and the Arizona Cardinals, which corresponded to the bad weather, the second quarter began.
However, when Quarterback Brett Favres Pass arrived at Lavernues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, it marked the perfect start to an afternoon when their developing collaboration made a huge step forward.
Favre found Coles in this quarter for two more touchdowns, which once slipped out as an outside defender and the other time 10 seconds before the end of the half.
“I didn’t make a special effort,” says Coles about the passports that went to Coles.
“He’s a superplayer.
Our vote has voted, no matter what people think,
While Favre and Cole's prisoners were playing, the Defence Quarterback Kurt Warner took off.
Foreign defender Darrelle Revis started a failed throw and turned him into a 32-yard touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith came to another pass and caught him.
Linebacker David Bowens then caused a loss of warner.
The last ball loss, forced at Bowens, was probably the most crazy.
The cardinal had conquered the ball with another 10 seconds left in the game when the jets conquered the ball and Jay Feely turned a 20 yard shot to 34 to 0 lead.
These were most of the points the jets had ever achieved in a quarter.
When he was asked to describe the madness Erik Mangini, coach of the jets, answered the second quarter or the third quarter,
To the answers both, because the jets had 21 points in the third quarter without reaching a single one, Mangini said: “Faith to me, I enjoyed the second quarter more than the third.
A lot of points have been achieved in a short time,
Restored Gebrsselassie strikes its world record
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has shown again why some people think of him for the best long-distance runner of all time after he broke his own record in the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and became the first person to create the 42.2 kilometres route in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory on the flat course in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie improved his previous result of 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, which he had achieved last year in Berlin.
Gebrselassie, 35, has thus established his 26th world record in his versatile career, in which he has at least won a world championship title or set up a world record on every route from one kilometer to the marathon.
Last month Gebrselassie left the Olympic Marathon in Beijing, for fear, which may have been exaggerated in the aftermath, that air pollution could worsen his asthma problems.
Instead, he signed up for the competition in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions - at sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees at the destination - Gebrsselassie has won at an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since rail runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya have changed on long-distance tracks, the record time for Marathon has fallen by more than 2 minutes over the last 10 years since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in 1998 in Berlin with the result 2:06:05.
After his victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie told the press that he had had two weeks of spasms in his wade and therefore could not train for a week.
Apparently he came back after a break and did not rust.
“I’m so happy,” he said to reporters.
“ Everything has been running perfectly.
I resumed the training a week ago and still had some concerns today, but at the end what was all super-
He was criticized for this - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's rivals from East Africa - for orchestrating his race races excessively, for avoiding many world's best marathon stars in general, for relying too much on the race leaders as if it were a race, and for putting world records on the competition.
But this criticism hardly hurts the size of Gebrselassies as a long-distance runner.
Together with four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie had reached the center of the route in 1:02:04.
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi continued to challenge Gebrselassi after the pacemakers had left.
A little more than three miles before the finish, Gebrselassie made his last trip to separate himself from Kwambai, who arrived as second in 2:05:36 and thus improved his best time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi became third in 2:07:48.
In women, Irina Mikittenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now German, completed a considerable year by showing the seventh quickest result of all times at 2:19:19.
The world record of 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliff from Great Britain.
Last spring, the 36-year-old Mikittenko had surprisingly won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She missed the games in Beijing because of problems described as back injury. However, she recovered to win in Berlin and improve her best time in her third marathon by five minutes.
She planned her course by first rinsing a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners, but after 30 kilometers she survived.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia was second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop from Kenya arrived third in 2:25:01.
The pride and the stripes in the life of the black population, in a city of a very special kind
Hidden between the growths of leisure parks in the area of Orlando, a few miles from the glowing, loud and gigantic drifts, there is a quiet city where the pride and complications of African-American culture appear.
Eatonville, the first completely black city in the country and the home city of Zora Neale Hurstons, is no longer as easy to describe as Hurston did in 1935: “the city with 5 lakes, three crockery sites, 300 brown hides, 300 good swimmers, more than enough guaven, 2 schools and no prison,
Today it is a pilgrimage site.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to commemorate the most famous author of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet it is and remains the city that it describes - and which made it a tourist destination by taking it into the Florida travel guide, which was produced by the Bundesschreiberproject at the time of the depression - in many respects a place of very special variety.
Eatonville is as independent, dedicated and private as in the 1930s when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man, who \"knows so little about us that he doesn't know what happens to him\"
Even today, in a year when a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open discussion of racial relations, many are still suffering from outsiders.
“We are very concerned about how our history is told,” said Hortense Jones, 59, from birth to a city and parishioner of the oldest church in the city.
It must vote,
Eatonville has long been defined as the paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is both a historical example of the black movement and a community of almost 2,400 inhabitants, where the poverty rate is twice as high as the country average.
It is on the one hand a stronghold of literature and on the other hand an example of the - sometimes condemned, sometimes praised - black culture of the rural south that has its roots in American slavery.
It is not surprising that residents here are both proud and on the hat.
And the concerns about Eatonville's image actually started with Zora, as here all the Hurstons call it.
She presented her home city to the world in books that had come from the heart and were written in mouth, as were \"Mules and Men\" (1953) and \"The Eyes were watching God\" (1973)
Five paragraphs in the Florida travel guide changed the city, which is very close to Route 77, a road leading through the often-forgotten centre of Florida, to the locations of black history and human drama.
Freak like Oskar in real life as well as in literature, Hurston led reader to the store of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then turned to more private affairs.
“Besides the road to the left,” she wrote, “the brown - white modern school, with its well maintained gardens and playgrounds, which always take care of Howard Miller, although he can hardly read and write, is located in the brown - white school.
She also mentioned the new man of Witwe Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn sold drinks of every kind and what-and-everything fits into hourly rooms,
Thus, in just a few hundred words, Hurston associated Eatonville with self-government, but also with illiteracy, second marriage, and sex.
This was certainly not a travel guide.
In fact, this was not a portrait that was appreciated by all.
“Zora described things as they were — according to the 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson’s girls immortalized Hurston by quoting the men who sang songs about their beauty that were full of sexual play.
She added: “Some people didn’t like this, ” she said.
One still remembers Hurtson as a lively eccentric who regularly returned after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, remembered that when Hurston came to the city brewing, she did this mostly without warning, in a wretched Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants, in a city that itself now forms something on their venerable style of dress.
According to Mr. Franklin, most inhabitants were fascinated, whereas many despised them.
“The people were always happy to see Zora,” said Mr. Franklin.
But “she never stayed too long,” he added as he swirled in his chair, on a back terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was probably baptized.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and had her books broken.
Together with most of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them.
Although she was once a famous author, a contemporary Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived, in an anonymous tomb.
In Eatonville there was no great commemoration, no public readings in great style.
“I don’t think they understood their contribution in the world or their heritage in the least, according to Valerie Boyd, author of “Wrapped in Rainbows” a biography about Hurston published in 2003.
The turn came in the 80s.
Orange County authorities wanted to lay a five-track highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the slow two-track main street of the municipality.
Orlando's suburbs had already pushed highway 4 through the western outskirts of the city.
The proposal was presented when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult phase in his history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the municipality.
In the 1950s, the fight against racial mixing brought hatred into the community.
“In this time a bunch of white boys often came and they threw oranges and stuff on the offside sitting people,” said Mr. Franklin.
“There was even a woman who was killed.
They threw a watermelon out of the car,
In 1955, in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the request of the Supreme Court to force integration by calling his decision against the School Council in the case of Brown as 'political instead of respecting my race'.
People today say that although the abolition of racial separation has been positive in some respects, it has weakened the group cohesion in Eatonville and the self-awareness of its young people.
“Black children were accustomed to being hugged - I remember - they hugged his teacher in the morning and hugged his teacher in the evening - according to N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and managing director of the nonprofit group to protect the Eatonville community.
This could be maintained for so long, she added, until teachers and students stopped coming from the same place.
“You didn’t embrace his white teacher, because he was a white teacher - I mean there is a cultural gap - said Ms. Nathiri.
However, civil rights have contributed to the creation of space for more Zora Neale Hurstons - black authors, actors and artists who have gone beyond prejudices, as they did, with positive self-awareness and statements such as: \"How can anyone deny the joy of my society!
I don't understand,
In 1975, writer Alice Walker made his way to Hurston's nameless grave and began to fight for the revival of her fame.
Five years later, a much praised Hurston biography of Robert E. Hemenway was found in the bookshelf, and again made it part of the American literary canon.
The long-distance project came at exactly a time when Eatonville's most famous daughter once again stood in the light of the public.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The municipality began planning a Hurston Festival in 1988 to show what could destroy the district by building the highway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January many return for the celebration.
A few years later, the district turned away from its road construction plans.
\"The plans of a five-track long-distance road inspired the city, accelerated the whole thing at peak speed, awakened real citizen pride\" said Ms. Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd expressed it a little easier: “Zora saved Eatonville”
The victory against the long road project has contributed to a change in the self-image of the city.
There were more and more railroads, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been going to the church since 1993, and locals began to reestimate the past.
Eatonville was admitted to the state-wide historical register in 1998.
A new one-storey library (of course named after Hurston) opened in 2006 on the newly paved and decorated Kennedy Boulevard.
Nowadays, Eatonville is still a special feature in Florida: only 6 miles from the city centre of Orlando, it can sometimes feel like a backyard in the summer rain, as small as it was when it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(It's 90% black today.)
Outsiders looking for the history of Eatonville and its importance are often still treated with caution.
For most interviews, prior approval is necessary and certain things - like the wall painting of Eatonville's oldest church, painted by a white man and represented by black men in field work - must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Mrs. Jones, a courageous, self-conscious teacher with a preference for dark red, still fear that her shielded community will be misunderstood.
And yet, at the same time as the Hurston Festival grew, an increased degree of home pride was also born.
Young people in particular tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw their entire race: beautiful, with all its problems, neither worse nor better and just as proud, creative and diligent, silly and perplexing as any other racial and international group in America.
It is the sincere love for this city that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, the 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who has been planning to return to Eatonville after college to work in the city administration or in the police, who, according to him, could use some help.
And even the disciples, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
“Most people who only go through here will think, “Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others,” said Alondra Kenon on a Sunday after the church.
“But if you actually stop and look at his story for a moment, it’s a very beautiful city,” he said.
Here in New York we speak fluently of financial Latin.
At first glance, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan were away from the newspaper booths and the huge TV screens in Times Square, they would not even notice that they are in the middle of a debacle.
They would never believe that over their heads, in the shoe box-like offices with the glass facades, bankers and hedge fund managers, who have the monopoly in New York, have the worst horror working day since the fall of 1929.
The suppliers still push with loud clappers the metal tea trays along citizens' slopes and transport tablets loaded with muffins for breakfast sessions.
Latinos still slump around between apartments as human pack animals load with about 50 tied t-shirts hanging on a yoke-like rod on their shoulders.
Office staff are still waiting for their breakfast desks on the citizens' climbs and it is still impossible to get a yellow taxi on a weekday between 16am and 7pm.
It didn't feel like a crisis at all until I decided to open a new savings account on Thursday afternoon due to all the world's break-in talk.
Although I had decided to lay my duty time on the quiet late afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase tribal branch, about 20 people already stood snakes.
Not to the cash desks to pick up or pay money, but to the customer service desk where regular customers order checkbooks, ask tourists for the way to Macy's department store and where new customers open accounts.
Most in front of me, I later learned from Starr, my \"personal banker with license\" stood for the same reason as I was a snake.
Unlike me, however, they had already removed their savings from smaller banks, at places from where they were commuting, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had raised money from so-called Thrifts (a little like a building park), cooperative banks and those local savings banks that only have branches in one state and say they treat their customers like family.
In the last year 15 of these banks went silently and quietly.
In the last few days Washington Mutual, a bank with investments worth $327 billion, went over in bankruptcy management and when last Friday New Yorkers drove home over the weekend, was Wachovia, another bank that owns savings assets worth $440 billion, looking for a saving buyer.
In the fear of another collapse, the office and shop staff who were in front of me brought their cash to a bank that is considered safe harbor, a bank responsible for most rescue purchases on Wall Street.
Very ordinary New Yorkers have made their way into the last few weeks of flowing financial laity.
A woman who telephoned in my Chinese tribal supermarket took with so much trust with regard to Lehman Brothers, the Pleited Bank and its remote-looking CEO Dick Fuld, as if to blaspheme over a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the 50-year-old uniformed concierge of my living block came from our usual entertainment topics about Brad and Angelina and my food delivery.
“I now have all my savings in money market funds,” she told me after my visit to the bank.
“I changed, I’m not going to risk anymore,”
Muslim tombs damaged during legal slide in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a left-wing judge of the Austrian Liberal Party of Austria, and Filip Dewinter, a member of the Belgian right-wing Pertei Vlaams Interest, will take part in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday 17 January 2008, to represent the organization “city against Islamization”.
They carry signs in the style of traffic signs on which a mosque is pictured, painted with a red line.
The police accuse right-wing extremists of the grave in a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same weekend at the extreme right-wing party of significant gains in the country's parliamentary election.
During the night from Friday to this morning, more than 90 graves at the cemetery in Traun near Linz were badly damaged in an action, according to police.
The perpetrators sprayed Jewish symbols such as the David Star on some of the graves, but criminal officers consider this an attempt to conceal the motive of the extremists driven by hatred for Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is in any way in connection with the elections.
A spokesperson of the local Islamic community said that she was “deeply shaken” about the news of the burial that took place when the religious month of the Muslim Ramadan came to an end.
At the same time, in Austria, there is a round of research on conscience, after the country slipped to the right in the last parliamentary election.
The FPÖ and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, the two far right parties received the almost 30% of the votes, committed themselves to a strict anti-Emmigrant law in their election campaign, and some of their polls were criticized by opponents as hostile.
Heinz-Christian Strache, chairman of the FPÖ, who won 18% of the votes, committed himself to banning headaches and burcas and even expressed his aversion to food, which is generally associated with Islam.
At his last rally in Vienna, he spoke of a \"European Brotherhood\" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to prohibit the construction of mosques and minarettes with the argument that these political symbols of continuous Islamization are Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the election, which say that the extreme rights of the most politically powerful block in the country, indicate that this new development is based on young voters who are worried about their future in the European Union.
Foreign travel barrier for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the glam rock star condemned by the sexual abuse of children, was courtly forbidden to travel to France and Spain.
Judges issued a six-month locket after informing the authorities controlling him that he wanted to travel to Spain via France.
The police in Kent were granted a ban on a foreign travel barrier last Thursday after she presented evidence of Glitter's pre-punishment to the judges for the sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, the real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford District Court in Kent, but was represented by the law firm Corker Binning.
EIn Spokesman of the Court of Justice, he said: “On Thursday, 25 September, the police asked Kent at Ashford District Court to prevent foreign travel from Mr. Paul Glad to France and Spain by 25 March.
Paul Gadd was not personally present
According to the Register for Sexual Criminals, Glitter, 64, informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad.
He must inform the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also notify the police 7 days before his planned departure.
Failure to notify the authorities could lead to a five-year prison sentence.
The police in Kent said they would not discuss individual cases or Glitter's possible place of residence in the country.
One spokesperson of Kent's police unit said: \"The police in Kent will do everything necessary to protect children in that country and abroad,
\"In our opinion, it is easier to control someone in the United Kingdom because we have a comprehensive system to effectively prevent any potential risks,
“It is the highest concern of the Kent police to protect the inhabitants of Kent and we work closely together to monitor the conduct of registered sexual offenders in the country in order to minimize any risk that might exist for the population.
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse of 2 girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he was scheduled to take a flight to London.
But he said he didn't feel well and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not let him through the passport control and he flew to Hong Kong after some time.
The Chinese authorities also denied him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officials insisted that he return to Britain.
Last but not least, on 22 August he arrived at Terminal 3 in Heathrow and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge District Court in West London, where Scotland Yard had successfully asked for permission to register as a sexual offender.
Glitter had previously been detained for 4 months in the United Kingdom for possession of images of child abuse in 1999.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior Jacqui Smith was calm and satisfied that Glitter was being held off to travel to France and Spain.
`I receive the master behind the stage to hold his character', Günter Brauer, photographer.
No paragraphs, no smells, no costumes for the performance.
The nature of the large flame-cotans, which give up concentration and dedicate themselves to interpretation to get a relaxed look as a woman or as a man.
On the one hand, artists
On the other hand, personality
I look into private life, in those moments that are foreign to the public, I know when I can find typical gesture for the personality, the depth of a stolen eye or the strength of the hands that are concerned because they will not be able to enter the stage.
In his project `Flamenco-people', the German photographer Günter Bauer presents alternate theatrical themes on stage with singers, dancers and guitarists. From this page he was little known for the artists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a special iconography of flamenco presentation at different levels.
The exhibition, which belongs to the program of the month of photography of Flamenco, 'reflects the international importance of Flamenco, which is increasing from day to day,' explains the artist and makes it clear that `Flamenco-people' can be any human being, but when you look at the photos, the viewer notices that there are no typical images of artists on stage.
Very normal people on the portraits are artists who are able to convey passion on stage, sadness, joy and thus move the audience.
In order to hold the personality of these artists, you don't have to take photos on stage.
Her personality and her character are in her heart.
What interested me was to create a personal atmosphere that would enable me to hold the characters of the greatest flamencomaster with the camera.'
Bauer, inspired by the festival `Cante de las Minas', made a long journey in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the image sorting function of the camera and the existing material, images created are reminiscent of classical photography.
The use of various stylistic means destroys the classic foundation of the image, giving the image the modernity and the idea of how the farmer understands Flamenco: `Music with traditional roots that change and surprise each day'.
These are not only the dance, the singing or the instrumental play to itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, which seduces the audience with his art.
The search for essentially, for a certain something that becomes visible in the form of hearing, of being, and was the fixed goal of this work, which will be presented in the gallery of El Fotómata in the next time.
Famous personalities in Flamenco among them Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Moreente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others are among the narrow selection of almost seventy artists that have been photographed.
The project became an anthology of flamenco and will soon appear as a book, with all portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for the portraits led him to take up this idea two years ago and to realize it as a 'portrait of the veterans of sports' ('sportARTproject').
Although the concepts of the project `Flamenco-people' are different, the photographer says that I like to photograph people, get to know them, and put me in their state of life, whether for a short time or for a longer time.
I think in the field of photography the portrait is the most difficult genus.
You meet or fall on people, personalities that you sometimes don't know at all, or they leave you alone for a few minutes to take a photo.
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer I always try to realize my ideas.'
The collection of the portraits of the flamenco today entitled 'Flamenco-people' is exhibited in the gallery of El Fotómata, which is located in the street called la calle de la Mata and runs parallel to the street la Alameda de Hércules. You can visit the exhibition until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa says that the Roma he is writing is 'a great-quality'.
He does not yet know where the story of the novel takes place and what it is about, but Mario Vargas Llosa is persistently trying to advance the project he is working on, a novel with the protagonist Roger Casemant, a nationalist from Ireland who lived in the Congo for twenty years and moved to the Amazon region.
Yesterday, during his presence at the Festival Hay Festival Segovia, the preferred Nobel Prize winner admitted that the project he was working with is `a rarity' and `everything points out that he would not have to write the novel'.
'If I were healthy, I wouldn't have done it, but I'll do it and hope to end the novel at some point,' he concluded his attendance at the festival, where the ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged. Within the four days he saw hundreds of writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people who were in Segovia.
The author of `La ciudad y los perros' was one of the most outstanding personalities at the third festival and made predictions.
Vargas Llosa, who won the festival's premium Hay Festival and whose voice most attendees give, is compared with the old edition of `Our mutual friend' and can be seen in the theatre Juan Bravo.
He was introduced by Félix Romeo and stated that he had an audience in front of him, which noted that the Peruvian, who possesses a wonderful memory and great sense of humor, was not given enough time to pass through everything once more: as his vocation to literature arose from `extraordinary adventure', from `peace on reading' and from `more experience than before'; as he writes and `discipline perceives' to supplement `the lack of inspiration', his intensive work with documentation, numerous corrections and revisions that he makes; as Faulkner, Víctor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas influenced his vocation and which `mental images' it is the basis for his stories.
The Hispanic novelist admitted that there is `no way' in which you can measure and where you can know if books change life, `but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, a volatile experience', emphasised Vargas Llosa, who claims that it brings out `effects' and `brings people even more apart', so I did not ask the writer `seek of ease' and `take responsibility' for his vocation.
At the party in Pozoblanco, the weather did not play with: bullfighting parties fell out in part.
After the announced bullfighters found that the ground of the square was in bad condition, the bullfighting festival, with which the feast was to be concluded in Pozoblanco, was moved to yesterday morning.
With the agreement of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, the organizer decided to postpone the bullfighting ceremony.
Thus, the feast was suspended from the unstable weather, so two of three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday it rained, which is why the second planned bullfighting festival could not be celebrated.
The Matadore group consisted of José Luis Moreno, Curro Días and Juan Bautista, who eventually entered the bullfighting arena.
So there was only one celebration on Friday.
The winner there was Daniel Luque, who cut three ears and triumphed after leaving the passage with pleasure and aesthetics.
On the same evening, Alejandro Talavante met two horns and one ear of the bull, which was more through galloping than through his bullfighting art.
And worse was El Juli, who went through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without fame.
After he fought so badly, a large part of the audience responded to his second fight with Buh-Rufen.
In Álava two people wanted to escape the control of their car, which was loaded with two thousand kilos of hashish.
Tomorrow: five minutes ago ten.
Traffic control in Ertzaintza, in the city area of Armiñon (Álava).
Two police officers called the drivers of the car to stop, and then they took the flight.
It looked as if they had to stop with the load of more than two thousand kilos of hashish.
The police persecuted her and arrested one of the drivers, the man 28 years old, known as A. A. J., as told the interior ministry of the Basque State.
The arrested person was accused of drug trafficking and counterfeiting of official documents.
The incident occurred when the officials of the traffic police of the Álava region had already completed traffic control on the N-1 and passed through the city area of Armiñon.
They decided to stop a car to perform the route control. The driver did not follow the instructions, suddenly increased the speed and tried to escape the control.
The police began the persecution until the car stopped at the edge after a few kilometres. At the moment the riders got out of the car to escape via a road to a forest area.
The police of the city of Ertzantza finally brought in one of the two. In the car, an Iveco Daily, the drug dealer transported 2,178 kilos of hashish, which was seized by the police.
The front part of the car was loaded with hashish bundles, which were later directed to further police stations for the exact laboratory analysis and for the weighing of the bundle.
In addition, the officials found that the mark was 'doubled', so that it did not correspond with the mark indicated in the car papers, which was also the result of a arrest due to counterfeiting of official documents.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza continued the investigation to make the arrest of the second suspect, who, as mentioned above, could flee, but also to determine the origin of the seized drugs.
The 28-year-old A. A. J., who was arrested, was taken to a police station for questioning, and will be presented to the arresting officer in the next hours.
Actress Heather Locklear was arrested for driving under the effect of an unknown medication.
The actress Heather Locklear, who is known for the role of Amanda in the series \"Melrose Place\", was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California because of driving under the effect of an unknown medication.
A witness observed how she tried to get out of her parking lot in Montecito in a rather strange way, and spokesperson of California's traffic police told the magazine 'People'.
The witness told us in detail that Locklear had pressed 'after 16:30 a.m. gas pedal and made a lot of noise by trying to move her car back or forward from the parking gap, and as she drove backwards, she caught herself several times on her sunglasses'.
A little later, the witness, who had probably not known the actress in the beginning, saw Locklear stopped on a nearby road and left the car.
The witness was the person who notified the emergency service because she had 'anxiety for Locklearns'.
When the police strip came, they found the actress sitting in her car, standing across the street and thus blocking traffic.
`They seemed to be orientated', so they brought the police into a special drug and alcohol center to take a test.
According to a police speaker, the actress was shown to be cooperative, excessive alcohol enjoyment was excluded from the first moment. `To follow the first observations of the officials, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of an unknown drug', according to the speaker.
Locklear was arrested under suspicion of driving under the influence of an undetermined substance that could not be determined and brought into a local investigation prison at 7 p.m.
Two months ago, Locklaer was released from the Arizona hospital after treatment, where she was treated for anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists that the Andalusian Association of the United Left will be responsible for the Silva case.
Gaspar Llamazares, the chief coordinator of the VL and United Left Members, has today assured that the regional association for education will be the one who will make the decision in the case of the former City Council for Youth and Sport of the City Hall in Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who has resigned last week after being accused of doing business with family members.
'In such cases, I am a great federalist, and the Andalusian organization will be the one who must take responsibility for it', Llamazares pointed out what action the party must have towards that which so far sits as a city council in the Municipal Council of Seville.
Nevertheless, the Chairman of the VL defended the need for 'transparency' in the possible investigations of regulatory violations that Silva might have begun: 'The VL always insisted that such cases receive maximum transparency'.
With regard to this subject, he stressed that education has ‘a strict ethical code for all public offices'.
`Sangre de mayo': Heroes' Book of Garci
Inspired by `Episodios Nacionales' by Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Carci in `Sangre de mayo' represents the revised version of the famous uprising of the Spanish against the French. This is an amazing film in filmography, with around 15 million euros of investment for filmmaking.
In this way the Cineast has tried to show 'a lot of personalities and social analysis', which he has always admired at the works of the famous novelist Carci today explained in the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the beginning of a long list of performers.
`Sangre de mayo' with a film length of more than two and a half hours, this Friday is presented in cinemas and later shown on the transmitter Telemadrid as a four-hour mini-series.
José Luis Garci, great fan of Galdós literature, assures us that thanks to this film work his `Kindheitstraum' went into fulfillment. This he owes to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago from the autonomous community of Madrid to film a memorial film to the second century celebration on November 2nd in Madrid. Especially because the story was based on `Episodios Nacionales', he accepted the order.
The total contribution of 15 million, put for shooting by the autonomous community of Madrid, offers Garci, as he added, the 'one-time possibility' with the help of decorations and appropriate clothing, the image of the 'distorted Spain, who sought the wrong leader for the struggle, because the people had been brought into existence by the struggle for independence and under the rule of Ferdinand of VII.'
However, the Cineast regrets that one could not count on the financing as with `Alatriste' or `Los fantasmas de Goya' (two times as high as at `Sangre de mayo'), so some scenes from the screenplay with Horacio Valcárcel, with which Garci worked almost all his career, could not be rotated.
For this reason, Garci, who was also film director in `Volver a empezar', worked through his usual work: he appeared on stage to the actors, with whom one must first try before turning and for those who had not made a casting, he appeared 'demovable' and respecting, `a part of the job of the film director is to provide help in theatre and cinema to know what is happening in the cinema industry in which one works.'
Many performers to whom he falls in `Sangre de mayo' must repeat before his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, Oscar candidate in four nominations (of which he won one), is of the opinion and assured that none of the three candidates representing Spain in front of the Academy of Hollywood this year represent a young generation of Spanish filmography. Neither `Sangre de mayo', nor `Site mesas de billar francés' nor finally the selected film `Los girasoles ciegos'.
Garci does not expect any awards for this film.
`In the beginning you believe that you are working for the offspring, later you will notice that it is only for the sake of prosperity, and now you are satisfied when you have produced another film', Garci explains after more than 30 years of professional activity.
Isabel Bayón calls back the memory of the dancer from Seville Tórtola Valencia
A flame-cot dancer from Seville worships a dancer, who also comes from Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia: her father was Katalane (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and the mother Andalusian (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), who was born in the Triana district and when she was three years old, her family moved to London.
She was a dancer and expert in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first fighters for the emancipation of women, such as Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was Buddhist, vegetarian, and she set out for the abolition of the corset, which restricted the free female movement.
Isabel Bayón was fascinated by the life of this woman who left behind her traces of the dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe in the period between the wars.
`I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested to me this role, which seemed impossible to me.'
'We're not trying to tell you about their lives without keeping their Esprit,' said the flamenco dancer.
Your dance foundations have helped me a lot in Flamenco.
`The dance of the butterfly' appeared to me, for example, like Guajira, or `the dance of the snake' like Tango.
Her dancing was sensual and I've been told that my dancing is also in this aesthetic area', she claims.
The production expects two extraordinary collaborations: with Miguel Poveda, who will sing again for Isabel in one of her performances, as he did in `La puerta abitta'; and with Flamenco master Matilde Coral, who wanted to work with one of her ex-students in exceptional terms.
`Matilde plays tórtola, a very mature personality.
I am happy because she agreed to contribute to my work, and I feel very honored.'
The production also includes musical composition and the guitarist Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the singing of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; with the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa el Viola and the collaboration with the actor Juanfra Júarez, he 'takes over the role of the companion of the artists who were Divas, in which he always loves himself again and again.'
In this work it is also told in a certain way about the life of this woman, who became known in places such as India, the United States or Russia and also throughout Europe, although she normally lived in London.
`I wanted to recall them, because I think they are one of the women who have a huge influence on a particular era and whose works today are no longer appreciated and therefore they are even less appreciated,' Bayón asserts.
The performance takes place today at the Lope de Vega theater at 20:30.
The publication of the book `Diario de un poeta recién casado' also includes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of `Diario de un poeta recién casado' in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), in a place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married in 1916, offers a corresponding atmosphere to carry out planned activities on behalf of the Andalusian Council for Culture to celebrate the `Trennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' (2006-2008). The aim is to commemorate the fiftyth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize of Literature and the day of death of the two.
Thus, 'the Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' will be completed with the new edition of this work, with the international congress held in New York, with the restoration of the house museum of Juan Ramón Jiménez-Zenobia and with the hiking exhibition `Juan Ramón Jiménez: `Aquel chopo de luz', which was opened in May and after which it was in different places in Andalusia, now reached New York and presented in the course of the international congress.
The Andalusian Council for Culture has also received eight hundred copies of `Diario de un poeta recién casado', published by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso. The aim is to make the person and the work of the Andalusian world poet more famous.
The USA can imagine badly without Paul Newman
`Sometimes God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them.'
This sentence came from actress Sally Field, who worked with him in 'Sensation reporter', and from the American cinema, which was then held in the penitentiary, came from all over the Americas to Newman with his enthusiasm and followed her.
Now see what she cost him to give him Oscar.
And when he retired in 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
Nevertheless, this was a big blow for everyone.
`What one sometimes feels is much more than an expression, and now I have lost a great friend', said Robert Redford crying, `my life and my country were the greatest draughts of his life.'
No one was afraid of making or exaggerating himself.
As a 'father' of cinema and fatherland, he died in a sad moment, in which fear of terrorists and the market collapse prevails, in which the American-American's self-esteem has fallen to the hopeless search for reasons to regain dignity.
If in this hard time without virtue only a few people you can admire remain, then you don't necessarily have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he embodied almost a Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered various losses as well as gains: from the foundation, which committed itself to the fight against drugs and in honor of his son from the first marriage, who died of overdose, was founded up to his own brand of homemade and organic products.
All of this is a gift for the country in which it took a lot of effort to resist a deadly culture of nutrition.
A wide wave of wonderment strikes at home over Hollywood without regard to nationalities and nationality.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only one person died but all the era.
The Englishman Sam Mendes, film director and Oscar award winner, said that working with Newman was not more or less than the top of his career.
Russell Crowe, the evil boy who came from Australia, dared to label Newman as his greatest inspiration.
'We have left the largest of us all,' George Clooney confirmed, perhaps one of the few who today trust trying to live as Paul Newman lived: to maintain high demands on justice, to lead a responsible private life far away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or not even possible in today's media jungle.
But there's someone who's trying, and Paul Newman was an example of that.
He divorced once and was married to Joanne Woodward for fifty years, which he was faithful to, although there were certainly many possibilities not to be.
`Why should I eat a hamburger on the street when I file at home?' he often shaved himself.
In heaven he will be proud that on earth his daughters have the same opinion as his fans, which is not necessarily common in America.
'From all the major roles he played, to none he was as proud as that of the faithful husband, the loving father, the attentive grandfather, and that of the philanthropist,' they say.
For the Olympic Games, the streets in Madrid are inadequate.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to organize some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the failure for 2012, it may be 2016.
But I wonder, 'Are we prepared for it?'
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say it's not true!
It was described as a perfect road, and my assessment of it was the worst road with everything in it and in it.
Of course, this is a lot of nonsense, if one were to pay attention to the evaluation and I could check it, something that clearly would not have happened.
But, let's go through everything from the beginning.
The nonsense starts with the ticket pick that allows you to go first.
It doesn't seem bad to me either, but if they let you go, then they should give you everything (including chip to avoid the traffic jams).
So don't.
Here they only let you get the ticket (the first nonsense that consists of just going there) and (after an infinite queue) there is the surprise! The T-shirt was only in the size `S' (a second nonsense because I needed the size XL)
Where do we live?
Or is it that after the crisis it was decided to buy only small, much cheaper shirts made of less fabric?
Well, things like these are a small thing compared to the days on the road.
Apart from having to go very early to get the chip, there's already a waiting queue of at least 15 minutes and, besides, you have to leave the backpack.
Waiting took more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible in the case of a road where 11,000 people are expected.
Finally, as it was expected, the road started and we had not left our backpacks before, even if once it had been successful, but getting them back would have been more difficult.
In addition, in this 40-minute waiting period it looked like rain, so that there was a temptation to organize a popular uprising and attack the house.
I think tomorrow will certainly have some 500 people's pneumonia and some like me will not even appear in time at the classification because of this chip I got, I can already think that the output has been stamped incorrectly.
Of course, if you were to ask me about a perfect road, this road would never happen to me.
That's how I think we'll dream about a city that's well prepared for the Olympic Games.
Microsoft looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the `Emerging Technology Conference', hosted by MIT, Microsoft presented the progress of the new image recognition system and human interaction, an essence of artificial intelligence without much intelligence, but capable of performing some primitive tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, this is a route planner to move on the campus of the company).The system observes what it hears during entertainment.
Thanks to a camera and a form and facial recognition system, this `receptionist' can recognize how many people are in the room who they are and even remember how they were dressed, it can listen and understand the keywords of their entertainment.
It can also assign the persons present to the groups after the discussions.
In the presentation video, `the receptionist' notices a third person, but she understands that this person is not part of the group that leads her conversation, and that neither is a company employee.
She asks if the person here wants to visit someone and answers that she will listen soon.
Everything without the blue screenshot
Impressive
This is certainly the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example on the next version of its operating system Windows.
This week we talked very superficially about Microsoft's change of strategy.
Windows 7 will be faster and not have so many integrated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if the computers were equipped with the most necessary, rather than filling them with the commercial garbage, they would work five times faster. Human, Steven, that will only be for the few.
Everything is only one thing to note when considering that Microsoft added some feature or other and `extras' in Windows versions.
The change in direction is worth changing
Microsoft is right, the operating system gradually loses meaning, just like the software.
When Google Chrome appeared in the web, it was part of the theory that it was the first step of Google to compete with Windows.
Skilledly, many point out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system, as an indispensable part, will always be necessary to allow hardware and software to function at the same time.
The operating system fulfills the function that can be compared to the function of its wife or husband when it comes to sharing something with his mother-in-law.
That's right.
The system will never disappear, but one must think of its 'death', not as an absolute but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is confirming this idea.
People pay less attention to the operating system every time, for that more to the web browser.
The computer is only started to run the Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and every day we spend more time surfing than in the environment of the `window'.
What is half of the applications available in the computer?
Less is more
And Windows 7 must be more compact, much more compact than Vista.
Lighter, not so exaggerated, less complicated.
Microsoft's interest is more about integrating its online services, which can eventually become the alternative to Google.
In reality, they need that, no doubt, and I'm bringing a small example of that.
I took the photo from this place in Redmond, in one of the recreation rooms for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month.
On the refreshment drink machine a sign is attached: `Your search. Our future'. It prints out a request to use its own tool for online search.
In 2006, an independent study concluded that the 66% of employees at Microsoft used Google for network research.
By the way, last week was also confirmed that the new version of the Windows Mobile 7 was slowed down.
It will not appear at the beginning, but at the end of 2009, rather even 2010.
Microsoft is looking for the possibility to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 to the mark at the same time.
Every day the phone turns into a computer.
The Android and the iPhon are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso owned it in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio had this brand in `Blood Diamond' by Edward Zwick, just like Al Pacino in `The Pate' by Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time, it belongs to the clothing of a well-built pastor.
When we start counting the countless stars, we can take back to the picture of a very powerful man with a pointed beard, which had raised heavy weights in a walking circle.
Basically taken, this is a typical male t-shirt made of cotton, sleeveless and waistless.
The English-speaking people call it `tank'. Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles, however, exceeds all other brands.
First of all, because of its great name, although it is called in the narrow circle `Marcel'. Legend tells that the name origin is connected to sports and originated from boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
`La Marcel' surpasses all due to its excellent cotton, because of its distinct unisex cut and is characterized by a small Belgian flag (to be recognized) that these T-shirts have as detail on the neckline.
And attention, the Belgian company not only focuses on the production of `tanks'.
They also have college sweatshirts, boxer retro, cardigans and cashmere, cotton pants, t-shirts with stripes, babies, mini shorts
Modelled and comfortable underwear.
Although, it is very bad to use it as underwear.
You're very attractive.
`I want to be a young mother; to the candidate I don't worry about it'
Her great appearance with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monatica Cruz is graceful, but full of joy of life.
Currently, brothers and sisters Gruz are taking their new activity very seriously in fashion.
For Monthica, this means much more than for some pretty and rich girls who keep their reputation.
She was in Paris at the promotion of the Mango company, moved her residence there and also made the presentation of the most important awards in fashion sponsored by the Spanish fashion house.
Merciful and shy, winner on the short routes.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection for this autumn/winter season, which my sister Penélope and I designed for Mango, and I also attended the presentation of the second edition of `Mango Fashion Awards' and took part in dinner at Valentinos Honors.
A very intensive working time, which is exciting at the same time.
You work for the Spanish house, what is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for Mango?
My sister, both I and I are fascinated by the cinema of the 50s and 60s; there we find many ideas.
I am happy to go through a city and observe women dressed as they combine their clothes, I often do.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I believe, but finally, everything is happening in one and these areas have many similarities.
Since I was little, I was excited about the clothes; I always wanted to go to my grandmother to wrap around my aunt's clothes and see her clothes.
It was great to go almost better than a leisure park.
Even later, as a dancer, I always tried to pay attention to the clothing.
You know, we dancers like to have our own style in lessons and rehearsals so we can look into the mirror and feel good about it.
As an actress, when you get the costume, you put yourself in the real performer role.
Finally, everything is connected, it is so, much respect for the costume designer and her professionalism.
Recently, you turned 30, didn't you fall into a crisis?
Oh, that's it.
I feel better than I ever felt like thirty years ago.
I find the woman to be mature, has experience and can enjoy life with less error.
I'm not afraid of my biological watch.
I've done the things I've wanted to do since I was a child, and that has given me a lot of inner joy.
So, you're thinking about becoming a mother, aren't you?
For a long time I've known that I'm going to be a mother because that's what my body needs, and I also want to be a young mother; I don't want to miss that.
As far as the candidate is concerned, I'm not worried.
I will convey great happiness to my child and educate it with a lot of love.
As far as film art is concerned, you keep in mind the work you have participated in and the last year has been filmed.
That is exactly the way it is and I would like it to be presented to the public.
I, as a woman who comes from the theatre, am very impatient and restless and want to have everything at once, which of course cannot be immediate.
I very much wish that `La última hora' and `En busca de la tumba de Cristo' are listed for the first time.
Let's see how they like you
A few days ago, you appeared on the race with Naomi Campbell, right?
All right, don't say that.
It's not like I went on the race to model.
Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for some time, has simply called me and invited me to London to take part in a parade for the charity event of her organization 'Women for a better world' and the clothes we show. I know that two clothes from our collection have been auctioned for mango to collect the money for Naomi's NGO.
People don't know Naomi's good heart.
Many things are told about them, I, as the one she knows, would tell you that they don't vote.
Nevertheless, I will support this good thing in which it is involved.
She asked me to take part in the parade for this big-hearted thing, but when she comes and asks me to make a handstand, I will do the same.
To support women in the Third World, whatever is needed.
The drivers, who can be relapsed due to the alcohol level, will have to install the `Alcolock'.
The Authority orders that the driver, who had three official penalties due to the alcohol level, install in his car this system which forbids him from starting the car in the drunk state. If he is alcoholicated, then the car does not jump on.
The initiative has been announced in June last month and is already part of the report of the Public Attorney General. According to their information, it is a pilot project that will last for a year.
The purpose is the resocialisation of the driver, which is why he gets a course for the re-training of the traffic behavior.
The Department of Transport and the Foundation of the Technical Institute for the Safety of the Automobiles will also participate in this in addition to the Attorney General's experience.
According to statistics, between 30-75% of car drivers, who were displayed more than once because of driving under alcohol influence, returned to tax.
The `alcolock' would prevent this because it is a system connected to the car, it measures the alcohol content in the breathed air and prevents car start if the driver has made alcohol test; or if an alcohol concentration is detected that is higher than permitted.
It costs more than 1 000 euros, the cost is borne by the one who imposes the penalty.
In this context, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that cars equipped with these devices would prevent up to 65% of the regulatory violations as early as the first year after its introduction.
In Spain it is calculated that 115 lives could be saved annually.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to engage in this conduct before it became a criminal offence.
And in order to facilitate their implementation, legislative reform can be implemented along the usual path, and yet a reform of the basic law is required, which is necessary for the prosecution process.
The equipment is still in the Spanish markets, in no business available, although it has already been installed in some commercial vehicles and vehicles of public transport.
The House of Representatives will vote tomorrow because of the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, which proposes to install this system in school buses, which has already been done in France.
In Mexico and without `peep-toes'
With British punctuality, at 17:40 a.m., at the time planned by the program, next to the Presidential Hangar of Benito Chihuahua de México DF Airport, the plane of the Spanish Air Force landed with the prince and prince of Asturias.
The sun went down, but her rays still forced her to use her hand as an umbrella to see the royal pair that came out of the plane.
Directly on the Gangway: the Spanish Ambassador and other authorities
A few hours before, I had asked a taxi driver on the street whether he knew that the prince and the prince of Asturias visited the city to formalize the official trip.
- Ah, very good, so, you can't take people at the airport at this time. You're from here or so
No, she's the Spaniard, but she's been here for a couple of years.
- Well, very good.
But the Mexican press knows exactly who the prince and the prince of Asturias are and knows the importance of the journey.
There are many who are waiting in the hangar of the airport and on the red carpet, also military protection of 27 Marine soldiers, giving the salve of honor.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in marine blue, and she, the prince, with long hairs blown by the wind, without ordinary 'peep-toes', may have been told that a thunderstorm is expected in DF.
Before entering the hall, they smile and are prepared for the photographers in which the official sequence is waiting.
At the door of the hotel, where they are accommodated, one of the four largest in the city, she is waiting for a reporter from Mexican television who likes to make jokes.
The best premium of fashion
Probably there was no more suitable place in the world than Paris to present a premium of fashion and there were probably no substantially excellent fashion designers and Bonvivants than Valentino.
Mango presents the second edition of the fashion competition `el Bóton-Mango Fashion Adwards' for the promotion and international increase of young fashion talents.
This is awarded with cash prize of EUR 300 000.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, saw her drawings yesterday in the show window of the Mango branch on Boulevard Haussmann Number 54 in Paris and almost wept because of the emotional excitement.
By the way, this is the second largest business of the company in Europe and has recently been opened. It offers a sales area of 1 335 m2.
The largest business is located in London.
So many events have happened that are associated with the fact that you want to thank the fashion designer Valentino for his jury chair at the competition. Everything ended with a luxury dinner in Opera National de Paris.
In the surroundings of many famous people, the board table organized by Mango seemed spectacular.
Nati, with the heavy heart that was broken by the pain because his brother died recently, was tearing himself together. He drew the suit from the fashion house and owned some jewelry items from ELAH that were stunning. He held himself at the arm of his son Luis, who is almost two meters tall and accompanied Valentino at the dinner, to his honor.
Andik, the owner and lord of the Mango house, welcomed the guests and was such a cavalier, so that he ended up with the Baron of Rotschild without jackets, because jackets they lent to the ladies.
Mondica Cruz, has rushed to the store and had a pants and a shirt which she modelled herself, and to dinner she wore a long, black sexy dress. At a night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us a room for ballet samples, so she got excited, remembered the old times, took a rod and made a kind of 'grand ply'.
Inés Sastre, did not join the walk through the palace's premises, but before that she had shown us the photos of her son on the phone.
The next morning we were able to look forward to the presence of Oliver Martínez, a personality that always evokes a stormy enthusiasm, and to Jon Travolta, who after arriving (with his own sheets and towels) at Hotel Internacional in Paris, asked in advance to have a room without smells.
The stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh la la, that's life.
1001 Rat vs. Stress
There are not 1000, but one more way to forget chaotically our fast daily life.
And if there are few, they are all gathered in a book in which it says how to relax. The book comes into the book's proceedings on September 30.
The alarm clock is a punishment when it rings at 7 o'clock in the morning, but even worse, the idea appears to come back into the hectic rhythm that the current life requires.
The office is called the tension and the computer that causes the back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are not one and not two methods to combat the daily exhaustion and problems of the workplace.
The number increases, however, not more and not less than 1001.
In addition to yoga performances, the classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott presents in the book the full list of possibilities adapted to the taste and time of each individual.
The work against stress is called `1001 ways to relax' and thus the calm that the book conveys comes into the bookshops of the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
Who thinks that it is impossible to achieve peace in the areas such as workplace with the help of personal contacts, so this handbook refutes such faith.
In addition, the methods are offered as to how to stay in contact with nature or the 100% natural recipes proposed that lead to relaxation.
If the adrenaline in your vein no longer rises to restore balance of the body and the stress has become a problem, the moment has come to add to the sofa, turn off the brain and focus on reading.
Talking In Sleep
Some kids talk at night
I mean not those who wake up and tell us something that happened on the day before, but the children who talk during sleep.
If it happens to you for the first time, in the best case, you will be scared, but in reality this has no meaning.
This is a positive sleep disorder called speaking in sleep.
It is widespread, especially among children and adolescents.
Certainly, more than one of you was told that you spoke at night.
This phenomenon can occur occasionally (one time in life, for example, as during high fever), or regularly (every day, once a week, once a month), the next day the child can remember nothing.
There is no single reason that causes this phenomenon.
Often, relationships with other appearances are sought in sleep, such as nightmares, panic fear at night, enuresis noctura (bed noses at night), talking in sleep, but there is no reason for it.
As we mentioned earlier, it can be on very high fever, stress situations or over-requirement.
In any case, this is a little researched phenomenon.
The frequency with which it occurs is very variable.
It may be that one speaks quietly in individual words, whispers or it can be quite an opposite (screaming, crying, long discussions ).
In cases where the expression is very intense, it is recommended that the child be monitored and consulted with a specialist to see if a problem exists, which causes anxiety and thus results.
We have said that it is a positive disorder, so it is not treated, whether it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, with sleep apnoea or with stress).
What you can do is perform a series of simple prevention measures:
Try not to raise the child before sleeping.
So, calm game for the child to choose and avoid stressful TV programs that are terrible and too wild.
Relaxation methods can be used to help the nervous children who are recommended to relax to get some inner rest.
This helps the child sleep quietly.
Once talking occurs in sleep, try to keep calm.
Remember that it is harmless for the child, and the next day it won't be possible to remember anything that happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake it up.
This is useless, because the child is unconscious, so you will get out of sleep.
Although the child speaks, it sleeps, so it rests.
Remembering that when it appears to be scary after a few appearances, it is recommended that you let yourself be consulted or find out what reason the child is afraid of.
When they understand what it says (which is not so usual), the child does not put pressure on them to make an appointment and get more information.
So you won't be able to achieve anything because when the child is sleeping, it's unconscious and can't think about it.
Moreover, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it is dreaming and why it says that, therefore, they are careful with the interpretation of the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Maybe it doesn't tell the child that you hear it at night and know its secrets.
Not even as a joke.
That's causing a lot of fear.
So, don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's a moment that takes just a few minutes.
Illhouses ... finally
After a long thirst, Illhäuseren on the field is finally back on success course.
Without great effort, the yellow blacks played numerous goals and managed to implement one of them, thus winning the game.
The pace of this encounter, at which the attackers had trouble showing their ability, was not very high.
After a first attack by the guest captain Kauffmann, whose distance shot was almost at an angle, Illhausen was supposed to dominate the game with ease, and he managed to alternately start with a distance shot, then brain with a high pass, and Romain with a shot with the foot tip to challenge the defence of Denmark.
The opposing team blocked in the middle of the field and left only the lively riahi at the top of the storm.
The beginning of the second half should be decisive with initially two Torchancs fought by Riahi and Temporal, and immediately afterwards with the first gate for the Illhouses by Marais, which was exactly right to resume a ball that had been resisted by Diebold in a first attempt.
But the ill-heusian goalkeeper should not be able to enjoy his luck for long and be sent to the bank about twelve minutes later, which meant that his teammates had to continue to play underage.
Denmark, however, did not take advantage of this and did not face any major problems for an ill-haeous elf, who only turned back a little to 'denied' their defense, except in the very last seconds of the game, in which the ball passed very close to the latte after a big mess.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before he flies to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make another trip to Britain.
In view of the determined attitude of fishermen who blocked the access to several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the French President decided to enter the port of Guilvinec in Finistère on Tuesday morning in order to meet with their representatives.
The latter promises to receive him `with a constructive mind', and hopes that he will come with `concrete suggestions'.
The President's visit takes place at the same time as a General Assembly of the Crisis Committee, which was established by the Breton fishermen to implement measures in view of the extreme increase in diesel price, which has reached a record value of an average of more than EUR 1.14 per litre.
According to the press spokesperson of Elyséepalast David Martinon, 'the President will discuss possible solutions with them to help their company become competitive again, and to secure the working conditions and payment of seafarers'.
Sarkozy is expected by fishermen with determination.
Tuesday morning, they led protest marches in Morbihan and Calvados, which caused traffic jams of almost ten kilometres in length.
The seaport of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-île did not break.
The Quiberon peninsula was bordered by a barrier.
Already on Monday the sailors gave expression of their determination by burning tires and pallets from early morning before the fuel deposits of the ports of Brest and Lorient, while in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc demonstrations were held.
The movement extended to other ports of the Atlantic coast and the Channel, such as Sables d`Olonnes, in Vendée, where the fishmen did not drive out, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the maneuvers of the merchant ships.
The fishermen of Turballe and Croisic in Loire-Atlantique resolved the blockade of the major total refinery in Donges in the evening.
The Bologne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the course of the meeting at the Ministry on Wednesday before deciding on possible measures.
In fact, the crisis committee in Guilvinec must decide on the reactions to the movement and its participation in the discussion planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the representatives of the national fisheries committee who did not support their movement.
'The strike will continue', because 'the fishermen will not give up in any point' and 'will not go to Paris', for example, Liliane Cariou, President of the Fisheries Committee of Lorient, announced.
The professional fisherman who does not pay taxes on diesel currently costs about 50 cents, but they believe that the limit of profitability of a boat can only be reached with diesel for less than 30 cents per litre.
Paul Newman the Wonderful
The unforgettable performer from 'Butch Cassidy and the Kid' died at the age of 83 of the consequences of cancer in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford or Sam Mendes were adopted by the cinema legend and the dedicated actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008
This year, the Brazilian aircraft manufacturer expects 215 aircraft delivered, despite the threat of recession, to be a threat to the world economy.
Embraer, the fourth largest aircraft manufacturer in the world, maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, confirmed his president Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer expects a lot from the Chinese market, especially for his aircrafts of size from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider dispensing more than 15% of its assets
According to the Financial Times' Sunday edition, the insurer American International Group, who was financially supported by the US Monetary Authority, considers spending more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion that was put before it.
AIG is prepared to pay the sale of a large part of its business, beyond its insurance at international level and its pension provision in the United States.
According to FT, the Board of Directors met Sunday evening to check possible sales.
No confirmation was obtained at the AIG.
Among the assets AIG might separate from include its aircraft leasing branch International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% share of Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate assets and investments in private equity, FT continues.
As regards these sales, no final decision has been taken, the FT continues.
AIG must quickly make sales in order to repay the loans over 85 billion that the Federal Reserve has granted it, including the risk that the American authorities will receive 80% of their capital and lose current shareholders to the same extent.
Analysis Historical Paris of the meeting Historical morning meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported on Monday, after the House of Representatives had rejected Paulson's plan to rescue the banks, a historic case of the rates: The Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a loss that had never been there of about 800 points, and the Naday 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) has fallen by 777.68 points to 10,365.45 points.
As far as the points are concerned, the strongest case of its history (684.81 points) was previously recorded on 17 September 2001, day of trade decline following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
According to the final balance figures, the Naday Index, mainly technology relating to, dropped by 199.61 points to 1,983.73, and the widely used Standard&Poors 500 index by 8.81% (106.85 points) to 1,106.55 points.
After the unexpected rejection of the plan to save banks by the Chamber of Deputies, which would once again allow for some stability in the markets, Wall Street, which had already been attacked at the beginning of the quarter, collapsed.
By 228 votes against, and 205 against, the Members refused the financial secretary Henry Paulson the funds for which he had requested.
Almost two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
'Here a bad picture is being put in circulation, which represents Congress as incapable of adopting a plan', said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
`This shows how much the market counted on this plan,' she added, and fears that a project 'too late' will come in several days.
`If the project is actually condemned to failure (...), it will be a quick task of the Fed (the US Central Bank, Anm. d. Red.) and other central banks to deal with the crisis, which would limit the credit conditions even more', Brian Bethune, economic leader at Global Insight warned.
And Miss Piegza emphasized, highlighting the feeling of extreme urgency even more, 'that every day, which scatters, the ruin of a financial enterprise' in the United States 'brings with it'.
After Washington Mutual's bankruptcy on Friday, the American authorities planned to purchase Wachovia's banking business through its competitor Citigroup.
In Europe the crisis suddenly accelerated and led to emergency measures in favour of banks in the UK, in the Benelux countries, Iceland and Germany, an indication that markets are 'not just an American but a global crisis', added the analyst of the FTN Financial.
The market for basic goods has grown greatly.
The revenue of the government tax within ten years has decreased from 3.632% to 3.827% on Friday evening, and the revenue within 30 years last evening from 4.161% to 4.357% on Friday evening.
Obama, winner after points in the first TV Duel
The first debate of the two candidates for the White House on Friday followed another one to find out who was the winner of it, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, the QGs announced their own victory in this television duel to both Republicans and Democrats, which was to be pursued by a third of the American families.
The political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCain's performance, though quite obvious, was not `brillant' enough to enable him to stop his decline in election polls five weeks before the presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, of which a poll was published on Saturday, which says Obama has five points ahead (49% to 44% for McCain), believes that democracy clearly makes the better figure.
With the still undisclosed voters, so those on whom it is now coming, Obama emerged as winner of the polls with 39%, while according to a CBS survey, 25% of them see McCain as a winner.
Obama should be able to confirm his lead on Thursday with the good performance expected by his competitor Joseph Biden at first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin
`It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
She has good instincts, but warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
The seventeen-year-old McCain did not stop his indisputable experience in the field of foreign policy, clearly stressing the 'naïvity' of his opponent with regard to these issues, which were the focus of this first television channel.
`Senator Obama does not seem to understand that...', he emphasized several times.
'I don't think Senator Obama has the necessary experience and the necessary knowledge to become President', he also assured.
An attack point that has been being preached in the Republican elections since yesterday.
Obama himself stressed that he represents the future.
He expressed himself in a short and precise manner without being brought out of the text.
He focused on his ability to make good decisions and to renew the image the world has of the United States.
'McCain has still not understood Obama already', this weekend put aside a democratic campaign in which Republicans were accused of not having grasped the full extent of the crisis that is taking place on the 'Americans off the road'.
'During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot of things to say about me, but nothing about you,' Obama rebuked 20,000 people yesterday, who had gathered in the torrential rain at an election in North Carolina.
He did not even mention the words 'middle level' or 'worker'. 'The financial crisis gives Obama, which the Americans consider most appropriate, even to save the economy at the edge of the abyss, a clear advantage.
'The coming week could represent a decisive turning point', estimated yesterday by the influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
The democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton government, compared the 'good economic instincts' of Obama to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the democratic candidate, the current crisis is 'the final judgment of an eight-year-old bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain'.
After again stressing that he would even manage to reduce taxes for 95% of Americans despite the fluctuations on Wall Street, the Illinois Senator pointed out that the creation of a possible energetic independence of the country and the promotion of renewable energies, together with the introduction of a health insurance system, had a top priority for him.
McCain, on the other hand, wanted to build a plant of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates will consider the issues raised by the plan to save the financial market of more than 700 billion dollars (470 billion euros), which was adopted by Congress last evening and is extremely unpopular to the people.
`Have you noticed that a choice took place in Minsk?'
Youths and oppositionaries demonstrated Sunday evening at the main square of the Belarusian capital in order to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evenings since the closure of the electoral venues in Minsk's marketplace to protest the fraudulent nature of the parliamentary elections.
Although no results had yet been announced, numerous young people had come to demonstrate against the power of Alexander Lukachenko: 'The dictator is to withdraw'.
Some admit that they didn't even choose: 'What does it benefit if they do eh with my voice what they want,' says a youth.
They do not believe that the regime, which has shown itself to foreign observers in the best light to resume negotiations with the European Union, is ready to take a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the non-dividing of visas for 40 leading Belarusian personalities and the raising of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered clean by the observers.
According to the opposition, they were not.
'We were excluded from the electoral commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the census', deplored Juri Potemkin, the press spokesperson of the Union's democratic forces, a heterogeneous merger of twelve parties.
This is a cosmetic change, emphasizes Alexander Milinkiewitsch, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-Europe movement, because it is important who counts the votes, and with us this is the executive.
If Members of the Opposition move to Parliament, then because they have been appointed, and not elected.
But their entry into Parliament can mean broadcasting time on television, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals. '
The opposition is thus guilty of getting involved in the political game, because 'the dialogue with the European Union must be opened.
Because if our economy, which Russia owes strongly to, is in crisis and we do not reform ourselves, we are at risk of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
Well, we want to be independent.
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has followed the election, does not recognize the election as valid.
It stresses that the voter participation figures appear too high and that the extension of the vote in advance (26% of Minsk voters) has paved the way for any kind of manipulation.
`Have you noticed that an election took place?, the leader of the Social Democrats Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners to be released in August of this year.
There was no one in the polls.
And there will be a maximum of five members of the opposition in Parliament, those who are most in line with the government's ideas.
The silence of the night falls again over the Oktoberplatz.
On television, President Lukachenko and the members of the central electoral commission congratulated themselves on their success.
Negotiation - From the blood that became safe again
Hema-Quebec celebrated the 10th anniversary of her founding yesterday, and her president, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to rejoice because Hema-Quebec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood banks in the world.
And, above all, she regained the public's confidence, which had been severely shaken by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As we know, the national blood reserves administered by the blood donation service of the Canadian Red Cross were contaminated during the 1980s with the HI virus and the hepatitis C virus.
In the light of this drama and public dissatisfaction, in February 1994, the Government of Canada launched a public investigation, led by Judge Horace Krever, which aimed to shed light on the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy and to draw up guidelines to prevent a further disaster of this kind.
While Judge Krever was still reluctant to submit his report, at that time several provinces placed a committee on the legs, whose goal was to develop a new system for the administration of blood vessels in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this mission.
According to the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two blood banks were established in Canada: Hema-Quebec, which is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian blood company to provide the other provinces and the two territories.
`1998, when Hema-Quebec took up her work, hardly 38% of the people had confidence in the blood conservation system in Quebec, Dr. Décary recalls.
The situation was discouraging.
Because of the enormous efforts made to improve the safety of the blood vessels and by working in this area during the following years, we have regained the confidence of the public,' she says, before she proudly stressed that almost 94% of the population of Quebec now had confidence in Hema-Quebec at the beginning of 2008.
Dr. Décary, however, retains in the consciousness that 'trust is something extremely fragile'.
Since its establishment on 28 September 1998, Hema-Quebec has acted on the principle of caution.
At this time we experienced the occurrence of numerous cases of the human form of cattle madness in Europe, a new type of Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease, this woman, who has been in charge since its founding in 1998.
`And we did not have the slightest idea of whether this disease could be transmitted over the blood.
So we called on one of the main guidelines of the Krever and Gélineau reports, which are said to be exclusive measures, if one does not know and if a disease only progresses slowly, as is obviously the case with Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease, which is expressed by a degeneration of the brain, which inevitably leads to death.
So in April 1999, there was no blood of people who had remained in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
Well, a few years ago, without any doubt, this disease has been proven to be transmitted over the blood.
So this event has shown us that the principle of caution we applied has a sense of purpose.
In 1999, a much more accurate technique for detecting HIV appeared on the market: the nucleic acid (NST) tests, which allow the presence of the virus itself directly in the donor's blood, and not that of the antibody against the virus, as was the case with the previous tests.
The NST allowed to shorten the incubation time between the time when the person was infected and that when the first viruses can be detected by our techniques in the blood, the specialist explains.
This time could be reduced to a duration of less than a week.
Thus, the risk that some donors could be infected without knowing it, and one could not recognize it, was significantly reduced.
These improvements allowed a significant reduction in the risk of transmission of AIDS via a blood transfusion.
Nowadays, one of 12 million people are at risk of receiving HIV infected blood.
'In other words, this means that 12 million blood cans would have to be distributed before someone gets infected with HIV.
Since Hema-Quebec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood cells each year, it would take more than 24 years before a case of transmission of HIV via a blood vessel.
I believe that you can feel comfortable nowadays when you get a blood transfusion or write down to restore your health', says Hema-Quebec's management chief.
`Our challenge for the next ten years is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen can get into the system.
Only last year did the Chikungunya virus appear on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by insects over the blood.
We need to monitor uninterrupted', Dr Décary continues before she emphasizes that Hema-Quebec, in addition to a safe supply, must also provide sufficient supplies.
'The need increases because the population ages.
As anticancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also affects the blood donors network, with an average of only 3% of Quebec's blood donors.
Every healthy person who is 18 years of age or older and meets the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, that is, six times a year.
On average, 14% of those who provide their blood are not accepted because of AIDS or malaria, for example, and those who have traveled to a country where malaria has been spread for one year are excluded from blood donation.
This 3% enables us to obtain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Lack of supplies are very rare.
But it is necessary to renew the members of this donor network when they get older and can no longer donate blood.
It is hard to convince people to donate blood, but especially to keep it and to make it become regular donors.
Life is so hectic today that you rarely find time to spend an hour on blood donation', regrets Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Quebec not only supplies blood, but also human tissues, including bone transplants, heartbeats, eyeballs and skin, which are used almost exclusively in severe burns.
These tissues are examined, processed and frozen before they are stored in Hema-Quebec, which also manages the only Quebec Public Fountain Blood Bank.
In the umbilical cord, previously considered as biomedical waste, there is rich blood in stem cells that can serve to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
'A few weeks ago we celebrated the insertion of our thousandth umbilical cord blood sample, and we plan to decrease more than a thousand annually.
'We should probably start making it available for transplants at the beginning of next year', explains Dr Décary, who describes this program of umbilical cord blood loss as very popular.
'Many mothers are convinced not to have access to it' because Hema-Quebec lacks the means to offer this complex and costly program in all Quebec hospitals.
Soccer - Impact in the semi-final
Montreal's impact yesterday, thanks to a 3 to 1 win (4 to 3 with all goals) against the Seattle sounders at the second and decide to play the quarter-final series at the Saputo Stadium, where the total gate ratio was counted, qualified for the semi-final round of the first league of the USL.
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro shot the decisive goal in the ninetieth minute of the game.
After a first half-time without goal for both one side and the other, midfielders David Testo and Rocco Plancentino landed the other hit for the Montreal Formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who set out for the Sounders by Matt Jordan.
Let us remember that in the first game of the pre- and replay series on Friday Impact the Starfire Complex in Tukwila had brought in a 2 to 1 defeat in a suburb of Seattle.
In the semi-final, impact is measured with the Whitecaps from Vancouver.
On Saturday evening, Thunder was able to balance a 3 to 1-deficit in Minnesota with a 4 to 3 win, but the Whitecaps still entered the semi-final round with a total tor ratio of 5 to 4.
Impact will probably have to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the game series are set today.
In short - victor by Kovalev
The number one trio of the Canadian team is ready to attack the season.
Last evening, Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec, and Andrej Kostitsyn launched the attack on the Panther from Florida with a storm fire, leading to a 3 to 2 victory.
Costitsyn, the star of the encounter, shot a gate, Plekanec delivered two templates and Kovalev turned a pass into this victory game, the fourth of the tricolors into six preparatory games.
Kovalev won the victory by shooting the only gate of the entire shooting.
`I'm not ready yet, warned the Russian.
I need another game to feel comfortable.
`He's been too fixed on it in the first half of the day, Guy Carbonneau noticed.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He got a stormy seizure.
Charest sets to the north
The Prime Minister does not exclude taking up elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the Liberal Party General Assembly ended, Jean Charest joined Jean-Talon in Quebec yesterday, where the new Minister of Health Yves Bolduc (Left) tried to be elected in the present partial election.
'Move the course of our last great border in the north': This is the long-term goal presented yesterday by Jean Charest with visual means at the General Assembly of the Quebec Liberal Party in Levis, following the guidelines.
During his lecture a kind of picture mill was projected behind him.
On three huge screens spectacular images of hydropower plants, mines, viewed from Quebec in 'Google Maps', maps, etc.
Large resources as during the electoral period.
In contrast to the press, the Prime Minister refused to exclude him from holding the elections this autumn, even if he said that his schedule was very full.
The 'Plan North' is the fourth element of a 'vision', which the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, namely that of a 'new economic area', which provides an agreement with France on labour force, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Although it has been frequently mentioned in the speech of the Prime Minister in recent times, the opening of the North - the northern area on the 49th latitude - has never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North was 'a jewel with enormous potential', but did not mention a date, no sums of investment or precise priorities for the coming projects.
A maximum of a few views on what could be worked on: mainly on water energy, on the forest, but especially on the mining sector, favoured by the growth of emerging countries and the renewal of public infrastructures.
According to Mr. Charests, the north has 'Nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds'.
This `area twice the size of France' `is near us, is in Quebec.
It's not just in our vicinity, it's in us', he stressed how to show clearly that he is looking for a national foundation.
Quebec grew very much by its connection with the north, he stressed: the road to gold in Abitibi, the technology of Quebec, the James Bay.
'It belongs to us, it is our future', he added, after he had put in a theatrical break to look at the huge card behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes part of Labrador, which Quebec has always asked for, said to the Prime Minister of the press.
`This is a traditional attitude that all governments pursued.
There is a border line at which there has been no agreement for a very long time when the opportunity is offered I will resume this attitude on behalf of the government,' he explained.
Moreover, 'with climate change we need to rethink our vision from the north', he explained and talked about the north-west passage, which will be feasible due to the ice melt all year round.
Against this new geopolitical background, the Prime Minister believes that it is precisely a duty to occupy this area.
And the inhabitants of the land, the natives and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would deal with them very carefully and that they would benefit from this project, especially the boys.
Two former ministers of various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former pecist deputies of Ungava) have already initiated consultations with about thirty communities.
A ministerial committee headed by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (transport and land estimates) takes an important place, has taken up the work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large assembly, 'not necessarily a summit', but an opportunity where 'you will create a common vision'.
The development of the North will continue to take place in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be 'discussed, regulated and environmentally sound', he promised.
Jean Charest described this 'vision' as if it were a continuation of the liberal Prime Minister who was in office before him.
`Like the liberals who were in office before us, we thought about turning the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.
This was, by the way, one of the constantly raised topics of the weekend, which was opened on Friday with a large cocktail party to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the takeover of the party leadership by Jean Lesage.
One of the decisions adopted is to rename Beauharnois' power plant into Adélard-Godbout-Staudamm.
`From Godbout, who created Hydro-Quebec, about reading, which achieved the silent revolution and the stateization of water electricity, to Bourassa, who made the James Bay, our party always knew how to determine the future,' said Jean Charest.
The press compared him to another conservative project, namely the 'Roads to the North' programme by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
With regard to the project Hydropower Staudamm Eastmain1a-Ruper, Mr Charest stressed that its commission for 2012.
'This remains among us, but I have intended to be there,' he entrusted his party members with what led up to those incidental storms.
In fact, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and certainly also in 2009, has not yet ruled out the possibility to hold an election this autumn, which is possible for him by law.
He stressed, however, that his schedule is full, especially because of a mission from the Council of the Community in China and a summit between Quebec and New York.
The Weekend General Assembly provided the liberal party leader with a platform of nationalist plans, mainly from 'the constitutional objectives' which were adopted without further delay: the PLQ specifically calls for the recognition of the ' particularity of Quebec' in the Constitution.
It also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Council of Canadian Broadcasting and Telecoms and to have a veto on the decisions taken in Quebec.
From the sides of the opposition, the guidelines of the Nord Plan were included with scepticism.
The head of the Québécois party, Pauline Marois, has again brought about the policy for the development of the Nord-du-Quebec, which the government introduced in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, refused to apply it.
If she had done it, 'we're going to be much further' today, Ms. Marois, on the side of her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election is taking place today) judged Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has agreed to support the adoption of a North Plan by the government.
'But what we want is that this isn't just a big idea,' said the party leader Sébastien Proulx, representing Mario Dumont, who is returning from vacation today.
Letters - A remote country
Mr. Vic Toews, ex-'Justiz' minister (which irony) at the Harper Cabinet, was to allow himself last summer to say about Louise Arbour that she was a 'shake' for Canada.
This woman, who has waged an unending struggle for justice and deserves all our admiration to cover up with dirt, expresses just as much about the people around the Prime Minister as about Stephen Parker himself.
We have to deal with a government that, as the only one from all the countries concerned, has not brought home its countryman caught in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that does not even take into account that Omar Khadr was still a youth when the things that were being imposed upon him happened.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, breaks its word and caused a child soldier to vegetate there under inhuman conditions.
The only one who turns to a judicial parody to assess the accused's guilt.
Let us remember that, above all, UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of Canadian Advocates advocate that Omar Khadr be brought home so that he can get a fair trial in Canada.
The same government also closes its eyes to torture: it is little interested that a young adult will certainly be mentally broken after so many years of suffering forever.
We are not yet aware of it, but we are experiencing here just a secret circumcision of our rights, our freedom and our 'democracy', this word that Harper constantly wears like a flag in front of him, and that sounds so empty from his mouth.
So the time has come when there is no morale left: one may arbitrarily abuse, torture and lock-in a Canadian citizen, all after the guise of a head of government, who is only supported by the minority until today (May he be a minority after 14 October...).
Many voters believe in finding their salvation at a party that preaches virtue, law, and order, but they do not see that this government has turned away from what was the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr Toews, lies in this ransom, and nowhere else.
Free Opinion - The Orwellian Speech of Barrick Gold
In her September 17th issue, Le Devoir published a letter by Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Vice General of the Canadian Gold Mine Barrick Gold.
This confirms, and follows an orwellian logic, that the world's largest gold-winning society was seeking to slander over six million against three authors and a small, medium-sized publishing house, with the aim of opening a 'public transparent debate'.
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, they do not judge the truth, especially in the case of slanderous charges, but the law.
As expected, this fundamental difference was completely weakened by Mr Garver.
For Barrick Gold is the best way to lead a public debate, driving everyone into ruin who dares to represent one of their opposite opinions.
Just as the process goes on, the authors and publishers of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defense and fight against an army of lawyers who are paid out of the almost inexhaustible pockets of gold mine with very unequal weapons.
The tactic of these unequal struggles is often to ruin the defenders in order to enforce a agreed-upon rule that makes the opposite possible and also to deter anyone who dares to deal with the question again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she would have had to present her view of things in front of public opinion.
In contrast, in many of the countries in which Barrick works gold, debates are usually held in Canada by the exchange of ideas and not by the batting hip.
So it would have been sufficient if the gold mine had revealed their books and documents and opened a real debate through the newspapers, media, publications and funding of independent audit teams that could have brought light to this question.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to have any confidence in public opinion and rejects the petitions and letters to support the authors of Noir Canada with a hand movement aside.
Could Mr Garver perhaps explain how he can at the same time ask for a 'public' debate, but he still disregards the opinions of this public?
It seems that this word in the world of the Vice-President includes only the generous lawyers, not the community of all Canadians; a very narrow view of the concept.
In a democracy, even slanderers have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - is that the public who supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada does so primarily because it rejects the brutal attitude of the gold mine.
This public is willing to listen to and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not in a framework that many perceive as a knel complaint (in the course of the 'public debate', Barrick Gold has just addressed a demand to the authors of Noir Canada, in which they require them not to use this term anymore...).
Apart from Mr Garver's surreal speech, Barrick Gold's complaint is a direct attack on freedom to academic research and truth finding that are fundamental to any democratic society.
It completely denies the right to quote credible sources and to discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible in a country like Canada to explore and discuss topics that do not please the rich companies of this world, who else can do that?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could lead them by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to answer.
The university environment that we belong to has long been able to deal with debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's disproportionate complaint clearly shows that, contrary to what she says, she has no desire for a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the university world, as well as for the public debate, and it will be time for governments to take measures that restrict this kind of unjustified action.
Wall Street rescue action - Democrats and Republicans understand each other
The Bush administration and the executive congresses, Republicans and Democrats alike, finally reached agreement yesterday on the most comprehensive economic recovery plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan to stop the financial crisis that has shaken Wall Street for months still needs to be adopted by the two chambers of congress.
The main contents are: a better control by Members on the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to secure the repayment of the public funds used, new provisions to limit the number of houses seized due to late payment and the right to monitor the salaries paid to senior employees of the assisted companies.
American Finance Secretary Henry Paulson, President of Nancy Pelosi’s Chamber of Deputies, and the Republican representatives present during the negotiations, Senator Judd Gregg, announced yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, the good news, after a two-day negotiating marathon.
'We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be market effective', said the representative of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson.
'It all happened to protect the real economy and the American people from the price crisis on Wall Street,' said the Democrat.
'This is the fundamental point: if we don't do this, the trauma, chaos and unrest will be enormous in the daily lives of Americans', the Republican Jew Gregg explained.
The negotiations had accelerated over the last two hours, for fear of the effect that would have had a further failure on investors' mood.
The deadline agreed was market opening this morning.
The two American presidential candidates, who had only recently taken part in the negotiations, showed themselves more as advocates of the agreement, but without failing to express their dissatisfaction that they had to be met in this extreme way.
The democratic Senator Barrack Obama insisted on the addition of certain provisions to agree, especially those designed to enable owners to keep their homes, and those concerning the salaries of senior employees of the state-saving companies.
'If the taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the lack of responsibility of certain persons, that is nothing to be congratulated on.
But these measures are necessary, he said on the American television stations.
When he was asked on another transmitter if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain replied: 'I would like to know the details first, but I hope so.
`The guiding principles that I have read [show] that this is one thing that we all need to digest, and with which we will be able to progress.
The option to do nothing is simply not acceptable', he said.
The 700 billion dollar plan is aimed at the money of taxpayers
It comes 14 months after a crisis, caused by the placement of a real estate bubble, which first led to the collapse of risk-rich mortgage loans (subprime) before expanding into more widespread bonds (PCAA), and finally into a freeze of financial power and the ruin of banks and money institutions.
A group of Republican MPs was the first attempt to reach agreement last week.
Since the Democrats accepted that certain 'toxic' assets of the societies are only to be secured by the government and not to be purchased, the Sackgasse is to be believed to escape.
In order to complete the perspective for all in Congress, one has also added a provision stating that if the government was to make losses with this programme within five years, it could then raise new taxes to recover its capital.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion, to which additional 100 billion can be added if the President considers it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion will have to be approved by Congress in a new vote.
In return for his help, Washington receives shares of the supported companies which dividends him in the case of profits and which can resell it when the storm is over.
The Federal Government will have the possibility to stop the filing procedures concerning housing linked to the property credits affected by this plan and also to set deadlines for repayment and settlements paid to senior employees of the companies concerned.
The developers of the plan would like the Chamber of Representatives to vote on it today, and the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all her efforts, it is not yet certain that her plan will get green light.
In fact, there were other votes against this project yesterday, both on the part of Republicans and on the part of Democrats.
'Ganz obviously does not understand us,' said Republican Scott Garett, a member of the Board's Finance Commission, to his voters.
`Yes, we have a big financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not those who insist on asking the taxpayers for cash.'
The democratic MEP Brad Sherman, head of a group in Congress called 'the Caucus of Skeptics', presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
'Four hundred excellent business professors, including three Nobel Laureates, have written us to tell us: We ask Congress not to let themselves be pressured, and carefully consider which way is to take,' he explained yesterday.
At the same time, we were again given evidence in Europe that this is a global crisis.
At an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion US dollars).
The entry of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it would refrain from buying up its competitor, which is in great difficulty since it lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion US dollars) in the crisis due to the risky real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
'This is not a lost money, said the Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
To compensate, we get a right to vote and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what the savers and households appreciate, now that uncertain times are announced. '
During this time, on the other side of the Channel, the British government was just about to make a bank in trouble from the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take all current loans from the Bank Bradford and Bringley, of which over 41 billion ($75.5 billion) from real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would purchase the branches and customer accounts of the UK bank.
After Northern Rock, Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank to state the British government since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of a committed icon
His beauty with the azure eyes was for a long time his trump, no one would say his weakness.
Did the American actor get rid of the narcissistic mirror with the charming smile?
Yes and no.
His fine feeling, his sensitivity, and an obvious talent must have kept him away from a position of power that brings the truly terrible monsters to the world.
But what a great endurance runner!
Paul Newman died on Friday at the age of 83 of the consequences of lung cancer on his ranch in Connecticut, one of the last icons of the American cinema of his golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, whom he resembled for a long time and for whom he was a kind of rival on the canvas, more careful in his play, certainly also more fragile, but just as an apostle of liberty and the sprinkling of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often produces wonderful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 as the son of a German Jew and a Hungarian mother.
One of the glorious faces of the American dream should come from its European roots.
Without excessive ego, extreme quality feature.
For in him a whole country, which was in love with the self-made man, was reflected again in the fighters who were injured in the Pacific War, studied acting in Yale at the beginning of the 50s and then attended the Actor's Studio in New York before he had success at the theatre, on television and soon in cinema.
This man, who fought for civil rights, was also the driver, who was in 1979 at the 24 hour race of Man's Second, and also a sex symbol, although he lived in a show relationship with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With him, too, the unknown facets of this mysterious, reserved, committed and hypersensitive stars are disappearing against the glamour of the show business, whose puzzles will never be completely solved.
A decent man, in the purest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newman put the cinema lovers this weekend in Taumel, while on the dark screen of the memories all his major roles were played.
More than half a century of American film art is constantly changing with him.
The charming cowboy, butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), once again pushes into the memory, and the young man, who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in Die Katze on the hot sheet roof, who was filmed by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
A much shorter recall (1990) is being called back, which is awakened at his sensitive Mr. Bridge, who, in his old age, is disturbed by a wedding that did not all fulfill their promises.
There were so many other Paul Newmans in the course of the story.
This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Somebody Up There Likes Me (a hand full of dirt) by Robert Wise, a role that was intended for James Dean, was recaptured after his death and made the Newman truly famous in 1956.
This sympathetic ganove in the superior The Sting (Der Clou), which was awarded the Oskar for the best film in 1973.
As a bitter and vengeful billiard player in the wonderful The Hustler by Robert Rossen (1961),
This face through the times, that was him.
Still him.
In his CV, epochs unite.
The youth knew him mainly from the cult film Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the little orthodox coach of an ice hockey team.
His fans found him again in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Brothers Coen.
With a final role in 2003 as the father of the Irish Mafia in Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes, the circle closed.
In contrast to several cinema legends who have retired early enough from the film world, Newman should stay in the saddle for a long time, betraying Hollywood, his fortune, his prunk and his concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humor, as a living challenge to 'underplaying' when he judged his all too expressive performances.
The Metier was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman to fly to for a long time.
However, he rarely played Sunnyboys as outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, fissures or desperate ones, with their perfect representation he reflected his abduction and opposition.
As director, Newman revealed unknown sides of his true fine-feeling sensitivity.
His Rachel, Rachel of 1968 (after the novel of Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, drew a fine-looking female portrait full of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott through an overdose, dedicated his film Harry and Son in 1984, a work full of feeling and sadness.
At the flood of honours that sprang up yesterday over Newman, his close friend and former armed companion Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) declared: `His presence has improved my life and this country.'
Generousness and joy of life were essential characteristics of the deceased actor.
In addition to his legendary career, he is now also accompanied by a great advocate of civil rights, environmental protection and independent cinema, an opponent of the abstinent Hollywood.
We often saw him standing with the foot in bowls full of vinaigrette, sauces, pastries or other foods, and thought this to be quite tasteless, even though at first we found it fun.
The profits from his sales nevertheless flowed to his Children's Foundation.
Instead of resting on his myth, Newman became involved in shooting.
He left his five daughters with a letter with these sentences: 'Always and to the very end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was an honor to be here.
And for us, it was an honor to pursue the life of such an intelligent and generous American actor.
An exemplary citizen, in the narrowest sense and in the widest sense.
What was produced in the billing factory by Zuschlag &amp; Co.?
On 8 October the negotiations in the criminal trial against János begin with a contract with his accomplices.
In particular, the accused shall be accused of participating in organised crime, gross negligence and business fraud, and other criminal acts, including document counterfeiting.
According to the prosecutor, the funds obtained from the tenders were used for their own purposes, while the services provided were often carried out with counterfeit invoices.
State funds and grants from the self-government - a total of HUF 65 million - are partly to be entered into the accounts of Fiatal Baloldal, partly into individual private funds.
As the investigative authorities indicated, fictitious invoices have been submitted in relation to the tendering fees, and the associations should not have complied with their obligations either.
According to the charge, much of the invoices should have been faked.
The invoice blocks were purchased at the Józsefváros market, and the round seal was made in Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which companies are to issue the invoices was decided on that round trip north of the Lake Plateton, to which István Lados was sent by János.
In the course of this “exploratory tour,” Lados should find pensions and restaurants.
He requested bills on consumptions to later issue invoices based on these submissions for the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the self-government of Budapest.
These invoices should have been mostly manipulated by István Lados and his accomplice András  theri, the latter being responsible for the constitution of the relevant reports, according to our information.
One of the goals of Lados' exploration tour was a beer site.
How to obtain two invoices issued by the supplement and Co in 2003, the gastronomy company should have hosted the ninety-member group of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület.
Now, however, the head of the company says that such a large group would not at once fit into the local area.
Another bill, issued in the summer of 2002, to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, later known as Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, also revealed grave formal and content errors.
In a pension in Badacsonytomaj, which has only three rooms and cannot accommodate more than ten people at the same time, 130 guests should have stayed according to invoice.
The imagination of the accountants was apparently as limited as it was to the Pigal Kft., a gastronomy company whose accounting documents by the customers Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá, according to the charge authority, do not appear at all.
As Managing Director Győző Farkas informed the hvg.hu, it was immediately clear to him that it was fake documents when he was submitted by the prosecutor during a survey.
\"Our company name and the tax number were incorrectly affixed on the stamp \"
And further: Apart from formal errors, the fact was also wrong that the company should have accommodated a hundred people after having a total of eleven rooms, which are impossible to accommodate so many people.
Also, if the restaurant had been serviced on the invoice, the restaurant would not have been in operation for a long time.
The emissary accountants have also declined to verify that the Budapest travel agency they have taken into the visa only offers trips abroad, and so they have indicated Hungary travel on the cash bill, which also contradicted the accounting practice of the company.
In addition, as has been known in the course of the investigations, they have also introduced VAT on the invoices, although travel agency services relating to a country outside the EU are tax free.
The total amount of VAT was incorrect to four invoices issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, since the company only charges 15 percent of VAT instead of 25 and the employees only issue machine invoices, but the counterfeit documents were handwritten.
Another mistake that had been experienced by the “reputative investors” was that in one case, “vehicle transport” had been reported as a performance, although this is not offered by the company specialised in investment consulting, the prosecutor informed the prosecutor.
Further form errors - false invoice format, false stamp - were due to the fact that the invoices issued to Egyttt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, as well as to XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont could be disclosed as counterfeits.
Likewise, in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the sports camp Kunfehértó, whose managing director believed that the invoices had never been issued.
Another “error” is the fault at the HIB Kft. from Nyíregyháza: This society was in disuse at the time (2001) when the Fiatal Városért Egyesület group was supposed to have eaten there - the mass administrator therefore indicated that the bills were not self-exposed.
Consistently False
The other group of auditors are persons who were well aware that they had to make fictitious invoices.
At the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, the Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation has issued invoices for the Egyttt a Harmadik Évezredért Foundation, which is approximately HUF 4 million.
According to the charge, the managing director of the Collab Kft. was transferred from one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to the exhibition of fictional bills.
The biogate Kft. currently also available in liquidation should also have worked with supplement and Co.: In 2003 the GmbH will provide the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány Foundation, as well as the Atlasz Egyesület and Vorösfenyő Egyesület associations with counterfeit invoices of the total value of HUF 5 million, which relate to non-achieving services.
However, there was also little payment because the invoices were cancelled immediately after their exhibition, which the persons concerned have forgotten to note in their documents.
The third group of auditors shall comprise persons directly associated with the accused.
One of them is Iván Cubatov, the postman of the Ukrainian managing director of Delta Trió Kft., a company based in Budapest, but not available there.
This company will have issued several invoices on the sale of EV components in the total value of HUF from October to December 2005.
According to the investigative authority, the cash investment Kft from Kiskunhalas, which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005, is to have acted as the buyer of these invoices.
The managing director of this company was a Romanian, to which the company documents should also be sent by Iván Cubatov, between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, Cubatov has received invoices on behalf of the GmbH. to the Atlasz and Hoppá Associations, as well as to Egyttt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, whose countervalue has been collected.
The companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. as well as Jos investment Bt. should have been founded by Romanian Maurers on Iván Cubatov's express wish.
In fact, however, none of these companies were active, which was according to accused of lack of order.
Nevertheless, he was able to benefit from the companies: at the request of his accomplice, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who was responsible for preparing the company's founding documents, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the associations associated with the contract, such as Atlasz and Y-Generáció.
In total, Cubatov will have issued 15 invoices of HUF 14.2 million in the name of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade to the organisations.
The prosecutor assumes that Cubatov may have collected 10% of the invoice and VAT.
Cubatov is even supposed to have abused the company Szi-Beri Bt. for the exhibition of fictitious invoices - in this case the invoices were filed with the applications of Biztos Pont.
Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért submitted their applications in January 2006 to the non-profit organization of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány-TMA.
Both received 500,000 forints per year, but used these amounts for the purposes of alienation.
To hide this, they presented the TMA with five fictional invoices of the Works Team Kft..
These invoices were, by the way, secured in the Ministry of Education when searching the office of Árpád Kemecsei.
In the course of the negotiations, some defendants are now charged with a confession of the conduct of the counterfeiting of accounts, as they have already been filed before the prosecutor.
A sensation could be if the main defendant, János, decided to make a comprehensive confession.
His previous information was less detailed, and even though he had already repeatedly promised to report extensively on everything, his confession still stands out.
The question remains, therefore, whether this is in his interest whether the socialists have concluded a pact with him regarding the reparation of the bulk of the damage suffered by HUF 50 million, and whether supplement is in return willing to assume responsibility.
It is quite possible, however, that supplement now plays the “injured” after his attempts at healing the detention and house arrest had come on deaf ears.
While other criminals, who have suffered much greater damage with economic offences and have not reimbursed them, are on a free foothold, or at least under house arrest, this possibility remains denied.
The psychology of overbiding - or why we are willing to pay more
In case of auctions, buyers tend to spend more and thus overvalue the bid.
Neurologists and economic researchers at the University of New York have now succeeded in discovering the neurological-economic foundations of this well-known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to a study published in the Science magazine, people in a competition, such as an auction on eBay, do not want to give up and are therefore willing to pay even higher prices.
The researchers have tried to explore the neurological scheme of this “game” with experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers should play Lotto while the other participated in a playful action - in both cases the active brain regions of the subjects were examined using functional magnetic resonance (fMRI).
In both games the participants were able to win money, but an increased activity of the striatum, a complex below the brain, was measured in the case of losers of the auction, in which the overriding of the opponent plays a major role.
In addition to many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the “self reward” of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore said that the increase in prices was explained by the avoidance of an overreaction of the striatum.
In order to substantiate their thesis, economists in the research group have also conducted studies to track the money.
In this case, three groups should compete against one partner under different conditions.
The control group was informed of the true value of the product, after which they made their efforts.
Another group was also promised $15 reward, in case they come out of the game as winners.
The third group received 15 dollars before the auction, which was also lost in the event of a lost game.
The difference between the two groups was that the emphasis on one was on winning while the other was on losing.
However, as evidence of the hypothesis expressed by neurologists, the members of the “non-lost” group were ready for higher stakes than those in the control or profit group.
\"These results cannot be deduced from any previous economic theory.
In fact, the practices observed in auctions have so far been justified only with the joy of winning, or of avoiding risk.
The contradiction between these two theories was resolved thanks to the pictorial neurological process, so that we have now prepared a third explanation - said Andrew Schotter, professor of the Faculty of Economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should the doctor visit?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed among leading causes of death.
The number of infected people is estimated to be one hundred thousand, but only seven thousand are treated, which is that patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the collective term for liver diseases caused by various viruses.
Symptoms are often similar - liver inflammation and jaundice are common, but the pathogens and diseases differ.
Depending on the pathogen, hepatitis viruses spread in two different ways: for hepatitis A and E, by the digestive tract (for example by contaminated food or water), hepatitis B, C and D, the viruses can be transmitted through blood and other bodily fluids (such as sperm, mucous membrane or saliva).
Travelers are advised against viruses A and B at any time, against virus C there is no vaccine.
Symptoms in hepatitis A occur about two-three weeks after consumption of contaminated food and are generally accompanied by discomfort, weakness, abdominal pain and vomiting.
After that, yellow growth occurs on the skin and in the eyes, the stool becomes bright, the urine dark, and the healing can last up to two-three weeks.
Worldwide, about 1 million people die each year from hepatitis B, far more serious diseases such as liver cancer and cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that estimates suggest that only every tenth infected person is in medication treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: untreated can lead to liver cirrhosis and liver cancer.
Most infected people do not even know about their disease, as the pathogen secretly destroys the liver cells - in many cases the first symptoms after 20-30 years show up.
Therefore, timely prevention, such as regular checks, is essential.
There are three groups in which this disease is more common: those who had undergone blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts, and tattoos.
Currently, the number of chronic hepatitis C patients worldwide is estimated to be 200 million.
As the disease is already detectable in a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to consult the home doctor for the first signs of unknown origin.
It is recognized in due time that the disease can be cured, the virus can be eradicated, thus banning the risk of infection and preventing the emergence of cancer.
The 30th of September is the World Day of Hepatitis, organised for the first time by patient representatives worldwide in 2004.
The aim of the action is to strengthen awareness of this chronic liver inflammation caused by viruses, their origin and the importance of early detection.
Do believers have less pain?
As recent research shows, religious faith acts like a kind of lubricant, which should have already facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Oxford University scientists performed an interesting experiment: The British newspaper \"Telegraph\" reported on the extent to which belief in God affects human pain feelings.
In the course of the rather bizarre investigation, 12 faithful and atheists received electroshocks each while studying a painting of the Mother of God.
As the results showed, the faithful were able to eliminate much of the pain.
By means of brain scan technology, it could even be demonstrated that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for pain regulation.
The study was the first in a research project in which, in addition to scientists, philosophers and theologians from various departments of the university participate.
In the attempt, a sparkling device was attached to the left hand, which gave off the electric shocks.
The participants were asked to focus heavily on two paintings: firstly, one picture of the Mother of God painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and secondly Leonardo da Vinci's lady with Hermelin,
The researchers hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary among the faithful would produce a kind of religious trance, while they chose the image there, because it was hardly distinguished from the other paintings and felt as soothing.
The subjects spent half an hour each in an MRI scanner, and during that time received a total of 20 electric shocks in four stages, while they should look at either the religious, or the other painting.
The Catholics reported that they felt at the sight of the Mother of God, in security, as if they were “careful, ” and they felt“ rest and peace. ”
While viewing the religious painting, they reported over 12% less pain than when they had Leonardo's work in mind.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the attempt, said that one could also produce similar effects with other highly active images, even with the atheists, one would have to find only the corresponding photo.
“We had to find a picture that evokes very positive feelings, such as a mother or a father, such as the psychologist.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
“Practicing faith should change our personality, and so does Wright in many cases.
According to these excellent results, only the question remains of what effect a Madonna image of Leonardo or of another comparable painter would have on the pain regulation of the faithful.
Would the high-quality Virgin Mary achieve even better results?
You're what you tell about yourself
On their tenth birthday Google can claim with fug and right: it is found in people's pockets as well as above their heads in the sky: it knows where people spent their vacations, to which specialists they go, and what moves them.
And that still isn't enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the CEOs of Google.
In the direction of skeptics plagued by Orwellian horror visions, he lets them align: these would just overlook the essentials of Web 2.0.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Schmidt recently said that Google’s main goal is to collect even more personal data about users and thus to get closer to the original target of the company, according to which they want to “order all the information of this world. ”
Schmidt explained that after ten years of world-changing work, Google was still at the beginning of the information collection.
Asked about the Status Quo in five years, Schmidt said: he wished Google would be able to answer questions like \"What should I do tomorrow\" or \"What job really fits me\", but software programs are not yet able to do so because they don't know enough about users.
Not all Internet users are aware that the search terms would be registered in the course of their Internet searches, as well as the IP addresses from which they were searched and the pages visited.
For example, the \"Personalized Search\" introduced two years ago allows the visitor to save their own search process and later access it, so that the results can be generated much more accurately later, and the same logic is also based on the so-called \"recommendations\" with which the system recommends tailored products and services due to previous preferences.
However, users wonder what happens in the event of a data abuse - \"If you look at what I am doing - some people are concerned about the Google data monopoly.
In most cases, however, it is rather the company's represented, potential power that is stimulating to fear, and less the guilt or fear of punishment, the desire for freedom or the desire to resist the power that many Internet users are fighting for rejection.
However, it is a proven fact that the search terms are not only stored, but also passed on to third parties in the event of the event, and in these cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user.
A parade example of this was recently the action against paedophilia in Brazil, in the course of which Google provided information to the Brazilian government, which was collected by the community site called Orkut, and also made it possible to identify the paedophilia.
However, users concerned with personal rights were still able to breathe in May when Google, together with the civil rights organisation EFF, successfully appealed against the FBI: therefore, Google cannot be forced to release information to the FBI on a secret request in the future with any point of the Constitution.
(However, the Federal Government has successfully produced the publication of 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms with reference to the Youth Protection Act adopted years ago, but the list of individual users, respectively their web and search terms list, has been reserved for two months.)
So Google's image remains controversial: those who are reluctant to release their personal data because they fear the loss of their privacy and intimacy through the use of the Google services, are poised by the company with the conservatively representing companies.
Nevertheless, the American \"geek culture\" which is present in many countries and which attracts enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, the next generation of \"cool entrepreneurs\" in them, as opposed to Microsoft, which thanks to Windows, is the market leader, even if both are fighting for the same goal.
One possible reason for this is that, unlike Microsoft, Google does not require its users to identify codes, and provides its services free of charge, so that an open, constantly updated source code and program package seem to be far more attractive, youthful and cool than the official practices of the software giant.
On the other hand, the geeks see through the problematic relationship between personal rights and the Internet gauge- a relationship that has become the focus in recent years, especially thanks to the concept of Web 2.0.
The “Web 2.0” is about nothing other than collaboration, say, leaving the users behind deliberately track and use the available communication channels, and even if the extents are individually different, the main thing remains the same, namely to show themselves publicly.
An average youth can simultaneously manage his profile on several community portals - from Facebook via Xanga, it can connect with one another through other services, such as Twitter, or music services such as last.fm, and can all of this eventually integrate into a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. In addition, they can conduct blogs that automatically represent the latest photo galleries that are listed on Flickr or Picasa.
And a number of other exemplary cases prove: when viewing the party photos of the past night, the friend soon finds out who had enjoyed her unfaithful friend or the employee is released because he is only making too honest his anger at the company management in his blog - one is sure: the term “private sphere” has been completely reinterpreted.
Anyone who leads an online life is what he praises by himself - such in some way one could formulate the basic idea behind the behavior of today's youth.
And whoever tries to keep something secret, or even to bypass the Google monopoly, can do so - like Scroogle, a tool that attacks Google's search engine, but does not intentionally leave any traces.
Few people deliberately do not register on community pages so that they can't be found, but also Google's online applications, such as word processing and graphical tools and RSS feeds, can deal with alternative versions that are not tied to huge server parks and therefore do not generate the best possible profile from the user.
However, public opinion is waiting for Google to show its true face.
With its current value of USD 156 billion, the company is even ahead of IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising areas threaten the revenue of advertising agencies, and the ever-faster services not only provide Microsoft, but also other software developers with head breaks.
However, critical viewers also find the disturbing counterpole: for example, the Group Executive has rejected a protest from employees in all cases after the fees of the company's own Kindergarten have been doubled, and the management also said that the staff's regular boarding was too costly. However, all this suggests too mildly that Google went even to the knees in 2006 before the Chinese government and agreed to an agreement that all regime-critical hits, or those that were contrary to the good taste, would be filtered out.
The internal regulation of the Group is that no new service will be applied in advance, but only if it is already available. However, the events of the coming months and years may change a lot: while some of my Google's book and magazine scan or archiving project now assume that soon the company would have to deal with the Supreme Court, others are worried about the system's 'health', which allows the creation of a complete health profile based on findings, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google is building a genetic database already provides the next generation of Sci-Fi authors with the fabric - for example, Scroogled - the famous novel by Cory Doctorow describes in best orwellian manner a future in which a human being, thanks to Google-related data, becomes frighteningly close.
Two young people help the double killer of Ózd to remove traces
In connection with the double murder of Ózd, the police have now interrogated two young people who are suspected of helping to remove the tracks, the spokesman of the police commissioner Borsod informed us on Tuesday.
The young people were consistent, they are currently being charged with the aid.
According to information from the MTI news agency, these are two girls who defend themselves on a free foot.
Aid is threatened with a penalty of imprisonment of up to five years.
The suspect of the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old local man, was arrested on Sunday.
The man is under an urgent suspicion of having deliberately murdered several persons out of greed.
In the course of the investigation, it was found that the 23-year-old owed a larger amount of money to a 53-year-old.
However, the suspect did not want to compensate for his debts, so last Wednesday he attracted his creditor to a site in Ózd, where he murdered him and his nine-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the man has planned the action by long hand - this also proves the fact that he committed the murders with a weapon hidden at the crime scene.
Together with experts, the police are now examining the weapons and the circumstances of their use.
Warsaw Stock Exchange offers purchase for Prague Stock Exchange
Around 200 million euros, or 5 billion Czech crowns, the Warsaw Stock Exchange has offered for the one hundred percent purchase of the shares packages of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Poles despite the fact that they were previously excluded from the Czechs as possible owners of their stock exchange.
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange belongs entirely to the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, but it wants to sell more than 60% of the papers in the coming months.
According to the Czech daily newspaper E15, the offer of Poland includes the highest purchase price ever offered for the Prague Stock Exchange.
As the newspaper reports, until now the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have made offers.
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague Stock Exchange said last week that of all interested parties the Warsaw Stock Exchange would probably be the worst new owner, and he also did not rule out that this could even lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange to be 5-10 billion crowns.
According to the shareholders agreement, 90% of the shares could be sold.
The biggest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance Investment Bank with a 25 percent stake, followed by Ceská Sporitella Bank with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the point of view of European newspapers
Commenting on the ever-increasing international financial crisis, on Tuesday, some leading European leaves already spoke on the second 11 September.
We owe the American President the global financial disaster, for example, La Repubblica, the President has not even been able to put his own party behind him for the draft law, which should bring something relief to the appalling situation...
Instead of a \"new Pearl Harbor\" as the billionaire investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more appropriate to speak of a \"second September 11\".
Parts of the press in Madrid also ordered the scapegoat in Washington.
According to the “El Mundo,” the lack of political leadership is due to the fact that the world economy is now at the brink of collapse.
The American financial system is threatening to collapse more and more, and under it the whole world will suffer.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but now, after the vote in Congress, there is a risk that Washington will not have a political means of crisis management.
The world economy is in the air, just at a time when one of the greatest transformations of the history of capitalism takes place.
One can no longer ignore the threat, for example the Geneva Day Indicator,
While some countries may still be able to provide their money institutions with rescue packages, and save banks with taxpayers' money from bankruptcy.
However, if a domino effect is triggered and there are more banks that are still pleading, then neither further financial injections nor other immediate measures will help.
In the long term, EU Member States would have to jump over their shadows and centralise the control of money markets.
On Monday alone, more than EUR 100 billion was paid to weak financial institutions, the Vienna Standard also reminds us, as the newspaper continues, that the concerns are more and more realistic that, according to the Americans, European taxpayers must now take a little deeper into their pockets to get out of the crisis.
So far, the EU has not seriously dealt with the crisis, which is now waging like a tsunami over the old continents.
While the rescuers would not immediately have to win with several hundred billion euros, it would be advisable to keep in mind where it would be reasonable to raise taxpayers' money in order to avoid even greater damage.
Intelligent car imitates Hummel's flight
What would be the best method of developing new technologies to prevent accidents if not imitate the obstacle sensors from nature?
For example, those of bees.
At the CEATEC in Japan, an amazing project was presented in which the Nissan engineers were inspired by Hummeln in creating new accident avoiding systems.
In cooperation with Tokyo University, Nissan has built a BR23C biomimetic system controlled by autobots, a mini-car equipped with the properties of bees, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that avoids any collisions.
In flight, each bee forms its own oval, private area, which is very similar to our own protective shield, said Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology PR and research development, at the exhibition.
The composite eye of the bee, which can see in any direction and at an angle of over 300 degrees, plays an important role.
In order to imitate the function of the compound eye, the researchers took up the idea of the laser-controlled distance gauge.
This identifies obstacles in front of the BR23C in a 180-degree face within 2 metres, calculates their distances and sends signals to the microprocessor on board, which immediately initiates the collision avoidance process.
The obstacle is recorded in second-break parts, and the auto robot immediately changes the course, similar to the movement of bees by rotating the tires around the corresponding angle.
In contrast to previous systems, this maneuver takes place instinctively.
\"If it were not, the auto robot could not react quickly enough to avoid the obstacles, explained Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the Autoroboter project.
The system must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the innermost and most vulnerable part of the shield - a layer within which accidents are still considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect the behaviour of bees if they deviate from other bees.
And this needs to be done in the fraction of a second.
However, the deviation, unlike bees, cannot be up, down, or even diagonally - it can only be two-dimensional, only in the direction of the practicability of the tyres.
While bees have an infinite range of options for eviction from other bees, the researchers at the autorobot were able to use only the rotational movement, or acceleration and braking.
The BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and more energy efficient and therefore have a longer life than conventional lithium ion batteries.
Andoh explained that it comes to the instinctive, intelligent response, and less to the processing of the data, and even less to the ability to store it.
This device has to process only a few inputs per second and react accordingly to them.
It does not have to save it, or produce an intuitive, logical reaction on the basis of previous maneuvers, so that it constantly takes only a handful of KB of memory.
There is no need for gigabyte- and megabyte-heavy memories.
This is the first step in the development of immediate collision avoidance technology, which, according to Nissan, will be serial in production within the next ten years.
Another application could find the technology in GPS satellite navigation by deliberately guiding the driver around obstacles and leading him to the goal.
A name for the parent child
Now the written version of the 700-Mrd dollar heavy rescue package law, which will be applied in several stages and aimed at purchasing the bad loans of the banks.
In the first passage, half of the money is to be spent.
In a meeting that ended on Saturday after midnight local time east coast, after several days of debate, the congress delegates went through to agree on the 700-billion-dollar rescue package, Reuters reported.
“We have made significant progress,” said Nancy Pelosi, the democratic president of the American House of Representatives, and said that the agreement was only to be brought to paper.
The compromise reached on the rescue package supported both presidential candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain.
Minister of Finance Henry Paulson said as a result: The programme will show effect and it will be efficient, but one has to do even more. According to Pelosi, this was not about the rescue of Wall Street, but about tearing the rudder of the economy.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, so, Washington time Sunday evening 8 a.m. (Central European time Monday 2 a.m.), but did not trigger any high-speed flight on the stock exchanges.
On Monday, first, the House of Representatives agrees on the draft law on the stabilization of the economy of 2008, then the Senate is on the line.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on Saturday evening, and the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement.
We are satisfied with the progress achieved at night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our markets and protect our economy, said Tony Frotto, spokesman of the White House.
However, the programme deviates from the initial recommendation of the Bush Administration, according to which the $700 billion should be spent at once for the purchase of counterfeit securities charged with loans.
In a first tranche, a maximum of half of the 700-billion sum is to be spent, with 250 billion immediately available, after the Congress will be expected to vote on the causa on Monday. This sum is to be spent on the purchase of credit-burdened, poor securities, and on the other USD 100 billion, the President is to decide.
The programme will be reviewed by a Commission of its own, which is also the President of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the 700 billion depends on a further decision by the Congress.
In accordance with the law, the Ministry of Finance may also apply a combined tactic: it may buy poor loans, mortgages, and securities charged with mortgages, or other “toxic” loans.
As reported by the competent persons of the Ministry, the purchase can take place both in an auction and directly.
The law allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme where the Ministry of Finance guarantees the worrying funds and the companies pay the expected damages accordingly.
Henry Paulsen said: The law defines the necessary funds so that up to $700 billion can be made available as instant aid for the American financial system, whether it is for the large-scale purchase of poor funds, their insurance, or the avoidance of a system risk triggered by the collapse of a larger financial institution.
We take the necessary steps so that we are ready to introduce the law once it has been signed, according to Paulson.
However, the heads of the banks in difficulty and now dependent on state aid can expect to be cut by the government by the government for their manufactures, which are called salopp in the Overseas Snake, Golden Handshake.
There will only be a reduction in salaries in certain cases, and these reductions will depend on how the Ministry of Finance helps each.
The reduction essentially means that if the Ministry buys in the context of an auction, the \"Golden Handshake\" is taxed unless the retired bank chief is transferred to the pension.
In the event of a direct purchase of the counterfeit loans, the government will turn on aggressively to ensure that the manager's salaries are not overrun.
The picture also shows that the existing Golden Handshake agreements are not changed - the restrictions relate only to new agreements, so that more people participate in the program.
This is the first case in American history that cuts in managerial salaries are regulated by law, the Democrat Barney Frank, Chairman of the Financial Committee, commented on the measure.
The state gains equity rights in participating banks so that the risk for taxpayers decreases as they can participate as soon as the economy and thus the saved bank get better.
The draft law provides for the President to submit a proposal to Congress over the next five years on how taxpayers should recover their lost money from the financial sector.
However, there were skeptics on both sides who expressed their doubts regarding the plan.
This is not what the American citizens expect of us, the plan does not protect taxpayers' money, according to California Republican Darrell Issa.
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, said that the measures were carried forward by the same people, who are also responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industry prices continued to rise
Like the Central Statistical Office, domestic sales prices rose by 0.1 percent compared to the previous month in August 2008, compared with August 2007, by 12.9 percent.
Export prices were 1.1 percent higher than those in July 2008, and fell by 3.9% compared to the previous year's prices.
As a result of price changes in the domestic and export sectors, production prices were 0.7% higher than in the previous month, and 3.2 percent higher than in 2007.
The domestic sales prices have only increased slightly compared to the previous month, i.e. by 0.1 percent.
The sales prices of the manufacturing industry also rose little - 0.1 percent - since July.
The largest price increase in August 2008 was for leather goods (2.8 percent) - mainly for bags and belts - here the increase was 4.6 percent, while in shoes the prices were 2.5 percent high.
Higher prices for plastics and chemical raw materials significantly increased prices for chemicals and production (1.6 percent).
A decrease in prices was recorded in crude oil processing (1.4 percent), electrical and technical equipment (0.9 percent), as well as wood processing (0.1 percent).
The prices in paper production, as well as in the publishers and in the printing industry remained unchanged.
In other branches of the manufacturing industry, a price increase was measured between 0.2 and 0.9 percent.
In the major domestic sales markets of the industry, such as electricity, gas, steam and water supply, prices increased by 0.3 percent in August, primarily as a result of the increase in gas prices introduced on 1 July.
If one considers the domestic sales markets of the manufacturing industry in the year, prices in crude oil processing have increased the most (32.4 percent).
In the metal processing sector, a 13.2-percentage increase was observed, while the increase in the production of food, beverages and tobacco was 11 percent.
A decrease in prices was observed in the textile industry (2.5 percent) and in electrical and technical equipment (0.3 percent).
The scale of the renting in the other manufacturing industries was between 0.6 and 9.1%.
Overall, prices in the manufacturing industry climbed by 10.2 percent last year.
Prices for electricity, gas, steam and water rose by 18.7 percent compared to the previous year.
On the domestic market, the highest price increase was noted in August on the investment goods sector (0.7 percent).
In the consumer goods production sectors, prices rose by 0.3 percent, while in the energy and processing sectors they remained the same compared to the previous month.
The largest price increase in August 2008 was observed in the energy and reuse sectors (16.8 percent) compared to the 2007 comparison period.
In the consumer goods-producing sectors, a 6.8 percent price increase was observed, with investment goods a 1.4 percent price reduction.
Industry export prices measured in Forint increased by 1.1 percent in August compared to the previous month, but there was a decrease of 3.9 percent in the year.
The domestic currency was weaker than the euro by 1.7 percent, the dollar by 7.1 percent, and compared to the August 2007 price, it was increased by 7.5 percent compared to the euro, even by 15.9 percent.
No more visas in the US since 2009?
Kinga Göncz sees good opportunities for the American-Hungarian visa agreement to enter into force around the 12th of January, as explained by the Foreign Minister in front of the representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
In your opinion, \"all things now only depend on whether the electronic immigration or control system is introduced in a timely manner in overseas.\"
However, she also stressed that there will be no entry permit in the new system, but that tourists would have to register in advance.
The Head of Hungarian Diplomacy is currently negotiating in Washington.
She meets Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, who will hand her over to the Republic of Hungary, the Middle Cross with Star, and also talks with the foreign political advisers of Democratic Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support rescue package for banks
On Sunday, Barack Obama and John McCain, the two presidential candidates of the major American parties, promised their support for the $700 billion rescue package for banks, but there are also politicians who demand the resignation of the Minister for Finance.
After day-long marathon consultations on Sunday morning, Congress and Government representatives announced that they had come to an agreement on the bank rescue package.
The Wall Street crisis, as well as the upswing of the frozen credit market, became the central issues of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain - both claim to be better than their opponent in order to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
After recent polls, Obama was able to further expand its lead thanks to the economic issues, while McCain's high who provided him with the presentation of Vice-President Sarah Palin after the Republican Convention was melted down at the same time.
At a campaign event in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress would adopt the law of the $700 billion package quickly.
He stressed that the plan also includes those passages of consumer protection that he supported.
“We have to act now, and your jobs, your savings, entire industries, and the stability of the entire economy are threatened,” he told 35,000 spectators.
He did not fail to describe McCain's economic vision as \"obsolet\".
In an interview given by ABC, McCain said: “We’ll all have a hard time kanfering (...) but nonstun is certainly not an alternative“
The Republican Senator said that the plan also outlined the establishment of a Control Commission for the Minister of Finance, as well as the restriction of the discharges for top managers - something that he insisted on.
The CBS told Obama that McCain had not played a definite role in the negotiations, whereas he, Obama, was in contact with the minister.
On Sunday, the spokesperson of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, announced that the House of Representatives will probably already vote on the draft law on Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking area
The right bearing is intact, only the voters became more self-confident within the camp - so commented \"The mirror\" the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria.
In Austria, Haider and Co are ready to rule in order to prevent a red and black coalition.
The Mirror (Spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the German news magazine located on the left, Franz Walter analyses the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article \"Bayern's Revolution destroys her fathers\"
According to the renowned politicologist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber-Duo took over his offices.
The Christian socialists have renewed Bavaria over decades - now the modern citizens are turning away from them.
The outbreak of the epoch is at the same time a problem of Christian democracy, as is the case with Angela Merkel.
Surprisingly, the disaster of the CSU did not come to an end, but on Sunday something went to an end, which, however, had already marked itself quite exactly ten years ago: the indisputable hegemony of a state party
Ten years ago, 1998, the CSU landed at 47.7 percent and fell below the 50 percent mark for the first time since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, thus still in the much cited Stoiber era.
The modernisation of the CSU in the Federal Country has recently destroyed its own mothers and fathers.
Sociologists had predicted this 40 years ago, but they were greatly appreciated at the pace. But without effect, secularization, educational success, the influx of East and North Germans into the prosperous regions of Bavaria could not remain on the loyalty of CSU voters.
Modernisation always comes with option multiplication, and that has political consequences.
The right bearing is intact - only the voters within the camp became more critical and independent.
It is remarkable that in recent weeks, the traditional citizens' groups have expressed the greatest distance to the CSU: the free professions, the commercial citizenship and voters with abstinents such as university degrees.
The CSU support declined to even under 40 percent.
The Press (diepresse.com)
The conservative Vienna daily reports on the chaotic domestic political situation in Austria after the new elections in their “Who with whom?“ Party leaders withheld from coalition issues.
The SPO wants to negotiate with the EPP.
The ÖVP prohibits the interference of the SPÖ into internal affairs.
The BZÖ shows itself open to discussions in all directions, while the Greens do not yet want to establish themselves in relation to a coalition.
The new elections are over, and now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debates on public-law television, the party leaders had hardly seen their cards.
SPÖ-Chief Werner Faymann reaffirmed his desire to negotiate with ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between both parties is very likely - in some federal countries and in the social partners, this is already the case.
The question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current VEP chief as vice chancellor, left Faymann open.
As he said, the voters had chosen the bowl-molterer course.
A repetition of this direction would not be in question.
Molterer has indes responded to red offers cautiously.
The cooperation could not be fruitful, he said, if Faymann tried to interfere in the internal concerns of the EPP.
Whether his party is in opposition, or in the coalition, it is entirely open at present, and these questions should be discussed at the VEP internal level.
BZÖ-Chief Jörg Haider showed himself open in all directions.
“In order to prevent red-black, we are ready to assume government responsibility,” Haider said.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, the European Summit on Equal Opportunities has begun in Paris, which is now directed by the EU Presidency of the Council of France.
In its speech addressed to the plenary, Lívia Járóka, a member of the Fidesz of the European People's Party, drew particular attention to education segregation, as it is one of the most serious legal violations against Roma children, and this is also the greatest obstacle to their need for application.
The high-level conference was opened by French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs Xavier Bertrand on behalf of the French Presidency and Vladimir Spidla, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among the participants were representatives of governments, the European social partners, and the most important European legal and civil society organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
Járóka, as reported by Fidesz's press office, pointed out that in addition to discrimination in job search, Roma would primarily be pushed away from the labour market because of their low education levels.
\"The vast majority of Roma young people have no secondary education, and thanks to poor primary education, only a small part of them can reach a university degree,
Járóka also stressed that education is a fundamental human right that plays a key role in the application of other human rights.
Investment in early training of Roma children could strengthen the economy of the EU Member States.
It is important, according to the honourable Members, to be aware of the widest possible circle - Roma and non-Roma -.
The earlier a Roma student starts school, the stronger his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market, and through income and turnover taxes they contribute to national spending.
\"As citizens of the Union, Roma must be guaranteed the right to high-quality education - the poor and segregated classes must be set aside - according to Lívia Járóka.
As the honourable Member said, a joint, goal-oriented and action-oriented action by the European Union is necessary to speed up the process of desegregation in the education sector, and this is essential to ensure that the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives are properly observed.
“We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, and give Roma children the democratic opportunity to contribute to the future of Europe as a fully-qualified citizen,” Járóka asked.
Since last year's Congress in Berlin, the summit has been held annually with the aim of creating a unique forum for the advancement of the objectives of equal opportunities and freedom of discrimination at European and national level, within the meaning of the European Year of Equal Opportunities.
CSU: grace on time
At the end of October, the fate of the fallen Duos Huber-Beckstein is decided
Despite the election debacle, there are still no heads, at the top of the Bavarian CSU the staff debates were postponed.
Party leader Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein remain in their offices, the question is just how long this grace lasts.
The fate of the tandem after the disastrous 17-percent loss of voting will be decided on the last week of October at the extraordinary party day.
The much-sold duo, however, has already seen that it doesn't want to stick to its armchairs.
In doing so, they want to embarrass the angry group and the party base, which demanded personal consequences one day after the 'bayerian Tsunami', in view of the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, the Christian Social Union reached 60.7 percent. Now, however, one year after the coup against Stoiber, they were able to secure only 43.4 percent of the votes.
For 46 years CSU was a sole regulator in Bavaria, which generated 18 percent of German GDP.
The conservatives remain the determining force in the important southern federal country for the Hungarian economy, but will have to rule in a coalition in the future.
As the first sign of party internal restructuring, the potential successor of Hubers, Vice-President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer will also be involved in the reconnaissance team, which will lead to the liberal FDP, or the law-directed \"free electorate\" conference on a possible Münchner coalition.
One irony of fate is the fact that with the list of free voters, Gabriele Pauli comes into the legislature, whose anti-Stoiber appearance the Huber-Beckstein Duo first took advantage of, in order to serve the determined politician without mercy.
The CSU leadership now focuses all its forces on the stabilization of Beckstein.
In this transition process, Stoiber, who has so far moved the threads out of the background, will play an active role. The former Prime Minister and CSU Chairman called the 28th September the \"bitter day of his political career\"
On Monday Huber made some toxic remarks towards CDU - he believes CSU would have earned far more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a signal to the CDU and thus also to Angela Merkel.
If the CSU, which has contributed a lot to the success at national level in 2005, is not put back on its feet with a joint act of force, Merkel cannot become a chancellor again after the Bundestag elections in September 2009.
Merkel, who has made no hail from her disappointment at the fiasco, believes that the loss of the CSU's land will not negatively affect the great coalition in Berlin.
However, what is relative: the wounded CSU will not be easier to govern, and the crisis of social democrats will continue.
With 18.6 percent, the SPD reached its best result in Bavaria since 1946.
Lukashenko opposition: 110-0
During the Sunday elections, there was no Member of the Opposition to the Ukrainian Parliament.
Russian observers believe that this is due to prosperity and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but the OECD suspects lawlessness in counting the votes.
The OECD, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the elections.
Although the legislature of the 10 million resident state has been unopposed for decades, the counter-party gathered under the name ‘United Democratic Forces’ (ODS) has seriously hoped before yesterday’s elections that Lukaschenko, who had already renewed his presidential mandate for the fourth time in 2006 in the face of the unclean elections and a constitutional amendment, would this time allow some Members of the opposition to \"allow\" in Parliament.
That's why the ODS even took away from the boycotts planned.
Ukraine is becoming more economically dependent as a result of the rising prices of imports of natural gas from Russia. In order to reduce price increases, even loans have been introduced, and the country has also agreed to the sale of the Beltransgas, the owner of the country’s leading gas pipeline, to the Russians. In the light of the expectations of the opposition, the hope that Ukraine will improve its relationship with the EU has been banned after Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians have banned entry into the EU because of the anti-democratic political system.
The evaluation report of the OECD elections, in which emphasis was on the positive movements rather than the shortcomings, such as the exclusion of a third of the opposition candidates from the elections, provided temporary relaxation.
However, the OECD's rapid report already criticized the campaign on Monday - therefore oppositionals should not appear in the press - and in particular the fact that opposition was not allowed to be present when the vote was counted.
Despite all this, the opposition is able to recognize a improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been placed on a free footing, and Minsk is even willing to face up to smaller confrontations with Moscow by continuing to deny recognition of the independence of the depraved Georgian provinces of southern Ossetia and Abkhazia, although Russia, with which Ukraine forms a federal state on the paper, has considered the two territories to be independent for a month.
“We have taken two steps forward and one backward, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun,” said Alexander Milinkevich on our sheet.
According to the opposition candidate of the 2006 presidential election, a continuation is desirable, although “mighty people have been afraid to leave only one opposition to Parliament,”
The opposition does not plan any protest measures in view of the results, but rather attempts to clarify the need for economic reform to the voters.
“We have to deal with many problems here - the opposition newspapers have to be printed in Russia, the local authorities have put us in the way of selling stones, but I still see that more and more people are supporting change, even the older ones - - said Milinkevich in response to the fact that not even the most-supported layer of pensioners is in agreement with the Lukashenko regime, whose only merit is the production of social security.
“Thanks to the debt of the country and the rise of the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time until the “social security” that is muttering to the silence of a cemetery begins to break,” Milinkevich said.
In contrast to opposition politicians, Russian observers have called the elections democratic.
Sergej Lebedev, Head of the Community Mission of Independent States, said to the news agency Ria Novosti: \"People believe the deeds, and not the words - The lack of opposition is therefore a proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: “From now on, it will be frozen before work is done.
For the first time in the history of the Chigi Palazzo there are rotating doors for the entrances and exits of the officials.
From now on, the measure will enter into force against those slumiers who first stamp and then go to coffee drinking during the working hours.
The new Anti-Faulpelz Act was introduced today by Renato Brunetta, Minister of Public Administration and Mauro Masi, Secretary General of the Board of Ministers.
“> “True doors were a means of increasing work efficiency through a higher attendance rate and more services,” said Minister Brunetta.
“Now a new era of responsibility and transparency begins.
This is reformism - underlines Brunetta once more.
With the Chigi Palazzo, the establishment ends in all buildings of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers.
Masi says: \"The choice of rotating doors is also of great symbolic value\"
On the part of the officials there was no resistance, the Secretary-General assured: \"This process was supported by all, the cooperation came from all sides,
All in all, there is now no more breakfast during the working hours; close with coffee or croissant.
Brunettas advises about this with a smile: “A good cappuccino at 7 o’clock works wonders,
During a meeting of the Supreme Committee of Public Administration (Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione)
The Minister announces from Rome that \"within three months the absences of officials have decreased to 50%, that is to say 60,000 people per year are more present at work,
He added that it was necessary to strengthen the efficiency of Italy's public administration
\"The number of wage dynamics - the Minister said - has twice the size of the private sector over the last 8-10 years and far above the inflation rate\"
Meanwhile, thousands of officials have met to counter the Brunetta decree in the context of the call supported by Codacons.
\"While the Minister for Public Service is profiled with numbers of lower absenteeisms at work - according to the consumer centre - the people of 'active laziness' are growing uninterrupted.
Indeed, thousands of correct and valuable officials of the public service have met together to declare war on the unlawful standards of the decree,
In particular, the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) will fight for additional financial compensation for work-related illness, including the planned extension of the compulsory house arrest of the sick worker, during which control visits can be made and further aspects of the Minister's innovations will be challenged.
Napolitano: \"Prevention against accidents at work is crucial\"
Every day 2500 accidents occur in Italy, three people die and 27 remain disabled for life.
For 2007, the data of the Inail (Istituto nazionale contro gli inforuni sul lavoro) confirm that the fatal occupational accidents were approximately 1200.
These figures demonstrate the seriousness of a phenomenon that causes almost twice as many deaths as murders.
Today, the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) in all provinces of Italy will take the 58th national day for the victims of occupational accidents to draw the attention of the social institutions and media to this dramatic situation.
\"The worrying data and the tragic news of these days from Anmil confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is, confirmed the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano in his communication to the President of the Amil (Associazione nationale mutilati ed invalidi del lavoro) Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expressed his \"great appreciation for the constant commitment to prevention of jobs, protection of injured workers, support for victims' families and awareness of public opinion\"
\"An outraged \"basa\" has raised itself in this regard; understandably in the case of tragedies, which, measured by their magnitude, trigger some vortex in the media and participation of the public. However, everyday reality often confronts us with dramatic events that can even repeat themselves in their own dynamics,
Napolitano does not hide that there is in any case a resource problem: it must be invested in education and information,
The numerous initiatives to raise awareness in school frameworks are of particular importance to young people who feed on the world of work.
It is our duty to pay attention to this phenomenon rather than distracting it from its social seriousness. One must put into effect and improve a legislative standard.
On the other hand, the President of the Gianfranco Fini Chamber has emphasised \"how the phenomenon of work-related deaths forms an urgent social emergency which insults the conscience of all of us and forces all institutions to work on decisive rules that aim to put an end to the problem\"
\"The data of accidents at work seem to signal a slight improvement, but this does not exclude the fact that the number of deaths caused by work is far too high, said President of Anmil, Pietro Mercandelli.
“We do not want this “positive trend” to mean less attention. That is precisely what ultimately causes the tragedy,
“How do you believe that you are doing too little in order to counter the phenomenon of accidents? You can fight against them through various actions.
In our opinion, stronger controls and inspections are necessary, says Mercandelli, but also stronger measures to educate workers who are already starting school.
\"An additional effort is needed - he adds - as regards the communication and awareness of public opinion.
But above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers is in demand of a phenomenon that represents a social emergency,
Mercandelli also insisted on \"to speak of the progressive deterioration of protection for the victims of work accidents and called for the abolition of the social system against which we have been fighting in recent years\"
“The aim is, therefore, to give the worker a guarantee on insurance so that the fate of the victim of a job accident will not depend on voluntary or accidental donations, which are currently decided by a legislator,
Mp3 player under charge: risk of hearing damage
Listening to loud music over a longer period of time with portable music devices, such as Mp3 player, can lead to permanent hearing damage.
This is what the European Commission is reporting, which cites the EU’s opinion of the Csrseri (Scientific Committee on Current and Recent Identified Health Risks) in a report published in Brussels today.
“It is clear from the report, as it says in a note, that 5-10% of those who hear loud music with portable instruments for at least five years a week for at least one hour a day risk the permanent loss of their hearing,
“I’m worried that such a large number of young people, who usually put portable musical instruments and mobile phones on high volume, will irreversibly damage their hearing without knowing it,” says Meglena Kuneva.
“From the scientific findings, as the European Union says, there is a clear risk of pushing too fast action.
What really counts is to raise consumers' awareness and make this information a common asset.
In view of these scientific findings, we need to review the already existing control systems again so that they are fully effective and keep pace with the new technology,
Brussels had commissioned the independent scientific committee in view of the widespread use of portable musical instruments among young people.
\"The scientists - this concludes the EU Communication - confirm that one is too concerned and that the European Commission, together with the other members of the European Union and those concerned, will now examine the necessary measures to better protect children and young people from the noise coming from portable musical instruments and similar devices.
There is already a European standard which limits the level of noise from portable musical instruments to 100 dB. The concern about the damage that could result from too much noise.
These damage can be greatly reduced by taking solutions such as reducing volume and length of noise generation.
In her report, the Scientific Committee of the European Communities points out that if users of portable musical instruments listen to music only five hours a week (less than 89 decibels) so that the legal limits are already exceeded, which apply to the maximum noise level at the workplace.
Those who cross this border of music risk the complete loss of hearing within five years.
Thus, 5-10% of users are affected by such devices, the number of which can be estimated to be between 2.5 and 10 million persons in the European Union.
Roma, Alemanno gives the start-up to the \"Commission for the Future of the Capital\"
We're starting today, in March it's gonna be over, in June we're going to get a balance sheet.
This is the deadline set by the Capitol for the work of the Commission on the Future of the Capital of Rome.The Commission met this morning in the new headquarters behind the Caracalla thermals.
In six months, President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will draw up the guidelines for Rome.
Once the project will be completed, the City and Municipal Council will evaluate the analyses and projects in order to be able to present the strategic plan for Rome in June with the \"official stamp\" of the Capitol and the mayor Gianni Alemanno.
\"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented in it - stressed Alemanno. \"It will present proposals for a development plan for Rome, whose political responsibility remains with the City and Municipal Council.
There is no redistribution of responsibilities, only the will to have a place where one can develop a great project for Rome.
In March its task will be completed and the Commission will resolve itself again, as such a project must have a timely end point.
In June - as the Mayor announces - we will present the strategic plan in which we will use the work done by the Commission,
Those who question the competence of the Commission, since their view of liability is lacking, answer Alemanno: \"Everything depends on the work that the Commission will do and on the quality of its proposals.
If, as in France, the Attali Commission provides quality results, and this will certainly be the case in Rome, then its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often, politics deals with the everyday problems and emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the other hand, want to have a longer period in view, in order to work seriously in a deeper perspective on the development of Rome and the future of the city,
The Mayor of Rome places great importance on clarifying the following: This Commission is neither a useless facility nor a wreckage: it is absolutely free, it will not cost the Roman citizens a cent and it will bring us to mind. It will employ the best heads of the capital,
According to Alemanno, it is necessary to have a strategic plan that is neither hermetic nor static to enable our city to have a quality leap - which it really needs - and thus to take a common step towards the future,
A future, according to the mayor of Rome, which is \"restricted not only in the current municipal boundaries but also in the role of Rome as a metropolis and political capital of Italy, but also as the future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean,
Obama, the first anti-American president?
A well-known American politician, who is much about being considered independent, wrote: “Barack Obama becomes the second anti-american president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, through his decisions, decimated the economy of the United States and maintained relations with the enemy Islam (and still does this as a private man today) \"
The attacks against Obama are getting more and more violent, just now, where the elections are approaching.
A Miami lady wrote in an Internet page: “This person is full of ambitions.
Obama is very angry: he thinks he will receive the highest office in a nation that has seen two black governors and five black senators in total.
However, these attacks don't have much to say; they are racist attacks and they don't answer the voter's question: will he be a good president? And then there are also the polls; all say Obama will win with a great advance.
Even in this case there are people who talk to the heart and not the head.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, wrote in her editorial: first in the Electoral Cabinet we will probably know who will give his voice to the real American patriot.
This is where a mentality of the United States appears, which has been kept hidden until recently.
\"Telling you what you want, we'll decide for whom we're going to make our creeks, whether for Obama or for McCain.\"
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we'll move out of America.
Something you never heard before - only now, where the success of the black candidate seems so certain.
In all cases, despite all these considerations, the final weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were questioned: what mistake did Bush make during his term of office? 89% replied: the war in Iraq.
America is changing.
The nation lost 50000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent back home with a third in the back.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Nevertheless, Iraq remains for the majority of Bush's weakness.
The one who will take his place is facing a huge task.
The financial collapse also leaves its mark with journalists: in the newspapers you can already feel the cuts. And many accuse the Internet, the “killer” of the printing press.
Five hundred American journalists were questioned by the PEW Research Center about their situation and their mental control of the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, they did not really express concern about the information concerning the representatives because of the general credibility.
They don't feel as alone as they used to be.
The problem for American journalists is the money.
For these journalists, the 2008 crisis is a crisis of an economic model that was destroyed.
In addition, the major problems are caused by the cuts in the newsroom, i.e. the space in which the editors work to compile the newspaper.
This is a problem that needs to be solved, so the interviewed journalists, if one wants to prevent traditional journalism, as the big audience understands it, from shrinking significantly.
A clear but complicated pessimism is fulfilling the American journalist today.
Six out of ten journalists and executive seniors of the printing press believe that journalism is on the wrong track at national level.
In the local area, the executives even account for 65%.
Printed vs. Broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine in which direction the web goes.
The most important publishing groups are heading to the Internet, which is considered by many to be the “killer” of the printing press.
The \"economic pressure\" the journalists feel has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have agreed to join the new technology, hoping that they will bring something good for journalism.
The biggest crack is in American journalism today between the newsroom editors and the reporters who work for them.
56% of editor-in-chiefs at national level are sure that their reporters share their values with them, while they are only 23% at local level.
Some people think it has to do with \"security at work\".
The managers, who are afraid of losing their jobs within three years, are 47% at national level.
There are 30% among journalists.
The theme of “safe work” in the team (our editors) is always a topic in the United States.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation, as it is the United States, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV broadcasters and internet operators, employers offer as it is popular with them and so it becomes a question of taking it or leaving it.
The editor-in-chiefs get very high wages very often, but the editor can sometimes receive only 10000 euros a month, including pension and insurance fees.
As for the holiday, the matter becomes complicated: a certain amount of days in the first year, so and so many after the third, to finally reach 15 days after a certain number of years.
But the American journalists, as they themselves admit, will often be \"sick\" throughout the year.
It is a question of climate.
UNIPOL: COURT IN ROM: DANILO COPPOLA BLIVED IN GREATAFERRATA
The President of the Second Chamber of Penalties in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the application of the real estate agent, who had asked to be transferred from Grottaferrata to Rome.
It is established against Coppol for bankruptcy in the context of the investigation of the counter-agreement in the case of the acquisition of Unipol-Bnl.
In the course of the trial against him during the last week, his dismissal from the house arrest was converted into a residence obligation in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked to allow the real estate broker to be moved from the provincial city to an apartment in the capital.
According to the court, this could give him the opportunity to influence his company and obtain evidence that he was indicting.
The elite is in danger
The phenomenon had been revealed a few days ago when the Chamber of Deputies voted against the $700 billion package of White House: A large part of the Americans was and is more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This confirms the recent issue of the New York Times, which reports how the crisis gradually widens the Republican Party, which increasingly splits into its old and moderate East Coast Seas, which has always favoured the state institutions and business community, and the neo-conservative, which is opposed to those in Washington and the financial world, and which, for example, wins voters in the south and the centre of the states.
This part of the party owes its rise to the vote of the one I mentioned above.
This example just mentioned, however, is only a small part of the major changes that the current economic earthquake announces or even already represents: not only in the United States, also throughout the West and perhaps beyond these will be affected by them.
Both in the states and in Europe, the crisis seems to speed up the long-awaited events, which are finally taking shape and coming to light under these new conditions.
The first of these phenomena is the rediscovery, the unheard-of renaissance of the state in connection with a kind of renationalization of the economy.
In fact, the crisis means a decline in the banking and financial institutions, which have close links to abroad and at the same time manage an enormous amount of assets of private households residing in a single state.
This means an immediate political problem for governments: how to deal with the families concerned, which are also a huge electorate.
The crisis thus appears economically global, but politically it is almost purely national.
Political internationalism seems to have become so disillusioned and lost its right to speak: the European Union has provided a clear proof of this, which, due to its division into various national and international conflicts, does not know how to find a common way.
Therefore, everyone now expects the intervention of their own state; rescue plans, new rules, and, above all, distribution of aid funds: Since the crisis became more and more serious, only the US has been in the economic situation to save itself without foreign aid.
In addition to the funds, they also have the legitimacy to use them: thus, two non-valued conditions, in certain circumstances, on which otherwise no international organisation and no market will be able to intervene in a similar way.
The new emphasis placed on the state-national element is, moreover, perfectly consistent with the ever-increasing importance that is recently associated in the economy with a more closely related sector: territoriality.
Paradoxically, it is just now, when we were so convinced that we have long entered a networked realm, into a realm of ever-differentiated technologies, the immaterial that we have to determine at once how our future will depend more and more on the essential material things: water, harvest and oil.
While these can certainly all be transported from one place to another in the world, they are nevertheless connected to a closely defined piece of earth, a territory.
Therefore, the person who has such a territory is in favour of another who lives in a landless, waterless or free area of oil.
I now come to the second novelty, but it requires a brief introduction.
Whoever territory, who government, who says politics, also says leadership.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to create two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, there is knowledge about the need for perceived leadership, that is, the need for someone who knows how to regulate things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of disarmament over existing leaderships, including those of the economy, which have become inadequate and full of shade zones.
Finally, there is a deep richness and, in a sense, even more disturbing aspect: a loss of confidence, an intolerance, an image of the incompetence, a feeling of distance, all aimed at a whole class of managers of the Western countries.
It seems that the conviction among large parts of the population is moving its way, that it is not only the actions of the social elite, but already their world of ideas, their Way of Life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose content is the majority of which is increasingly foreign and more translucent.
The demand for leadership thus nourishes underground a branched but powerful movement of the dismantling of the leading class and of the traditional political establishment. This manifests itself in unforeseeable revolts, the electorate and in the uninterrupted recovery of the collective state of mind of the last time: beginning with the rise of Conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, over the collapse of the Labour Party in Great Britain, to the rebellion of American Members against Bush (and perhaps also the victory of the Rights in Italy plays a role here).
One gains the impression that the old elite, their parties, their programs, as well as their rites, magazines, intellectual creditors, some of them would say their format, more and more understanding problems, and therefore less representative value regarding what is happening today in the lower social layers of the West and is even reinforced by the financial crisis and driven to over-dimensionality.
In view of all of this, it would simply be exaggerated to speak of a “rebellion of the masses. ”
But keeping the eyes wide open is certainly not.
The super adhesive that makes the walls go up
The forces of gravity thanks to a adhesive to be defeated and walls to climb up like Superman.
This is the subject of four American research centres, one of which seems to have reached almost the goal.
With a glue placed on an area of only 2.5 sqcm, the researchers succeeded in fixing a 100 kg body on a vertical wall.
STUDIO, an American magazine, has published the results of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the research team is a further development of the adhesives already used, which use a special carbon structure called carbon nanotubes.
“The principle of the adhesive can be presented as a series of pipes arranged for a stack of spaghetti,” explains Zhong Lin Wang from the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists have been inspired by the feet of the geckos, which are covered by microscopic hairs that give the animal a perfect hold.
The tests carried out with various materials, such as glass Teflon and grinding paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the retention of the feet of the reptiles and, at the same time, allows them to be removed from the wall without problems, says Liming Dai, researchers of the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
TO MAUREN ENTERMINED? “This material could be used as a passing adhesive, adds Liming Dai.
About how Spiderman can be felt on walls? Perhaps already, but the researchers think of a less fascinating benefit, such as the connection of electrical devices, because the nanotubes are also heads of heat and electricity.
Further applications could fall into the space sector.
So for the moment, the superheroes still have to wait.
THE OTHER PART OF RESEARCH - also the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to a new type of adhesive.
In an article by the American Chemical Society, Californian scientists present a adhesive made of microfibres that clean themselves like hair by moving on a surface itself from dust and thereby maintain perfect liability.
Medicines: Never take fruit juice
Beware of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, which are consumed in summer due to their refreshing quality and vitamin richness, can cause serious health damage if they are taken at the same time with certain vital medications, as they can have an extreme effect on the intake of these by the body.
David Bailey, professor of the University of Western Ontario in London, repeatedly points to the risk of packed and fresh fruit juices associated with medication intake. During the 236th meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he again struck alarm: it is sufficient for a glass of apple, orange or grapefruit juice to reduce the absorption capacity of certain vital medicines so that they are virtually eliminated and thus the health of the patients is threatened.
Grapefruit juice was already suspected to be responsible for increasing the effects of some medications, such as antibiotics, antiasthmatics, cardiovascular drugs, anxiolytics and neurological agents, up to toxic levels.
MEDIMENTS IN FAHR - The same agency of the medicinal product had warned doctors and patients in a report two years ago about the dangers of this mix, and stressed that it should be taken care of in connection with drugs such as diazepan or metadon.
ES IS NOT GRAPH - According to the experts, orange juice and apple juice contain substances that can inhibit medicines.
The list of active substances inhibited by the fruit juices is long.
Therefore the appeal by Michele Carruba, director of the Università Statale di Milano: “These results are usually forwarded immediately to the various international manufacturers, who are so free to change consumer information.
Therefore, it is recommended that you always read the package leaflet and, if there are still any uncertainties, do not hesitate to ask a pharmacist or a doctor - emphasises the Ansa Agency's expert.
Economic Nobel Prize goes to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize is to the American Paul Krugman for his analysis of commercial patterns and the establishment of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a Neokeynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is known for his regular articles for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush Administration's economic and foreign policy.
A few months after the attacks of September 11, 2001, during the days of the Enron collapse, Krugman had claimed in a New York Times editorial that this second event was more crucial to the history of the United States than the assassinations.
A prediction that did not receive a little polemics as an answer and that was kept to the economist years later, but today proves to be completely correct.
“I’m surprised and also shocked at how quickly the memory of the scandals in the context of Enron’s or Worldcom collapses has disappeared from the public perspective,” said Krugman at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is an “econom of great value, but also a banalizer with a“very aggressive style, which is particularly directed against the excessive liberalism of the Bush government,
Open Office, it appears the third version of the Anti-Microsoft package
The day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0 has come; as a free replacement for Microsoft's Office, the Open Source Software gains an increasing number of users, both at home and in the office, both among freelancers and public administration.
After a year of intensive work by the voluntary developers supervised by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office is now presenting itself to the public with some new features: in addition to a revised and now more sparsely designed initial menu, it is now finally achieved by a reason for guaranteed compatibility with Apple's operating system Mac OS x, as well as support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, i.e. the latest standard ISO version.
Eight against was also read on compatibility with Microsoft's Office 2007, whose new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) can be read by OpenOffice.
Also interesting are some new features, such as those that allow you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, which facilitate e.g. sending via email. This also includes the possibility of importing PDF files into graphic editing modules and at the same time preserve the original appearance of the page.
This allows us to generate \"hybrid\" PDF files, which extend the typical graphics of Adobe format to include the elements of a table and a word processing system.
The collaboration is one of the most improved elements of the applications: tables can now be edited multiple times by different users, avoiding conflicts in the case of changes; in the case of the word processing system, a question is assigned to each processor to ensure a better correction procedure.
Some companies are just publishing various OpenOffice functions on the Internet (on the cloud), while the final result is to be made public in the coming weeks.
The Italian version is available on the following link: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html. Thus it follows the English version, which has been on the mirrors since Friday.
Besides for Windows and Mac OS, the program is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request you can send the installation CD home or to the office.
On the other hand, the free movement of costs may be an incentive for the distribution of the programme into private households, it is also particularly important in the area of business where OpenOffice could succeed in the major throw: finally, various public administration and schools have already transferred to OpenOffice.
In fact, it is not even missing a training offer, which means optimal assistance for small and medium-sized enterprises, and thus even opens business prospects.
OpenOffice consists of five main components: Writer, the Word corresponding text-setting program; Calc, the spreadsheet program, which aims at a displacement of Excel; Impress, to create presentations like Powerpoint; Dbase to operate databases instead of known access; and lastly Draw, a graphics module.
The goal for 2008 is to achieve 5 million downloads - a goal that can easily be exceeded with already reached 3 million and 600 thousand.
Coal also tested positively and thus the fourth doping case
It opens up a new Dopingfall mi framework of the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian athlete Bernhard Kohl of the Gerolsteiner team, the third-class and winner of the jersey of the best climber.
The news published the daily L'Equipe on their website.
The 26-year-old coal from the Gerolsteiner team is the fourth driver, who was tested positively on Cera, the third generation Epo. Previously, this was done by the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher.
The analyses from the Kohl blood samples are among those conducted in the last few weeks by the Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
Now, the counter samples confirm the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place and will be excluded from the races for two years.
The chief of the French Antidoping Commission Pierre Bordry confirmed the positive epotest, and, according to the Associated Press, also notified the Austrian representatives.
The 26-year-old Austrian rose to the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans and also claimed the jersey of the best climber for himself.
THEMA INVESTIGATION: THE NEW YORK TIMES FRANTS: IS ITALIAN WIRELESS?
Italy, \"the former country of the immigrants has recently become one of the preferred countries for immigrants, which are only taken up with resistance.
Does this make Belpaese a nation of racists? This asks the New York Times in a long article dedicated to the subject of racism in Italy and from the case of young Abdul William Guibre, who was murdered in Milan a month ago after he had stolen a pack of cookies.
The case is evidenced by what the Times calls the “Paradox of the North”: the northern regions are those in which “most of the integration and job opportunities” exist, yet the highest degree of anti-immigrationist sentiments and the greatest support of the Lega Nord is to be noted.
As confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Times calls for further episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not just this.
The new legislation against immigration introduced by the Lega and the rapid expulsion of illegal immigrants is also cited as a sign of climate change in Italy.
A movement that also stressed the Pope and the President of the State: \"Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope for a cooperation between Church and State to combat racism at a meeting on the Quirinal,
Students Victims of up to 900 Euros per room high rental price
The market for apartments for students knows no crises.
According to the last study of the Sunia, the tenant trade union, a single room can cost a student up to 900 Euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
“This phenomenon has already taken very heavy trains. All the groups of students are losing their right to study, as their families are unable to support them at this level, as Sunia’s representative Laura Mariani said, “in these cities, the high demand for students is leading to a deformation of the market, which has also damaged the other residents.
In addition, most rental offers include a number of infringements: free contracts, missing registrations, without rental price limits, unauthorised sub-rents.
For the Sunia, there is a need for exceptional measures, which result in a revision of taxation at lower rental prices.
With a closer look at the investigation, it turns out that in Milan a sleeping place in the district of Brianza is needed about 450 Euros; a single room starts at 650 Euros (in the district of Nere) and ends at 800 Euros in the district of Lambie, Udine and Fiera or even 900 Euros in the district of Vittoria.
In Florence, a sleeping area costs an average of 350/400 euros, a room 700.
In Bologna, where students focus around the university in the neighborhoods, there are 250/280 euros for a sleeping place of needs, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, prices in the neighborhoods around the university are about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a sleeping place in a double room.
Only a little deeper are the rents in the neighborhoods around the other universities of Rome: 550 Euros in Ostiense and Cinecittà.
Only those in foreign districts can save money: 300 Euros for a sleeping area and 450 Euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar neighborhoods.
In Naples you need 300-450 euros for a sleeping area, for a room the price is between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive neighborhoods, the Policlinico, Vumero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari a sleeping area costs 250-350 euros, a single room at least 350.
In the smallest cities, prices are lower, but they have a greater weight in the urban economy.
In cities where the phenomenon of renting to non-European students is more common, such as Perugia, there is even another anomaly: a rent of 25-30% above average is demanded by foreign students.
Looking forward to the old cinema Paradiso - the cities close their historic cinema halls
The historical cinemas close due to the favoured multiplexkinos.
\"A city without cinema halls is a blind city, like a face without eyes,
This image of the director Giuseppe Tornators describes with effect what is happening in the major urban centres of Italy, and also in the provinces.
The process of exclusion of cinemas, which began with the birth of the large multi-sale complexes in the periphery, means in the long term death for the single-sale cinema in the center. A process that not only appears irrevocable and irrevocable, but also carries the train of a cultural crime.
Most of the historical places are full of memories, - it's like losing a friend with whom you've laid down a piece of street full of emotions - according to the director of the film, Nuovo Cinema Paradiso, who brought him to the Oskar and the great prize of Cannes 20 years ago. It's the story of a suburban cinema and its nostalgia, which consists of living in a world that is probably lost forever.
The figures provided by the Anec, the central trade association, speak a clear language: over the last five years, the enormous amount of 316 traditional cinemas have had to close; these tokens have largely paid the cinemas in the major cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the most affected regions are Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41.
This demonstrates that the main fault is the multiple xkinos, because it is precisely these three regions in which the largest number of these modern cinemas has been registered: with 195 in the last 5 years, Lombardy has been leading the lists, 81 are both in Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
\"The business has evolved in an irrational way, according to Paolo Protti, President of Anec, \"it is useful that new structures also arise, but the main thing is the preservation of the already existing one, because a hall closes in the city, not all its regular customers are willing to look for a multiple xkino in the periphery instead of the old one.
And here, the missing budget for the fund of the trade association remains out of mind: the debt burden recorded by the state is about 10 million euros.
It is a shame from the ethical and moral point of view that the government does not respect the existing laws.
To preserve the sector would be between 16 and 18 million euros per year of need,
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which, because of the fears surrounding the old cinema halls, has decided to protect it through an agreement between the municipality and the Anec; it is the first agreement of this kind in Italy aimed at protecting and supporting traditional cinemas, both in the historical centre and in the periphery.
Among the measures envisaged are tax advantages for the cinema operators as well as benefits for the public in the area of travel: it will be allowed to drive into the restricted areas of the centre and also to park at cheaper parking fees.
“It’s an enjoyable initiative, according to Giuseppe Tornators,” I hope that other cities will join our example and also design new concepts.
Certainly, however, we also need a better audio and video equipment to be able to do something against the superpower of the multiplex halls, because in the end, today's audience is more demanding.
The defence of traditional cinema has always been an important topic for me: the closure of the \"supercinema\" by Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the decisive point that led me to establish the \"Nuovo cinema Paradiso\", even if I had played with the thought for 10 years.
For 25 years I have been living in Rome; if I have passed by the Rialto or the Quirinale in the Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn to the side so that I don't have to see the dust-covered posters.
The links between politics and 'Ndrangheta lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro
“The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to adapt the decisions of the municipality to the interests of the Mafia group Piromalli.
The accusations of the attorneyship of the Antimafia authorities of Calabria against the mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his deputy Rosario Schiavone of the municipality of Gioia Tauro, who was arrested this morning for committing Mafia business, are serious.
Gioacchino Piromalli, the older mediator between the clan and the public administration, as well as his nephew: the lawyer, who bears the same name as the boss of the clan, had already been sentenced to a compensation sum of 10 million euros due to the involvement of Mafia criminal associations.
\"Every kind of moral and legal standard is contemptuous, so the lawyers write, \"the two local administrations have decided to pay the lawyer Piromalli funds for consulting activities,
“The Mafia Group was thus made possible, according to the judges, to invade the Council Houses on an official basis and to co-finance the public administration’s policies,
The President of the Calabria Regional Committee, Agazio Loiero, does not deny that there are places where Mafia's concentration is greater than in others where such connections are virtually inevitable.
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'Ndrangheta: heroes who receive a white vest,
The arrests of this morning follow those of last July, with which the police of the Piromalli clan were decapitated.
Since the end of last April, the Council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, but the local politicians of their municipal offices had already been excommunicated in 1991, and also at that time due to alleged links between organized crime and local administration.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of the Udc, was elected head of the Central Rights Coalition after the election of May 2006.
He wrote scandal as the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the council.
He was interested in the Vice Minister of State Marco Minniti, whom he accused of having invented everything for political-strategic reasons, but the judges, in connection with this morning's arrest warrant, declare that the Piromalli clan had even dared to request a change to the A3 project.
From a hearing action in connection with the investigations into the Dal Torrione case, the willingness to respond to the wishes of a businessman who is known to be a representative of the large group around the Piromalli - which has made the public administration's actions identical with the interests of that clan - has been shown to be identical to those of the public administration.
When the energy comes out of the waves, the big ones suddenly run up
It is a non-skilling source of money that covers over 70% of the planet's surface and only now seems to understand the world's big energy companies.
Waves, currents and tides are the new renewable energy sources looking for all, and also for occupiers, such as giants like Chevron.
The possibility of extracting energy from the movements of the sea has been considered and examined for 70 years, and these studies have not accidentally intensified significantly since the first oil crisis.
When the price of oil fell by 1980, the idea of sea energy was gasled, but now the environmental organisations and the increased price of oil are pushing for new impetus in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the world's global energy needs could be covered by the energy generated by the ocean waves.
This would be equal to the double of the current energy produced by nuclear power plants.
In addition, the currents and tides would be added.
Giants during attack.
The first company to rely on marine energy is Enersis, which signed a contract in 2005 to set up a power plant in northern Portugal.
When this news was published it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, there are now more and more companies from the traditional energy industry that rely on marine energy production.
“Chevron explores these technologies,” says the spokesman of a company known to the US giant in the Wall Street Journal, and considers the possibility of working with us.”
It is about obtaining approval from the American Energy Commission, which is needed to launch a project off the coast of Alaska.
This is a sign that is not to be underestimated, especially considering that oil is still being promoted by the United States in Alaska, and President Bush recently launched plans for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, the companies Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey, which invest in the new industry, are also not known for the details, so observers speak of an increasing interest.
Even improved technologies.
Experts are talking about a technology that is still in the process of breaking up, not least because the last doubts of environmentalists have not yet been clarified.
So far, projects such as those in Portugal and Scotland are of a rather small dimension and do not seem to cause any serious environmental problems.
However, in order to produce energy to a large extent, there is a need for technologies with a much greater impact on the environment.
There are several possibilities: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of interconnected buoys.
The thrust of the waves, which the bows move up and down, is transformed into hydraulic pressure within the swimmer via pistons and cylinders.
This drives a turbine, which in turn operates a generator.
The electricity is sent to the coast via underwater lines.
So far there are four planned installations of this kind, which are only waiting for state approval. Part of the energy obtained could also serve for military institutions.
However, Power is already producing energy for a department store and a parking lot using undersea turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movements during the tide drive the turbines, which feed the generator through the resulting rotational motion.
According to Verdant, a long queue of potential clients is already waiting for the necessary authorizations to use these energy sources.
First the waves, then the tides.
According to the Institute for Power Production Research, a particular interest is immediately deserving of the potential that is in the tides.
Although this is also an irregular phenomenon, the tides are better predictable than wind currents, solar radiation and also waves, and therefore a more reliable source of electricity.
It is precisely the tidal energy that has led states like New York, Maine and Alaska as well as other coastal states to invest as much as 7.5 million dollars in 2008 - up to 35 million are already planned for 2009.
