Members of the Welsh Assembly worried they're going to look 'like fools'.
There is consternation among some meeting members about the proposal that their title should change from AM's to MWP's (for Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This was caused by plans to change the name of the meeting to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of all over the police spectrum are afraid it could provoke a mockery.
One worker party says his group is concerned because \"it's with Twp and Pwp rhyme\"
For Readers Outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means relief.
A member of the Plaid Cymru party said the group as a whole is \"not happy\" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his group is \"unreceptive\" about the change of name, but noticed that it was a short leap of speech from MWP to Muppet, the British equivalent of fool or fool.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced like the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter u.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently designing legislation to introduce the name changes, said: “The final decision on any descriptions of what is called Assembly Members will, of course, be a matter for the members themselves”
The Wallish 2017 Government Act gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public consultation on the proposals that received broad support to call the meeting a Welsh Parliament.
As for the AM's title, the Commission preferred Welsh Parliament Members of WMP's, but the MWP option received the most approval in a consultation with the public.
AM's seeming to be proposing alternatives, but the struggle to gain consensus may be a headache for the chairman, Elin Jones, who within weeks has to submit a bill on the changes.
The legislation on the reforms will also include other changes to the meeting's way of working, including rules on disqualification of AMs and the design of the committee system.
AM's will get the last say in the question as to what they should be called when they debate the legislation.
Macedonians vote in referendum on change of country name
Selectors will vote on Sunday or have to change their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The popular vote was arranged in an attempt to remove a decade-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which itself had a province called Macedonia.
Athens has already demanded for a long time that the name of its neighbor in the north represents a claim in his territory and has repeatedly made capsion against his applications for membership in the EU and NATO.
The president of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposed the popular vote on the change of name, said that he would ignore the vote.
Supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, however, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of Saint Martin's get quiet because churches in Harlem are struggling
“Historically speaking, the old people I spoke to said there was a bar and a church on every corner, ” says Adams.
“ None of the two are there today, ” he says.
He says that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
“ People now socialize in other ways, ” he says.
“Crowses are no longer neighborhoods ’ family rooms to which people go regularly“
Regarding churches, he is concerned that the money from asset sales will not last as long as leaders expect, “and sooner or later they will be back exactly where they started“
Churches, he adds, can be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums full of the type of people who will not help the neighborhood’s remaining refuges.
“The vast majority of people who buy units in these buildings will be white, ” he says, “so the day these churches close completely will bring even closer, because most of the people who move into these condominiums will probably not become members of these churches“
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis - Metropolitan Community in 1870, Saint Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist community moved away in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had worshiped nearby took over the building's title.
Saint Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by Ehrw. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers in125th street, a main street for shopping in Harlem, who did not want to hire or promote black people.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but while Father Johnson's members were planning to rebuild it, they ordered the carillon.
Father David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at Saint Martin's, proudly called the carilion's bells.
The expert who played the carilion in Julie called it something else: 'A cultural treasure' and 'an irreplaceable historical instrument'
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carilion in the world played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who moved to the larger carilion at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather says Saint Martin's didn't replace him.
What has been played at St. Martin's in the past few months is a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought in by the laymen of the church, others by the Episcopal diocese.
The church council, the congregation’s governing body, made up of laymen - wrote to the diocese in July with concern that the diocese would try to transfer the cost - to the church council, even though the church council was not involved in the appointment of the architects and contractors who sent the diocese.
Some parishioners complain about a lack of transparency from the diocese's side.
Shark hurt 13-year-olds on crab diving in California
A shark attacked a 13-year-old boy on Saturday and injured him when he dived for crab on the first day of the crab season in California, officials say.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy yelling for help and then rowing with a group to help him pull out of the water.
Hammel said he first thought it was just the excitement of a first lobster, but then he realized 'that he called, 'I'm bitten!
I'm bitten!'
His entire key leg was torn open,- Hammel saw when he got out of the boy.
\"I called that everyone should come out of the water: 'There is a shark in the water!' \"Add Hammel.
The boy was flew to the Rady Children’s Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is described as critical.
It is not known which shark species is responsible for the attack.
Larry Giles at a media education session said that a shark was noticed in the area a few weeks ago, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries on the upper part of his bulb.
Officials closed beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and safety reasons.
Giles notes that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plan to expand to UK beauty brand
Sainsbury's says Boots, Superdrug, and Debenhams are fighting department store-type beauty corridors manned by specialist assistants.
As part of a major expansion in the UK's £2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow while sales of fashion and household goods are falling back, the larger beauty corridors in 11 stores will be tested across the country and if it is a success next year will be taken to more stores.
The investment in beauty takes place while supermarkets are looking for ways to fill racks once used for TVs, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury's say it will double the size of its available beauty products to 3,000 products, which for the first time will include trade names such as Revlon, Essie, Twezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bee will also find more space with trademark-specific areas similar to those seen in shops like Boots.
The supermarket also again launches its Boutique-grimering series so that the majority of products are vegan-friendly - something on which younger buyers demand more.
In addition, the perfume retailer, The Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon in South London and a second which will open later this year in Sellly Oak in Birmingham.
Internet shopping and a shift to smaller quantities of food bought daily at local convenience stores means that supermarkets need to do more to persuade people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, the chief executive officer of Sainsbury's, said that the stores are going to look more like department stores when the supermarket chain tries to fight back against Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's put Argos sales points in hundreds of stores and also announced a number of Habitat sales points since it had bought both these chains two years back, which, according to their grocery sales, had made the purchases more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to renew its beauty and pharmacies failed.
Sainsbury's had tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000's, but the relationship was terminated after an argument as to how profits from the pharmacies should be divided within its shops.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's three years ago sold his 281 store pharmacy for £125m to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
It says that Lloyds will play a role in the plan by offering an extensive range of luxury skin care products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: “We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty corridors to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invested in specially trained colleagues who would be at hand to offer advice.
Our range of trade names has been designed to meet every need and the attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now a challenging beauty destination challenging the old way of shopping \"
Peter Jones 'wounded' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from £11 million agreement
Dragons Den-ster Peter Jones ran away 'wounding' after TV provider Holly Willoughby withdrew her from a £11 million agreement with his lifestyle brand business to focus on her contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby didn't have time for their home clothes-and-coming trade name, Truly.
The couple’s business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop trade name.
The This Morning provider, 37, announced on Instagram that she was withdrawing.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons Den-ster Peter Jones angry by withdrawing at the last moment from their profitable lifestyle brand-besistance--to focus on her own giant contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Bronne says that Jones' rage was when TV's golden girl Tuesday at a tense meeting in the headquarters of his business in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, announced that her new events - worth up to £1.5 million - meant that she could no longer spend enough time on their home dress-and-advantage trade name, Truly.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop trade name and would have doubled according to Willoughby's estimated £11 million fortune.
While Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones climbed on a radiator and traded Britain for one of his holiday homes.
A source says: \"Truth was Holly's greatest priority at far.
It would be her long - term future that would carry her through the coming few decades.
Her decision to withdraw was absolutely stupid to all those involved.
No one could believe Tuesday what was happening, it was so close to the presentation.
There's a warehouse full of goods at the Marlow headquarters that's right to be sold.
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the This Morning provider, one of Britain's stars that makes the most of the money flow, can drive millions out of the bag as a result of the huge investment in products that stretch from pillows and candles to clerks and home clothes, and the possibility that his disclosure may encounter even more delays.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby set up Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined him as chairman in March.
The couples stay together on vacation and Jones owns a 40 percent share in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become a trademark ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the provider of ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
A source near Jones last said, \"We will not comment on his business matters.\"
Hard words 'and then we fall in love'.
He ridiculed criticism that he was going to get from the news media because he made a remark that some would consider \"unpresidential\" and because he was so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
said Trump in his camma--nous reader's voice.
“I didn’t give up anything, ” he said.
He mentioned that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump described their first meeting in June in Singapore as a major step towards the nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
But nuclear disarmament negotiations burned down.
North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, said on Saturday, more than three months after the June Leaders' Convention in Singapore, to leaders at the UN General Assembly, that the North did not see an \"conformity response\" from the US to North Korea's early disarmament activities.
Instead, he noted, the U.S. continues with sanctions aimed at keeping the pressure going.
Trump took a much more optimistic turn in his convention talk.
“Our progress is excellent with North Korea,” he said.
“We were on our way to start a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we've got this wonderful relationship.
He says that his efforts to improve relationships with Kim have produced positive results - it has ended rocket tests, helped to free hostages, and brought the remains of American soldiers back home.
And he defended his unusual approach to descriptions of relationships with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be presidential, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded arena, we would have had nearly 200 people standing just there,” Trump said as he pointed to the crowd right before him.
Tidal wave and earthquake in Indonesia ravaged island, killing hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were said not to be needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been uprooted, no national disaster has been announced, a prerequisite for catalizing international aid.
“Unfortunately, they were very clear that they were not asking for international help, which makes it a little difficult, ” said Sumbung.
Although Save the Children are putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is not certain whether foreign personnel can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster agency, said that Indonesian officials assisted the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the assistance effort.
Given the constant global tremor that Indonesia continues to endure, the country is sadly poorly prepared for the anger of nature.
While tsunami shelters are built in Aceh, it is not a common sight to other shorelines.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning iron in Palu probably contributed to the loss of life, even though there was a warning of strength.
Traveling between Indonesia’s many islands is best challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims was on their way to Palu, but it would take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Yoko Widodo made the improvement of Indonesia's sophisticated infrastructure a central point of his election campaign and published questionable money on roads and railways.
However, Yoko’s administration is being harassed by fund shortages as he faces reelection next year.
Mr. Yoko also faced the pressure of sloating sectarian tension in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim merriment accepted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced as Christian and Muslim gangs with machetes, arrows and bows, and other primitive weapons fought on the streets.
Watch: Liverpool’s Daniel Sturridge kicks good equalizer against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London from a Premierliga loss at Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute.
Xherdan Shaqiri told Sturridge when he was some 30 years from the Chelsea target and his team was 1-0 behind.
He typed the ball to the left before kicking it far to the goal.
The attempt went high above the frame as it hovered to the upper right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball swirled over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell in the net.
“ It was just trying to get into that position, to get on the ball, and players like Shaq always play forward as far as possible, so I tried to make as much time as possible for myself as possible, ” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Edge coming and once typed and didn’t think too much about it and just kicked up, ”
Chelsea was at half-time 1-0 before after the Belgian star Eden Hazard recorded a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blues' goal-header played in that playroom with a back-up again to Mateo Kovacic before he pulled near the middle field and inhaled into the Liverpool help.
Kovacic quickly received and cited in the middle field.
With a beautiful forward head, he then led Hazard into the frame.
Hazard crossed the defense and ended with a left-foot kick past Liverpool's Alison Becker in the farthest goal net.
Liverpool celebrates Wednesday, 3 p.m., the battle against Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at Stadium San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea arrived in London on Thursday at the UEFA Europe League in front of Videoton.
Death to 832 after Indonesian tsunami
The death toll in Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami climbed to 832, the country’s disaster agency said early on Sunday.
It has been reported that many people were caught under the debris of buildings that caused the earthquake, which struck at a magnitude of 7.5 on Friday, to collapse, and caused burners of up to 20 feet, the agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said to a news conference.
The city of Palu, with its more than 380,000 people, was littered with the ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest man, 32, under suspicion of murder after woman has been shot dead
A murder investigation was launched after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old was found at 7.55 a.m. in Grayson Mews in John Street with knife sticks, and a 32-year-old man was arrested under suspicion of murder.
The police urged people in the area who had heard or seen anything to get ahead.
Spectator Brian O'Hagan said: ‘The investigation is in an early stage but I appeal to anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard anything suspicious, to contact us.
I also appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught anything on dashcam film material, to contact us since they can have information that can be indispensable to our investigation.'
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead, and that she was found within a property.
This afternoon friends who are said to know the woman arrived at the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations continue since the police said they were in the process of informing the victim’s next - to - present.
A taxi manager who lived in Grayson Mews had just tried to return to his apartment but was told by the police that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
Residents are now told that these will take hours before they are re-instated.
It was heard that a police officer told one man that the whole area was now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears on the scene.
She repeatedly said ‘it’s so awful. ’
At 2 nm there were two police cars inside the cordon with another car just outside.
A number of officials are left within the cordon to monitor the block of apartments.
Anyone with information is asked to link @MerPolCC to DM, 101 or to link Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 with log 247 of 30 September as a reference.
Parliament's Statute of Cromwell becomes the latest memorial hit with ‘rewriting history' disputes
His banishment will be poetic justice for his Talibanlike destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious objects of art carried out by its fanatic Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Association described Mr. Crick's suggestion as \"soothness\" and \"an attempt to rewrite history\".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Association, said: “It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statutes that the shape of Oliver Cromwell would become a target outside the Palace of Westminster.
The image storming of the English civil wars was still commanded by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his forefather Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent portrayal of Cromwell was evidence of 19th century opinion and part of the history of a figure that many believe is still worthy of remembrance.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether it is an entirely accurate portrayal is the subject of continued historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the middle 17th century gave shape to the later development of our nation, and that Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure representing one side of that division.
His success as a Protector is also worthy of celebration and commemoration-
Mordvark Distinction Chinese Farmer
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwest China.
The man, identified only by his, 'Yuan', was found dead with a torn artery covered with blood near a cage at the market in Liupanshui in the Guizhou province, reported the South China Morning Post Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares on May 30, 2005 to inject pigs with vaccines at a pig farm in Xining of Qinghai province, China.
He reportedly traveled Wednesday with his cousin of the neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead, and found a door open to a neighboring pig cage.
He said there was a great pig of males in the cage with blood at his mouth.
A forensic investigation, according to the report, confirmed that the 550-pound pig had bitten the farmer.
“ My cousin’s legs were bleeding and torn, ” said the cousin, who was mentioned on his “Wu, ” quoted the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera film material showed how Yuan entered the market Thursday at 4.40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man does not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A Mark manager told the Evening New that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking someone else, while the police collected evidence on the scene.
Yuan’s family and the market authorities are said to negotiate compensation for his death.
Although strange, cases of pigs attacking humans have been reported before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and left the man with critical injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 650 pound pig had tied a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife had frightened the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBS News that pigs are not normally aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as a \"sneller.\"
\"They're not playful.
They're picks, very curious... they're not going to hurt you.
You just have to show them the proper amount of respect,' he said.
Res from Hurricane Rosa will bring widely distributed heavy rain to southwest U.S.A.
As foretold, hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring floods throughout northern Mexico and the southwest U.S. over the coming days.
Rosa had winds from about 5 a.m. east of 85 m.p., a category 1 hurricane, and was placed 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough over the Pacific Ocean begins to take shape and move eastward to the west coast of the US. As Rosa Monday approached the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm, it will drive heavy tropical humidity northwards the southwest US into the beginning.
Rosa will bring rain from up to 10 inches in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, in response to the approaching trough, tropical humidity will bring widespread rainfall to the southwest over the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inch of rain will cause dangerous flash floods, floods of waste, and possibly landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical humidity will cause place-place rainfalls of up to 2 to 3 inch per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 2 to 4 inch of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially over the largest parts of Arizona.
Instant floods are possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions because of the spread nature of tropical rain.
It would be extremely unwise to venture on foot into the desert with the danger of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rains can cause deep - claps to hit rivers and thunderstorms will bring severe local winds and dust clouds.
The approaching trough will bring some local heavy rain to parts of the coastline of Southern California.
Rainfall total numbers of more than half a inch are possible, which can cause low flow of waste and smooth journeys.
It will be the region’s first rainfall of the wet season.
Some scattered tropical rain showers will begin to reach Arizona on Sundays and early Mondays before the rain allows Monday and Tuesday to become more widespread.
Heavy rain will spread Tuesday to the Four Angles and last until Wednesday.
In October, intense temperature results across the U.S. can be seen as the North Pole gets cooler, but the tropics remain very hot.
This sometimes leads to dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
A good example of dramatic temperature differences throughout the central U.S. is on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, prolonged summer heat will try to rise and expand again.
It is expected that large parts of the central and eastern US will start to warm October, with widely distributed 80's from the Southern Plain to parts of the Northeast.
The city of New York can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a higher chance of above average temperatures for the eastern US for the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watch Brett Kavanaugh trial
Over 20 million people have watched on six television networks on Thursday for the thrilling testimony of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christians Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that was alleged to have occurred in the 1980's.
Meanwhile, the political deadpoint continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular programs for Friday's on-the-nipper turnout: an agreement made by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to carry out a week-long investigation.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh was drinking her and was trying to pull out her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a hearty testimony, said he was 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people were watching it Friday, said Nielsen.
The company counted average viewer number on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
Numbers were not immediately available for other networks that showed them, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen sometimes finds it difficult to measure people who look into offices.
To put it in perspective, it's an audience as big as one for a decisive football game or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was all the networks before with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day-long trial, said Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest was still high after the trial.
Flake was the central figure in Friday’s drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he was going to vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was caught on Friday morning on CNN and CBS where objectors shouted at him as he tried to take a elevator to a Judicial Committee.
He stood with downed eyes for a few minutes while CNN vividly depicted his bad speech.
“ I’m standing right here in front of you, ” said one woman.
“ Do you think he is telling the country the truth?
He was told: “You have power while so many women are powerless,
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and gone in front of the elevator door, saying that he would have more to say at the committee trial.
The cable and broadcasting networks covered all later living hours when the Judicial Committee would vote to promote Kavanaugh's appointment to the full Senate for a vote.
But Flake said that he would only do this with the understanding that the FBI would look at the charges against the candidate for the next week, as the Democratic minority had requested.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Democrat Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake’s choice was powerful because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump filed an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British EM May accuses critics of ‘political game' about Brexit
First Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union, accused of \"political play\" with Britain's future and undermined national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
Britain’s Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Konservatieve party conference in Birmingham, Britain on September 29, 2018.
In another interview next to her on the cover of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that a suggestion that Britain and the EU should invent each other's tariffs was \"very ridiculous\".
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest suspected Dyteon Simpson in LSU player's death
The police arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and arrested on a second-degree murder charge, said the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims had lost his glasses during the clash.
The police found the glasses on the scene and said they had found Simpson's DNA on it, reports CBS-affiliated WABB.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he admitted that he had shot Wayde.
His bail was set at $350,000, the lawyer reported.
The courtesian obituary of East Baton Rouge Parish issued a preliminary report on Friday saying that the cause of death was a gunshot wound at the head at the neck.
The department praised the Louisiana State Police's refugee task force, the state police crime laboratory, Southern University police, and local citizens for their help with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Athletic Director Joe Alleva thanks territorial law application for his zeal and pursuit of justice
Sims was 20 years old.
The six-foot-ses predictor grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
His average past season was 5.6 points and 2.6 returns per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team in \"plated\" and \"in shock\" about Wayde's death.
“ That’s what you worry about, ” said Wayde.
Volcano spit as in Mexico City
As what spewed out of the Popocatepeti volcano, the southern neighborhoods of Mexico’s capital had reached.
The National Center for Ramp Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater had picked up and registered 183 gas and ash releases in 24 hours.
The center monitored multiple thunders and shakings.
Images on social media have shown thin low gas car windscreens in neighborhoods of Mexico City like Xochimilco.
Geophicists have noted an increase in activity at the volcano, which is 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.1 central Mexico peaked in September 2017.
The volcano, known as “Don Goyo, ” has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalonian separatists for the commemoration of independence voice
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, and thousands joined in demonstrations to commemorate the first commemoration of Catalonia’s polarizing voice for settlement.
A group of masked pro-separatists who were held back by riot police, they bombarded with eggs and poured powder paint that caused dark dust clouds in streets that usually swarmed with tourists.
A rowing also broke out later in the day, and the police had to use their clubs to keep the fighting in check.
Over several hours, pro-independence groups on one tone \"Don't forget, don't forgive - sing in confrontation with the Unionists' scream of \"Lank Life Spain\"
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries suffered in the processions, reported the local press.
The tension continues to run high in the independence-oriented region a year after the referendum of 1 October by Madrid was considered illegal but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
Selectors voted overwhelmingly to become independent, but the participation was low, with those who were largely captivating the voice.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police attempted violent clashes to prevent the polling from continuing throughout the region.
Pro-independence groups camped overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The procession continued but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist confession with his wife, said he was no longer hopeful of the prospect that Catalonia would gain independence.
“ Last year we spent one of the best moments.
I saw my parents cry of joy because they could voice but now we are stuck, “he said.
Despite a vital yet nail-crapped victory in regional elections last December, Catalonian pro-independence parties have struggled this year to maintain momentum, with many of their best-known leaders either in self - imposed exile or in detention in predominance for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police on his phone, says the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
“ It’s getting more and more tense, ” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalonian leaders in pre-trial detention since last year, announced that he would be in European Parliament elections next year.
“A candidate for European elections is the best way to eliminate the decline in democratic values and the oppression we have seen of the Spanish government, ” he said.
Londonderry: Mans arrested after engine at home vasry
Three men, 33, 34, and 39 years old, were arrested after a car was repeatedly trapped at a house in Londonderry.
The incident unfolded at about 19:30 BST on Thursday in Ballynagardsing.
Spectator Bob Blemmings said that damage was done to the gates and the building itself.
A crossbow may also be shot at a stage after the car.
Menga target gives Livingston 1-0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga’s first goal for Livingston ensures victory
Advanced Livigston surprised Rangers to transfer Steven Gerrard to only his second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga’s goal was evidenced by the difference when Gary Holt’s team moved with Hibernian to the second.
Gerrard's team stayed this season in the Premiership without going away and came next week to stand before the forerunners Heart, which they were eight points ahead.
Rangers first host Rapid Vienna in Europeliga on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston expands their unsurpassed loop in the division into six contests, with Chief Trainer Holt still not a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston is playing out chances of boat visitors
Holt's team had to run ahead long before they recorded a goal, with their bruising that Rangers had made all sorts of problems on their necks.
SR broke through but behaved in front of the goal hook, then AL could only play wide after approaching and meeting CH’s headhold across the target hook.
The hosts were content to let Rangers play before them, knowing that they could get the visitors to the death - game scene.
And thus came the decisive goal.
Rangers took off a ransom and Livingston created an opportunity, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson, who together gave Menga the chance to kick and draw a goal from the middle of the frame.
By then, Rangers had dominated but could not penetrate the home defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely unconcerned.
That pattern was continued in the second half even though Alfredo Morelos had forced a setback from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was denied by the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow widely typed to escape Livingston's still open game.
Overcrosses repeatedly reached Livingston’s frame and repeatedly stopped, while two punishments — after Halkett’s challenge of replacing Glenn Middleton and one for handball — were dismissed.
Livingston’s ‘Fenomenal’ - analysis
BBC Scotland’s Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal game and results for Livingston.
To the last man was excellent; they still surpassed expectations on this upward course.
Hul game style and manhood have been almost unchanged since their return to first - class, but quite a bit of credit goes to Holt for the way he strengthened the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Hackett was huge with his manciifical defense arrangement while Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall constantly on their toes.
Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
As well as at times under Gerrard, they could not maintain those standards.
Hul final ball was missing and only once could they get through the home team, which is somewhat of a wake-up for Rangers, which they found in mid-division.
Erdogan gets mixed receptions in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29,) smiles and blue air came when leaders from Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It's the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which had to restore relations between NATO allies.
They had a fallout on issues that included human rights, press freedom, and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city houses the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police cited security reasons to prevent the 25,000-strong crowd from meeting in front of the mosque but many supporters then arrived to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurdies, also dictated their votes and condemned both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The fighting demonstrations reflect the division of a visitor greeted by some German Turks as a hero and extorted by others as an autocrat.
Deptford road accident: Bicycle driver dies in collision with engine
A cyclist died in a collision in London involving a car.
The collision took place around 10:15 BST near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped, and paramedics were present, but the man died on the scene.
The collision occurred months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-trap in Childers Street, about a mile from where Saturday's accident occurred.
The Metropolitan Police said that officials are working to identify the man and to inform his immediate residents.
Road closures and bus redirects were advised in place and motorists were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards injured in riot
Six guards were injured in a riot at a high-security prison, the prison said.
On Sunday, about 09:30 B.C.E., riot broke out and is still in progress at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire.
Specialis- 'Tornado keepers' were called in to handle the riot, which included eight prisoners and was confined to one wing.
The guards were treated on the scene for minor facial injuries.
A prison service spokesman said: “Specially trained prison personnel have been invited to pay attention to a continued incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six personnel were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and make it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and can stay behind bars longer'
HMP Long Martin houses more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous offenders.
It was reported in June that the principal of the prison received hospital treatment after he was attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot officials were called on to pay attention to serious disorder in which staff with biliary balls were attacked.
Hurricane Rosa Drieg Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Kitsfluge (Dry Areas Trek Dalk Advantage)
It's unusual for a tropical low pressure to hit Arizona, but that's exactly what could happen early next week when Hurricane Rosa's remaining energy moves across the southwest desert and brings instant flood risks.
The National Weather Service has already issued instant flood guards for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa Tuesday will take a direct route over Phoenix, and by Monday will be approaching with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix, in a second, noticed that only \"ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border,
National hurricane center models predict 2 to 4 inch rainfall, with isolated amounts of up to 6 inch in the Mogollon edge of Arizona.
Other parts of the U.S. Southwest, including the central Rockies and the Great Kom, will likely receive 1 to 2 thumbs, with isolated totals of possibly up to 4 thumbs.
For those out of the risk of instant flooding, Rosa's rain will probably be a blessing as the region is plagued by drought.
Although floods are a very serious issue, of this rainfall will likely be beneficial since the southwest is currently experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona experience at least extreme drought, the second highest category, “weather.com reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa’s road leads to approach to land throughout the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still at hurricane - strong Sunday morning, with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm encounters cooler waters in the Pacific, so her strength decreases.
So it is expected that she will reach the country on Monday afternoon or evening against tropical storms in Mexico.
Rainfall over parts of Mexico can be severe and present a significant flood risk.
“ Rainfall totals from 3 to 6 inch is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with up to 10 inch possible, ” reportedweather.com.
Rosa will then move as a tropical storm north over Mexico before it reaches the Arizona border in the early morning hours as a tropical depression and will then move through Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday evening.
“ Rosa’s greatest danger is very severe rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and the U.S. Southwest, ” said the National Orcan Center.
This rain is expected to cause life - threatening flash floods and debris in the deserts and landslides in the mountainous areas.
Midsummer Norton attack: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys a 20-year-old man was arrested under suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The injured teenage son was found on Saturday at about 04:00 BST in the Excellent Terrace area of Midsummer Norton.
He was taken to the hospital where he was still in a \"stable\" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man was arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Officials appealed to anyone who may have any mobile imaging material from what happened to come forward.
Trump said Kavanaugh 'was suffering under the community, the anger' of the Democratic Party.
\"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to reject the merciless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party, \" said Trump at a convention in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh suffered under the commonality, the anger, of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh witnessed Thursday before Congress and boldly and emotionally denied a claim by Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also witnessed about her claim during the trial.
On Saturday, the president said the Americans saw Kavanaugh’s “brilliance and quality and courage. ”
\"A voice to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to confirm one of the most competent legal spirits of our time, a jury with a pure record of public service,\" he said to the crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's nomination while talking about the importance of Republican attendance at the mid-term elections.
“ Five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our life.
I don’t stand, but I actually stand, “he said.
That’s why I fight for these candidates all over the world.
Trump argued that the Democrats are on a mission to resist and hinder \"
The first important procedural vote on the Senate floor on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected not to take place later than Friday, said a senior GOP leadership assistant for CNN.
Hundreds died from Indonesian shaking, tsunami, with figures still rising
At least 384 people were killed and many washed away when giant waves broke on beaches when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered on the beach on Friday in the city of Palu for a feast on the beach when burners of up to six feet (18 feet) broke high at sunset on the beach, washed away many after their death, and destroyed everything that was in the way.
The tsunami followed a 7.5-range earthquake.
“When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still busy with their activities on the beach and did not run immediately and they became victims,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia’s BNPB disaster relief agency during an information session in Jakarta.
“ The tsunami did not come on its own, it dragged cars, logs, houses together, it hit everything on the ground, ” said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had moved over the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h (497 m/h) before it hit the coast.
Some people climbed into trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photographs released by the disaster agency show many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges torn and collapsed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, aftershocks shook the coastal city.
A series of earthquakes is felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's agency for evaluating and applying technology (BPPT) stated in a statement that the energy released by Friday's giant shaking was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which is at the end of a long, narrow bay, could have increased the size of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as “significantly ” and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls, and hotels collapsed.
Bodies of some victims were found where they were trapped under the ruins of buildings that collapsed, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the accidents and damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala that is closer to the earthquake shaft.
Communication is completely obstructed with no information - from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are over 300,000 people living there, the Red Cross said in a statement, and added that their staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
“It’s already a disaster, but it can get much worse,” they said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday because they did not tell that a tsunami hit Palu, although officials said the waves had come at the time the warning had been issued.
In amateur imaging material shared on social media, a man can be heard on the top floor of a building desperate warnings about the upcoming tsunami screaming at the people at the bottom of the street.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the beach and slurry buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately declare the image material authentic.
The shaking and tsunami caused major power disruptions that cut down communications around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, said authorities, but evacuaters still needed food and other basic necessities.
The city’s airport was reopened only for assistance efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was to visit decommissioning centers in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia tsunami mortality rates rise above 800.
It is very bad.
Although World Vision’s staff from Donggala arrived safely in Palu City, where workers sheltered in deck shelters erected in their office’s courtyard, they passed by scenes of destruction, said Mr. Doseba.
They told me that they had seen many homes destroyed, “ he said.
It is very bad.
Even while assistance groups are starting the terrible task of launching the disaster relief task, some have complained that foreign aid workers are being prevented from traveling to Palu with great experience.
According to Indonesian guidelines, funds, supplies, and personnel from overseas can only begin after the area of the disaster has been declared a national disaster zone.
That has not yet happened.
“It is still a disaster on the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
\"As soon as the government says, \"Good, it's a national disaster, \"we can open it for international assistance, but it doesn't have any status yet\"
With the arrival of the second night on Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those still missing are hopeful that their loved ones will be the miracles that will bring relief to the sad story line of natural disasters.
On Saturday a little boy was taken out of a sewer pipe.
On Sunday, rescuers saved a woman for two days under rubble, with her mother's corpse next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the trainer of the Indonesian national parachutes team, set up two of the missing parachutes for the Asian Games that had earlier ended this month in Indonesia.
Still some of those who were trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi, were his students.
\"As a senior in the parachute weaving field, I have my own emotional burden,\" he said.
Mr. Gendon tells how, in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel on social media had circulated among the parachute weaving community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu participants who participated in the beach festival.
However, his messages were only answered with one gray marking, rather than two blue markings.
“ I think that means the messages were not delivered, ” he said.
Thieves steal $26 750 when refilling OTM by Newport on the Life
Thieves stole $26 750 on Friday morning at a Brink's worker who had refilled an OTM at Newport on the Life, according to a news release from the Newport Police Station.
The car's driver was emptying an OTM in an entertainment complex and getting ready to deliver more money, detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.

According to the exemption, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing from the scene, but the police did not specify the number involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities must contact Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes its name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West will change his name to Ye
With the announcement of the change on Twitter Saturday, he wrote: “The being formerly known as Kanye West
West, 41, had been nicknamed Ye for a long time and used the nickname as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change occurs on Saturday Night Live, where it is expected that he will introduce his new all to Yandhi.
He replaced Ariana Grande on the program that for “emotional reasons ” had canceled, the program’s manufacturer said.
Besides the fact that it is an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has said in the past that the word has religious significance to him.
\"I believe 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you','- said West earlier this year when he was discussing his album title with radio provider Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, it is us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye, just the reflection of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.
He is one of a number of famous rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs has been known among others as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West employee, JAY-Z, has also been done with or without a link sign and uppercase.
Mexico’s AMLO promises not to use military force against civilians
Mexican newly-elected president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has run into the country's 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students promised never to use military power against civilians.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to “never use the military to control the Mexican people ”
Soldiers shot at a peaceful demonstration in the plaza on October 2, 1968, where up to 300 people were killed at a time when left-wing student movements took place throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to those studying and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training are moving youth to gangs.
US must double AI funding
With China becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the US must double the amount spent on research in that field, say investor and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several parts of the U.S. government made AI announcements, even though the U.S. has recently made an overall formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China announced its plan last year: they are aiming to be the No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
“Double the AI research budget will be a good start, given that all the other countries are so far behind the U.S. and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI,” said Lee.
The doubling of funding may double the chances that the next major AI performance will be achieved in the U.S., said Lee this week in an interview to CNBC.
Lee, whose book ‘AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order’ has been published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the HUB of Synovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980's at Carnegie Mellon University he worked on an AI system that hit the highest-ranking American Othello player and later was a managing officer at Microsoft Research and President of Google's China branch.
Lee recognized previous technology competitions of the US government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's robotics challenge and asked when the next one would be, to help identify the next visionary.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win government seats, said Lee.
“ It is not China that takes away the academic leaders; it is the corporate ones, ” said Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have appointed influential individuals from other universities to work on AI.
Lee says immigration policy changes can also help to help the US AI efforts.
“I think green cards should be offered automatically to PhD’s in AI,” he said.
China’s State Council issued their Next Generation Development Plan for Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people at academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint centre for artificial intelligence aimed at attracting partners from the industry and the academic world, and the White House announced the formation of a Core Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, US legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence came under fire for months.
Macedonians vote in elections or have to change the country's name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on whether to change their name to \"Republic of North Macedonia\" which would resolve a decade-old dispute with Greece which blocked its membership boats for the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that their northern neighbor's name represents a demand in the area and has refused their admission to NATO and the EU.
The two governments entered into an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argued that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether the attendance would meet the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum vote letter read: “If you are in favour of NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece,
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argued that it is a price that can be paid to seek admission to Macedonia, one of the countries that came from the collapse of Yugoslavia, to such bodies as the EU and NATO.
“ Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live free under the umbrella of the European Union, for it means more secure lives for all of us, said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although this is not legally binding, enough members of parliament said that they would accept the outcome of the vote to decide it.
The change of name will require a two-thirds temper in Parliament.
The state’s election commission said there were no reports of irregularities at 1 p.m.
But the attendance was then only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of the registered voters voted.
“I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gyose Tanevski, 62, an elector in the capital city of Skopje.
Macedonia’s EM, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica, and his son Dushko bring their voices to the referendum in Macedonia about the change of the country’s name that will pave the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
Before the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small height and drew up chairs in front of tents set up by those going to the referendum.
“ We are in favor of NATO and the EU, but we want to join our heads up, not through the back door, ” said Kavadarkov.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia to become part of the Euro-Asia Integration
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
“I believe the vast majority will be in favor of it, for more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favor of the EU and NATO, ” said Zaev after expressing his voice.
He said that a ‘yes ’ outcome would be ‘confirmation of our future. ’
A survey published last Monday by Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum - less than the required amount.
Another survey, conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful, attendance must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A setback in the referendum will be the first serious setback to the policy of a pro-Western government since the government took over in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero navigates through entire Brighton defense for purpose
Sergio Aguero and Raheim Sterling eliminated the Brighton defense in Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy at his goal in the 65th minute.
At the beginning of the series, the Argentine target header received a call at the center field.
He chased between three Brighton defenders before he struck the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed past one defender before passing several others on the edge of the Brighton goalk.
He then pushed a show to the left, where he found Sterling.
The English forerunner used his first touch in the cage to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to knock the Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a kick up to the right of the net.
‘Aguero is struggling with problems with his feet,' City manager Pep Guardiola told journalists.
“ We talked about playing 55, 60 minutes.
That is what happened.
We're happy that he's signed up for a purpose at that moment \"
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premierliga struggle.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
At that game, Aguero received the ball deep in the Brighton area.
He sent a beautiful ball along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane had some contacts before he led Sterling to the farthest target angle.
The Sky Blues forerunner kicked the ball in the net just before he was over the back.
City Takel Hoffenheim in Kampioeneliga Tuesday at 12:55 pm. by Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to beater play against Rockies
With the Nationals out of play, there's not much reason to force another start.
But the ever-competing Scherzer wants to take the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there are still play implications for the Rockies, which has a one-game advance over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies won at least a pro-motor choice spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals Friday evening, but still want to tie their first division title.
“ Although we play for nothing, we can at least play the game knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team will probably stare at the highest level at any point of me this year.
Why Don’t I Want to Participate?
The Nationals still have to announce their beginning player for Sunday, but it is reportedly beneficial to have Scherzer thrown into such a situation.
Scherzer, who will have started his 34th, had a throw-up session on Thursday, and will play on his normal rest Sunday.
The Washington court judge is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 exhales in 220 2/3 turns this season.
Trump holds conventions in West Virginia
The president referred indirectly to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court choice Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of Republican attendance at the mid - term elections.
“ Everything we did is at stake in November.
Five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
It’s one of the big, big, “I don’t stand, but I actually stand and that’s why I fight for these candidates everywhere, ” he said.
Trump continued,--you see this awful, awful radical group of Democrats, one now sees it happen.
And they are now determined to take back power by using any possible way, one sees the commonality, the genius.
They do not care who hurt them, over whom they should walk to gain power and control, that is what they want, power and strength, we will not give them it'
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to \"stand up and hinder\"
\"And one has seen it over the past four days, \"he has said, and has called the Democrats \"bad and mean and gracious and false.\"
He referred to the name of Senate’s judicial committee’s high - ranking Dianne Feinstein, who received heavy bonds from the audience.
“ Do you remember her answer?
Have you leaked the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, I'm waiting one--it was really weak body language--the weakest body language I've ever seen--
Workers' party is no longer a broad church.
It is intolerant to those who say what they think
When Momentum's activists in my local party voted to put me under censorship, it was not just a surprise.
After all, I am the last person in a string of Workers' Party LPs to whom we have been told that we are not welcome -- all because we have said what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she stood up in fear of anti-Semitism.
In my case, the sensational motion criticized me for differenting from Jeremy Corbyn.
Of the importance of a responsible economic policy, of national security, of Europe, ironically enough similar issues that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Workers Party meeting Friday said that 'we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive'
For most of my eight years as the local Workers’ Party LP, it was exactly what Friday’s AR meetings were.
Sadly, this is not the tone of many meetings today, and the promise of “more friendly, more benevolent, ” politics has long been forgotten, if it ever began.
It has become increasingly evident that different views are not tolerated within the Workers ’ Party, and each opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party’s leadership.
It began shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom I had thought I had previously shared similar political outlooks, began expecting me to make a U-turn and take positions that I would never otherwise have agreed with, whether on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public -- and it doesn't really matter what I say -- there's a tirades of abusive speech on social media that ask me not to be re-elected, disapproval of politics from the core, and telling me that I shouldn't be in the Workers' Party.
And that is not just my experience.
Actually, I am happier than my colleagues because the comments directed at me tend to be political.
I have great respect for professionalism and determination for those colleagues who face a flood of sexist or racist insults every day, but never get away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the levels of insult normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Workers Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church, and with every “motion of distrust, ” or change of selection rules, the party gets closer.
For the past two years, I have had a lot of advice that encourages me to stay under the radar, not to be so outspoken, and that I will then be “oukei. ”
But I did not get into politics to do so.
Since I joined the Workers' Party 32 years ago as a student, encouraged by the Thatcher government's neglect which literally left my high school dropout, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need it the most, whether as a local councillor or government minister.
I never hid my politics, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been somewhat confused about my political positions and areas where I differ from the current leadership.
To those who have advocated the motion on Friday, I can only say that with the country sending on a Brexit that will damage all households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader the Workers Party.
But the one message I actually have is not to Nottingham Momentum, it is to my voters, whether they are members of the Workers' Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of threats from not being re-elected or political advantage will prevent me from doing what I believe in all of you's best interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unconquered Ayr bo
Two late threes may have somewhat shrunk the final outcome, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to prevail in this wonderfully-fortunate Tennent's Premiership contest of the day.
They are now on top of the peak, the only unsurpassed team of the ten.
In the end, it was their excellent defense, as well as their better chance, which carried the home team and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be content.
“ So far we have been tested in our games, and we are still unsurpassed, so I have to be happy, ” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “Honor to Ayr, they took their chances better than we had.
Grant Anderson's three in the 14th minute, which was intended by Frazier Climo, made Ayr before, but a yellow card for Scotland player Rory Hughes, which was made available to the competition by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to count the numbers and Jason Baggot recorded an unintended three.
Climo increased Ayr's lead with a penitentiary, just before he, just before rest time, intended to make it rest time 17-5 for Ayr.
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson’s three, purposed by Baggot, reduced the backlog to five points.
There was a long silence for a serious injury at Ruaridh Knott which was carried on a portable, and from the start Ayr increased the lead with a Stafford McDowall-three, intended by Climo.
Ayr's observing Captain Blair Macpherson then got a yellow card and once again Melrose used the extra player with an unintentional three by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a lot of pressure game.
The home team made a return and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card because he had killed Climo without the ball, and from the line of punishment MacPherson pushed the ball to death after the coming Ayr meal.
Climo intended this, as well as almost doing it from the start, after Kyle Rowe got David Armstrong’s goalhead and flang Gregor Henry sent away for the home team’s fifth three.
Still Game star looks like he's going to take on new career in restaurant business
It seems that Still Game star is moving to the hospitality industry after it has been discovered that he has been designated as the director of a company of licensed restaurants.
The 56-year-old is playing Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC program, which he writes and plays in with old come-up thief Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the next ninth season would be the program’s last, and Kirnan seemed to be preparing for life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor didn't want to comment, although a source at the Scottish Sun had suggested that Kiernan be involved in Glasgow's \"floring restaurant business\".
'The sea is ours': surrounding Bolivia hope court will reopen away to Pacific Ocean
Matrose patrols a masquerade-covered fleet quarters in La Paz.
Public buildings fly a sea blue flag.
Fleet bases from Titicaca Lake to the Amazon are lined with the slogan: “The sea is to right ours.
It's a duty to get it back\"
Throughout the surrounding country Bolivia is the memory of the coastline that they lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century, yet fresh as well as the need to return to the Pacific Ocean.
That hope is probably the highest it was in decades, while Bolivia is waiting for a verdict by the international court on October 1, after 5 years of talks.
\"Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and peacefulness, and obviously expects the outcome with a positive attitude -- said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the IGH speech on large screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will find in favor of Bolivia's claim that, after decades of sporadic negotiations, Chile is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia a sovereign passage to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic native president, who next year faced a controversial struggle for re-election, as well as many who depended on Monday's ruling.
“ We are close to returning to the Pacific, ” he promised in late August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court would decide in Bolivia’s favor - and that little would change if it did.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to assign Chilean territory, and it has suggested that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the IRH's ruling only comes to the last six months shows that the case was \"not complicated\" says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And rather than helping Bolivia’s case, for the past four years, it may have slowed down.
“ The issue of access to the sea was capped by the current Bolivian administration, ” said Zárate.
Morals ’ aggressive rhetoric tapped any remaining Chilean benevolence, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will, at one point, continue conversing, but it will be extremely difficult to carry out afternoon conversations.
The two countries recently exchanged ambassadors in 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision was extremely fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile, and a chance to end 139 years of differences with reciprocal benefits, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, is using the maritime issue as a political cross.
Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific, “he added.
\"The verdict is an opportunity to see what we need to overcome the past\"
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not come unless their US can trust
North Korea's Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, said that his country would never first disarm their nuclear weapons if they could not trust Washington.
Ri was on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He appealed to the United States to fulfill the promises made at a meeting in Singapore between the rival countries' leaders.
His remarks follow US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo apparently on the verge is to restart nuclear diplomacy, which reached a dead end, more than three months after Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's a dream image, that continued sanctions and U.S. capion will also bring the North to its knees to an explanation that the Korean War has ended.
Washington is careful to agree to the declaration without first taking significant steps toward disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second consultation.
But there is widespread skepticism about whether Pyongyang is serious about taking an arsenal away from what the country considers the only way to guarantee their safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump meeting.
Paris fashion shows reveal latest series of large head coverings on their way to the shops near you
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or completely reverse the sun, you don’t have to look further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne introduced a series of slave-sized headgears at their SS19 collection on the walktable that enchanted the style at Paris Modeweek.
This summer Instagram has been extremely impractical, and these designers have prepared their glamorous creations on the shelf.
The flicker by Valentino was an oversized beige hat with a four-legged wide rim that swallowed the models' heads.
Other outstanding additions included water lemons decorated with jewelry, a sorcerer hat, and even a pineapple -- but it's not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also introduced a series of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had elaborated lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation looked like a scuba tower, with a snorkel and a goggle, while another looked like a melted ice horn.
And if you continue the big fashion setting, it is your happy day.
Style viewers predict that the huge hats may be on the way to the shops near you.
The great hats soon follow the heels of 'La Bomba', the straw hat with a two feet wide edge seen on all its heads, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the extremely impractical hat that was spread over social, sent another great creation over the walking plan, a straw beach bag almost as large as the swimwear model that carried it.
The burned orange raffiasak, finished with raffafraids and finished a white leather handle at the top, stood out at Jacquemus' La Riviera's SS19 collection at Paris Modeweek.
Known stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: 'I expect to see large hats and beach bags in stores appear for next summer' since the designer has made such a big impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for great additional ones.'
John Edward: Language skills essential for world citizens
Scotland's independent schools have a ride performance of academic excellence, and it was continued in 2018 with another set of excellent exam results, which has only been reinforced by individual and collective successes in sports, art, music and other community enterprises.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen career, and their position as world citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a custom school curriculum, we see that world languages continue as a popular and desirable choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: \"If you talk to someone in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart'
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s recent exam results, we can see that languages are above the league table with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages achieved a higher grade A.
The data, gathered from SCIS's 74 member schools showed that 72 percent of students achieved a higher grade A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 of those who studied French, and 63 of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young adults will no doubt need in the future.
Languages now, as a choice of subjects, have the same view as STEM vectors (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in independent schools' curricula and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Commission for Professions and Skills found in 2014 that of the reasons that workers provide for their difficulty in filling posts, 17 percent are attributed to a lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future careers.
With more probable job opportunities that require languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Whatever career anyone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future with such a lifelong skill.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically put a multilingual person above the competition.
According to a YouGov recording of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation and were French the only language spoken by a double-sypression, 15 percent.
That is why it is so important to invest in today’s children’s language education.
To know several languages, especially those of developing economies, will equip children with a better chance of getting meaningful work.
In Scotland, each school will differ in the languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while other languages will teach what is considered essential to the UK when looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarins or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, with teaching staff who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare and equip children with the skills needed to succeed, regardless of what the future holds.
It cannot be denied at this stage, in a global business environment, that languages are still vital to the country's future, so they must be reflected in education.
Truly, modern languages really need to be viewed as ‘international communication skills'
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity, and excellence to Scotland’s young people.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will debut Sunday for San Diego Lakers
The guard is almost over for supporters to see LeBron James make his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play in San Diego in Sunday's pre-season opening match against the Denver Nuggets.
But the exact number of minutes he will play remains to be determined.
“ It will be more than one and less than 48, ” said Walton on the Lakers official Web site.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell has argued that James will probably play a limited amount of time.
After an exercise earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six matches in the pre-season program.
“ At this point in my career, I don’t need preseason matches to get ready, ” he said.
Trump's West Virginia convention time, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts a flagship election meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia tonight.
It's Trump's first of five scheduled gatherings in the next week, including stops in friendly places including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote currently being held back for his choice of filling the subject matter in the Supreme Court, Trump intends to build support for the coming interim election because the Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress when the vote is taken in November.
What time is Trump's gathering in West Virginia tonight and how do you look online?
Trump's joint in Wheeling, West Virginia, was scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can check out Trump's concatenation in West Virginia using live streaming below.
Trump will probably pay attention to this week's hearings for the appointed for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who has become tense over accusations of sexual misconduct with an expected confirmation voice held for up to a week while the FBI is investigating.
But the main point of this overmatch is to help the Republicans facing difficult elections in November.
Thus, President Trump’s campaign said that these five gatherings were aimed at visiting “volunteers and supporters in the following week, while Republicans tried to protect and increase the majority they had in the Senate and House of Representatives, according to Reuters.
“Management of Congress is so critical of its agenda that the President will travel to as many states as possible when we reach the busy campaign season,” said a spokesman for the Trump campaign, who refused to call his name, to Reuters.
Tonight's gathering, arranged for the Wesbanco arena in Wheeling, can draw supporters from ‘Ohio and Pennsylvania and can be covered by the media in Pittsburgh,' according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time last month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state he won with over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump tries to help the West Virginia Republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind according to the voting patterns.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to give him a boost to the voting bus,” said Reuters, “and Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Rowerbecker 2018: The team of the U.S. shows that they have courage for the struggle to keep hope alive when entering Sunday’s single game
After three one - sided sessions, the four - game teams of Saturday afternoon may have been just what this Rider cup needed.
The swinging sling of momentum is a generally sophisticated sport concept but one in which players wholeheartedly believe, and certainly in competitions like this.
Where, then, would they say that the momentum is now?
\"They went ahead with six points and now it's four, so we carry it as a bit of momentum, I reckon,\" said Jordan Spieth when he walked away at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage, four points ahead of and another twelve that are played.
The Americans, however, feel, as Spieth says, that they have such a little wind in their sails and that there are many to encourage them, not least the class of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each recorded three points out of four.
Spieth was deadly from the top to the inn, leading by his example.
That score of celebrations became louder as she progressed rounds and he sank a critical set to win match four completely equal while he and Thomas were after two rounds with two behind.
She put hold of what the game won at 15 for them, was greeted with a similar shout, the kind that tells one that he believes the American team still has a chance.
“ You really have to take everything out and worry about your own game, ” Spieth said.
That is all those players have left now.
18 puppies to print their stamp.
The only players who score more than Spieth and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of the Ryderbecker.
Europe’s unmarried but captivating couple got four out of four and could do nothing wrong.
“Moliwood — the only few who did not keep one on track on Saturday afternoon, but they also kept one on track on Saturday morning and on the rear nine Friday mornings on Saturday mornings.
That log, and the way their energy seems to flow to and from this exuberant crowd, confirm that they are the players that have to be knocked on Sunday, and there will be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari who can claim a potential European victory when the sun falls over Le Golf National.
Select both at once or at different puppies.
It is, however, too early to speak of European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short measurements with Sergio Garcia, the four - ball hero of the morning, playing with Alex Noren.
One held track number and two doubles on the front nine, the Spanish and the Swedish landed in a hole from which they could not even almost get.
However, Sunday there is no one to help you out of your hole.
The four-balls and four-game teams are so exciting to watch from close up because of the interaction between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way a strategy can change into an eye-catch.
Europe has always played better as a team so far and on the last day has taken a significant lead, but this four-game session has also shown that the team of the U.S. has the courage for the struggle that some, especially at home, doubted.
Europe runs 10-6 ahead during the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a healthy advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after coming with a 10-6 lead from Saturday's four-ball and four-game games.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two victories over a struggling Tiger Woods to take their score to four points at Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who tried to preserve the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team that performed unevenly in the morning's fourballs, so that they won the 3-1 series.
The U.S. had more resistance in the four - game games and won two contests, but they did not shrink the back.
Jim Furiek’s team needed eight points from Sunday’s 12 single - game games to preserve the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, who are called \"Moliwood\" after a sensational weekend, are only the second few in the history of the Ryderbecker who signed four points after their first four games.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed into the four-balls, they played excellently together to conquer a Pap Woods and American newcomer Bryson Dechambreau with an even more convincing 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, sometimes showed flashes of brilliance but he now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourballs and four-games and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning's four-balls, came back to play with Henrik Stenson in the four-games to a 2&1 defeat for Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka--which are first and third on the world ranking.
Europe, however, on a pleasant day with a wind of southwest Paris, did not always get their way.
Jordan Spieth who won three times a big tournament and Justin Thomas put the mark on the Americans on Saturday with two points.
They recorded a difficult 2&1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls and later returned to knock Poulter and Rory McIlroy into the four-games with 3&4 after losing the first two puppies.
Just twice in the history of the Ryder cup, a team recovered from a four-point backs when they entered the single game, although Furiek's team only had to play equal to keep the trophy because they already liked it.
Having been second best for two days, however, it doesn't seem that they are going to do a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says they will 'not be' unilaterally disarmed without confidence.
On Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister said to the United Nations that continued sanctions would aggravate their distrust of the United States and that the country would certainly not give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally without such traits.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that in the past year, North Korea has taken significant measures of goodwill, such as stopping nuclear and missile testing, breaking down the nuclear testing ground, and promising not to increase nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“ However, we see no corresponding response from the U.S.A., ” he said.
“Without any confidence in the U.S., there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances we will certainly not disarm ourselves unilaterally first ”
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phased” approach to the removal of nuclear weapons that would reward North Korea if it took gradual steps, his words seemed significant by not rejecting unilateral removal of nuclear weapons unconditionally as Pjonjung had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong-Oen and Donald Trump at the very first summit between a president of the U.S. and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore when Kim took to work for the \"destruction of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula\" while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea wants a formal end to the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pjongang must first give up his nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted requests for severe international sanctions against North Korea.
“The U.S. insisted on the ‘destruction of nuclear weapons first’ and exerted more pressure by tightening the level of sanctions to achieve their goal in a compelling way, and even objecting to the ‘explanation of the end of the war,’ said Ri.
“The perception that sanctions can force us on our knees is a dream of the people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions make our distrust worse,
Ri didn't say anything about plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump on which the U.S. leader mentioned earlier in the week at the United Nations.
Rather, the minister called attention to three meetings during the past five months between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in and added: “If the party in this issue on nuclear weapons destruction was South Korea and not the U.S., the destruction of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a dead end...
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korea's rockets would be directed to the US land mass after \"Mr. Bose President\" Trump called Kim a \"fire pilot\" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who had threatened to destroy North Korea all the time last year, commended Kim for his courage for taking steps to disarm, but he said that much work still needs to be done and that sanctions still have to remain there until North Korea destroys nuclear weapons.
Wednesday Trump said he didn't have a timetable for this, and said, \"It doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years, or five months.\"
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pjongyang for the steps they have taken.
However, U.S. foreign minister, Mike Pompeo, told the UN Security Council on Thursday: “Adaptation of sanctions by the Security Council must continue zealously and without letup until we realize the full, final, confirmed destruction of nuclear weapons —
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously intensified sanctions against North Korea in an attempt to dry up funding for Pjongyang's nuclear and ballistic emission programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the outskirts of the UN General Assembly and then said that he would visit Pjongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo had visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip there did not go well.
He left Pjongyang in July and said that progress had been made, but North Korea accused him only hours later of setting \"bendful demands\".
North Korea has promised a meeting with Moon to break down a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States adopts \"concordant measures\".
He said that Kim had told him that the “consisting measures ” he wanted to see are security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore and steps toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students follow a course on sufficient rest
A new course at Harvard University this year will make all its pre-graduate students get more sleep in an effort to combat the growing macho culture of studying by caffeine driven 'whole-day sessions'.
An academic has found that students at the world's top university are often ignorant of the basic principles of how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical Faculty and a specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the U.S..
He was inspired to start the course after he gave a talk about the effect of sleep withdrawal on learning.
'At the end, one girl approached me and said, 'Why do they tell me this now, in my senior year?'
She said that no one had told her how important sleep is--which surprised me,' he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was presented this year for the first time, explains to students the basic principles of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as how it improves their overall well - being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical Faculty and executive director of the university’s health services, said that the university decided to take the course after it was found that students were seriously deprived of sleep during the week.
The hourly course involves some interactive tasks.
In one section, there is a picture of a dormitory, where students have to click on coffee cups, curtains, practice shoes and books to be told about the effect of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is influenced by lack of sleep and the importance of a sleep time routine.
In another department participants are told how long-term sleep withdrawal can increase risks of heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
'We know it won't change students' behavior immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know--just as you have the right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes,' Prof Czeisler added.
The culture of pride to 'study all day' still exists, he said, and added that modern technology and increasing pressure on students meant that sleep withdrawal is a growing problem.
To make sure that you get enough sleep of good quality, a student's 'secret weapon' should be to avoid stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, he said--even to avoid putting on weight, because sleep loss puts the brain in a hunger mode, which makes you feel hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californiar studying chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after he walked one of his classes last year, during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to work for a campus-wide course.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the institution where people compete.
Prof Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm for when they are going to sleep, as well as when to wake up, and being aware of the harmful effects of 'blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can disrupt your circadian rhythm and cause you to struggle to touch the sheep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Target of Menga conquers Gerrard’s men
Rangers experienced another sarcy of day-old heartache when Dolly Menga's goalhead Steven Gerrard's inhospitable team brought down a 1-0 downpour.
The Ibrox team wanted to win their first as visitors since February's 4-1-seges at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team handed over to Gerrard only his second defeat in 18 games as a driver so that his team was eight points behind Hearts, who had run off loose in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga struck seven minutes before rest time, and it didn't seem like a Ranger team would play without much inspiration.
As Rangers fall to the sixth position, Livingston climbs to the third and is only on target behind Hibernian.
And there could be further trouble for Rangers after border judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after an object was apparently thrown off the wayside.
Gerrand made eight changes to the team that had rushed past Ayr to the final battle of the Betfred cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same Livi-11 that had taken a point of Hearts last week and he would have been in his noppies with the way his well-trained team smothered their opponents at every turn.
Rangers may have dominated ball ownership, but Livingston did more when they had the ball.
They should actually have recorded points after just two minutes when Menga’s first deposit Scott Pittman passed on to Allan McGregor’s goal, but the middle - field player opened his big chance.
A deep freshman by Keaghan Jacobs subsequently found Captain Craig Halkett but his defense mate Alan Lithgow could just kick off at the rear goal.
Rangers took control, but there seemed to be more hope than conviction about their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos felt that he should have received a penalty goal at the quarter point when he and Steven Lawless clashed, but divorce judge Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's requests.
Rangers managed to get only two shots to the target during the first half, but the former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly bothered by Lassana Coulibaly's headshot and a mace goalhead of Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi’s opener at the 34th minute may have been in the direction of play, no one can deny that they earned it, even though it is only for their hard work.
Rangers again did not handle a deep set of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained cool head and sent it to Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard acted at the break when he traded Coulibay for Ryan Kent and the exchange had an almost immediate impact when the wing sent to Morelos but the impressive Kelly from his strip to the block.
Livingston, however, continued to force the visitors to play just the kind of game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett palling long ball after long ball.
Holt’s team could have increased their lead in the last stages, but McGregor got up well to stop Jacobs before Lithgow could come in far from the corner point.
Rangers' alternate Glenn Middleton had another late demand for a criminal head when he broke up with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geigerteller
And now a page from our Sunday morning almanac: 30 September 1882, today 136 years ago, and OUR TEL VERSER ... the day on which the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm'Hans' Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called the Geigerteller.
Since then, the Geigerteller has been a supporter of science, and it has also become a supporter of pop culture, as in the 1950 film \"Bells of Coronado,\" in which those two unlikely cowboy scholars Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played:
Man: “What is on earth is this...
Rogers: “It’s a Geigerteller used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you pick up these earphones, you can even hear the effect of the atoms that are released into the minerals by the radioactivity.
Evans: “Good, it’s cracking about now.
‘Hans' Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention bearing his name continues.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to 'see' predators
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to 'see' and kill predators
Deficiency learns immune system to identify predator cells as part of treatment
Method involves withdrawal of immune cells from a patient, change of them in a laboratory
They can then see a protein that is common to many cancers and then inject it again.
A test substance shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
One woman who was treated with the vaccine, learning the immune system to identify predator cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves withdrawal of immune cells from a patient, changing it in the laboratory so that they can see a protein that is found in many cancers and called HER2 and then inject the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzovsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.\"
HER2' stimulates the growth of several types of cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to removing immune cells from patients and teaching them how to attack cancer cells has worked to beat a kind of leukemia.
Kanye West began a pro-Trump mockery after his action on SNL, while he wore a MAGA hat.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was issued during a Saturday night live in the studio after a prolonged action in which he believed the US president Donald Trump and said he would vote for him in 2020.
After singing his third song of the evening, which is called Ghost Town and during which he wore a Make America Great-pet, he sailed out against the Democrats and repeated his support of Trump.
“I’m talking to a white person so often, and they say: “How can you like Trump, he’s a racist.”
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have moved from America long ago, “he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star had mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's judicial committee on accusations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even if it was not broadcast, the image material of West’s scramble was loaded on social media by the comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock tried to ridicule West by putting it.
West also complained to the audience that what he had carried on his head was making it difficult for him behind the platform.
“ They bullied me behind the platform.
They said, 'Do not go out with that hat up.'
They bullied me!
And then they say I'm in a low place,' he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Will you see the low place, and said that he would put on his “superman coat, because it means that you cannot tell me what to do.
Try to “love ”
His comment at least twice provoked an audience publication and members of the SNL roll division seemed embarrassed, reported Variety, with one person there who said to the publication: “The whole studio has become silent.
West was brought in as a late substitute for the singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, the rhyme clerk Mac Miller died a few days earlier.
West was very surprised by the performance of the song I Love it, dressed like a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the head of conservation group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one of the bravest spirits: DANKIE THAT YOU LEARNING TO THE SCREEN,
But chattering program guestwoman Karen Hunter has rumoured that West was simply \"who he is and it's absolutely wonderful\"
“But I chose to reward someone NOT (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his art) which I believe to accept and proclaim an ideology that endangers my society.
He's free.
We, too, “she added.
Before the show, the rhyme dresser announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said that he was now “the creature formerly known as Kanye West. ”
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
Mede-rymkletzer, Snoop Dogg, had the name Snoop Lion and of course the late musical legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist who had formerly been known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington criticizes toxic manhood
Kit Harington is known for his raging role as Jon Snow in HBO’s violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, criticized the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they should be tough to be respected.
Kit spoke to The Sunday Times Culture and said he believed 'something went wrong' and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo-era.
Kit, who recently married his fellow from Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he felt 'reasonably strong' about working on this issue.
'I personally feel quite strong about it at the moment--where did we go wrong with masculinity?' he said.
'What did our husbands learn while they grew up with regard to the problem we now see?'
Kit believes that television may well be responsible for the growth of toxic manhood because of its very male characters.
He continued: “What is born and what has been taught?
What is taught on TV and in the streets that makes young boys feel that they should have this certain aspect of being a man?
I think it really is one of the big questions in our time - how do we change it?
Because something evidently went wrong with our young men.'
in the interview, he also acknowledged that he would not participate in any of the Game of Thrones preoccupations when the series next summer came to an end, for he said he was 'clear with battlefields and horses'.
As of November, Kit will play in a new version of Sam Shephard's True West, which is the story of a filmmaker and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he thought that the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones was to meet his wife, Rose.
'I met my wife on this program, so that way it gave me my future family, and my life from here on,' he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-rounded fantasy series.
The couple married on the site of Leslie’s family estate in Scotland in June 2018.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced that there is a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country are affected, health officials.
Some 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted through sex, representing a change in the past.
Traditionally, HIV is rapidly spreading through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who acquired HIV in this way was reduced to almost zero, said Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, the number of people living in China with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000.
HIV transmission by sex is a critical case in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still very common.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the diseases come from insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, China's government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an attempt to work on the matter.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member has leaked GOP senators' data, condemning 'dangerous lies' and 'consumption theories'
US Republican Maxine Waters sailed out on Saturday against allegations that a member of her staff placed the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the legislators' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the charges were driven by ultrarights, experts, and Web sites.
“Faith, lies, and yet detestable lies,” said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The selected information is said to have included the home address and phone numbers for U.S. Sens. Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, placed by an unknown person on the Capitol Hill during the Senate Panel's trial of the claims of sexual misconduct against the appointed person for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identified the source of the sites was related to Waters' office and disclosed the information of a member of Waters' staff, reported the Hill.
“This unfounded claim is completely untrue and an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“ The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information, and security were put in jeopardy as a result of this deceptive and false claim, was by no means responsible for licking out this information.
This unfounded claim is completely untrue and an absolute lie \"
Waters ’ statement quickly provoked criticism online, including former White House press representative Ari Fleischer.
“ This denial bears witness to anger, ” wrote Fleischer.
“It indicates that she does not have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he has not done, do not be angry.
He should not be challenging.
He should not question the motives of the prosecutor.
He has to be calm and calm.
Fleischer apparently compared Waters ’ reaction to the Democrats ’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of seeming to be angry during Thursday’s trial.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who tried to light up Waters in the intermediate choice from the pillows, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“ Great if that is true, ” he said, “he was intoxicating.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had “notified the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies of these deceptive claims.
“We’ll make sure that the managers are exposed, ” she continued, “and that they will be legally accountable for everything they do that is destructive and dangerous for every member of my staff“
Johnny English Strikes Again Review - Flou Rowan Atkinson spy spottery
It's traditional now to look for Brexit meaning in any new film with a British impact and it seems applicable to this revival of Johnny English action comedic the mock-franchise - which then started with Johnny English in 2003 and continued to struggle with Johnny English Reborn in 2011.
Will tongue-in-the-cheeks be self-evident on the subject of how obvious power we are the nation's new executive entity?
In any event, the unresolved Johnny English with his outpourings and rubber face had his license to waste everything for the second time--and his name is a clearer indication than anything else that he is a great comic creation for non-English-speaking movie listeners.
He is, of course, the mocked secret agent who, despite his bizarre pretension to sophisticated elegance, a bit of Clouseau, a piece of Mr. Bean and a good shot of that old man who contributed a single note to the Chariots of Fire theme song at the open-mindedness of the London Olympic Games in 2012.
He was also originally based on the traveler and international man of puzzles, who left chaos behind him, who played Atkinson at once in the now forgotten Barclaycard ads.
There are one or two cute moments in this latest version of JE.
I liked Johnny English who came up to a helicopter while he was dressed in a medieval armored cloth and the screwdrivers cut short against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is shown but the humor feels rather faint and peculiarly unnecessary, especially when the \"serious\" movie brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible now use their own comedy with confidence as an ingredient.
The humor feels that it is aimed at children rather than adults, and for me Johnny English’s adversity is not as original and focused as Atkinson’s silent jokes in the persona of Bean.
The eternal thematic assumption now is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber cracker had infiltrated Britain's supersecret network of spies and revealed the identity of all Britain's agents in the field, to the dismay of the agent on duty--a regrettable little roll for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last straw for a prime minister who's a puffed-up and besieged character, who's already experiencing a total collapse of political unwillingness: Emma Thomspson does her utmost with this quasi-Teresa May character but there's little in the text to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that since every active spy was put in danger, she should call someone out of his retirement.
And this means the struggling Johnny English himself, now serving as a teacher at some awesome institution, but giving lessons from the record on how to be a secret agent, there are some fun jokes here when English offers a School of Rock-type spy school.
English is called back to Whitehall for an emergency order and is reunited with his former longtime companion Bough, again interpreted by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, married to a submarine commander, an allamapstic role in which too little of Vicki Pepperdine is expected.
Thus the Batman and Robin are all completely wasted in Her Majesty’s secret service and come down to Olga Kurylenko’s beautiful women fatal Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister ends up under the dangerous spell of the charismatic technology billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems: the mysterious Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey of ridiculous escapades: disguised as waiters they set fire to a French restaurant, causing them chaos when they smuggle themselves on board Volta's luxury sailing; and English releases pure anarchy when he tries to use a headpiece for virtual reality to become familiar with the inside of Volta's house.
For that last scene nothing is spared, but as cute and exuberant as it may be, the whole affair is quite much like children's TV.
Fairly mediocre.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't stop thinking: can't the British give Rowan Atkinson a role that really makes his talent come to his right?
Labour denies that it is a plan for British to work a four-day week but be paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Workers party must consider a drastic plan that will cause British people to work a four-day week--but be paid for five days.
The party is said to have claimed that company-based savings caused by the artificial intelligence (KI) revolution must be transferred to workers by giving them extra day off.
It will make workers enjoy a three-day weekend--but they will still take the same payment home.
Sources say that it will 'pass' at the party's economic agenda and plans to put the country in favor of the workers.
To change after a four-day week was signed by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior working party source said to The Sunday Times: 'An policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'It won't happen overnight, but a four-day work week is an ambition that fits the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favor of the worker as well as the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Workers Party will not be the first to endorse such an idea, with the Green Party promising a four-day work week during its campaign for the general election in 2017.
The ambition, however, is not being endorsed by the entire Workers ’ Party.
A spokesman of the Workers' Party said, 'A four-day work week is not party policy and is not considered by the party.'
Shadu Minister John McDonnell used last week's Workers' Conference to elaborate on his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from 'visible directors' and 'profit-makers' from service companies.
The shadow minister's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not recover their entire investment as a labor government may make withdrawals on the basis of alleged wrongdoing.
He also confirmed plans to place workers on directs from companies and create inclusive ownership funds to give employees 10 percent of equity in private sector enterprises, which can receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tells “60 Minutes ” whether the FBI’s investigation of Kavanaugh can change their opinion
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh had a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court with at least a week delayed and raised the question of whether the bureau's findings could convince any Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republicans John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could understand anything they could change their opinion.
Kennedy seemed more receptive than his colleague from South Carolina.
“ I mean, of course, ” said Kennedy.
“ I said at the beginning of the trial, I said, I was talking to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it had happened, that accusation came out, and said, 'Did you do it?
He was determined, certainly, indisputable.
Graham’s voice, however, appears to be unchangeable.
“I formed my opinion of Brett Kavanaugh and it would require an accusation of dinamite,” he said.
“ Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett zealously denied it, ” continued Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“ And everyone she mentioned could not confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see anything new changing »
What is the World Citizenship Festival, and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday New York will be the host of the World Civil Festival, an annual musical event that has a particularly impressive group of stars that act and have an equally impressive purpose; the end of poverty in the world.
The World Citizenship Festival is now in its seventh year and during the festival tens of thousands of people will flock to Central Park’s Great Lawn to enjoy not only actions by Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes but also to create awareness of the real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizenship Festival, which began in 2012, is an expansion of the World Poverty Project, an international inter-agreement that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you are willing to pay for a GDP card), concert participants had to perform a series of tasks, or actions, such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or any other meaningful way to raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But just how successful was World Citizens with 12 years remaining to achieve their goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert, a good way of convincing people to demand a call to action, or is it just another case of so-called \"Kliktivisime\"--people who feel they make a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, World Citizens have said that it has recorded over 19 million actions from its supporters, supporting a multitude of different goals.
It says that these actions have helped to encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to over $37 billion that will potentially affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group reported 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its actions, at least $10 billion of which have already been paid out or collected.
The group estimates that the confirmed money so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the most important commitments include the Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers committed to helping children reach their full potential, and promised to provide $35 million for Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after obtaining more than 4,700 tweets from World Citizens.
“With the support of the government of the UK, donors, national governments, and World Citizens just like you, we can let the social injustice of malnutrition become a footnote in history,” said the Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman in April 2018 during a London concert to the crowd.
The group also said that, after more than 5,000 actions that were taken to approach the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which would reach 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the common questions at his Web site, which prompts you to think that our extreme poverty can end
World Citizen replied: “This will be a long and hard road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements in front of us, we will be successful, because together we have more power.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists who act in New York on this year's occasion, which will be offered by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. can use fleet for “blocking ” exports of Russian energy - minister of domestic affairs
“If necessary, ” Washington could leave on his fleet to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of State Ryan Zinke, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed Russia's involvement in Syria - especially where it works at the invitation of the statutory government - is a pretext to investigate new energy markets.
\"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to act as brokers for energy just as in Eastern Europe, southern Europe, he said, \".
And, according to an officer, there are ways and means to tackle them.
“ The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that the sea is open, and if necessary, to block, to make sure their energy does not end up in the market, ” he said.
Zinke addressed the attendees of an opportunity offered by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group without profit that they consider to be the \"vote of the energy consumer\" in the U.S.
He went on to compare Washington’s approaches to the handling of Russia and Iran, and he noticed that this was practically the same.
“The economic option on Iran and Russia is, more or less, to finance and replace fuel,” he said while referring to Russia as a single talent, with an economy dependent on fossil fuel.
The speeches came because Trump administration was on a mission to boost the export of their liquid natural gas to Europe to replace Russia, by far the cheaper option for European consumers.
For that reason, the Trump administration's officials, including America's president Donald Trump himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the 'unpaste' North Stream 2-pipeline project, which, according to Trump Berlin Moscow's 'captains'.
Moscow repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion North Stream 2-pipeline, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fiery opposition to the project is merely driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means of performing pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers,” said Russian Minister of Energy, Aleksandr Novak, after a meeting with America’s Secretary of Energy, Rick Perry, in Moscow in September.
The U.S. view called for counterreaction from Germany, which reaffirmed their commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), relied on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will consider it “seriously ” to stand as president in 2020, said Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts’s senator, Elizabeth Warren, said on Saturday she would consider \"seriously\" standing as president after the mid-term elections.
At a town meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider standing.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and correct our broken government, and this includes a woman on the highest sport,” she said, according to The Hill.
“After 6 November, I’ll seriously consider standing up for President’s
Warren voiced her opinion about President Donald Trump during the town meeting and said that he “takes the country in the wrong direction.
“ I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy, ” she said.
Warren was very outspoken in her criticism of Trump and his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court.
In a second Friday, Warren said, \"Of course, we need an FBI investigation before we vote.\"
A record released Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own voters did not think she should stand in 2020.
Eight-and-fifty percent of \"probable\" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not stand, according to Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe survey.
Thirty-two percent supported the idea that she should stand.
The survey showed more support for the idea that former governor Deval Patrick had to stand, with 38 percent supporting the idea that he had to stand potentially and 48 against it.
Other high-profile democratic names discussed to possibly stand in 2020 include former vice president Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, reported the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions Track Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump meeting
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after he joined in September
He was arrested on Monday night and charged with an incident of domestic violence.
\"What my own son is going through, what he has been going through since he came back, I have sympathy with other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and the injury with which our soldiers return, \" she told an audience at a convention for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest 'the elephant in the room' and said of her son and other war veterans, 'they come back a little differently, they come back loud, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what they and their fellow soldiers and air forcemen and every other member of the army gave to the country'
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence, assault of a woman, interference with a complaint of domestic violence and possession of a firearm while under the influence, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Station.
18 states, D.C. supports challenge of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge of a new US policy that rejects asylum to victims fleeing from gang or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the district filed a friend-of-the-court court order Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker and challenge policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the claimant in the Grace v. Sessions contest filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy was not made public.
She says that her mate — and his violent gang members ’ sons — had abused her, but U.S. officials refused her request for asylum on July 20.
She was kept in Texas.
The state attorneys supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which produced a large number of applicants for U.S. asylum, as nations that face profound problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. ailing policy in 2014 reversed a decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals (Council of Immigrant Appeals) which allowed immigrants to apply for asylum without the necessary documents that fled from domestic violence.
District Columbia's Attorney General Karl Racine said on Friday in a statement that the new policy \"decades' state, federal and international laws ignore\"
'Federal laws require that all asylum applications be settled on the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such advocacy violates that policy,' said the friend of the court court's court.
Attorneys have further argued in the legal order that the policy that immigrants refuse access to is damaging the US economy and say it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and will provide needed labour —
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to stop allowing asylum to victims fleeing from domestic and gang violence.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership to a specific social group or political opinion,” said Sessions in his announcement of the policy on June 11.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all problems — even all serious problems — that are facing people around the world every day.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu while death toll doubles in race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is growing.
“It feels very tense,” said 35-year-old Mother Risa Kusuma as she comforted her feverish baby son at a evacuation center in the ravaged city of Palu.
“Every minute brings an ambulance body.
Clean water is scarce
Residents have been seen returning to their devastated homes, searching for elaborate possessions, trying to save anything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5-range shaking were overwhelmed.
Of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who had contracted a broken back and shoulder, rest outside Palu's military hospital where patients are treated outside because of constant strong aftershocks.
Tears fill his eyes as he tells of the violent earthquake that shook the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
“ There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pressed into the walls' ruins, I thought, \"Haris told Associated Press and added that he and his family were in town for a wedding.
“ I heard my wife call for help but then quiet down.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe.
U.S. ambassador accuses China of 'knuttering' with 'propaganda advertisement'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in an American daily that praised the mutual benefits of U.S. China trade, the U.S. ambassador accused China Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to the China Daily's paid insert in the Des Moines Register -- the state of Iowa's newspaper with the most sales -- after he accused China of having interfered with the U.S. Congress elections of November 6, a complaint that China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. elections marked what U.S. officials had said to Reuters is a new phase in an increasing campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington were now caught in an escalating trade war that led to their tariff rounds on each other's imports.
China’s retaliation rates early in the trade war aimed to beat exporters in states such as Iowa that supported Trump’s Republican Party, said Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former governor of Iowa for a long time, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing hurt American workers, farmers, and businesses.
China, wrote Branstad in an opinion in Sunday's Des Moines Register, \"is now exaggerating the bullying by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press\"
“By spreading their propaganda, the Chinese government seized America’s cherished tradition of free speech and a free press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, at the newspaper kiosk in the street here in Beijing, one will find very limited disparaging voices and not see any real reflection of the differing opinions the Chinese people have about China’s worrying economic trap, given that media is under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that “one of China’s most prominent newspapers had shrunk away from the offer to publish his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans alienate women's selectors before intermediates with Kavanaugh debacle, warns analysts
While many top Republicans were standing at High Court-dominated Brett Kavanaugh and defending him in the face of various claims of sexual assault, analysts warned that during the coming intercessions they would see counter-reaction, especially of women.
The emotions are so high, and most Republicans are on record that they already indicate that they want to continue with the vote.
Those things cannot be reversed,' said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School to The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted whether Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s incentive for an FBI investigation on the narrow enough to appease fierce voters.
“Women are not going to forget what happened last night; they are not going to forget it tomorrow and not in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior consultant and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
Friday morning, protesters — November was on their way — thundering as they argued in the entrance portal of the Senate while the Republicans who controlled the Judicial Committee continued their appointment in spite of the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
“ Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to be very high,” said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, to the newsyard.
“ People say it was already high; it’s true.
But it can be higher, especially among swinging voice-female voters in suburbs and younger voters, 18- to 29-year-olds, who don't often vote because they don't like the president's \"
Even before Ford's public testimony explaining the details of her charges of sexual assault against the Supreme Court-dominated, analysts said that a counter-reaction could follow if Republicans continued with the confirmation.
“It became a mess for the GOP,” said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not about the committee’s vote or the final vote and whether Kavanaugh is put on the court, it’s also about the way the Republicans handled it and how they treated her,” said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helped to favor Democrats, pointing out to the news channel.
However, Americans seem slightly divided about who believes in Ford and Kavanaugh’s testimony, with slightly more to the latter’s side.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents certainly believe Ford's testimony, while 35 say they certainly believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought Kavanaugh was likely or definitively jogging during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
According to Flake’s suggestion, the FBI is currently investigating the charges made by Ford, as well as at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford, under oath last week before the Senate's Judicial Committee, testified that Kavanaugh had assaulted her at the age of 17 while he was drunk.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court-renominated his genitals revealed to her while they attended a party during their student years at Yale in the 1980's.
The inventor of the global web plans to start a new Internet to attack Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the global web, is leading an initial endeavor to compete with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The technology legend's latest project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee's open source platform, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and what people are allowed to access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee mocked that the idea of Inrupt world domination was.
“ We should do this now, ” he said about the project.
\"It's a historic moment.\"
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own personal online data storage or a POD.
It can include contact lists, job lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available at the same time and on one browser.
What is unique about the personal online data storage is that it relies entirely on the user who can access that type of information.
The company calls it “personal authentication by data”
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company’s HUB John Bruce, is for the company to bring resources, processes, and applicable skills to help make Solid available to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, developers on the personnel contracted to work on the project and a community of volunteer coders.
From this week on, technology developers from around the world can create their own decentralized applications by using the tools available on the Inrupt Web site.
Berners-Lee says he and his team are not talking to \"Facebook and Google about the presentation of a complete change whether or not, where all their business models are completely reversed overnight.
“ We don’t ask their permission, ” he says.
In a placement on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy as well as an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid's \"
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the Global Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has had an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even while he is intrusive, Berners-Lee will still remain the founder and director of the Worldwide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m very optimistic about this next era of the web,” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: WW1 Victoria Cross Spiritual Celebration
The only clergyman of the Church of England who won the Victoria Cross as a fighter during World War I was honored 100 years later in his hometown.
Lt.kol honor Bernard Vann won the award on September 29, 1918, in the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed four days later by a sharp shooter and never knew he had won the highest British military honor.
A memorial stone was revealed by his two grandsons on Saturday at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was “brilliant symbols ” that the stone is revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s award -winning achievement.
According to the London Gazette, Lt. Kol. Vann, on September 29, 1918, led his battalion across the Channel de Saint-Quentin, through many thick fog and under heavy fire from the field and machine guns,
He later rushed to the line of fire and led the line forward with the greatest bravery before he stormed a man alone and knocked out three of the department.
Lt.kol Vann was killed by a German sharpener on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather’s action is “something I know I can never do well, but something that is humiliating.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a cliff after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestras.
Michael Vann said he felt honored to be able to play a role in the parade, and added that \"the courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the support given by a crowd of people\"
MMA supporters stay awake all night to watch Bellator 206, but get Peppa Pig
Imagine, you stay awake all night watching the follow - up Bellator 206, just not being able to watch the main event.
The program of San Jose contained 13 battles, including six on the main program to be broadcast directly by night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gear Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were on their way to charge each other, viewers in the UK were stunned when the cover changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were unimpressed after staying awake especially for the fighting until the early hours.
One supporter on Twitter described the switch to the children's cartoon as \"one or other sick joke\"
“It is government regulation that the content was not suitable at 6 p.m. and therefore they had to switch to children’s programs,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator senior vice president of marketing and communications when asked about the broadcast.
‘ ‘Peppa the Pig, ’ yes,
Bellator's company president Scott Coker said they'll work on their scheduling to include UK viewers in the future.
“ I think that when I think of the remission, I think we can probably work out something, ” said Coker.
“But it’s six o’clock in the morning on Sunday there and we won’t be able to sort it out until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we work on it.
Believe me, when it switched over, there were many text messages sent back and forth and it wasn't all friendly.
We tried to correct it, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I can promise you that it will not happen next time.
We will limit it to five battles instead of six, as we normally do, and we have tried to offer more to our supporters and just about our time.
It's an unhappy situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley has a sense of inferiority about sexuality
Olympic divers Tom Daley says he grew up with a feeling of inferiority about his sexuality -- but it gave him the motivation to be a success.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize before he went to high school \"not everyone like me\"
When he spoke on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs offered by Lauren Laverne, he said he had voiced his feelings about gay rights to give others' hope.
He also said that to become a parent, he cared less about winning the Olympics.
The regular provider of the years-long program, Kirsty Young, took off for a few months because of illness.
When he appeared as a repugnant on Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt \"less than everyone else when he grew up, because \"it was not socially acceptable to love boys and girls\"
He said: “To this day, those feelings are less than, and feel differently, the real things that gave me the strength and energy to succeed,
He wanted to prove that he was “something, ” he said, so that no one would be disappointed when they finally learned about his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze medal winner became a high-profile LGBT fighter and used its appearance at this year's State Alliance games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He says that he has voiced his feelings because he is so happy to be able to live openly without consequences and wants to give others “hope. ”
The three-time world champion said that to fall in love with a man -- US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 -- -- caught him aside --
Daley was married last year to the Oscar winner, who was 20 years older than he was, but said the age difference had never been a matter.
\"When you went through so much at such a young age -- he went to his first Olympic Games at 14 years of age, and his father died of cancer three years later -- he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar highs and lows.
The couple became parents in June of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his \"whole perspective\" changed.
\"If you asked me last year, all was about 'I must win a gold medal',' he said.
“ But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie's
His son had the same name as his father Robert who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley says his father did not accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was whether they had tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to be in the front row.
\"I couldn't tell him 'you won't be here to be in the front row, Dad',' he said.
“ I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it was only after he stopped breathing and died that I finally admitted that he was not invincible, ” he said.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
“I just knew that it was what I dreamed of for my life, ” he said, “to dive in front of me at an Olympic Games, there was no better feeling.
It also inspired its first songbook, Proud by Heather Small, which also resecrated with him in building up to the Olympic Games and still gives him chicken meat.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson doesn't drive and withdraw from Saturday's Ryderbecker
American Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder cup game, but he will have to make his shape to prevent it from being an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played for a record- 12th time in the two-year event, was withdrawn from the game by Captain Jim Furijk for Saturday's four-ball games and four-valves.
Instead of being the center of the action, as he has often been for the United States, the five-time Major winner will divide his day in the meantime to be racial leader and work on the exercise bob at his game in hopes of correcting what scales.
Even at the height of his career he was never the straightest driver and therefore the 48-year-old is not the ideal person for the narrow Le Golf National track where the long rudder always punishes the wandering blows.
And as if the track on its own is not challenging enough, Mickelson came to stand in his ninth match against the accurate British Ope champion Francesco Molinari, who teamed up with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the four - points - behind Americans start the 12 single - game games well, Mickelson’s contest can be absolutely essential.
Fury expressed his confidence in his husband, not that he could say much differently.
“He fully understood his role today, gave me a knock on the back, and put his arm around me, and said he will be right tomorrow,” said Furiek.
“ He has great confidence in himself.
He is in the Heroes Hall and has contributed so much to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably did not think that he would play two games.
I had more in mind, but that is how things worked out and that’s what we thought we should do.
He wants to be there on the job, just like anyone else's.
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo’s record for the player who played most Ryderbecker matches on Sunday.
This may mark the end of a Rider's career that has never really corresponded to the highlights of its individual achievements.
Mickelson had 18 wins, 20 defeats, and seven halfs, although Furiek said that his presence contributed to the team’s unscrupulous aspects.
“He’s funny, he’s sarcastic, he likes to shave the crazy, and he’s a wonderful guy to have in the team room,” he explained.
“ I think the younger players also enjoyed shaving with him crazy, which was fun to see.
He offers as much more than just game-
Europe Captain Thomas Bjorn knows great advance can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a considerable advance before the last day's single game in the Ryderbecker can easily turn into an uncomfortable experience.
The Danish made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where the team under the direction of Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead, but only nail-crap won with 141⁄2-131⁄2.
\"You keep reminding yourself that we had a great advance at Valderrama; we had a great advance at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won nails, \"Bjorn said, in the photograph, after he looked at how the 2018 Class won 5-3 Friday, and yesterday 10-6 ahead at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone on the team that it is not over.
You're going to be full tomorrow.
Go out and do all the right things.
It is not over until you have the points on the board.
We have a purpose, and it is to try to win the trophy, and it is where the focus remains.
I’m still saying, I’m focusing on the 12 players in our team, but we’re also well aware of who stands on the other side, the best players in the world.
Rejoicing at how his players were at risk in the difficult golf course, Bjorn adds: “I will never go ahead with this.
Tomorrow is a horse of a different colour.
Tomorrow it is the individual participation that comes in turn, and it is a horse of a different color.
It's wonderful to be out there with a mate when things go well, but when you're individually there, you're tested to your full capacity as a golfer.
This is the message you need to convey to players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your mate behind, and he also needs to get the best out of himself.'
In contrast to Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furiek would want his players to do better individually than they did as gamemates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who got three points out of four.
Furiek himself had been around on both sides of that great last-day, where he was part of the wishpan at Brookline before he finished as a loser when Europe achieved the \"wonderwork of Medinah\".
“ I remember every hidden word, ” he said in reply when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, spoke up on his way to that last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but one would like to start well, as seen at Brookline, as seen at Medinah.
When that momentum starts in one direction, it puts a lot of stress on those middle games.
We set up our team by that, and divided the men we felt, you know, for us tomorrow will bring something powerful \"
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the counterattack and competed against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter, who are the other Europeans in the upper half of the division.
“ I chose this group of guys in this order, because I think it covers it to the end, ” Bjorn said about his single - game options.
Germany’s New Warship Resented
The German army's latest frigate would have been put into service in 2014 to replace the old warships from the Cold War era, but it would not be there until at least next year, due to faulty systems and growing costs, reports local media.
The use of the \"Rheinland-Pfalz\" the main ship of the brand new Baden-Wrootemberg class frigate has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to The Zeit-Kurant who quotes a military spokesman.
This vessel must have joined the Navy in 2014, but the fraught post delivery issues have plagued this ambitious project's fate.
The four Baden-Wroottemberg-class vessels that ordered the fleet in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-klas frigate.
It is understood that they will have a powerful cannon, a battle order air repellent and anti-ship missions as well as several secret technologies such as diminished radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the latest frigate for up to two years away from home ports.
But constant delays mean that the advanced warships, which will evidently enable Germany to project power overseas, will already be aged by the time they engage in service, called The Time.
The disastrous F125-fregat took stock last year when the German Navy officially refused to put the vessel into service and sent it back to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the fleet sent back a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the remission, but German media has mentioned that a number of essential software and hardware defects make the ship useless if it is launched in a campaign.
Software defects are particularly important since the Baden-Wroottemberg class vessels will be handled by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half the manpower on older Bremen-class frigates.
It also revealed that the ship was drastically overweight, reducing performance, and reducing the fleet’s ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000 tons of Rhineland-Palatinate are thought to be twice as heavy as ships of similar classes used by the Germans in World War II.
Besides the faulty hardware, the price label for the whole project -- including training the crew -- also became a question.
It evidently reached an incredible €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) more than the initial €2.2 billion.
Problems that the new frigate beset are particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the force of Germany’s fleet is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's defense committee, acknowledged that the fleet's ships that could be unplugged were in progress,
As time went by, the official said, the issue got worse, for old ships were put out of service, but no replacement vessels were supplied.
He lamented that none of Baden-Wroottemberg classes could join the Navy.
National Trust Listens to Wings ’ Secret Life
New research is being carried out on an estate in the Scottish Highlands that aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the usual and soprano wing mouse as well as the brown long ear and Daubenton bats at Inverevene Tuine in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed on the property at important locations to track bat activity throughout the season.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also make mobile recordings by using hand pointers.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will check the regularity of the bat calls and determine what species does.
A Habitat Map and Report will then be compiled to create a detailed landscape scale image of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a conservation consultant for NTS, hopes to reveal the results of the areas of habitat that are most important to the bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management such as pasture farming and how to best manage forest lands for bats and other associated species.
Fleet populations in Scotland and throughout the UK have declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects sleeping and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lightning can also pose a risk, as well as fly paper and some chemical treatment of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Wings are not really blind.
But because of their nightly hunting activities, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo orientation technique to show goggas and obstacles on their flight route.
The NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 acres [76,000 ha] of land, is very serious about bats.
It has ten trained experts who regularly conduct surveys and sleep - place inspections and sometimes perform rescues.
The organization has even set up Scotland’s first and only dedicated bat reserve at Threeave estates in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
Land manager David Thompson says the estate is the ideal site for them.
“Here at Thrave we have a wonderful area for bats,” he said.
“ We have the old buildings, many vet trees, and all the good habitat.
But there is so much about bats that is still unknown, so the work we do here and on other properties helps us to understand better what they need to flourish.
He emphasizes the necessity of looking for bats for preservation in property because it is possible that ignorant destruction of a single crow can mean up to 400 females and young children's death and a whole local population can be eradicated.
Wings are protected, and they are illegal to kill, disturb, or prevent or destroy sleeping places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to jump in to help.
She said: “We still have much to learn about our bats, and for many of our species, we don’t know how their populations go.
Ronaldo completes rape orders while attorneys prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo turned down rape orders against him as 'false news' and said that people 'will promote themselves' by using his name.
His attorneys are ready to sue German news magazine, Der Spiegel, which published the claims.
The Portugal and Juventus advocate was accused of having raped an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He reportedly paid $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, reported Der Spiegel Friday.
In an Instagram live video in which he addressed his 142 million followers, hours after the claims were published, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the reports as 'false news'
“ No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news,--the five-time balloon d'Or winner told the camera.
“ They want to promote themselves by using my name.
This is normal.
They want to be famous for saying my name, but it's part of the whole thing.
I'm a happy man and everything is right,' the player added smilingly.
Ronaldo’s lawyer is preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the claim, which they called, according to Reuters, “inadmissible reporting of suspicion in the field of privacy. ”
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player will claim compensation for ‘moral damages for any amount corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years’
The alleged incident was reported to have occurred in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went to the player's room, where he had already raped her to anal, according to documents submitted to Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell down on his knees after the alleged incident and said he was \"99 percent--a good old man\" who was abandoned by the \"one percent\"
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claimed that she had gone to the police and had taken photographs of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to a settlement outside the court because she was \"banging for retribution\" and worried about being \"publicly humiliated\".
The 34-year-old says she now wants to reverse the settlement because she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo, at the time of the alleged assault, was about to join Manchester United by Real Madrid and moved this summer, in a €100 million agreement to the Italian giant Juve.
Brexit: VK will 'forever repent' if their car manufacturers lose
The UK 'will repent forever' if they lose their status as world leader in car manufacturing to Brexit, said Executive Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it is \"fearingly\" that Toyota VK told BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, it will have to stop temporary production at the Burnaston factory, near Derby.
“We need an agreement,” said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese vehicle manufacturer said that the impact of border delays in the case of a non-agreement Brexit can cost posts.
The Burnaston plant, which produced Toyota's Auris and Avensis, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“ My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production stopped in our factory, ” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s managing director at Burnast.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover have voiced fears about leaving the EU without an agreement and about how cross-border trade will function.
BMW, for example, said they'd lock their mini plant in Oxford for a month to Brexit.
The main concerns related to what car manufacturers say supply chain risks are in the case of a Brexit without an agreement.
Toyota’s production line runs on a just time basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars made on order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be disruption on the border that the industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's stock at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and therefore production will be discontinued.
Mr. Clark says Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is \"precisely calibrated to avoid those border controls\"
“We need an agreement. We want the best agreement that, as I say, will allow us not only to enjoy the present success but to seize this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today program.
“The indications of not only Toyota but also other manufacturers are that we absolutely need to continue with what was a highly successful supply chain.”
Toyota could not say how long production would be discontinued but warned that in the long term, added costs could reduce plant competitiveness and eventually cost posts.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and the Unite Union's co-operator on the plant, says his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, when these posts disappear, it never comes back again.
A government spokesman said: \"We have proposed a precise and acceptable plan for our future relationship with the EU\"
Trump meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, says White House.
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be postponed with another week, while the fight over nominated for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh continued, said the White House Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special legal adviser Robert Mueller, who examines the Russian electoral interference, links between Trump-helpers and Russia, and possible cross-beaming of the law by the president.
Whether Trump was going to dismiss the deputy attorney general or not, and thereby threatened Mueller's independence, had for months fueled Washington's gossip.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of wearing a recorder to record conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president via the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, amid reports that he was on his way to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would choose not to thank Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash with the Senate court's trial in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both witnessed.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of allegations against Kavanaugh and the full Senate vote further postponed.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: \"A date for that has not yet been determined, it may be this week, I can see that it is postponed with another week with all the other things going on with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the press up-to-date.
Some journalists will disagree with that statement: Sanders have not yet held a White House press information session since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the scarcity of information sessions is not due to a contradiction for TV journalists who are \"effect-seeking\", although she said: \"I will not argue with the fact that they are effective.\"
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
“The president held more V&A sessions than any president before him,” she said, adding, without citing any evidence: “We looked at the numbers.
Information sessions will continue, Sanders said, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, then it is infinitely better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it a lot and you've seen us do it a lot in the past few weeks and it's going to take the place of a press information session when you can talk to the president of the United States \"
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press releases with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press releases are scarce.
In New York this week the president may have demonstrated why, by making an unbounded and at times, bisars appear before journalists assembled there.
Secretary of Health writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland about Brexit fears
The Secretary of Health wrote to EU personnel working in Scotland’s NHS to express the country’s gratitude and to express the wish that they would remain in Brexit.
Jeanne Freeman MSP sent a letter less than six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed themselves to covering costs of negotiated status applications for EU citizens working in the delegated public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer negotiations between the UK and EU on withdrawal continued, on the way to expected decisions this fall.
But the UK government has also intensified their preparations for a possible non-agreement scenario.
I know it is a very troubled time for all of you.
That is why I want to repeat how much I put every staff member’s contribution at the price, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that enhance and improve the health service, and the patients and communities we serve benefit from.
Scotland is absolutely your home, and we would like you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing emergency surgery after major injury
Tennessee State Tigers' line player Christion Abercrombie had an emergency operation after he suffered a major injury in Saturday's 31-27 defeat against the Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Tennessee-span's Mike Organ.
Tennessee State’s chief coach Rod Reed told journalists that the injury occurred shortly before rest.
“ He came to the sideline and fell in kind of just there, ” said Reed.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen along the margin before being placed on a portable and taken backwards for further evaluation.
An officer of Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was out of the theater at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there is still no details about the type/range of the injury, and Tennessee still tries to detect when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, an academic second year, was in his first season at Tennessee State after he moved from Illinois.
He died five times on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing his total for the season to 18 dead vessels.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher seal taxes when they buy a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher seal taxes when they buy a property in the UK and the extra cash will be used to help the homeless, according to the new Tory plans
This move will neutralize Corbyn’s attempt to attract young voters
The stamp tax will be levied on those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Tesourie expects to collect up to £120 million a year - to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher seal taxes when they buy a property in the UK - with the extra cash that will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The action will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's attempt to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and target high earners.
The stamp tax increase will be levied on individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, with the extra money that will help the government’s plans to combat homelessness.
The additional tax, which is outside the current stamp tax, including the higher levels set two years ago on second houses and houses purchased to rent, can be as much as three percent.
The Thessoury expects that move to bring in up to £120 million a year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built London Einemme are bought by non-UK citizens who push up the prices and make it more difficult for first buyers to get a foot in the housing door.
Many wealthy areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become “spook towns ” as a result of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy came just weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in seal taxes to help more young people own their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high by picking up land but not using it and encouraged Mrs. May to abandon quotas on affordable homes to restore Britain’s housing disaster.
Mr. Corbyn announced a striking series of proposed housing improvements, including rent management and an end to \"no-error statements\"
He also wants to give wheels larger powers to build new homes.
May said: “Last year I said that I will devote my prime ministership to restoring the British dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means repairing our broken home market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and build a life.
However, it cannot be true that it is just as easy for individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign based companies to buy homes as for hardworking British residents.
For too many people, the dream of home ownership has become a far-off dream and the humiliation of homelessness is too great a reality \"
Jack Ross: 'My biggest ambition is to run Scotland'
Sunderland chief Jack Ross says his \"largest ambition\" is to become the manager of Scotland at a time.
The Scots, 42, enjoys the challenge of blowing new life in the North-East team, which is now in the third place in League One, three points below the top.
He moved this summer to the Stadium of Light after taking St Mirren back to Scottish Premiership last season.
“ I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I took the second team, but it has been, ” said Ross to BBC Scotland’s Sports Sound.
“ But as a child, I often watched Scotland with my father at Hampden, and that is something that pulls me back.
However, the opportunity can only come if I am successful with club management.
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss said he felt no fear of imitating such established names at such a large club, after he had previously rejected presentations from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
‘At the moment, success will be measured for me by ‘‘Can I bring this club back to the Premier league?'
Because of the structure and facilities at this club, it must belong in the Premier league, \"he said.
“It’s not an easy task to get it there, but I’ll probably view myself as a success only if I can get out of the club again.”
Ross' career in management was only three years, after a period as assistant chief at Dumbarton and a 15-month period on Hearts' training staff.
He then helped Alloa return from relegation to the third league and convert St Mirren from on the brink of relegation to winners of the Championship title in the next season.
And Ross says he now feels more comfortable than he ever felt during his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academic.
“It was probably a true crossroads,” he says as he recalls how he took over Alloa’s leaders.
“ I really believed the board was the right place for me, even more than playing.
It sounds bisar, because I did well enough, made a reasonable existence out of it, and experienced reasonable highlights.
But the game can be difficult.
There are many things by which one should come weekly.
I still go through it with regard to the stress and pressure of the job, but driving just feels right.
I always wanted to drive and now I do it, it feels the most comfortable thing I have been in my own skin throughout my adult life.

The perfect time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday, found recording
The summer heat wave improved Britain’s struggling pubs ’ income but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Drinking places and bar groups saw sales rise by 2.7% in July — but revenue in restaurants dropped by 4.8 percent, figures showed.
Peter Martin, of company consulting firm CGA, who compiled the figures, says: “Continuous sunshine and England's longer than expected participation in the World Cup meant that Julie followed a pattern similar to that of the previous month, June, when drinking places were at 2.8 percent, except that restaurants were hit even harder.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant trade in June only increased in July.
Drinking-led drinking places and pubs have improved at far left and increased more than restaurants have dropped.
Cos-led drinking sites also suffered in the sun but not as badly as restaurant operators
It seems people just wanted to go out for a drink.
All over managed pubs and drinking places, sales rose by 6.6 percent for the month, with food down by three percent.
Paul Newman, of leisure and hospitality analysts RSM said: “These results continue the trend we have seen since late April.
Again and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the out-of-the-house market.
It comes as no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a decline in sales of 4.8 percent years a year will be particularly difficult above and besides constant expense pressures.
The long warm summer couldn't have come at a worse time for food-led operators and just the time will show if the more moderate temperatures we've been experiencing since August will bring us needed relief \"
Total growth in sales throughout drinking sites and restaurants, including new locations that opened up, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowness in trade mark announcements.

One out of five children has secret social media accounts hidden from their parents
One out of five children -- some as young as 11 -- have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers, revealing a recording
Recording of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in \"false Insta pages\"
The news raised fears of sexual content
Twenty percent of students say they have a \"head account\" to show parents
One in five children — some as young as 11 — create social media accounts that keep them secret for adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed rapid growth in \"false Insta Accounts\" a reference to the Instagram photoparticipation.
The news raised fears of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they had a clean \"head account\" to show parents, but also had private accounts.
One mother who came down to her 13-year-old daughter's secret yard found a teenager who encouraged others to rape her.
The research, at Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds have two profiles, with half of them recognizing that they have private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: “It’s disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t locate them“
Eilidh Doyle will be voice for athletes on Scottish Athletic Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the council of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the governing body's general annual meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track-and-veldatleet and chairman Ian Beattie described the step as a wonderful opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from her extensive experience at international level during the past decade.

Breast pump advertisement comparing mothers to cows dividing opinions online
A breast pump company divided opinions online with an advertisement comparing breast - feeding mothers to cows being milked.
To celebrate the lead of what is called the \"world's first silently portable breast pump,\" consumer technology company Elvie released a tongue-in-the-cheek music video-inspired advertisement to show the freedom that the pump gives to mothers who milk.
Four real mom dances in a barn full of straw and cows on the mate of a song that includes lyrics such as: \"Yes, I'm milking myself, but you can't see a tail--and \"If you haven't seen, it's not eggs, it's my breasts--
The choral section reads: “Pump it out, pump it out, I carry the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies,
But the advertisement published on the firm’s Facebook page caused online controversy.
With 77,000 watches and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed response from viewers, with many saying that it was the “grawels ” of the dairy industry.
“ Many weakly choose to use cows to advertise this product.
No, we have to get pregnant and give them birth to produce milk, but their babies are often stolen from them within days of birth, “one wrote.
The Elvie breast pump fits discreetly into a food bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another observed: “Experiencingly traumatic for mother and baby.
But yes, why not use it to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies'
Someone else added: “The advertisement is so out of touch - of - touch.
Others defended the advertisement, with one woman who admitted that the song was for her “scrying nose. ”
“I think it’s a genius idea.
I would have had one if I had continued breast - feeding.
Milking out made me feel just like a cow.
The advertisement is a little crazy, but I accepted it for what it is.
It's a genius product,' wrote one.
Another person observed: “It’s a fun advertisement directed at mothers who feel like milk (often in their workplaces or toilets) and like cows.
It is not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry.
At the end of the video the women show that they all danced with the discrete pump in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who are milking say that they feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, however, is silent, has no wires or tubes, and fits discreetly into a feeding bra that gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out while they're milking.
Ana Balarin, partner and UKD at Mother observed: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it has earned a large and appealing display.
By drawing a parallel between women who milk and dairy cows, we wanted to place the milking process and all its challenges in the spotlight, while in an entertaining way that people can find connection, we demonstrate the wonderful feeling of freedom that the new pump will bring.
It's not the first time the Elvie pump got the news.
During London Modeweek, a mother of two appeared on the walktable for designer Marta Jakubowski while she was using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of dependent migrant children has increased sharply although monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, partly due to shallow rhetoric and policies set up by the Trump administration that make it more difficult to place children at bail.
Traditionally, most of the guarantees were also undocumented immigrants and feared that their own ability to stay in the country would be put in jeopardy by stepping forward to demand a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that possible deposits and other adult members of their households should be fingerprinted if and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence, a senior official at Immigration and customs enforcement before Congress, testified that the agency had arrested thousands of people who had applied to secure unparalleled minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no previous criminal records.
\"Amper 80 percent of the individuals who are either sponsors or households of bail are illegal here in the country and a large number of them are criminal foreigners.
Hence, we continue to persecute those individuals, “” said Albence.
In an attempt to process the children more quickly, officials established new rules that would require some of them to appear in court within a month after detention, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to shelter workers.
Many will appear through video conference call, rather than in person, to advocate their case for legal status at an immigration judge.
Those who are considered unsuitable for relief will soon be deported.
The longer the children remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, resulting in violent eruptions or escape attempts, according to shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Advocates say those concerns are raised at a larger facility than Tornillo, where signs that a child is struggling are more easily misunderstood due to the size.
They added that moving the children to the tent town without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally to say good - bye to friends can aggravate the trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria tells US, French and Turkish ‘occupational forces' to withdraw immediately
When he spoke to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to come home even though the country's war was in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, said that the foreign powers are illegal on Syrian soil, under the pretext of fighting terrorism and will be handled \"in accordance with it.\"
“ They should withdraw immediately and without any conditions, ” he told the meeting.
Moualem insisted that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, the war on terror has been over with millions more being rooted.
He said that Damascus will continue “to wage this sacred battle until we have purified all Syrian territories, both of terror groups and of any illegal foreign presence,
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, which mostly train and advise Kurdish forces as well as Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France with over 1,000 troops on the ground in the war - torn country.
On the question of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions were good for them to return, and he blamed some Western countries for spreading “irrational fears that encourage refugees to stay away.
“We called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
\"They politicize something that should be merely a humanitarian issue \"
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats said a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in the last great rebellion of Idlib has created an opportunity to continue with political controversies.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has rejected a massive attack by Russian-supported Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, emphasized that the agreement had “sluggish spermies” and expressed the hope that military action would target jihadists, including warriors of the Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front that would be “cut off. ”
UN Secretary, Staffan de Mistura hopes soon to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to establish a post-war constitution for Syria and to pave the way for elections.
Moualem prescribed conditions for the Syrian government’s participation in the committee and said that the panel’s work should be limited to the ‘negotiation of the articles of the present Constitution ’ and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump will win the re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberals probably hope, a state of accusation and scandals end his presidency early.
In what no doubt \"the most dramatic final of a presidency will ever be\"
To date, there are no signs of viewer fatigue.
Since 2014, peak time viewing rates have more than doubled to 1.05 million at CCN and nearly triple to 1.6 million at MSNCBC.
Fox News has an average 2.4 million peak time viewers, at 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's \"The Rachel Maddow Show\" are top cable viewers with as many as 3.5 million viewers on big news evenings.
“It’s a fire to which people are attracted, because it’s not something we understand,” says Neal Baer, program manager of the ABC drama Designated Survivor, about a cabinet secretary who is president after an attack destroys the Congress building.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of \"Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club\" has a different theory.
She remembers a taxirite in Boston before the 2016 election.
The manager told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
“ He said, “For he makes me laugh, ” Scovell told me.
There is entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the storylines coming from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, or immigrant families, and the health of the global economy.
Turning out is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Yet, it goes beyond being just an informed citizen when you are in the sixth hour of how a panel of experts debated Bob Woodward's use of 'deep background' from his book 'Fear' Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich leather-bathe' a garment thick of the hubris' said The Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniels' shocking descriptions of Mr. Trump's, um, anatomy.
For example, I will never again look at Super Mario in the same way.
“Part of what he does that makes it feel like a reality program is that he does something for you every night,” says Brent Montgomery, manager of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of ‘Pawn Stars,’ about the Trump program’s changing role sharing and daily kinkels in the plot (such as looking for a quarrel with N.F.L., Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss one episode, or you'll stay behind.

He could not tear himself away, not with Brett Kavanaugh being on his way to appear before the Senate Court and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance.
“I remember when we were doing all those crazy programs back then and people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization, ’ Mr. Fleiss told me.

Outflow stream to the most exciting mid-term selection race in Home
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th saw an influx of money, thanks to a shift of convention districts that had now landed two officers in a race around the same seat.
The recently changed suburban Pittsburgh district allows Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb - who won its seat in another district in a special election last spring - to measure forces.
Lamb stands against another official, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which overlaps heavily with the new 17th.
The cards were withdrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally defined in the Republicans ’ favor.
The race in the new 17th kicked off with a campaign funding competition between the major parties' financial legs, the Democratic Field Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Field Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a nail-cracker won in a widely viewed special election in March for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
The seat was held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district at 20 points.
Political experts gave the Democrats a slight advantage.
US considered penalizing El Salvador rather than supporting China but then retreating
Diplomats noticed that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until Vennotes expelled the Trump Organization's management team.
Officials of the State Departments decided to recall the U.S. heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama on the \"almost recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan\" said Heather Nauert, the department's spokesperson, earlier this month in a statement.
But fines are only considered against El Salvador, which in 2017 received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid, including drug control, development and economic assistance.
The proposed fines, which include reduction in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be difficult for the Central American country with its high levels of unemployment and murder.
As internal meetings progressed, only North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level convention and focused on security and economic progress to follow up on a similar convention last year that was considered a step forward in an effort to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
But by mid-September, top administrative officials made it clear that they wanted the convention to continue effectively ending any consideration of fines for El Salvador.
Deputy President Mike Pence is now destined to address the convention, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the seriousness of the assembly for administration, the diplomats said.
And the three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic with no new severe messages or force from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton would not comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal debate on the basis of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an outside analyst who was close to the administration and also talked about the condition of anonymity.
Study History
The next thing that can happen may be the special deliberation of Robert Mueller’s report on Mr. Trump’s possible barbarism of the court, of which there is now much significant public record evidence.
It is thought that Mr. Mueller also focused his investigation on whether Trump’s campaign with Russia had cooperated in the country’s attack on our elections.
If Congress were to go into other hands, Mr. Trump would have to face accountability in that body, just when he was preparing to go back before the electors, and perhaps finally before a jury of his peers.
This is a lot of axes, and I don't want to imply that Mr. Trump's trap is inevitable, nor is it that of his counterparts in Europe.
There are decisions to be made on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how much the battle can be stretched out.
In 1938, German officials were ready to launch a coup against Hitler, when the West opposed him only and supported the Czechoslovakia-Slovakes at Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and the endless course of democracy is rushed or delayed.
Americans now face several such turning points.
What will we do if Mr. Trump deputy attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation, resigns?
Rosenstein had been in hot water since this newspaper reported that he had suggested taking the president in secret last year and speculating whether he was qualified for office.
Mr. Rosenstein says that The Times’s report is inaccurate.
\"How will we react if Brett Kavanaugh's newly requested FBI investigation is not complete or just\" or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court in spite of credible charges of sexual assault and dishonest evidence?
And above all, will we vote in the interim for a convention which will hold responsible for Mr. Trump?
If we watch those tests, there is a long winter ahead of democracy.
But I believe we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi rule who lived at a time in my ambassador's house.
She survived, emigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light up Sabbath candles on that table that carried the swastika.
With it as my origin, how can I not be optimistic about our future?

Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimism for Rapid Vienna match
Rangers play on Thursday hosts for Rapid Vienna knowing that victory over the Austrians, after the impressive equal outcome in Spain against Villareral earlier this month they will place them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europe League.
A knee injury has prevented middle field player Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season into the 2-2 equal impact against Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use this rash as a jumping spot for bigger things.
“That was a good point for us, because Villareral is a good team,” said the 31-year-old.
“We went into the game with the conviction that we could get something and walked away with a point.
Perhaps we could have won it at the end, but a draw-up is probably a righteous outcome.
They were probably better in the first half, and we came out in the second half and were the better team.
Thursday is another great European evening.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it'll be a difficult game, because they've had a good outcome in their last game, but with the crowd on our side, I'm sure we can push through and get a positive outcome.
Last year was certainly difficult, with everything that happened to my injuries and the changes at the club, but there is now a well-feeling factor in place.
The group is good, and the men are enjoying it. The training is good.
Hopefully we can now push through, sit behind us in the past season, and be successful\"
Women lose sleep over this retirement couple’s fear
Despite the fact that survey participants have a clear idea of how they want to be cared for, few people talk to their relatives about it.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide study said they talked to their husbands about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
“People want a relative to take care of them, but they don’t take the steps to have the conversation,” says Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance.
Here is where to start.
Talk to your husband and the children: You cannot prepare your family to care if you do not express your wishes long in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how to receive care, since those choices can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Bring in your financial advisor: Your counselor can also help you come up with a way to pay for those expenses.
Your long-term care funding decisions may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid cash-value life insurance policy to help cover these expenses or self-insurance with your own capabilities, as long as you have the money.
Work out your legal documents: Cut down legal disputes at the pace.
Get a health care proxy in place so you can designate a trusted individual to supervise your medical care and ensure that experts meet your wishes if you cannot communicate.
Consider, too, your proxy for your finances.
You must choose someone you trust to make financial decisions for you and to make sure that your bills are paid if you are not competent.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medication and allergies?
Play those details out in a written plan so you are ready.
“ These are not just the financial issues raised, but who are the doctors, ” Martin asks.
What is the medication?
Who will take care of the dog?
Make sure that plan is in place

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed because of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected.
With communications put out of action, relief officers could not get any information from Donggala Regentship, an area north of Palu that is closer to the center of the 7.5 range shaking.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were brought to safety after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province, located at the tip of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a rainforest that stretches along more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The regency, an administrative region under a province, had an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the pillars of the Central Sulawesi province's economy, especially the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but mostly concentrated in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938 a tsunami killed more than 200 and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck West Donggala in 1996 and caused nine deaths.
Indonesia sits on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of the past few years:
2004: A major shaking along the western coast of Indonesian Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26, which led to a tsunami that hit 14 countries, led to 226,000 deaths along the coast of the Indian Ocean, with more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong shakings hit the western coast of Sumatra late in March and early in April.
Hundreds died in Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-range hit the south of Java, Indonesia was most populated island, leading to a tsunami that hit the southern coast and caused almost 700 deaths.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude quake struck near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people are dead.
2010: A 7.5-range quake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, which led to a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozen villages and led to about 300 deaths.
2016: A level shaking hit the Pidie Jaya recovery in Aceh and led to destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly shaking and tsunami in 2004.
It didn't lead this time to a tsunami, but more than 100 were dead because of buildings that collapsed,
2018: Great shakes hit Indonesia’s tourist island Lombok, with more than 500 deaths, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin’s eldest son was arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former governor of Alaska and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested under suspicion of domestic violence, interference with a report of domestic violence and opposition to arrest, according to a report issued by Alaska State Police on Saturday.
According to the police report, he took a woman's phone from her when she called the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is in custody at Mat-Su Pretrial facility and is being held on a $500 unsecured deposit, reports KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared “innocent, ” when he was asked what he was pleading, the network reported.
Palin faces three Class A offenses, which means he can be imprisoned for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He is also charged with a class B offence, punishable with a day in prison and fined $2 000.
This is not the first time criminal complaints have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the alleged attack.
The case is now before Alaska’s Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference with the report of a crime of domestic violence, and possession of a gun while he was drunk, in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed that he had boxed her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after linking her son’s behavior to PTSD as a result of his military service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake tsunami: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after an earthquake on Friday struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
The 7.5-range earthquake led to a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been put out of action with mortality rates expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just outside central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulate on social media that shows the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the beach.
Federal prosecutors rarely seek death sentence for suspects in NYC terror attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are looking for the death sentence for Sayfullo Saikov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that caused eight people's death, a rare punishment that had not yet been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saikov, 30, reportedly used a Home Depot rental truck to launch an attack on a bicycle road along the West Side motorway in Lower Manhattan to reap pedestrians and a cyclist who was in his way in October.
In order to justify a death sentence, prosecutors would have to prove that Saipov had deliberately killed the eight victims and had deliberately committed serious bodily injuries, according to the notice of intention to ask for the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both of those charges bear possible death penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury struck Saipov with 22 charges, which included eight charges of murder in favor of extortion, which were typically used by federal prosecutors in gonganized crimes, and a complaint of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for “deceptive planning and predominance, ” said prosecutors, and described the way in which Saipov carried it out as“ abhorrent, cruel, and perverted ”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco, ” stated the intention notice.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since the Southern District of New York has legally prosecuted a death sentence.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to the murder of two drug victims but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York, in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been sentenced to death after being sentenced to a plot to carry out espionage for the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
Both Rosenberges were equipped with the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Zipov, a native of Uzbekistan, demonstrated no repentance in the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He mentioned to detectives that he felt good about what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the charges.
He also requested to show the ISIS flag in his hospital room, the police said.
He pleaded innocently against the 22 prosecutors.
David Patton, one of the federal pro Deo lawyers representing Saikov, said that they were \"naturally disappointed\" with the prosecution's decision.
“We think that the decision to desire the death penalty rather than to accept a debt recognition of life imprisonment with no possible release, will only prolong the trauma of these events to all those involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked persecutors not to desire the death penalty.
Tory LP says NIGEL FARAGE should be placed in charge of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage made a vow today to mobilize people's army during a protest at the Tory Conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians had to feel the \"heat\" of Eurosceptics, since one of Theresa May's own LPs suggested he must be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative afterbanker Peter Bone told the march in Birmingham that by the time the UK was out, the UK was if Mr. Farage Brexit secretary.
But the challenge that Mrs May face to unite her deeply divided officers was indicated by pro-Roman Tories by joining a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep her Chequers compromise plan running in the midst of attacks by Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
League members insisted that she would press through in her attempt to reach an agreement with Brussels in spite of the dead - and force Euroskeptics and Labour to choose between her package and 'chaos'.
Mr Bone told the Loop Term Loop convention in Solihull that he wanted to throw out ‘Chequers'
He suggested that Mr. Farage should have been made a nobleman and given the responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
‘If he were in control, we would have been out by the time,' he said.
The Wellingborough-LP added: 'I'll get up for Brexit, but we'll have to throw out Chequers.'
He outlined his opposition to the EU, saying: “We have not fought world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.'
Mr. Bone pointed out that public opinion has changed since the 2016 stormy: ‘The idea that British people have changed their opinions and want to stay is completely untrue.’
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was also on the march and said to reporters: ‘ I simply say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
‘Chequers are unpopular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular with our party and our activists who actually bombard the streets and make sure that we are chosen in the first place.
Please let Chequers go and start listening.\"
In a direct message to Mrs. May, she added: ‘First ministers must keep their jobs when they keep their promises.’

‘It’s about a matter of confidence between us--the people--and our political class,' he said.
‘They try to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them ‘we won’t let you get away with it.’
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: ‘ I want you to make our political class, who is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.
‘We mobilize the people’s military of this country that gave us victory in Brexit and will not rest until we are an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.’

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton sound world title after team orders gave him his win over Sebastian Vettel
It became apparent the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified for Lewis Hamilton on Saturday when Mercedes's team orders would play a major role in the race.
From pole position, Bottas had a good start and almost won for Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel first entered the wells and left Hamilton to drive in the back of the bundle, something that must have been decisive.
The Mercedes ran a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went forward to wheel-on-wheel action that the Ferrari driver against risk-free saw leaving the inside at risk of endurance after a double-movement to defend on the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the jumping grid and was seventh by the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led for much of the race as he held on to his tires to quickly finish and passed Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He may have come in at the 44th round at the wells but could not accelerate his pace in the remaining eight rounds, since Raikkonen took fourth place.
It was said that it was a difficult day, because Valtteri did fantastics all weekend and was a true sir.
The team did outstanding work to have one-two,' said Hamilton.
It was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein at a convention on Saturday for not licking Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which she accused High Court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
The president spoke at a convention in West Virginia and did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Committee. Instead, he commented that what was said in the Senate showed that people were \"common and rude and liars.\"
“ The one thing that can happen and the lovely thing that has happened in the Senate over the past few days, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and liars, ” he said.
“When you look at statements and leaks and then they say “o, I didn’t.
I didn't do that'
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you leaked?
Remember her answer... did you leak the document -o, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't lick it'
Well, wait a bit.
Had we licked it...No, we didn't lick it,--he added, in a preoccupation of the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter stating the charges back in July against Kavanaugh by Ford, and it was earlier leaked in September - but Feinstein denied that the leaking came from her office.
“ I did not hide Dr. Ford’s accusations, ” I did not lick her story, “and Feinstein told the committee, reporting The Hill.
\"She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential as she asked for it.\"
But the president did not consider her denial well, commenting during Saturday evening’s convention: “I tell you what, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen \"
The president continued to defend the Supreme Court-nominated accused by three women of sexual misconduct and suggested that the democrats use the charges for their own purposes.
“ They are determined to take back with any needed medicine.
You see the commonality, the impurity, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to care for to gain power and control, “mediaites reportedly said the president.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer threw two targets for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars agreed for Friday’s Elite League loss against Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 match in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants got an early two-purpose lead by throws from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team up before Dwyer restored the Giants ’ leadership.
Francois Bouchard brought Dundee up before two Lukas Lundvald Nielsen targets captured their victory.
It was the third Elite League victory of the season for Adam Keefe’s men who first lost competitions and then won Dundee 2-1 on Friday evening in Belfast.
It was the fourth convention of the season between sides, with the Giants winning the previous three contests.
Dwyer's opening ball came in the fourth minute at 3:35 from Kendall McFaull's help, with David Rutherford offering the help when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what was a busy opening period, Sullivan put the home team back into play at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became the supplier for Cownie's equalizer at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took lead until the first break when he threw his second goal of the evening at the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard again got them equal with a goal of power at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran stood together to help Nielsen get Dundee into the competition for the first time in the second half, and he made sure of the win with his team’s fifth point halfway through the final half.
The Giants who now lost four of their last five matches are home to Milton Keynes in their next game Friday.
Air traffic controller die to make sure hundreds of aircraft can escape earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is considered a hero after he died when he made sure that a plane carrying hundreds of people had risen safely.
More than 800 people were killed and more missing after a great earthquake Friday hit the island of Sulawesi, and caused a tsunami.
There are still strong aftershocks in the area, many being trapped in debris in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the control tower that swung heavily on the Mutiara SIS Al-Jufri airport in Palu.
He remained immovable to make sure that the Batik Air flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, was able to rise safely.
He then jumped from the traffic control tower when he day it collapsed.
He later died in the hospital.
Spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, says that the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reported Australia’s ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Sadly, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“ Our hearts break to hear about this, ” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll can reach the thousands with the country’s disaster relief agency, which says that access to the towns of Donggala, Sigi, and Boutong is limited.
“ It is believed that the death toll continues to increase as many corpses are still under construction while many are still unable to reach, ” said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves reaching six meters, Palu plucked, which would have a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial planes bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance body brings in.
Clean water is scarce.
The miniarks are being looted everywhere
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help survivors, but we do not know what they are going to find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it can get much worse.
Indonesia’s president Yoko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country’s military service: “I ask you to work day and night to complete every task related to evacuation.
Are you ready - reported CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesian aircraft accident: Air Niugini says one man is missing after beach more plane accident
The airline that handled a flight that crashed into a Pacific beach lake in Micronesia said now that one man was missing after they had earlier said that all 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they could not account for a male passenger.
The airline said that they were working with local authorities, hospitals, and detectives to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday, and that all of them were in a stable condition.
The cause of the collapse and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. fleet both said that the plane landed near the runway in the sea.
Some witnesses thought that the plane had passed the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane had come in very low.
“This is a very good thing,” said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and the others managed to walk through medium - deep water until the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said the aerial women panicked and screamed, and he suffered a small head injury.
The U.S. fleet said that ships that worked close to the improvement of a battle also with a inflatable boat with the rescue helped to get people to land again and again before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Air Safety Network indicates that in the past two decades, 111 people have been killed in collapses of PNG registered airlines, but Air Niugini was involved in one.
Analysts set a time line from the night when women were burned alive
The state closed its case on Saturday in the re-examination of a man charged with burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
V.S.- Department of Justice-analyst Paul Rowlett witnessed for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone records to assemble the movements of 29-year-old charged Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of his death.
Rowlett said that he had received location data from various cell phones that showed that Tellis was together with Chambers on the night of her death, which contradicted his previous claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford testified that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said that he was in Sanford’s truck that night, Sanford said he was “yok, because my move was in Nashville ”
Another inconsistency is that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile records indicated that they knew each other only for a week.
Rowlett said that a while after Chambers' death, Tellis had erased Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
“ He erased her from his life, ” Hale said.
The defense was scheduled to begin its final battle Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to go to the jury later that day.

Still a black person?!
NY childish wife sues couple because she is dismissed after 'racist' text
A New York childish woman sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a mis-addressed message from the mother who complained that she was still a black person.
The couple deny that they are racist and compare the dispute with \"depression\"
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, aired her distress when she found out that the new child care provider, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived for her first workday in 2016.
\"NEEEEEEEEEEEEE NOG 'N SWART PERSOON, -- wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a message.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she twice sent it to me Maurice.
After she found out her mistake, an 'uneasy' Plasco-Flaxman thanked me Maurice and said that their outgoing baby girl, who was African-American, was doing bad work and that she rather expected a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Me Maurice was paid for her one day's work and then sent home with a Uber.
Now Maurice sues the couple for damages over the dismissal and searches for damages to the amount of $350 a day for the six months, resident work for which she was initially appointed, although it was without a contract.
“I want to show them, look, you’re not doing so well, ” she told the Post on Friday and added, “I know that’s discrimination.
Looking back on the claims that they were racist, the couple said that it was the reasonable thing to end Maurice ’ appointment and feared that they would not be able to trust her after insulting her.
“ My wife sent her something she didn’t mean to say.
She's not a race.
We are not racist people, “man Joel Plasco told the Post.
“ But would you put your children in the hands of someone with whom you were rude, even though it was by the wayside?
Your newborn baby?
Come on, now.
Plasco compared the case to \"depression\" and said that his wife would have had a baby in two months and was in a very difficult situation.
\"Are you going after such a person?
It's not a very nice thing to do,' the investment banker added.
While the case continued, the court of public opinion was quick to bring the couple on social media and to cut them down for their conduct and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared that a talking bear would not involve readers.
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It is difficult to put yourself in the shoes of someone who first read it before it is published.
It is very entertaining that we know of Paddington’s great success “
She said her father would have been furious if his work had been rejected. He was a BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write the children's book on the little toy bear. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication after his death was last year'bittersweet.
Regarding Paddington, whom she described as a very important member of our family, she added that her father was silently proud of his ultimate success.
\"He was quite a quiet man, and he wasn't an apple-winged man, \" she said.
“But since Paddington was genuine to him, it was almost as if you had a child who accomplished something: you were proud of them, even if it wasn’t your job.
I think he viewed Paddington’s success in that way.
Although it was his creation and imagination, he always gave the honor to Paddington himself \"
My daughter was dying and I had to greet the phone.
When she landed, her daughter was chased to Nice’s Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
“Nad called regularly to say that it was really bad, that they didn’t expect her to make it,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“ Then I get the call from Nad to say that she would die within the next two minutes and that I should greet her.
And I did.
I said, “Tashi, I love you very much, I love you very much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicine that the doctors gave her to hold her heart on the knock was slowly getting up and leaving her system.
She was a while before it died and the body was shutting down.
I just had to sit there waiting, knowing it was unfolding.
I couldn't sing, or cry, or cry, because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I really had to keep it together.
Finally Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who by then was hurt at the loss of her daughter, went on board with the other passengers - unaware of the trial she appreciated going.
“ Nobody knew, ” she said.
“ I had my head down, and the tears always fell.
It's hard to explain, but I got on the run an overwhelmingly sympathetic feeling for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Mourning women post cards to prevent suicides on bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones because of suicide work at preventing others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys mail cards for a while on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Me Davis ’ son Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and killed himself at 18.
“ I want no parent to feel the way I feel every day, ” she said.
Me Davis, 45, lived in Lydney and said that her son was a promising shepherd with an contagious smile.
“ Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that his smile had clarified any room \"
However, he gave up work before he died, because he was \"in a very dark place.\"
In 2014, Tyler’s 11 - year - old brother found his brother after he took his own life.
Me Davis said: \"I am constantly worried that there will be a domino effect.\"
Me Davis designed the maps, \"to let people know that there are people out there to whom you can go and talk to whom you can, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit in silence - you have to talk
Me Humphreys, who has been a friend of Me Davies for years, lost Mark, her husband of 15 years, not long after his mother's death.
“ He didn’t say he felt sick or depressed or anything, ” she said.
\"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He reached the very lowest point on Christmas Day - when the children opened their gifts, he did not make eye contact or something with them -
She said his death was very traumatic to them, but that they had to work through it: \"It pulls a hole through the family.
It tears us apart.
But we all have to go on and fight.

Brett Kavanaugh’s future is still unquestionably as FBI investigates begins
“I thought if we could actually get something like what he asked for--a timeless investigation that didn’t cover--we could perhaps bring some unity,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday and added that he feared that the committee was trying to “fall apart” under horrified partisan clustering.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters have to investigate the FBI?
Their contradiction is all because of timing.
The interim elections are only weeks away, on November 6, if, as is expected, the Republicans are doing badly, then they will be weakened in their efforts to get the man they want to choose to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush called senators to influence them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House and who met his wife Ashley and was Mr. Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI has produced its report?
There will be a poll in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It's not clear yet whether Mr. Kavanaugh can come to at least 50 votes on the Senate floor that Mike Pence, the vice president, will allow to break a draw and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korea skipper numbers 'down' below Kim
The number of North Korean survivors to South Korea has dropped since then Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, said a South Korean legislature.
Park Byeong virtue, citing data from the South’s unification cabinet, said that there were 1,127 overlaps last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that stricter border control between North Korea and China and higher rates asked by human smugglers has been key factors.
Pyongyang made no public comment.
The vast majority of the survivors from the North are finally offered to South Korea citizens' rights.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most flight through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the highly protected demilitarized zone (DMS) between the two Koreans.
China considers the survivors to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often repatriates them violently.
Relations between the North and the South, who are still technically involved in war, have improved dramatically in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met for conversations that centered around the stagnant negotiations on the removal of nuclear weapons.
It came to the historic meeting in June between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore when they agreed in broad terms to work together for the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho has blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
\"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way that we will one-sidedly disarm ourselves first,\" said Mr Ri in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh - hysterical - saying he is unqualified to serve in the Supreme Court
Home minority leader Nancy Pelosi called High Court-renominated Brett Kavanaugh's \"histeries\" and said that he was temporally incapable of serving in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented on Saturday in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help thinking that if a woman ever acted like this, they would say ‘histiously,’“ Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Legal Committee Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied emotional accusations that he had assaulted sexual Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both of them were teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional and at times almost screamed and choked while discussing his family and his high school years.
He also expressly condemned Democrats on the committee and called the allegations against him a \"beliefful and coordinated character suicide\", organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because it showed that he was prejudiced against Democrats.
“ I think he makes himself unfit with those statements and the way he went behind the Clintons and the Democrats, ” she said.
Pelosi hesitated when she was asked if she would try to charge Kavanaugh if he were confirmed, and if Democrats won the majority in the House of Commons.
“I’ll say that -- if he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he isn’t qualified to be in the Supreme Court, but to be in the court on which he is currently,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the D.C. Ommegang Appealhof.
Pelosi added that as a democrat, she was worried about potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Law of Cheapest Care or Roe v. Wade, since he was considered a conservative right.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh raised questions as to whether he would challenge certain Supreme Court decisions.
“It’s not time for a hysterical, prejudiced person to go to court and expect us to say, ‘It’s not wonderful, ’” Pelosi said.
And women must handle it.
It is a righteous diatribe, months and years of anger that boils over, and she cannot get it out without weeping.
“ We cry when we get angry, ” Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s unusual, you’re doing “
She continued, \"I was greatly helped by a woman who was an executive officer somewhere, who also said she cried when she got angry, but developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she would have said to the person she was talking to, \"You may think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry.
And then she just went on.
And I thought it was brilliant.
Tears are permissible as a partial exit for bum because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my sharpest memories of an early work in a male-dominated office was where I once found myself crying with nameless rage and being grabbed at my neck skin by an older woman--a cold driver for whom I was a little scared--who dragged me into a logistical.
“ Never let them see you cry, ” she told me.
“ They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they've had an effect on you.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught up in an extramarital relationship on a boat called Monkey Business and he had to leave the race, I Schroeder, very frustrated, realized that there was no reason why she could not examine the idea that she could run for president.
“ I didn’t think well about the decision, ” she said to me laughing 30 years later.
“ There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another.
Someone called it “Snowy Little and the Seven Dwargies. ”
Because it was late in the campaign, she was behind with find collections and so she made a vow that she would not enter the race unless she collected $2 million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave men $1,000 would give her only $250.
“ Think of them I’m going to get setbacks, ” she wondered.
When she delivered her speech and announced that she would not lead a formal campaign, she was overwhelmed by emotions--thankful for the people who supported her, frustrated with the system that made it so difficult to collect money and target voters rather than sharegates, and angry at sexism--that she had choked.
You would have thought that I had a nerve breakdown,--recall me Schroeder about how the press responded to her.
“ You would have thought that Kleenex was my corporate security.
I remember thinking, what are they gonna put on my gravestone?
\"She cried,
How the U.S. China Trade War might be good for Beijing
The opening spirit of the trade war between the U.S. and China was overwhelming and while the battle was far from over, a conflict between the countries may have been beneficial in the long term for Beijing, experts say.
Donald Trump, the U.S. president, fired the first warning earlier this year by charging important Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
This week the most interesting escalation rolled in with new rates affecting $200 trillion (£150 trillion) items and effectively burdening half of the goods entering the U.S. from China.
Every time Beijing fell back in goods, tariffs of five to ten percent had been slapped at $60 trillion ’s of American goods.
China has promised to equalize the US shoot-for shot and the world's largest economy will not soon move.
To get Washington to stand back means to surrender to requests, but to publicly comply with the US's requests would be too much of an embarrassment for Xi Jinping, China's president.
Experts still say that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, pressure on U.S. trade war over the long term China can support positively by lowering the interdependency of the two economies.
The fact that a quick police decision in either Washington or Beijing can create conditions that could start an economic toll flight in any one of the countries is actually much more dangerous than spectators have known before,' said Abigail Grace, a research assistant focusing on Asia in the middle of New American Security, a thinker.
Syria ‘ready’ for refugees to return, says Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild the land that has been destroyed by a war for more than seven years.
The Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly that conditions in the country are improving.
“ Today, the situation at ground level is more stable and secure because of progress in combating terrorism, ” he said.
The government continues to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists to normal.
All conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country to leave because of terrorism and the one - sided economic measures that targeted their daily lives and their existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since then.
A further six million people still living in the country need philanthropic assistance.
Al-Mualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the rural land.
But he stressed that it would not accept conditional assistance or help from countries that secured the invasion.
Europe besiegs Ryder-Baker Victory in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder cup and defeated Spain U.S.A. with a final point of 16.5 at 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not yet won a Ryder cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn made the 14.5 points they needed to win the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who had struggled for most of the tournament, let his T-hou go in the water at the par-3 16th hole and awarded his match to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golf player Molinari has shone in all its rounds and has become one of the 1-of-4 players to ever go 3-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was blown out by the player with the lowest rank on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The player with the world's highest rank, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to land Poulter of England who might have played in his final Ryder cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, became the tournament's European winner of all times with 25.5 career points.
“ I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help it.
It was a rough year.
So grateful for Thomas who chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to get the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help,--an emotional Garcia said after European victory.
He hands the torch over to his countryman John Ram who won US golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single game on Sunday.
The incredible pride I felt, to conquer Tiger Woods, I grew up and looked at that old one,' said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods had lost all four of his matches in France and now had a record of 13-21-3 career Ryder cup record.
A strange statistic by one of the greatest players of all time and he won 14 great titles second to just Jack Nicklaus.
Span U.S.A. had to struggle very weekends to find the clean field with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau who played high-caliber golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furiek spoke after a disappointing performance on behalf of his team: \"I'm proud of these guys.
There was time this morning when we put some heat on Europe.
We deleted.
Hatred off for Thomas.
He's a wonderful captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll regroup. I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder cup committee, and we'll move forward.
I love these 12 boys, and I am proud to serve as their captain.
You need to keep your hat clean.
We've been outnumbered.
