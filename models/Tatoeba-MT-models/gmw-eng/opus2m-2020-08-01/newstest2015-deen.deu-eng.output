According to reports, India also hopes for a Treaty on Defence Cooperation between the two nations.
Karratha Police Arrest 20-Year-olds After Fast Motorcycle Hunt
A motorcycle was confiscated after the driver had driven it at 125 km/h in a 70 km/h zone and through Buschland to escape the police in Bilbara.
Traffic police in Karratha tried to stop a blue motorcycle this morning after observing it, as it left a gas station on Bathdate Road at 125 km/h.
The police report that the driver then ignored the stop signals and continued on the Burgess Road before he went off to the bushland where the officials lost sight of it.
The motorcycle as well as a person who corresponded to the description of the driver were later seen at a house at Walcott Way in Bulgaria.
Karratha police accused a 20-year-old man of not complying with a stop signal and reckless driving.
He is scheduled to appear in Karratha on September 23rd.
The motorcycle was secured and confiscated for three months.
George Webster charged for hotel rapes in Naim and Pitlochry
A man is in court for the rape of women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was read at a hearing of the Supreme Court in Glasgow.
He is accused of raped a woman at the Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry in Perthshire on June 7, 2013.
The charge is that Webster attacked her while she was "conscious, asleep and unable to signal consent."
Webster is also accused of raped a second woman at the Golf View Hotel in Naim in the Scottish highlands on May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set the negotiating date for 17 November at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh.
Recalling the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have tabled a bill to establish the organisation of trade unions as a civil right.
"As trade unions die, so do middle-class jobs," said Ellison, a Minnesota democrat and vice-president of Progressive Caucus in Congress.
That is why I am proud to present the Staff Empowerment Act together with the Civil Law icon John Lewis.
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal opportunities for discrimination due to the organisation of trade unions as in other forms of discrimination - and stops such an anti-union force.
The addition of the National Labour Law to create an opportunity for discrimination-affected workers to organise a trade union representation in order to sue before a civil court for justice - and to obtain damages or fines - is a sensible and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of their bill suggest is to link back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks that have been exposed to trade unions in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other countries throughout the country - Americans once encouraged countries around the world to recognise, extend and comply with labour rights.
There was a time when millions of Americans remembered when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right of association in a breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution to ensure that the militarized autocracy Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy.
Conscious that the workers and their trade unions played a role in creating a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly acknowledged that "the workers' rights to union and joint bargaining and action are guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that Fascism Adolf Hitler would be replaced by a strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that the workers would have to organize themselves and raise their voice in the new nation, the Germans added a clause that stated explicitly: "The right to set up associations to secure and improve the working and economic conditions is guaranteed to every individual and every profession or trade.
Agreements restricting this right or aimed at reducing it are null and void, and measures aimed at it are illegal.
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt held the presidency of the International Human Rights Commission, which designed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as adopted by the United Nations as a worldwide agreement in 1948, Roosevelt and the other authors added a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form or join unions to protect his interests."
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labour rights are human rights.
When this country advised other countries on how to form civil and democratic societies, Americans stated that the right to set up a union - and that this union should then participate in collective negotiations as an equivalent partner with companies and government agencies - must be protected.
After these rights were under fire in America, it is indeed very wise to see the American ideal again, so that the working population must have the right to unite and become a part of a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now all know that the workers' movement did not limit the strength of the nation, but increased it.
By increasing the standard of living of millions of people, work has miraculously created a market for industry and raised the entire nation to unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but history preserves them.
The story remembers, and we should do the same.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights as a protection against discrimination in the creation of workers' representatives - has long been overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that have made America great in the past and that they have fulfilled the promise of democracy.
Judge temporarily stops law that all abortion clinics in Louisiana could force closure
A U.S. federal judge temporarily stopped the implementation of a law in Louisiana on Sunday, of which lawyers say it would probably have led to the closure of all five abortion clinics in the state.
This measure, which was passed by Bobby Jindal, Governor of Louisiana, in June and is to enter into force on 1 Sept., would force doctors performing abortions to have a patient right at a hospital within a radius of 30 miles to acquire their practice.
However, the judge's decision means that doctors can continue to perform legal abortions for the time being, while applying for such a right.
"The complainants can continue to work in accordance with the law while trying to obtain these rights," wrote Federal Judge John deGravelles in his judgment.
Within a month, a hearing will be held for the judge to bring about a more permanent decision for the law.
Absorption advocates welcomed the decision, the latest in a series of judgments against similar measures and said that doctors could take so much more time to obtain hospitalisation rights.
"Today's decision means that women in Louisiana are missing out on a clumsy law that wants to take their health and rights," said Nancy Northup, president and chairman of the Centre for Reproduction Rights, who had complained on behalf of three of the five clinics of the state in order to stop the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the judgment also covered the doctors from the two clinics who had not joined the action and had also applied for the right of appeal.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have passed similar laws, with courts recently declared such measures in Alabama and Mississippi unconstitutional.
The key areas of a law in Texas, which would have forced most of the hospitals remaining in the state to close, were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
Absorption advocates and American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists as well as the American Medical Association agree that injunction rights require unnecessary restrictions on doctors.
Absorbent object to the fact that the measures serve to protect women's health, although some also welcomed the effects of closure of clinics.
Only a doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has patient access rights, reported the Center for Reproduction Rights.
If all other doctors in the state were forced to stop performing abortions, this doctor would not perform the operation for fear of his safety, the group said.
In their argument against the judgment, representatives of the State of Louisiana said that they would not punish doctors for the conduct of abortions while their applications for patient access rights would still be pending.
Delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment options lead to higher death rates due to ovarian cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have put a video home for her mother, who died of ovary cancer in 2007.
For women in the rural areas of Australia, there is a higher risk of dying of ovarian cancer than for women in cities.
Researchers analysed the medical data of more than 1100 Australians who were diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 25 percent were alive five years after the diagnosis.
Research director Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those who lived in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.
KLEINE STUDIE: New medicines may slow lung and ovary cancer
The researchers examined the medical care of women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman in the diagnosis, the type of ovary cancer, existing prediseases and social and economic status also affected the chances of survival.
The rate of survival was lowest for older women and those whose cancer was already advanced at the time of diagnosis.
For those who lived in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality was 20 percent higher during the study than for those in urban areas.
Although the study did not investigate why women living outside the city were more likely to die of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suspects that late diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centers as possible factors.
"This disease is best treated by gynecological oncologists, and they are usually found in larger cities," she said.
Despite the improvement of telemedicine services to counter distances, it proposed, as a possible remedy, a strengthening of the service of doctors flown in order to give specialists the opportunity to provide women closer to their place of residence, as well as treatment programs for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that regardless of geographical status, the study resulted in a poor long-term survival rate in women in ovarian cancer and underlined the need for better treatment and precautionary strategies.
The study funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is today published in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a young mother of 33 years, learned from the Gold Coast that she had an aggressive form of ovary cancer.
Gardening centres regret falling homeowner numbers
The decline, together with an increased fall in the number of homeowners under 35, could cause garden centres to lose tens of thousands of pounds a year if today's young consumers, according to a study by HTA, as reported in the Financial Times, reach the "Kernaltersgruppe für Gartenprodukte" (Kernaltersgruppe für Gartenprodukte).
The report states that tenants spend an average of 55 percent of the amount spent on their garden by people with their own homes.
The rise of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popular method of asphalting gardens for park purposes, and the declining size of the garden are other factors threatening the industry, in which an estimated £5 billion is put into sale every year.
In the larger London area, where the proportion of homeowners has fallen from 61 to 43 percent over a period of 6 years, the lowest expenditure on garden products per household is reported.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that living for rent or small gardens does not mean that people cannot draw plants.
Guy Barter, chief garden advisor for the RHS said: "Container gardeners, for example, are very popular with tenants because they can take their plants with them when moving."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of the retail trade in gardens due to increasing domestic and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
He also forecast an improved market situation for this year because of the better weather in the light of unfriendly weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement in Pakistan, led by opposition politician Imran Khan and the clergy Tahirul Qadri, continues.
In the capital Islamabad, around 1,000 demonstrators stormed the state television station PTV.
Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said that soldiers could have pushed the Protestants back out of PTV buildings.
The transmitter set up its operation for about 40 minutes, but now transmits again.
At the same time, some 3,000 demonstrators tried to reach the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
About a kilometer away, they supplied themselves with sticks and stones equipped with security forces.
The police used tear gas.
The demonstrators demanded Sharif's resignation, but he refused.
The army of the country is now calling for a political solution to the conflict "without wasting time and using it without violence".
After a meeting in the headquarters on Sunday evening, the military reported: "The army remains obliged to ensure the security of the state".
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has already done more.
The opposition politician Imran Khan accuses Prime Minister Sharif of cheating on the May elections last year.
The protests were escalated on the weekend after Khan and Qadri had called on their followers to come to Sharif's residence.
Three people had been killed.
Turkey orders US diplomat for espionage reports
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has ordered the country's busiest U.S. diplomats for information on a report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent said that the U.S. ambassador and Turkish officials had discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept reported that the former US analyst of the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, showed that Turkey was a major area of activity for the US and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan played down the importance of the report and said that all important countries pioneered each other.
An earlier report that also had the most important intelligence service of Germany Ankara in the visor caused significantly more angry reactions by the Turkish government.
Warning strike: Lokführer threatens with consequences for Pendler
The national warning strike of the drivers on Monday evening could also affect passenger traffic in NRW.
The exodus announced for 18 to 21 hrs all transport companies throughout Germany, including long-distance, regional and S-Bahn transport,
The main thrust of the warning strike is the transport of goods.

said the district president of the German Lokomotivführer (GDL), Sven Schmitte, in Düsseldorf.
We expect significant failures.
There were no regional priorities.
The main thrust of the warning strike is the transport of goods.
The Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced that it would do everything possible to minimize the impact.
However, the GDL did not say where it wanted to strike, so it was difficult to predict the consequences in concrete terms.
Head of Police of Magaluf charged with corruption
On Friday, the prosecutors presented proof of extortion by police officers and employees of the city of Calvià to the office of Mallorca's prosecutor.
The chief of the Calvià police on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested in the infamous binge drinking hotspot Magaluf after allegations of corruption by businessmen and bar owners.
Chief Commissioner José Antonio Navarro was arrested by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most of Magaluf’s bars and nightclubs lie.
According to the Mallorca Diario online daily, the prosecutors presented on Friday proof of extortion by police officers and employees of the city of Calvià to the office of the prosecutor for anti-corruption Mallorca.
Two other local police were arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in connection with the accusations of corruption and are consulted by a judge together with Navarro.
The Spanish National Newspaper ABC reported that the angry nightclub owners said that the authorities' vet management had a serious impact on their business.
"It's not about making money anymore, it's about survival," said one of the businessmen to the court.
Leave our livelihood out of the game.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer due to a viral YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British tourist who performed on 24 men during a sauftour Fellatio.
The island authorities have since tried to stop the illegal behaviour of alcoholic holidaymakers in Magaluf by minimizing the number of participants in the infamous alcohol-drinking pub tours.
The Playhouse Club, in which the Fellacio incident took place, was forced to close for one year, while Playhouse and the pub tour organizer Carnage together have to pay a fine of €55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist resort of Magaluf, which is especially popular with young British holidaymakers, is also known for a number of accidents involving alcohol, including the trend of "balconing", where people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony to the hotel pool.
The first spring day with wet and stormy weather conditions affects flights from Adelaide Airport
The FRÜHLING gave South Australia a winter surprise, with violent showers and strong wind that affected flights from Adelaide Airport.
In the evening until 9 p.m., another 5mm of rain fell on the city, after 6.6mm, which had already fallen in the night to Sunday.
The final precipitation was the result of a series of short, stormy showers, including a caste that started shortly before 20 o'clock and caused almost 4mm of precipitation in about 10 minutes.
After last week's winter provided an early dose of spring, the temperatures in the city on Monday fell to a maximum of only 15.8°C.
The bad weather conditions probably led to the late landing of a flight from Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was expected to land shortly after 7.30 p.m., but was hit by a whirlwind - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to start.
At that time, the wind impact reached about 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport.
The flight data showed that the aircraft also had to take off on a second landing and finally set up at about 20.40 a.m.
The delay in flight resulted in the delay of some other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quanta flight from Sydney.
For Adelaide a maximum temperature of 16°C is predicted on Tuesday, with possible showers.
Matthies says: High time for great networking
In view of the galloping technical progress that threatens to turn our comfortable home into high-tech switchgears, our columnist Bernd Matthies comforts himself with an extremely familiar electronic accessory.
As I write this, my look at the spiral cable that connects the listener to the phone, and I think, "Boah, how retro is that?"
But behind it is a consideration: If the cable were not, all listeners would fly around the house in no time, and that would be much more retro.
In any case, the ekeltronic (ekeltronic?
No, tip error: electronic) sector the rule that the world news of today is the electric scrap of tomorrow, bought - obsolete.
And for example, if you still have a tube TV in the living room today, it simply says that he rejects television in principle.
Why these considerations?
Because this week the pressing of the Ifa on the radio tower again leads us our absolute incompetence in electronics questions.
The layman, who used to blindly master washing machine and CD player, does not even understand the purpose of the devices, which are spread out to him with an inconceivable eitlemous expert speech: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" the press office promises us.
Yeah, are you all right?
What are we to talk about with people who apparently voluntarily spread out such a quark?
In fact, for about 20 years, it has been a matter of having to connect our house with us.
So that the yogurt can re-order itself, so that the fire detector will tell us on the Maldives on vacation that it burns in the office.
And wouldn't it be wonderful if we from the office the air conditioning on our soon arrival ...?
Yes, this requires air conditioning.
But a dream will certainly come true soon: We lift our watch, you say according to her, "Saugen!" - and at home the vacuum cleaner will go off.
- I'm wrong.
Everything goes to nothing less than a revolution: "The boundaries between white and brown goods are floating," a industry expert is running, one can connect the washing machine with a headphone, the steam garage sends the weather report and the data glasses show how long the pizza still needs in the oven, but which is of no use because we are standing in the reservoir.
We also know from daily practice: When a new-mode device is really needed urgently, the battery is guaranteed to be empty.
Which is another reason why the spiral cable on the phone will also survive the next radio exhibitions.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from the areas near the Gaza Strip returned to the schools on Monday after spending the summer in air protection rooms, while rocket and murderer shooting went down to their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas and the schools in Gaza were closed while the area recovered from the fighting.
The start of the school brought a sense of joy and expectation to the communities drawn by rocket shooting holes in the south of Israel, but the signs of fighting are still fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, staff members of the "Pashosh" kindergarten, who were hit by a rocket, removed from the walls and sliding walls before the students arrived.
"We're a little scared, but excited," said Ronit Bart, resident in Kibbutz Saad and English teacher there.
Many children from our area urgently need to return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it felt "a bit funny" to suddenly go back to school.
"These were difficult times, and we didn't leave the house at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Until a ceasefire the war last week, thousands of residents of the border communities, such as Saad, remained in their homes or left their homes to move further away from Gaza in safer areas and escape the rocket and killer fire.
Many inhabitants of Nahal Oz, a community near the border with Gaza, in which a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian murderer grenade, still hesitate to return.
The Ministry of Education reported that about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Their children were temporarily accommodated in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanjahu attended a school in Sderot, a border town in Gaza, which is heavily drawn by the Palestinian shooting.
He appealed to the children to learn a lot and said, "We will ensure that you acquire knowledge and offer you safety."
Israel and Hamas agreed on an indefinite ceasefire last Tuesday.
The ceasefire caused an immediate end to the struggles; however, important problems remain, such as Hamas' demand for the abolition of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of the air and sea ports in Gaza.
Israel calls for the disarming of Hamas and the handing over of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the battles.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin in Egypt this month.
In the war more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, three quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children were estimated by the Palestinians and the UN.
Israel contests this information and estimates that at least half of the killers are fighters, but did not provide concrete evidence of this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4.591 rockets and murderer grenades during the fights on Israeli cities, most of them in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in the Gaza area and about 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools, which were converted into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in the shelters and struggles persist, last week the educational authorities postponed the beginning of the school year.
"I hope the school is open again soon so that we can continue to learn, as do the children in the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who currently lives in a school in Gaza City.
By election in Saxony: CDU-Vize Strobl challenges NPD ban procedures
In view of the NPD's loss of votes in Saxony, CDU-Bundesvize Thomas Strobl has spoken out to the Federal Constitutional Court for an end to the ongoing NPD ban.
Berlin - According to CDU-Bundesvize Thomas Strobl, the ongoing bans against the NPD should end before the Federal Constitutional Court.
"The NPD is cutting worse than last time," said Strobl, who is also the CDU Landesscheef in Baden-Württemberg, the "Leipzig Volkszeitung".
This is a gratifying development in the right direction and a development that makes me come to the conclusion that the NPD is fought politically rather than before the Constitutional Court.
The NPD was very close to the five-percent score when voting on Sunday.
A first attempt to ban the right-wing party failed in 2003 because of the fact that the constitutional protection had informants at the time in the NPD summit.
In December 2013, the Federal Council submitted a new request in Karlsruhe after long preparation.
The Federal Government and the Bundestag did not join.
Harburg: Tents for new refugees
Refugees are now housed in tents at New Zealand Square.
The central first recording for refugees in Harburg is out of all seams.
Now the internal authority has had three Red Cross tents set up next to it.
The district politicians were only informed shortly before - they are little enthusiastic.
"These Hauruck actions further stimulate citizens' reservations and give the district politicians no opportunity to participate constructively in the human housing of refugees," says Britta Herrmann, President of the Greens' Group at the Harburg District Assembly.
Her party demands that the Harburg District Administration currently provide unused houses for accommodation.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
The reasons for the overfill in the first readmission are the intrusion of those seeking help - and the fact that the authorities cannot provide enough places in follow-up facilities.
Many refugees therefore remain longer than the regular three months.
The house prices have experienced the strongest winter increase in seven years, shows a widely observed index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for home houses in the Australian capital rose by 1.1 percent in August, according to the RP data from Monday.
As a result of this increase, the total increase in June, July and August is 4.2 percent, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9%, more than twice as high as the increase in the 12 months to August 2013, but the increases were not evenly spread across the country.
The RP Data Research Manager, Tim Lawless, announced that Sydney and Melbourne are driving a two-part market.
The RP data figures show that house prices in Sydney rose by 16.1 percent last year, whereas in Melbourne they rose by 11.7 percent.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose by an average of five and six percent.
At the other end of the scale is Canberra, which was hit hard by the cuts in government expenditure and where prices increased by only 1.4 percent over the year.
Mr. Lawless further said that with the spring beginning, an increase in the real estate for sale would now be observed for the next few months, which would undergo the market "a real test".
"If you look at the persistently high rate of auction prices, a generally fast selling rate and the persistently low interest rate environment, it is likely that home prices will continue to rise in the next three months," he said.
In a statement to the Neue Presse, he contradicts statements by the managing director Peer Medau and attests him to pose "like a lord of the field".
This is not the style of the university, as stated in the communication.
Thus, the Medau family had already been "in the middle of June orally informed about the start of the university.
The statement that the plans were not known until July is definitely wrong," said Pötzl.
At the same time, he points out that the plans are not "precisions or even decisions", but they would be "preferences".
The need for access to the narrow road up to the castle is also less dramatic than was feared by the Medaus.
A nine-metre-wide road was and is not the talk.
It goes at current level by 5,50 meters, which is a meter wider than before," explains Pötzl.
The argument of the Medau operators that their free and schooly parking spaces will then only be used by students of the university, Pötzl does not want to apply.
There is no parking at all because, as with other public parking spaces, this can now be solved intelligently.
Remembering the Residents
According to the president of the university, the Bergwichtel children's crib, which is located on the site and would take the access to the park deck at the front of its doorstep, is "not to be affected".
Rather, he is to consider "that this is not only about the children's crib, but also about the inhabitants at the entrance to Friedrich Streib Street and the 800 students of the neighbouring real school.
It is therefore a matter of much more than the particular interests of Mr Medau," said Pötzl.
Whether the criticism of the parental advisory board of the children's crib, with the extension of the street would be justified a "the few natural spots of Coburg are lost", "can the reader decide for himself".
At the beginning of October, Pötzl, together with the Bamberg State Building Office, wants to inform the City Councils about the building development of the university by 2020 "and in this context address the importance of the new development".
Peer Medau had last week informed the parents of the baby crib about the plans of the university.
According to this, the access to the new park deck is not supposed to lead through the campus and Friedrich-Streib-Straße as before, but through the Medau-Berg.
This means that the narrow road would have to be extended to about one kilometer of length two-track.
According to the Medaus, traffic in the park of Hohenfels Castle would be tenfold.
About 2,000 vehicles a day are spoken of.
From the city side, they did not want to comment on the project.
Glandorf resigns from handball national team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old of the Bundesligist SG Flensburg-Handewitt led to health problems for this decision.
I did not like the decision easily, it has matured over several months.
It is time for me to listen to the signals of my body and finish my career in the national team," said the 2007 World Champion on his Facebook page.
He thus goes with a balance of 167 national games and 576 goals for Germany in international retirement.
Because he wants to go to the goal hunt for a few more years for the Champions-League winner from Flensburg, he is now no longer available to the new Bundestrainer Dagur Sigurdsson.
With the Icelander, who announces his cadre for the country games against Switzerland on Tuesday, Glandorf held a "long and good conversation.
His ideas and approaches have just as impressed me as they will also inspire my longtime fellow players and my successors.
But for my club, I want to be healthy in the next few years too, and longer regeneration breaks are needed, which do not allow the current double load.
After a heel infection, the left hand had to fear even his career end in 2012.
Because of Achillessen's problems, he had been treated by team doctors of the German Handball Association (DHB) with a cortisone syringe that later triggered a strong inflammation.
An emergency operation and two other interventions followed.
Then Glandorf had announced a complaint against the team doctor, the dispute ended with a comparison.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team careers do not go past any body without any trace.
I have some health sites that I can no longer ignore.
After the three infections-related foot operations, which took place in 2012 at short intervals, I never got my blood pressure properly under control.
To this end, some other wear-related complaints come.
As early as the beginning of the year, I noticed that although I can control my head, I cannot deceive my body," Glandorf explained in the interview the magazine "Handball Time".
He would only be ready for a comeback in the absolute emergency.
"When all the knits tear, I'm always ready to talk," the double family father explained to the magazine.
However, I can count the years in which I can still play handball on one hand.
I also have to say that after my long stay in the hospital in 2012, I became quite humble as far as my health is concerned.
After my career, I want to be able to go at least a bit straight.
In 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo) won the EHF Cup in addition to the 2007 World Cup title and the 2014 Champions League win.
In 2012 he also secured the European Cup of Cup winners with Flensburg.
German economy declined by 0.2 percent in spring
The crises around the globe slowed the German economy down in the second quarter.
The gross domestic product fell by 0.2 percent from April to the end of June 2014 compared to the previous quarter.
This was communicated to the Federal Statistical Office and thus confirmed preliminary calculations.
Consumers alone revived the economy in spring, while investment declined.
Foreign trade also slowed down the economy.
Thanks to the strong annual start-up, a total GDP plus of 0.8 percent for the first half of 2013 is achieved compared with the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and the goal of the "Münsterland-Mooiste", which led for the first time through the Burgmannsstadt on Sunday.
The Burgmann City of Horstmar experienced an invasion of Dutch "bicyclists" on Sunday.
The largest cycling association in the Netherlands, NTFU, organized the so-called "Münsterlande-Mooiste".
It is the largest cycling tour across Münsterland, the cycling paradise near the Netherlands.
More than 1000 participants thanked Jos ter Huerne for the organisation of this tour through Münsterland.
This tour was offered to interested people in various professional magazines.
We come from The Helder and drove overnight to participate in this tour.
We would also like to get to know Münsterland in this way," the cyclists were delighted about the route through the districts of Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After registration at the Vereinsheim of the Schützenbruderschaft Sta.
Katharina went on a little "peace trip" through the city via the Wall, where the start took place.
Further, the route, which was designed for three different categories, led towards Herrenholz over the Schöppinger mountain towards Coesfeld and via Havixbeck and Bilderbeck back to Horstmar.
On routes of 95 kilometers with 1175 metres of altitude, 120 kilometers with 1475 meters of altitude and 145 kilometers with 1775 metres of altitude, cyclists proved their good condition.
They were installed on the road in Havixbeck and Bilderbeck.
Main organizer Jos ter Huerne and mayor representative Heinz Lölfing were very pleased about the success of this cycling event.
We are satisfied and it was a nice experience for everyone involved.
The organization went without problems and there were no negative incidents," Heinz Lölfing draws a positive conclusion from this event.
Unfortunately, not as many participants came as the organizer had hoped, which was probably due to bad weather forecasts and the morning rain.
"We will see ourselves again in 2015 with hopefully nice weather on August 30 or during another weekend," the cyclists nevertheless promised to return to Münsterland and the organizers are planning a new edition.
Konstantin Alarmer's merciless honest memoirs
It is actually more philosophical testimony than biography, which has brought Konstantin Wecker, Liedermacher, Pazifist, political-secure activist, ex-häftling, to paper in "Mönch und Krieger" on 287 pages.
Not chronologically, but more thought fats for thought fats, the Munich-born on 1 June 1947 wrote down his memoirs, each chapter started by a suitable song.
And he is relentlessly honest: from the onanie as a gymnast to the shoplifting and drug use, he does not leave out any human weakness.
Also to show how he himself learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings.
Wide space also includes abstract, but all the more important terms: love, soul, ego, being in the present, spirituality - all of this he tries to go to the ground in a very philosophical, but also very personal way.
And he also explains his pacifism, his critique of society, his political commitment - and also how he not only influenced the music (the operal lover became a soul and rock musician), but also his stay in prison.
The latter also brought the Lebemann Konstantin Wecker closer to the ascetic monk, who arises "by subtraction", as he says, "by leaving everything unnecessary".
But there are also short anecdotes to the earth between all the highly spiritual views: for example, about battling in a site frequented by GI or a crazy drive, where he frontalized a tree.
There too he is relentlessly honest.
Lenny Henry: My father never took me in the arm.
I never said "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children of a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and her relationship was limited.
Henry is testing for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and was created from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mixture of Reggae and Rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He visited "many" therapies after his mother died, and Henry is thoughtful of his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
One never saw his face, only heard his voice: "Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to see Cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who were already grown up when I was a child - went to the pub with him and talked about things like the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket beat.
I never had such a conversation with him.
Most of my life, he was this serious guy in the corner that read the paper.
Recently Henry opened a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than at the time of his father, he gained an insight into how life might have been for him.
It's slightly brighter now, but they're dark, smoked, deep rising labyrinths with flames and smoke and lots of soot.
My father used to just put himself in the tub and then you could hear him slowly singing because he could wash the foundry of himself.
As I walked around there, I realized that he had done this for years to bring the food to the table, and my respect for him grew bigger.
Nevertheless, Henry grew up as a child without his parents ’ expressions of love.
My father never hugged me, he never said "I love you."
It wasn't until my mother went bad toward the end of her life that we started saying, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he was able to share the love he had missed as a child.
Could you stop that "I love you"?
Stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
with Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
It is still friends of French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's mother was a diabetic.
This contributed to her death.
So when I became very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You must be radical.
So I went through this fitness and also had to make a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's strenuous.
No one likes to eat carrots.
Henry's career change may be reflected in his elegant, short-cut beard.
Since he was praised by the critics for his otello, he has been captured by the theatre.
It followed the comedy of the errors, and then Fences of August Wilson.
This is a different experience from the sitcoms and comedies that have filled out their busy working life.
He started at only 16 years of age when he worked in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on stage when he imitated people and wrote to New Faces about him.
His television career began in the mid-70s. "I was the only black imitator/comedian on television for quite a long time."
He learned in the profession.
Not only did I have to grow up in front of the public, but I also learned from 1975 to 1985 how I could become an efficient joke-telling machine while watching television as a star, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
Since his manager owned the stage right at the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program in which the people "blackly painted", Henry performed his comedy there for over five years.
It was very unpleasant for my family.
I kind of wish it never happened, but I don't regret that I did.
It was a strange, unpleasant position for me, but I worked on huge projects and learned how to deal with a big audience.
But this "years of award-winning light pillar of British television" was also a "grandish parody of black people."
In the 1980s, Henry worked on an alternative comedy circle through the introduction of figures that both mocked and celebrated the British black culture.
The first series of the Lenny Henry Show went on show in 1984, and in the nineties he was known among other things as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!.
Advertising, documentary films, TV series and film roles shaped his next decade, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv 2008 he thought: "What are you doing next, Len, because it feels like you're just bringing time around or taking a little on the spot."
Then came a documentary series for Radio 4 entitled What's So Great About ...?
The first episode revolved around Shakespeare.
On Shakespeare I was really allergic.
I had never really learned anything about him at school and thought him mainly for a domain of middle class, white in tights and a head in front of him.
So I was very afraid of it.
All we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said, "You should try it.
Don't hurt it if you don't know what you're talking about.
Take a few of the words in the mouth, and then you'll understand why we love all Shakespeare so much.
Henry introduced 20 lines from Otello's last speech for the documentary and he was enthusiastic.
I felt like I could do this.
It was almost like someone finally put my head right.
"That's what it's all about, it's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your text, research a little.
The samples were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we did it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car accident, and that just didn't happen.
And soon he appeared in the comedy of error.
Suddenly I was at the National Theatre and I could hardly believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you changed."
There was a technical mistake and Henry instinctively felt that he had to entertain the audience.
"A little voice told me, "You have to bridge for 10 minutes while they repair the computer."
Instead, the stage manager announced that the idea continued as soon as the problem was solved.
I left the stage and said something inside of me, "Oh, thank God."
I'm not responsible for that.
I can leave this to someone else.
"You play in a play, so stay in your role."
Henry in Fences on the Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for Fences was challenging.
Panic is very good, which strengthens tendons.
This was also a good thing, so it's like a big sign of the gods telling me "This is your destiny."
He says this, of course, with a DONNERNING voice.
So I'll stay with you.
I really love that.
I love being in a sample room.
But Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation is through humorous outbreaks, while he imitates people over and over again.
I have decided not to make a stand-up comedy because I think that this kind of instant satisfaction from a hall full of strangers is somehow dangerous.
If you always look for it, you drive it in front of a wall.
I sometimes perform live in Apollo, if I like it, but in total, I don't have as much as I used to.
I'm asking him if he'll ever make a stand-up comedy tour again.
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps to form a beginning, a middle part and the end of a trip - I don't think I want to give up.
So this is his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like to be an actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and that's great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Huthi rebels block streets in Yemen capital
In the conflict between Shiite Huthi rebels and Yemeni government, the Huthiss have called for civil disobedience in the capital city of Sanaa.
Huthi supporters had occupied central streets in Sanaa on Monday, said a spokesman of the Huthi Party "Ansar Allah".
Access to Parliament has also been blocked.
Yemeni media report a traffic chaos in the capital.
According to the online edition of the newspaper "Yemen Post", Huthi leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi called on the measures on Sunday evening.
Huthi, according to the leaf, threatened with a further escalation of the conflict, should not be met his demands.
The Shiite Huthis fight for greater independence from the Sunni ruling Yemen and demand the resignation of the government.
The people of Huthi have been besieging the Yemeni capital for almost two weeks.
Around 30,000 rebels have set up protest camps on the major access roads of Sanaa.
In the surrounding area, bloody struggles with the Yemeni army are repeated.
Kenya registers officials to limit "spirit workers"
Kenya has begun to register all state officials biometrically to remove "spirit workers" from the government's paylists.
Employees who did not register in the next two weeks would no longer be paid a government notice.
The government suspects that thousands of people still receive salary payments even after their departure from the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to fight corruption in the public service when he took office in 2013.
In an examination at the beginning of this year, it was found that at least $1 million ($700,000) per month of payments for "spirit workers" and other abusive financial practices were lost.
The government suspects that salaries will continue to be paid on accounts after a person has died or leaves the public service, reports Wanyama Chebusiri for the BBC from the capital Nairobi.
All officials must now appear at identification centres over the next two weeks in order to ensure that their data on biometric registrations are recorded, has been reported in a government message.
All those who would not do so without a credible apologies were removed from the salary list, the communication continued.
"This approach contributes significantly to the rationalisation of the public service by establishing the actual number of officials and also correcting the salary list at both levels of government - the "spirit workers" are eliminated," said Anne Waiguru, the Cabinet Secretary at the Ministry of Decentralisation and Planning.
The scandal for the art consultant Helge Achenbach will be brought to trial for the first time on 11 November.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, son of the Aldi founder Theo Albrecht, claim 19.4 million euros in a civil trial at the Düsseldorf Landgericht in Achenbach and two of his companies in insolvency proceedings.
This was reported by a court official on Monday.
In the notice of appeal it is said that Achenbach had cheated on the purchase of works of art and of old time, and that Berthold Albrecht calculated higher than actual purchase prices.
As a result, the agreed commission was also higher.
Achenbach bought valuables for Albrecht for 121 million euros.
Children need roots and wings
He was 44 years old in school, of which 23 was head of school.
From this time on, Manfred Richter knows many of Petershausen's and Kollbacher's students.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always borne by his quest to see the people in the student.
The snowheads are the most famous mountain in the Giant Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motif from his homeland.
Richter was born 1930 in Trautenau/Nordböhmen, today Trutnov.
At the age of 14, he was already interested in the teacher's profession after four years of high school.
A year later, the Sudeten Germans were expropriated.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave her house.
After a few months in a camp, it went to Bavaria in 1946 - in the freight wagon.
So it swindled Richter into the Upper Franconian Sankendorf.
Teacher education took place in Bamberg.
Manfred Richter had to walk ten kilometers to the next station six times a week, take the train to Bamberg, go there three kilometers across the city to school and back in the evening.
After two months Manfred Richter got a sleeping accommodation in a Red Cross home in Bamberg: together with up to 15 students in a dormitory room.
In 1951 he made the first and after three years of teaching candidates the second state examination.
Since Oberfranken had no free teaching post for him, he applied for Oberbayern and came to the school in Kollbach on 1 November 1954.
The "woman's room" was his first "service apartment" in the schoolhouse.
In 1958, he moved into a three-room apartment in the newly built teacher's house next to the school.
This house bought Manfred Richter in 1980 after the school had been dissolved in Kollbach in 1968.
Until then, there were three classes in Kollbach in the school association Petershausen-Kollbach and five in Petershausen.
From 1968/69 they were grouped in Petershausen in today's town hall.
When the Indersdorf School Association was founded, only the primary school remained in the village.
In order to avoid a reclassification in the now smaller school, the then rector Georg Sigl moved to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
But Petershausen grew, and as of September 1982, the children and their teachers were able to take on today’s construction, which was extended in 1997 after Richter’s retirement.
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor Ludwig Götz, who had a workroom built at municipal costs and in the extension of 1997 cellar rooms, although this was not eligible under the guidelines for school buildings.
"Bürgermeister Götz was very school-friendly," Richter remembered gratefully.
In all his career, Manfred Richter never forgot the contribution of a government representative who had replied to a speech by a school council on justice and justice: "You must never forget love." Manfred Richter implemented what he had heard there as a young teacher.
"You have to give the children two things: roots and wings," says the 84-year-old today.
And he had to learn, "It doesn't always work." Whether he means only his students or just his own six children, it's not quite clear.
In any case, Richter's doing was sometimes unconventional.
When students beat themselves, they did not get some criminal work from him, nor were they condemned to sit down.
At the expense of the community, judges had had two pairs of boxing gloves purchased and had the two opponents against each other, even though there should be a auction.
For the benefit of the school, as a rector, judges had a good relationship with the then mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).
After his retirement, he moved the partyless judge to register for the municipal council at least in 1996 as the last person on the CSU list.
But judges were selected six and joined the CSU.
180 kilometers in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 cyclists insert intermediate stops in the spa park of Bad Salzhausen and Schotten
If cyclists make a stop on their tour in Bad Salzhausen or Schotten, that's nothing special in itself.
On Friday, however, the only impression was the number of the rest: the 700 participants of the hr4 cycling tour and the accompanying team enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of Bad Salzhausen and later a party under the open sky in the Alteburgpark.
Under the motto "Rads and Celebrate on Newly Discovered Ways Between Nidda and Kinzig", the participants met in Bad Vilbel on Thursday and experienced a concert by Van Baker & Band.
On Friday it became serious: the cyclists took the first stage, the 60 kilometers over Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and further to Schotten.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes were welcomed by Mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who had started cycling in Bad Vilbel, and the head of the Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing-Döring, company-owned company.
To refresh the body and mind, all kinds of good things had been prepared: the country women from Ranstadt and Nieder-Mockstadt had baked 85 sheets of apple, tweezers, scatters and cheese cakes that made wonderful mouths of the skilled cyclists.
"Such cakes can only bake landwives," praised a participant from Aulendiebach, while ordering another piece.
Cold refreshments could be obtained at the water level of the Geiß-Nidda gym.
The "Duo Bravo" entertained the visitors with well-known melodies from operettas and musicals and reaped enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful ambience of the park seemed relaxing.
A gentleman also enjoyed a head massage from his partner: "He deserved it, after all, he has already fixed down the bike chains today."
At the time, the mayor and the manager still had to work: they were interviewed at the well in front of the drinking spa by reporter Rainer Janke and took advantage of the opportunity to advertise on the radio for Bad Salzhausen.
Promotional director Tobias Hagen, since the first hr4 cycle tour in 2004 as a tour leader, was also able to eat only a short time, but he had plenty to do with the technology on site.
His pickup truck, in which he communicated, wrote Facebook entries and made reports via three phones and a radio with his employees and the 15-member motorcycle squad of the police in Hesse, also needed a check.
"Most of the participants come from the Rhine-Main area," he said, "but also from Gießen or Fulda, from Lauterbach or Taunus and even from numerous cities in Westphalia, cyclists have arrived.
The number of participants depends on the available accommodation capacities.
In Category I, participants are accommodated in hotels, in Category II in collective accommodation.
From the spa, the cyclists had a good impression when they left after an hour and a half again: "Bye!"
"It was nice in Bad Salzhausen!" they waved for farewell.
After arriving in Schotten, the group was allowed to take a short break.
But in the evening the cyclists were required in the idyllic Alteburgpark.
Under the direction of the Schottner Society for Tourism and City Marketing (GTS), the park had received a beautiful festive atmosphere and of course it had prepared treats, such as flame cakes with well-cooled spring white.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS Managing Director Markus Hoßfeld and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs welcomed the visitors in his capacity as Board member of ADAC Hesse-Thüringen.
The three clearly welcomed the "many operations in Schotten".
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance stage.
The opportunity to move under the open sky was eagerly used despite the sporty activity on the bicycle.
Among the guests were increasingly mixed citizens who were as excited about the good mood as the great crowd of cyclists.
On the second day, the stations Birstein, Wächtersbach and Bad Orb - including a concert with the Trenkwalders - were on the program.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometers of cycling, the athletes arrived again in Bad Vilbel.
dozens of Turkish police arrested for "conspiracy" against the government
A total of 33 police were arrested in Turkey because of the suspicion of "conspiracy against the government", reports local media agencies.
The police authorities did not comment immediately.
Among the arrested are 14 high-ranking police, reports Hurriyet Daily News.
Some of them were involved in the corruption investigations against government staff, including four government ministers last December.
In July, a number of Turkish police officers were arrested for supposed to have founded an organized criminal association and tapped telephone numbers.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was then Prime Minister) described her approach as part of the activities led by the Islamic clergyman Fethulla Güllen against him and other persons in positions of power.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (1 September) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenij Jazenjuk brought his daughter to school.
There he told waiting journalists that not all schools had been reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in every school.
Heaven is not all over Ukraine peaceful.
We must fight for a peaceful sky.
The whole Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian people's front must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Papukhow, head of the school in Slavyansk, who visits Jazenjuk's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be restored here and that the children will receive an education that will be useful to them in future life.
The first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with the children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons in their hands and giving flowers to their teachers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director she needs.
She arrives with a proud glory drag from the banking world, media management and the inner circle of the Tory party.
And she has her own front experience.
Her career began with Bain and Co., a global management consulting company, where she moved to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearsons.
She served as Chairman of the Financial Times for seven years and resigned when the head office of the parent company Pearsons went to a younger male colleague.
Their settlement was supposed to be almost $1 million.
Their political ranking is also solid.
She was recommended to David Cameron of Lord Browne, the former chairman of BP, when he sought more private knowledge in Whitehall: she became a consultant to the cabinet.
Her husband is a former Tory councillor.
As early as May, I described the job of the chairman with a poisoned cup.
Not only does the BBC stand as a huge and complex unit in the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Trust works in two directions: inwardly on the first guard of the own management hierarchy in the BBC, but also outwardly as a voice of public concern and unrest when things are going wrong.
This ensures an almost unsustainable Duopol, which calls for a complete comprehensive reform.
But what new incoming chairman would risk entering into everything and taking apart an institution as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while perhaps putting himself around his job.
It's a difficult task.
And as if that were not enough, many are still interested in seeing the BBC reduced - power, money and status overtaken.
While competition is moving closer and new technologies threaten old, convenient security, the forthcoming negotiation of license fees for the BBC is associated with special risks.
For the modest sum of £ 145.50 a year, the British public is buying into the world's largest media company.
The BBC tells a good story: it says it reaches 96 percent of all households and costs each of them only 40 Pence a day.
And apparently the BBC is going up on the popularity scale again: 53 percent support today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
The vision and usage habits for the BBC have changed: I am getting news headlines on my phone these days and see missing programs later on my iPlayer.
But it remains a very beloved and remarkable institution.
She needs a remarkable chairman - I hope she found him.
Perry from Texas says that lowering Tweet was not authorized
A tweet from the official user account of the Republican governor of Texas, Rick Perry, on Sunday, contained a dwindling remark about the democratic district attorney, who is at the heart of a criminal charge against him for abuse of the official force.
The Tweet was later deleted and replaced by another by Perry's user account, which disapproves of the previous one.
A tweet has just been sent out from my account, which was not authorized by me.
"I don't approve of the Tweet and have deleted it," said it in the later message.
Perry's staff did not respond immediately to requests for comments.
Although the Tweets of Perry's official user account went out, it was not clear who actually served the feed.
In the earlier Tweet, an unfavorable picture of the district attorney of Travis County, Rosemary Lehmberg, was drawn, which was sentenced in April 2013 for drunkenness at the tax.
Perry filed a veto against the financial support of her office when she refused to step back, which led to a charge against Perry - who could possibly be a presidential candidate in 2016 - before a Grand Jury this month in Austin.
The text of the Tweet reads: "I don't always go drunk with the three-fold permitted alcohol level ... but when I do, I accuse Governor Perry when he's looting it."
I'm the most drunkard democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not entrusted with the management of the investigation of the Grand Jury against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a special state attorney from San Antonio, who was selected by a Republican judge.
Perry pleads for not guilty and called the charge a political trick.
His high-class team of legal assistants asked the judge responsible for the case to reject the charges and argued that the law, which is being used against the most elderly governor in the history of Texas, is unconstitutional diffuse.
Perry stopped $7.5 million of state funds at the State Public Integrity Unit - which is located in Travis County and in cases of state corruption in Texas - when Lehmberg refused to resign.
This Veto caused a public complaint on the part of a left-wing watchdog group.
Perry's official user account is often updated - and sometimes famous.
After completing his fifth position at the elections in Iowa during his presidential election in 2012, Perry responded to speculations that he would stop by posting a tweet of a photo of himself while jogging near a lake, with the words "South Carolina, we are coming!"
Berkeley declared housing market "normal"
One of London's most prominent construction contractors pointed out that the housing market in South-East England was "returned" to normal level.
Homes in the capital were hotly sought and subject to enormous price increases, which moved the Bank of England, because of the widespread fear of a credit bubble, to set upper limits on mortgage loans in June.
Tony Pidginy, founder and CEO of the high-class construction company Berkeley, said on Monday: "Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since peak 2013" and added that this offers a "stable environment for action".
The real estate market in London was well established during the downturn, as foreign buyers pushed into the capital.
According to information provided by the Katasteramt, prices in the city area alone increased by 18.5 percent last year, much more than the average increase in England and Wales as a whole.
The average sales prices at Berkeley's private, inexpensive and student offers rose by about one fifth last year and reached £423,000 at the end of April.
However, a stronger pound has made real estate in London less attractive to foreign buyers in recent months - some of them have also been deterred by the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric for a possible "valley tax" before the general elections in May.
The London real estate agent Foxtons warned last week that the mortgage market report for April, in which tighter lending arrangements were presented, would also lead to lower market growth in both real estate sales and prices in the second half of the year.
New data from the bank of England from Monday show a decline in mortgage approval in July, which also indicates that the real estate market is cooling down.
Hamtions International, another real estate agency, corrected its forecast for the increase in real estate prices in London for 2015 down to 3 percent, on the basis of a already weakening domestic price awareness.
The volume of transactions in the most expensive areas of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, has now declined by a quarter a year, according to the broker WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, the desire for a home in the capital for Berkeley is a blessing, as the amounts due for time sales amount to more than £2.2 billion.
Mr. Pidginy added: "The demand for the right, well-planned product at the best locations remained stable and, as a result, the time sales remained stable."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year until the end of April - almost a third more than the peak in 2007 before the crisis.
Annual pre-tax earnings rose by 40 percent to £ 280 million each year, sales by 18 percent to £1.6 billion.
In a communication on Monday before the company's annual meeting, Mr. Pidginy said that Berkeley's revenue is expected to be in line with current market expectations this year.
Analysts estimate the annual pre-tax profit to £ 450 million.
Berkeley shares were fixed in London's trade in the afternoon at £23.96.
nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence published by hacker on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence appearance at the 85th Oscar Award.
Naked photos of Oscar prize winner Jennifer Lawrence were published online by a hacker who claimed to have a "master list" of images of another 100 starlets.
A representative of the star from "The Tribute of Panem" confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were real and accused the hacker of "eclatant violation of privacy".
The authorities have been informed and will track all those who post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos originally posted on the photo sharing page 4chan were supposedly obtained by a gap in the online storage system iCloud of Apple. The alleged "master list" of hacking victims includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary Kate Olsen, reported BuzzFeed.
It is not certain how many of the pictures are real, although Winstead, star from "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" also condemned the hack on Twitter.
"To those of you who look at photos that my husband and I took years ago in the private environment of our house - I hope you are so happy with you," wrote Winstead on Twitter.
Victoria Justice from the Nickolodeon series "iCarly" and "Victorious" however objected that the photos were images of her and tweeted "These so-called nude images of me are FEELING, people.
Let's start with the beginnings. * Wordplay intended*.
Buzzfeed reported on late Sunday that a spokesman of the Popstar Ariana Grande disapproves of the authenticity of the alleged photographs from her.
Exclusive extract from Howard Jacobson's highly praised new novel about love and the letter "J".
They melted, so one could best describe it, they slowly disintegrated like a cardboard that was left in the rain.
Sometimes a woman told him that he was too serious, strenuous, intense, dissociated, and perhaps a little scratchy.
And then shook his hand.
He knew scratches.
He was astounded, as in hedgehog, yes.
The last victim of this staunchness was a just beginning affair, which had been more promising for a relief of the lonely boredom of his life than ever, and might even have brought him a certain satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a tremblingly delicate beauty with untamed hair and a flattering heart from a village on the northern island, which was even more remote and rough than port Reuben.
She had come to the south with an older companion who thought Kevern was her aunt and who had inherited a plot in a damp but paradise valley called Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for several years.
The pipes were leaks, in the bathrooms were still spiders, naked screws had left their traces on all windows and believed that they heard all of this, and the garden was overgrown with weeds that looked like huge heads of coal.
It was like the house from a children's fairy tale, both threatening and seductive, a garden full of secrets.
Author's portrait: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the Longlist for the Man Booker Award 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern had sat on the broken deck chairs in the high grass with Ailinn and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon. Both had sounded mentally into the console, which provided the country with soothing music and soothing news, when the sight of their crossed brown legs reminded him of an old song of a long forgotten black entertainer, whom his father had liked to listen to in closed roller shops in the house.
Your feet are too big.
Due to their own aggressiveness, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Not forbidden - nothing was so properly forbidden - just not played.
It has been successfully overshadowed, just as the word is obsolating.
The general taste created what decrees and regulations would never have done, and how the people in books choose the From platewasher-to-millionaire-memoires, cookbooks and love novels, so they chose the ballads in the music.
In the euphoria of the day, Kevern began playing an imaginary piano and singing in a gross-compassionate serenade of Ailinn's great feet.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"That was a well-known song by a jazz pianist named Fats Waller," he explained to her and automatically put two fingers on his lips.
His father had always done this to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It had begun as a game between him and his father when he was little.
His father had played it with his own father, so he had told him.
If you start a word with a J without putting two fingers over your lips, it'll cost you a penny.
It had not been a very funny game at the time, and it was not very funny now.
He knew that this was expected of him, that was all.
It had to explain what Jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard of any.
Jazz was not played, even though he was not directly forbidden.
The improvisation was no longer modern.
It was only space for a single "if" in life.
At the beginning of a melody, people wanted to be quite sure where they would end.
The same is true of the mind.
Its unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was musically expressed in mind.
Although he was 10 years old without hearing about Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about jazz from his father's half-secret collection of old CDs.
But at least he didn't have to explain to Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
At her age, she probably could not remember a time when pop singers were not black.
Again, no laws or constraints.
A compliant society meant that every element of this society gratefully agreed to the principle of group talent - grateful as those spared from fate.
People of Afro-Caribbean origin were suitable for entertainment and sports through temperament and physique, so they sang and ran.
People who originally came from the Indian subcontinent were, like nature, blessed with electronic talent and were entrusted with the task of ensuring that no family remained without a functioning service telephone.
What was left of the Polish community took care of the canalization; what was left of the Greeks destroyed plates.
Those from the Gulf States and the Levant whose grandparents had not left the country quickly as WATER, IF IT WAS GASED WATER - for fear of being accused of fires, for fear even that the flames would consume them next - had opened Labneh and Shisha pipe restaurants, kept themselves in mind and became depressed with the inactivity.
Everyone according to his abilities.
Since she had only heard ballads, it was difficult for Ailinn to understand how the insulting words that Kevern had just spoken to her could ever be displayed.
Music was an expression of love.
"They're not really insulting," said Kevern.
Except maybe for people whose feet are too large.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved this song.
He spoke too much, but the neglected garden gave him the deceitful sense of security.
Nothing could overcome the sound insulation of the huge carbon-like leaves.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why should your father have loved such a thing?
He wanted to say that it was a jux, but he hesitated to put two fingers back on her lips in her presence.
She thought he was something strange anyway.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She shook infidelity her head and blocked Kevern's sight.
There was nothing else to see all over the world but her unmistakable raven black hair.
There was nothing he would have wanted to see.
"If you say so," they say without any conviction.
But that doesn't explain why you sing it to me.
She seemed honestly concerned.
Are my feet too big?
He looked back once more.
Your feet aren't that direct.
Maybe your ankles, a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
Hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
That's just the stupid song.
He could have said "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"Your thick ankles are exactly the reason why you fell for me," he tried instead.
I'm a little perverted.
That didn't sound right.
It was supposed to be funny.
When he tried to be funny, he often found himself in trouble because, like his father, he did not have the soothing charm needed to tame the cruelty inherent in jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he wanted to be, Kevern.
Despite his kind eyes.
Ailinn Solomons became red and rose out of her chair, threw the console around and poured out the wine they had drunk.
Holunder flower wine, so drunkenness was no excuse for him.
In her excitement she seemed to tremble, like palm pedigree in the storm.
"And your thick head is exactly why I feel drawn to you pervert," she said.
Except that I'm not at all.
She was sorry for both the unnecessary unkindness of his words and the fear shown in her eyes when she rebelled against him.
Did she think he'd beat her?
She had not told him about life on the cold northern archipelago where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially like here.
The same huge and ice-cold ocean broke here like there on the shore.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and more despicable according to DEM WAS GETHERED TRUE when their ancestors as smugglers and beach robbers were, moved from pub to pub, always ready to raise their hands against a woman who refused or laughed against them.
Dickkopf?
They would have shown her a fat fist if she didn't watch!
They just cut - butts were the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, a counter-toxic to the unspeaking love ballads from the console - they first cut them and then beat them.
In Kevern’s view, this was unnecessary refinement, since the knut itself was already an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign to go through her body.
He rose from the deck chair like an old man.
She also felt bleached, but the wave of his grief surprised her.
That wasn't the end of the world.
They hardly knew each other.
She watched him remove himself - just as a room on the upper floor her companion was watching him - from a man who complained by something he himself had conjured up.
Adam left the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, although some had raised their hands against her.
A man turned away from her, bowed his back, ashamed, defeated, without fighting spirit - why was this a sight that she seemed to know well, if she could not remember one time when she had seen something like that before today?
When she was alone again, Ailinn Solomons looked at her feet.
Several years before the events just told, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative monitoring body for the public mood, worked on a short lecture on the continued violence at a low and medium level in exactly the parts of the country where their reduction, if not abolition, would be most likely, given the money and energy invested in the eradication of this violence.
"It has already been done a lot, and much still has to be done," she wrote, "to conjure up the innate aggressiveness of a people that has waged a thousand wars and won most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country in which the sweet breath of human kindness has been seen historically despite the high-inquiring church towers between the hedges.
But some qualities are proving to be inexhaustible.
The higher the church tower, it seems, the lower the passion he continues to awaken.
The people cry in the hearing of sentimental ballads, intoxicate themselves with stories of overcome difficulties, and claim to believe firmly in the virtues of marriage and family life, but not only does the former roughness keep rural communities in hand as well as our urban structures, but there is also evidence for the emergence of a new and hideous struggle at home, at the workplace, on the streets and even on the playgrounds.
"They have an unhappy tendency to exaggerate," said their mentor when he read the whole report.
I suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum lowered her head.
I have to ask, are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to say that," Esme Nussbaum replied.
Are you a lesbian?
Again, Esme called on her right to privacy and refused the statement.
Feministin?
Shut up again.
"I don't ask that," said Luther Rabinowitz, "because I would be against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
This is a prejudicial job.
We serve a prejudicial society.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which in themselves are absolutely acceptable and commendable, may occasionally distort results as you have presented them.
They themselves obviously have prejudices against the Church, and these things that you call "behind" and "raw" could be interpreted by others as just as well as an expression of natural strength and vitality.
If you continue on the road, WHAT IS FAITHED, WHO IT IS, as if, if it had happened yesterday, it means taking its essential life force to the country.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, an LED lettering in Flamingorosa repeated the advice given by Ofnow to the country in the last quarter of the century or more.
Smile at their neighbors, appreciate their partner, listen to ballads, visit musicals, use their phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, the sung word is better than the written, but nothing is better than love.
"I understand absolutely what you want to do," Esme Nussbaum replied with a calm voice when she was sure that her superior had finished speaking," and I say nothing but that we have not yet been healed as effectively as we imagine ourselves.
My concern is that without warning we may be able to find ourselves in the way we repeat the mistakes that were only the only ones that led to THE WHITE, IF IT IS FAMILY.
This time, however, it is not the others we are letting go of our anger and our distrust.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands.
To suggest an angel's virtue.
"They're going too far," he said, "if you call actions " error" that our grandparents may or may not have committed.
They go too far, too, if you're talking about the fact that these would have left out their "wort" and their "mistrust" to "others".
It should not be necessary to remind someone in your position that we are talking about understanding the past as we are protecting the present, not about "us" and "others".
There was no "we" and there was no "other".
It was a time of disorder, that's all we know.
"The one who, if we are honest with ourselves," Esme dared to throw, "can not claim to have behaved well.
I'm not suing anyone.
Whether it was done bad or good, what happened has happened.
That was then.
Nothing needs to be said about this - there we are agreed.
And just as no debt has to be allocated, no debt has to be repaid if such a eradication is appropriate and if there is a way to eliminate it.
But to what does the past serve if we do not learn from it -
The past serves to make us forget them.
If I can say anything about it -
Luther Rabinowitz brought his pyramid together.
"I will remember her report," he said and released them.
The next day, when she went to work as usual, she was overrun by a motorcycle driver who, as passersby described, was driving on the foot in a kind of "brutal rage".
There are coincidences.
Lesotho Military Member says that no coup is planned; Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Official military representatives in Lesotho disputed to have planned a coup to the overthrow of the government and said that they were fighting police officers who were accused of arming political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Tabane fled the country and announced that the army of the country had surrounded its seat and occupied government buildings in Maseru capital.
The premiere brought his family to adjacent South Africa after he had reported threats of attack.
Military spokesperson Major Ntlele Ntoi said that there was no coup de facto, but the military reacted to the threat of "political fanatics", whose armed forces were in the process of being armed by the police.
"What happened this morning was that the staff of the defense forces of Lesotho acted after he had received several intelligence reports that within the police were acting some elements that actually wanted to arm some of the political, party-political young fanatics who were about to do devastating damage," he said to Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said that the military action had made the impression of a revolution.
"Even if no one has claimed to have torn the government by force, all reports agree that the activities of Lesotho's defense forces have so far shown signs of a coup," he said.
Speaker of the military of Lesotho announced on Sunday that the soldiers were going back to their barracks and the location in the capital was quiet.
In the meantime, Vice Prime Minister Mothetjoya Metsing takes over the leadership during Tabane's absence.
Tabane announced that he believed that he had become a target because of his attempt to fight corruption in the country.
In Lesotho, there have been great tensions since June after Tabane suspended parliament meetings due to the conflicts in his unity government.
He said that his actions had not undermined the government, otherwise loud accusations in spite of it.
Production in the eurozone on a 13-month low
The increase in Eurozone production slowed down in August to the lowest point in the last 13 months, according to a closely observed study.
The final market purchasing manager index of the manufacturing industry (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, after a state of 51.8 in July.
A figure above 50 indicates an expansion.
New orders went down and factories experienced collapses in a time of rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures will be received before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
Markets expect the Bank to have a clear plan for dealing with a slow recovery of the euro area and for the threat of deflation at an inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There are speculations that the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could provide further information this week on whether he is considering a quantitative relief for the euro area, in line with those made by the United Kingdom and the US during the financial crisis.
"Although little growth is better than no growth at all, the repressive effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties have become clearer for manufacturers," said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.
The factory PMI for Germany, the largest trading partner of Russia in the EU, fell to the lowest level in 11 months at 51.4.
In the meantime, the second largest economic nation in the block, France, of PMI fell to 46.9.
France remains a child of concern, as is the descent of Italy from a solid expansion to stagnation.
Note that growth incentives in the key industrial mechanism are no longer effective in Germany, Spain and the Netherlands, nor are they reassuring," said Mr Dobson.
The decline in industry is likely to fuel the fire of analysts who expect further monetary or fiscal incentives.
A positive news came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economic expert at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing you can say for the purchasing manager's index of the eurozone's manufacturing industry from August is that the sector continues to grow after that."
He added: "Producers in the eurozone are obviously quite difficult to live at the moment, as the current increased geopolitical tensions - especially in relation to Russia and Ukraine - increase uncertainty in the still difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular, and consumer confidence - and are likely to lead to some orders being delayed or even cancelled, in particular large orders.
He said that it would be "ever more likely" that the ECB would finally have to introduce a type of QE, "although we suspect that this will be limited."
The Hell Year of Beslan's Survivors: Ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school, as the children who are trapped in it still suffer today.
Ten years ago, over 1,000 people from Chechen militias were taken hostages in a school in Beslan, southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day martyrdom that shocked the world.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death at the atrocities in the classroom.
Exactly a decade after the terrible siege of the Beslan School, where 334 people perished, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned of a new apocalypse in Ukraine last night.
As fanatic Islamic terrorists captured and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, the beginning of a new school year, it seemed like the evilst of evil.
The tragedy united west and east into aversion, and then surprisingly turned into action and hope for the future in the middle of the worst misery.
Ten years later we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death at the atrocities in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, although the memory of this terrorist hell will persecute it forever.
Your greatest hope?
That the war that now punishes Ukraine - and in which children die as they die - now finds an end.
The girl who was photographed trying to get back to the destroyed school sports hall
She was photographed and famous by the Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakov when she only tried in her underwear to climb back to the destroyed school sports hall after a mine had exploded.
Aida was completely confused looking for her mother Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were considered dead, but they survived.
"A woman told me to run around my life, but I couldn't," said Aida.
My legs were flooded with blood.
I got up and climbed back in to look for my mother.
A soldier put her in safety.
After a number of operations, she thought she was completely healed, but said yesterday: "Third months ago, the pain returned.
I'm afraid I need to get operated again.
Some pomegranates are still in my knees.
Her goal now is to become a dentist to help people how she was helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it didn't break me," she said.
"That happened to me, and you can't change that.
Once a year I always go to the gym to remind me of those who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were little and dreamed of going to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish my studies and start my career.
I think of a family later.
She says that the siege will always remain a part of it, although the memory becomes somewhat weaker every year.
I am glad that many people around the world still remember our horrors and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in Great Britain and everywhere.
When I see the photo of myself online, as I climb back to school, I think that many people see it for the first time, understand our catastrophe and contribute to the fact that something like that doesn't happen again.
The boy who fled through the ball hail, in the opinion that his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (Russians going to school at the age of 7 years) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother Tamara.
As a seven-year-old, he said, "Mama told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand."
After an explosion, he thought she was going to die.
She said to him, "Run."
Afraid that she could be dead, he fled and saw a crying grandchild on the way, grasping it by the hand and fleeing through a ball.
His father Vladimir, who locked his son in the arms outside, said, "Damir told me his mother died.
He said, "I could not save them."
In reality, Tamara was tripped outside and injured with leg injuries in the hospital, assuming that her son had died.
After her unification, she said, "I cried for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later flown to London (by the now dissolved newspaper News of the World) to receive the title of a Barnardo's Children's Champion by then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror follows you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering," he said yesterday.
But I can say it's getting paleer in my memory.
I remember throwing away all my toy guns right after that.
But now I can play computer games with shooting scenes and that's no problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to the gym, but I'm not thinking about myself.
I remember these kids I played in the yard with and they didn't make it out.
We never say they were killed or dead.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember very well my trip to London, especially the toy store, where I could choose everything I wanted, and the ride in an open up car.
But now he is afraid of place like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of disaster he and his friends suffered.
This horror follows you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I am so sorry for all those who suffer from the horrors," said Damir, who last week worked as a volunteer in a monastery.
I'd like to help.
I want to go to the police one day and hope they'll take me to the training academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said, "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine that?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were simply no children who could call and walk around, and this silence lasted many months.
She vividly remembers her trip to London with Damir.
The people in London cried when I told our story.
At that time I understood how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the prize and the opportunity to travel to London in autumn 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her that 10 years have passed, but I still remember the meeting with her and her husband in London, and how Damir and I helped.
I remember how Damir wanted to eat Borschsch and they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with waiters in a restaurant. Damir shot at her with his water gun and they ran away and played with him.
And that was only a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British willingly shared our pain and supported us.
She said, "I always think this world hasn't gotten better in these 10 years.
In Ukraine, the war continues now, and every day people die, and I believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed.
These are just like our children.
I think that for many of the war is part of the news they hear when they are bored or busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, the whole horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other and that's so sad.
Damir grew up and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he is not at all aggressive or angry.
For example, he doesn't look for revenge, he's not overwhelmed by the past horrors.
I know he doesn't like to remember, but he has six close friends from class and they occasionally go to the gym and light up candles there.
When he was smaller, he suffered from it - I remember him lying down on the sofa sometimes, the face turned away from us for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember him throwing off all his weapons and other military toys. Damir is now 17, bigger than I am, good looking, intelligent and healthy.
I can't believe I was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and I'd never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and came on my legs, I looked around, and saw hell around me, with body parts all around.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy could not have survived in this hell.
"I remember calling him, "Damir, run, run away," but I was also so sure he hadn't heard me.
But he heard it, and he ran away.
And so, unlike many others, life goes on for us.
Georgij Ilyin, 17
The boy whose terrible image after the siege became the symbol of the abomination of Beslan
Comfort: The Beslan Survivor Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the 2004 siege, on the right a picture of Georgij today
His blood-flooded face was drawn by fear when he ran around his life while Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols for the barbarians of Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, had dropped him off for his first day of school before she ran off to bring her older son Vladimir to college.
"I left the court about two minutes before the terrorists stormed him, and so my little boy stayed there alone for three terrible days," she recalls.
Not all alone, there was a whole family of relatives of us, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgia managed to survive.
The closer this date comes, the harder it is to think about it and talk about it.
There is not a single day when we do not remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's been a long time, I mean, it would have happened yesterday, some scenes from these days are always following me.
No one will ever forget that, I promise you.
Emphasis: The image of Georgij (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right).
I remember that Georgij wanted to go to school that day, and he said he wanted to embrace his teacher.
I only knew he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there is even this statue of the crying Georgia in San Marino.
Georgij doesn't like the picture, and it's hidden at home in the bookshelf.
I understand, but I also mean that people around the world feel our pain thanks to this picture.
Georgij says today: "It is important that such a thing can never happen again.
"I doubt we'll ever learn the truth.
People are constantly investigating such tragedies and never experiencing the truth.
And now they are investigating the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused him?
This world is becoming a terrible thing.
"I can't understand how this is possible, because when you ask people, nobody wants a war, so how does that happen?
Ten years are nothing in such pain.
We need dozens of years to forget it a little bit.
It has attacked my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years, I had a few nightmares because of the siege, but then it got better.
I went back to school later in 2004 and was scared every day.
I was thinking of my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That's why I always go to the gym when the 1st of September approaches.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It's hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to do it.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is part of my past now.
I won't forget, but I'm not sorry.
My life continues.
I finished school this year and attend a medical university in Vladikavkaz.
I'm going to be a heart surgeon.
My first choice was a training in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health didn't allow it.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that won't happen.
Georgia Fanijew, 20
The boy who survived even though he was caught at the feet of a murderous terrorist
A miracle: Georgij Fanijev was trapped at the feet of a murderous terrorist during the siege, but he managed to survive.
During the siege, he was trapped in the gym and sat next to the bomb that was attached to the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It's really a miracle he wasn't killed.
"We feel it as if it had been yesterday," says Georgij, who wanted to go to the FSB as a intelligence agent, but could not do this because of his health damage due to the siege.
It's still with me, it's nothing I left behind.
I'm older now and people say that children can easily deal with bad experiences - I have to say that's not true.
"In 2006, I worked with psychologists and after that I actually felt a little better, but I can't forget it.
And I'd like to forget.
2005 - the year after - was the first and only time I went back to the gym.
I lost consciousness.
I will never return there again and ask me not to show you where I sat in this famous picture.
Survivor: Georgij Fanijev today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is immense, and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know I don't like to think about it or talk about it and they never asked me about it.
Physically, I'm fine.
I should be careful about my injured knee, but I can run well now.
But because of my health, I couldn't study at the FSB Secret Service Academy in Saint Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent in my papers, including medical records, and they answered that it was not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I've been there for two years.
He learns the treatment of all animals "from cats to cows".
He said, "I knew I would never tell my children about my experiences.
Children should know nothing about this and, of course, they should not suffer it.
His mother Marina, 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
He's in my soul, worse when the anniversary approaches.
I will go to the celebrations to commemorate.
I know that Georgia won't go.
It must be much stronger for him because he was there and I wasn't.
I waited for him at home and couldn't help.
I am so grateful to God that he was given back to me. Here in Beslan all are drawn from it.
It stays in us.
Georgij is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.
It's hard to accept this when something so unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't take part because of his knee.
He's been operated on several times, he can run, but he can't run any sports.
I'd say he overcame the horror at 50%, but you can never completely overcome it and forget it.
This terrible experience will always follow us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the siege and this only reinforces my pain.
I lost a lot of people I knew well and who were expensive to me.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could make me, but my heart weeps for the dead.
I know of families in which new children were born, but also of widows who never married again.
It's hard to accept that life continues, even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart leaped in me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what is going on in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is now very close to our country and I can hardly believe it.
We used to be a friendly country, how can we fight now?
People and children suffer, I am sure that many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many are still being killed.
If only we could grab all these rebels and throw them out - as far away as possible.
Aljona Tskayeva, 10
The baby so grippingly borne by a special deployment command in safety
Gerettet: Aljona Tskajewa is secured by a Russian special deployment command (left).
It is now ten (right) and does not remember the atrocities at all.
The world breathed in 2004 when the baby Aljona was carried in the arms of a Russian policeman from the siege of Beslan.
The terrorists let her go, but in her cruelty she held back her 30-year-old mother, the 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar in the school sports hall.
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljona's mother and sister died in the murderous scourge.
Her father Ruslan has since married again and has a little girl with his new wife, Svetlana, whom he named after his lost daughter Kristina.
Aljona, ten years old today, does not remember the siege and has grown up to be an intelligent and happy girl, say neighbors.
"They are now a great happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to save them all the memories that come up with the tenth anniversary.
You'll understand why.

4 Tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you would like to take photos or videos underwater, there is a selection of devices.
The cheapest option is a waterproof point-and-shoot, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action cam such as the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both for about $300.
I took these photos at a family festival with several cameras, all available at a price of less than $350.
Regardless of the equipment, there are a few rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery compartment and other compartments are closed.
Also set your camera to the photos or videos you want to record.
Some cameras and camcorders have scene and recording modes that optimize exposure time for insulating underwater conditions.
And before you jump into it, check up to what depth your equipment is functional.
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Search our guide and reviews of digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models.
Make multiple shots - because many won't fold.
Point-and-shoot cameras feature an LCD that allows you to compose images, Action-Cams usually do not.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to see it underwater, and the right picture setting is a lucky thing.
So you're making a lot of recordings.
If your camera has a rowing mode that makes a number of recordings with slightly changed exposure settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light gets dramatically worse, the further you remove yourself from the surface.
So if possible, stay close to the surface when you take photographs in a pool, lake or sea.
This also allows you to bring more color into your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Go close to the objects.
This is also a good advice on land, but it is all the more important under water because of the bad light conditions.
It is particularly important when you work with an action cam: These devices often have a fixed wide angle lens, which means you need to get closer to your objects when they are to fill the entire frame.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the variety whose character changes things, even in such a huge organization as the NHS.
As a consultative anaesthesia doctor, he dedicated his career to saving the sick both the agony of the disease and the pains of treatment.
Among his patients, his wife remembers, was an MI6 employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that the diagnostics and diseases are important to the doctors, while the patients are mostly concerned with something quite different: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose path of suffering began.
"I didn't feel like it," he wrote in May of this year.
I had trouble getting me up.
While he was fighting the flu-like symptoms, he noticed that he was making impatient accusations to his wife Juliet.
"I prefer everything right away than later," he noted.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt quite unusual and for no reason worried.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to carry out an X-ray examination of his chest.
Only two weeks ago he had been skiing in the French Alps.
The results of the X-ray examination were available.
He suffered from Mesothelioma, an unhealable cancer that attacks the skin, i.e. the skin that overruns the lungs.
As with most cancers, the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine.
While some smokers suffer from lung cancer, for example, not all lung cancer patients used to be smokers.
But Mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos load - contact with the fiber building material, which was once regarded as a "wound substance" but has now been recognized as fatal.
For most of us, Mesothelioma is a disease that can easily ignore.
Finally, asbestos is a product of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos was no longer used in the UK since the 1960s, when the industry volunteered to stop using it.
Even where he was still used, only people in certain industries worked directly with the fabric - plumbers, construction workers, carpenters and shipyard workers, for example.
As an industrial dangerous substance from another time, it hardly seems to be alarming today.
But this self-satisfaction is inappropriate.
Britain, it seems, is now experiencing the height of a mesolthelioma epidemic.
There are more deaths from Mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die of this disease as in road accidents.
Annual figures of mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and expected future deaths in Great Britain
The reason why we are experiencing the deadly effects now, although asbestos has been illegal for years (in 1999 all types of asbestos were banned), is that a mesothelioma only develops after decades.
And the scourges of the Mesothelioma are not limited to former workers in the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and is often still present in the houses where we live, the offices in which we work, the schools in which we learn and the shops in which we shop.
And therefore, Mesothelioma knows no class barriers, financial limits, occupations or age.
The privileged bastiones, from the elegant department stores in London to private schools, are not a safeguard room.
The Parliament buildings are asbestos-rich.
Even in hospitals where we are supposed to get well, we have already been designated as the source of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a plumber either.
In fact, it was difficult for him to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
"It looks as if there was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I completed my training for six years." he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and gaters - use the tunnels.
You wonder how many of my peers will suffer from the same illness?
Unfortunately, he could at least partially answer this question.
"From the four doctors who were trained at Guy's Hospital and who have been suffering from Mesothelioma in the last five years," he wrote in a letter in 2010, "I am the last to live."
How many of us are still going to suffer?
At Andrew Lawson, Mesothelioma was diagnosed at the age of 48.
When he died on February 17, this year, he was 55.
That was an unusually long survival.
Fifty percent of all mesothelioma patients die within 8 months of diagnosis.
The disease always ends dead.
So we can only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us are still going to suffer?"
The leading expert in Britain on Mesothelioma, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in the UK is expected to come to an end, a total of 90,000 of the disease will have been killed.
Most of them have no idea at the moment that they will die like this.

A brief look at the files of the courts to which the persons concerned often turn for damages shows how far the scourges of the mesothelioma have already been spread.
In June this year, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that Janice Allen had been exposed negligently to asbestos.
She worked for nine years for the chain, from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of them the flagship store on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years old when she started working at M&S.
Now she's got two kids in the 20s.
"Before this thing," she says, "I had never heard of Mesotheliom, I didn't even really know anything about asbestos.
I never thought this would affect me.
There are only a few people who know a lot about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos refers not to a substance but to a group of six minerals.
The name comes from the word "Asbestiform", a description of the fiber structure that makes the substance resistant and flexible.
Three of the six were used in the construction industry.
Chrysotil, also known as white asbestos, is today by far the most commonly found asbestos in buildings.
It was used for roofing plates, flooring plates, pipe insulations, boilers, even for brake coatings in cars.
It is less deadly than other forms of asbestos, but it is nevertheless considered by the EU and WHO as a "great health risk" with possible death.
However, the brown asbestos (Amosit) and the blue asbestos (Krokydolith) are more dangerous.
United Kingdom was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that "there is clear, but indirect evidence that this was a major reason for the uniquely high mesothelioma rates."
An employee of Marks & Spencer was exposed to asbestos at Flagshipstore on Oxford Street, London
Janice Allen may not have seen himself as a typical mesothelioma sacrifice, but Julian Peto's work suggests that her story is by no means unusual.
He presented a study by the interested parties, which shows that "a significant proportion of mesothelioma without known suspension by work or at home was probably caused by asbestos contact in the environment."
Most of these contacts are based on the "normal use and aging" of our buildings.
It looks like no one can assume to be safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, who examined the palace of Westminster, shows how people could have been unwittingly exposed to the substance in the heart of the government.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service shafts and pipelines behind the Parliament's committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibres could be reversed by something as harmless as "strong air movements".
Members of Parliament are often accused of caring for their own interests, but here it looks as if the opposite is true.
While the Directorate of the Parliamentary Labour Service insisted that the Westminster Palace had received a "clean health certificate", it is now undisputed that 1 billion pounds of labour has to be spent over several years in order to renovate Parliament, modernise the electrical installations and remove asbestos, and that after the general elections in 2015, MEPs will probably meet in the nearby QE2 conference center rather than on the green banks in Westminster.
The Goddard report also pointed out that "the existence of asbestos was not handled in accordance with the relevant provisions."
No one can know if this mismanagement will cost life.
All you can do now is wait.
A person who could never precisely determine the contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general physician.
As Andrew Lawson suggests the 50-year-old Abbott, he was exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital where asbestos complaint was decided positively," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It is so difficult to remember all the places you worked on and the data.
What he remembers is the day at the beginning of December 2009 when he got such a fever.
He was 45 years old, and he was running an operation late in the evening.
Suddenly, I had a shake.
It came all of a sudden.
I felt terrible.
I didn't think I could make the trip home anymore.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pains of the breast fur that touched the skin around his lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a Mesothelioma.
He didn't go to work for a month.
Surprised doctors made X-rays of his chest and put on pleuracathether to remove fluid from the lungs and test in the laboratory.
However, his complaints remained undiagnosed.
His health improved slowly, and he returned to his workplace.
From time to time, however, the symptoms returned, often after sports activity and violent breathing.
In 2011, a patient came abbotts with similar symptoms in his practice and was later diagnosed with Mesothelioma.
But even now, Abbot did not link this to his own case.
Finally, his patient was a few decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in that case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition worsened again and his family doctor brought his CT scans and X-rays to an expert group.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott felt sick for the first time, a probe equipped with a camera was introduced into the cave between the rib and the breast fur.
I'm an optimist.
I usually just keep going," he says.
Honestly, I didn't worry so much.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was between Christmas and New Year the week before: "They told me it was Mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: Diagnostic Mesothelioma
Suddenly, Abbott had appointments with Macmillan nurses, one of whom recommended him to take a lawyer.
Only now did he understand the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often isolated with asbestos," he says.
The people exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now ill.
And so, Mesotheliom now meets younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous pipes with asbestosilation in hospitals were underground, so patients were probably not exposed to the substance.
But many people who ate in pedestrian tunnels from one building to another (such as Andrew Lawson) or underground canteens (as Graham Abbott often did) were most likely in contact with the toxic substances.
It turns out that over several decades after the war, hospitals may have been lifesaving for patients, but life threatening for the treating doctors.
He's still being removed today.
Students put their Bunsenbrenners on asbestos mats.
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and city halls due to its fabulous insulating and flame-retardant properties.
Schools, too.
In fact, many people have probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.
All over the country, in thousands of chemical hours, students have put their Bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
The topic of asbestos in schools is now often addressed on websites.
And for the time being, innocent objects in our houses such as flooring plates or shed roofs have included asbestos as standard.
"It is an industrial gift that is contained in most of our properties," notes Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that hit a woman was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
So take care of how you tear off your garden sheds.
The effects of the diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, is immense.
"It takes a while to process this," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to continue, but I noticed I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I was in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I'm not going to have another Christmas party.
With the greatest difficulty, the change of perspective was from the position of a doctor to that of a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he recalls how overwhelmed he was of all the information he had to do with.
"It was very difficult to record all this," he says.
"I asked my doctor, "How long do I have?"
And they gave me about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to have another Christmas party.
That's it then."
Mesothelioma is particularly secretive because it is our life-keeping mechanism - the breathing itself - that causes deadly cancer.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos consists of smallest fibres.
When the asbestos is swirled and the fibers are inhaled, they can be stuck in the thoracic fur, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the breast skin and can cause cell mutations.
"The problem arises with the inhaled nadula-shaped asbestos fibres," said Professor Tom Treasure, a heart-thorax doctor who moved to Guy's Hospital in 2001.
Just the hospital, which Andrew Lawson suspects has exposed him to asbestos, is now ironically a leading center for the treatment of Mesothelioma.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others who were probably also exposed to asbestos during their training in the hospital.
As soon as the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, says Treasure, "they are pushed from the breathing process to the edge where the skin is.
It is naturally invasive from the beginning.
The usual options for other cancers do not work so well in mesothelioma.
For example, the effectiveness of an operation is hotly controversial.
Some think she's worth a try.
Treasure disapproves.
"You can't cut out the breast fur," he says.
They don't come around with the knife.
The cancer "does not speak very well on chemotherapy," the "effect shows", but does not heal.
"Sometimes there are long-term survivors," says Treasure.
But in the end they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live long, much longer than expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still fighting.
After contacting Mesothelioma, Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson, who had become a one-man support and consulting office for the affected four years after his diagnosis.
"Hello, cancer center," he cheerfully introduced himself during calls.
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He had received his diagnosis four years earlier and was still very active.
Originally, Abbott had been offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which would last four months and probably only extend his life by one month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
However, Lawson managed "to make things appear in a slightly more positive light."
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, a heart-thorax specialist at Guy's.
"We had an advantage because I didn't have to be referred on, I just called and got an appointment," Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to receive a transfer and wait for the approval of treatment.
Money is crucial for mesothelioma patients in order to be able to perceive the best available therapies.
But if these treatments inevitably fail, many of the people concerned are faced with another financial concern - about the future of the families they leave behind.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous to health," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s was that one realized that even a very low load was a health risk.
And here the negligence of the companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital finally settled their case, but it was not what Morgan calls a "full compensation" because Lawson could not prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma was due to an asbestos contact with Guy's.
After the investigation of his death, however, a Guy's spokesman confirmed that "the asbestos fibres in the affected cellar area were removed in the 1990s."
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to Remove Asbestos
In fact, for mesothelioma sufferers who seek compensation, it is a huge problem to assign the deadly asbestos contact of a company or a workplace - usually decades after the incidents.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents can be lost.
And those who oppose claims know that the time is for them, but certainly not with the claimants.
In response to that, there were clear new legislation this year that makes it easier for Mesothelioma victims to sue compensation, even if their former employers are no longer to be found.
The law has set up a £350 million fund supported by the insurance industry for all who were diagnosed after July 2012 to prove a contact, but no one can complain.
In these cases, the complainants receive 80 percent of what a court could have said in a normal compensation process - about 120,000 pounds.
Some 300 successful applications for the programme are expected per year.
Andrew Morgan, like so many Mesothelioma victims, thinks that £350 million was a "very good job" in the insurance industry.
"This is a deal of insurers for insurers," he says, indicating that this sum is a quarter of what insurers would have to pay if the time had not passed and Mesothelioma patients found the companies and could sue them normally.
Mike Penning, then Minister of Labour and Pensions, also admitted that the law was "not perfect".
But both Penning and Morgan admitted that, in the face of seven death victims, quick action is necessary every day.
"People suffer so much and need help today," said Penning during the second hearing of the Mesothelioma law in December of last year.
At that time, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After their first consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation from which, unlike Tom Treasure, he expected a positive effect.
This was accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy that allows Lang-Lazdunski to present a survival rate of up to 40 percent for five years.
Abbott felt strengthened.
"This is, of course, with the most important," says Abbott.
You can see that again and again in patients.
There's something there that's gonna make you go on.
If you give up, you'll get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012.
At the end of August he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles behind him.
Post-care scans showed no signs of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer spots around my chest.
I just got 50.
It's not life-threatening.
That's life-ending.
Abott was once again subjected to six cycles of chemotherapy.
Now no trace of the tumors is visible.
But the process is physically and psychologically very strenuous.
You have to think of practical things - about the money when I am no longer, for example, or my wife shows how the Boiler time setting works.
If you get bad news, you will be negative.
You have to look forward.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, this is not always easy.
"It's hard for parents," he says.
It's hard to know what to say and how much.
When I got my first diagnosis, I told my girl I had a disease that I wouldn't grow old with.
They reacted quite differently.
Tamsin is very social and rude.
She told her friends and we soon got a lot of calls.
Ellie was more hesitant.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to go through.
But for mesothelioma patients, such conversations are not full of hope, not of a trace of hope for survival.
The disease (and finally for Stephen Jay Gould) brings a grotesque security.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesothelioma is not life-threatening.

China refuses Hong Kong right to government election, demonstrators swear retribution
On Sunday, despite the increased calls for democratic reforms, the Chinese Parliament decided against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 elections by the Hong Kong electorate.
This approach is likely to fuel the long-announced protests in Hong Kong's business district, while activists led the planning and mobilization of it within a few hours of the announcement.
In principle, the decision of the Chinese People's Congress allows Communist leaders to reject all non-peking candidates.
"It's not unexpected, but it makes us angry," said lawyer Emily Lau, chairman of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing had promised.
They lied to Hong Kong's inhabitants.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In his defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, Deputy Secretary General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that the admission of public nominations in the elections for the Hong Kong government would be too "chaotic".
Since 1997, when the UK returned control of Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing has promised to have its inhabitants elected to the government presidency from 2017.
The Chinese leadership presented the decision of Sunday as a democratic breakthrough, because there is a direct right of election for Hong Kong citizens, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leadership keeps the process firmly in hand through a closely controlled nominee committee.
After a new clause, only candidates will be allowed "with love for the country and love of Hong Kong".
The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most effective protests took place in Hong Kong for several years.
Behind the pro-democratic campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers threatened to oust the financial district if Beijing does not allow a real universal right to vote.
On Sunday evening, hundreds of Occupy-Central supporters gathered in the rain in front of the Hong Kong government headquarters within a few hours of the announcement.
At the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement had reached a new stage of civil disobedience and planned to protest in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any further information, apparently in order to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online communication, the organizers reported that the movement "has considered the occupation of the central district only as the last means, an action to take place only if all dialogue opportunities are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are sorry to have to say that today all the dialogue opportunities have been exploited and the occupation of the central district will definitely take place.
The Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for the Beijing announcement for days, and security measures, including police forces and barricades, were tightened on Sunday in front of the government building.
The unrest is reinforced by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city.
The movement of people from the mainland strengthens competition for products and services.
Furthermore, the fear is that the values of Hong Kong such as democracy and freedom of speech are beginning to crumble under the growing pressure of Beijing.
Some criticized the demonstrations of the Occupy-Central movement as it endangered the business - the Hong Kong's lifeline.
"The protests they are talking about could cause great economic damage, depending on how many are involved and how long they last," said legal expert Regine Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to be afraid that Hong Kong will be out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
China's state-controlled media reported recently on the democracy activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by Western powers.
This summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on the electoral rights in which 780,000 people participated - more than a fifth of the voters in Hong Kong.
In July, tens of thousands participated in one of the largest demonstrations of democracy in the history of the region.
The tradition of high school balls in the USA is now transferred to the universities where Freshmen performances are offered with the private aircraft.
We are pleased to be able to respond to this demand and to offer the first luxury travel service in the United Kingdom for students today.
In order to achieve a particularly impressive performance at the university, the company also offers transportation options such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr Stewart also stated that the service had a security section.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to ride their belongings in a dangerously overloaded car through the country.
Together with our new VIF options, we look forward to this year ensuring that students reach the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury.
A business spokesman said that there were no new bookings, as the service had just been introduced, but added that "students would book the service in the next few weeks".
The company also informed that despite the study fees of £9,000 per year, it expected a market for this offer.
Students today differ greatly in their expectations and demands from the students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can do exactly that.
However, the National Student Union criticized the service as being abolished.
Megan Dunn, Vice President of the NUS for Higher Education said: "This offer seems completely separate from the life of the majority of students.
Many students who start their studies this month face a crisis of cost of living, as the available grants in the form of loans and scholarships do not keep pace with the strongly increasing bills for the simplest livelihoods before they can even remember to spend thousands of pounds on such a simple thing as arrival at the student home.
Feminists criticize racial question and police behavior according to Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo. early this month.
The participants lifted their hands in the air and sang, "Hands up, don't shoot," while they waited for the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, because of the shooting of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
According to their experience, white feminist commentators put the sex ahead of the race when it comes to addressing reproductive rights and income inequalities.
However, while tensions in the Middle West were rising and attention was given throughout the country, Perez saw that white women's responses revolved 100% around the race.
Compared to the answers of black women shortly after the shots of August 9, the personal essays with titles like "Thinks to Ferguson of a White Woman" and "Feminism is not only about the suppression of women" were relatively late.
But for Perez, that meant an important change.
"I don't think you can find in feminism many people who are white and talk about privileges in such a high-class way," she said.
People felt compelled to express something about the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis we are in and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnized that they have to express it.
For English professor Koritha Mitchell from Ohio State University, Ferguson brought to light problems that black Americans are exposed to every day, but which are not considered "woman themes" in the cultural sphere.
"I can publish something funny on Facebook about me and my partner and get 150 likes from anywhere," said Mitchell.
When I post something about how colored people in their own country are under siege, the silence is deafening.
"How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship, but not about public security?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell who have studied race, gender and sexuality in the history of the USA, there is no dichotomy between racial and gender problems.
For them, black women have not had the luxury of separating the topics cleanly; they live every day in the combined reality.
While white women now combine race and gender in the feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattery, professor of women and gender research at George Mason University, says that her predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were suffering and the reason was almost always the rape of a white woman," said Hattery.
White women had to be involved in the story to justify the Lynch murder.
For Hattery, the division between white and black women came to the point where white women for women's election rights, like Susan B. Anthony, analyzed the country in the late 19th century and found that the struggle for the right to vote could only be successful for one group: women or blacks.
"They made the decision to stand for women's right to vote, and the right to vote for black should come later," said Hattery.
When you remember such things, you become aware with power of why colored women do not trust white women.
We didn't do our job well.
We have never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women were given the right to vote in 1920, it took a decade to organize white women against the Lynchen in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was created almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women, says Mitchell.
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist reactions to the questions raised by Ferguson - police behaviour, racial discrimination - is a mirror of the time when white feminists "fangs" have been playing with the problems that black women have faced for generations.
"Wouldn't it be great if the activists, who have such traditional feminist platforms have the right to raise a child as seriously as they do with the right to conception control?" asked Mitchell.
Feminists of the second generation who have built up their career in the fight for reproductive rights and access to anti-feminism drugs are now trying to understand what that means.
The famous white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went on Facebook two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown and published a scored article by Rebecca Carroll, columnist of the Guardian in which she demands more protests from white Americans on racism.
"I hope that women who have another but parallel reason to understand a danger inherent in the body - and opinions on the race, which are clearly different in public surveys - will lead the changes," wrote Steinem.
Although Steinem stands for a more intersectional feminism in which racial and gender issues are addressed, some of its comments on the topic of race in America are astounded.
Christina Sommers, researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole Feminism?" told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, "are far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's comments on Ferguson are contrary to her earlier criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently imposed a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and hispanic men, there were angry reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The police's relationship with the black community is not the only problem that pushes into the foreground of mainstream feminism.
After the U.S. Border Police has taken up nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors at the country's south-west border this year, the subject of immigration reform is again coming to the surface - this time as a women's theme.
Andrea Mercado, co-chairman of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that for a re-examination of the subject as an essential women's theme they only had to publish the stories of immigrants.
"These speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the large majority of work visas go to male immigrants, the women they accompany are in a position in which they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories find an aftertaste in the women's organizations," she said.
"Schijn-Haus" in Ipswich is for sale
The picture of a house for sale was removed by real estate agents when it became clear that it showed a big pig that it had made itself comfortable in the living room.
The detached house has a bedroom, is located on a private street in Ipswich and is offered for 120,000 pounds.
Among the details was a picture of the living room of the house - one of which was also a pig that had put his head on a sofa.
Real estate agent Connells said that the pig in the photo was the owner's pet.
"The photo was, however, mistakenly published and has now been removed," said one of the company's spokespersons.
At the house's exposition, Connells described the former assembly house as a "unique single-family house with a bedroom."
Although the broker has removed the image from the website, it still appears on advertising material.
The sale of the house was of interest in the social media when some asked if the pig was included in the purchase price.
The SW City of Harvey is home to a new millionaire after lotto win
A lotto player from Harvey this month
The search for a new millionaire in the southwest of Perth continues, with a happy winner who receives almost $1.1 million from the lottery draw on Saturday.
A newspaper skiosk in Harvey moved the jackpot in the draw of the first division for the second time in five years, after $1 million in November 2009.
However, the lucky winner still needs to report.
The store owner Steve Forward said that the profits provide for conversation in the small town in the southwest of Perth.
The city's not talking about anything else, and everyone's quite excited.
We thought that such a profit could occur.
Eight WA winners have celebrated winnings in the first division last month, a decent graduation for a few happy weeks for the players in the state.
Last week a player from Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires in August, after a married couple from Belmont had won $7.5 million a few weeks earlier.
The winning pair had played for twenty years and said that the winning allowed them the possibility of a world trip and the purchase of a new house.
The millionaire from Harvey is the 59th winner of the first division in the WA this year, with a total of almost 85 million dollars.
Leonidas asked in the gladiatorial arena
Not only the gladiators stood very deep in the Matsch at the first Rheinbacher Römertag in the leisure park.
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract well over 1,000 visitors yesterday, who resisted the rainstorms and the autumn cold, and were left with the historical spectacle.
There was a colorful dance of representations, performances, games, exhibits and information about the time of the Romans and their meaning for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the military force of the Gladiator School "Amor Mortis", which used every rain break to demonstrate its robust martial art in the arena prepared with soft sand.
Gladiator-owner "Leonidas" proved to be a humorous and competent presenter and sent his men together in the ring to the heroic twin battle in various gladiatorial pitts.
First, the "provocators" were on the row with rectangular shield and short sword as well as leg rail on the left leg and armrail on the right arm.
They followed the "Essedarii" with breast shield, short sword and worm, as well as iron gladiator helmet, leg and arm protection.
The appearance of the "Retiarius" was particularly impressive, which, with a thrownet, drezack and a dagger, attacked the "secutor" and after a recent battle hit the burgers to the ground.
As the swords were powerful metallic together, the shields created and the worms flew about through the arena, that a fear and anxiety could become around the health of gladiators.
But the imposing "Summa Rudis", the muscular referee, had an ever attentive eye on that.
"We wanted to revive Roman everyday life and make the culture of the Roman era experienceable," explained Lorenz Euskirchen, chairman of the organizer "Friendeskreis Römerkanal", the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, a "Oppidum Romanum", a Roman city, was established from the leisure park for a day, as vice-bourgeois Claus Wehage stated in his greeting.
Finally, the Romans not only brought war and conquest in our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous structures we admire today.
The remains of these were also to be marveled at during the Roman day, such as "Aqueduct marble" from the 11 meter high and 1400 meter long Roman Channel bridge, which once stood at Lüftelberg.
The Frontinus Society once opposed the supply of water and energy and now, and managing director Petra Fricke knew: "We still benefit from the knowledge of then".
This also confirms diploma survey engineer Ralph Heiliger of the "IngenieurteamZwei" from Rheinbach, who presented measuring instruments of the Romans such as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented sketches and models from the excavations of anno 1894 as well as bricks from the original hypocaust, the warm air heating that once heated the Roman villa.
Impressing also the footprints left by Wolf and Fox two millenniums ago in the footsteps of sound before they were burned.
In 2011 the Landendenkmalpflege office at the Landesverband Rheinland had excavated the remains of a Roman villa in the Nord industrial park in Rheinbach.
The walls of an economic building with a darre for drying and grinding grains were found.
The building probably belonged to a Villa Rustica, an agricultural estate, explained the archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser.
A number of finds from these excavations presented them in a glass vitrine, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels and parts of a petal necklace.
The villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century AD until the invasion of the Germans in the Roman Rhineland at that time, Morscheiser suspects.
In addition, the children were concerned with the Roman windmill game, similar to today’s mill game, or they wrote their names with metal handles on wax panels like the Roman students once.
At the stand of the Romans Zülpich, the children were allowed to lay mosaics themselves, bask glass mosaics at the stand of the Glasmuseum Rheinbach and to serve a heavy wheat mill made of stone at the stand of the Nature Center Eifel Nettersheim in order to grind the flour for a lettuce or a muesli.
The Roman caravans, drawn by two cold flowerers, drove through the leisure park and passed the impressive state of the Gymnasium, which presented the results of their "Roman Project Weeks".
With a Roman week from 13 to 21 September, the municipality of Wachtberg will also bring itself into the Roman year 2014 in Rhineland, which is to commemorate the death of Augustus 2000 years ago.
Together with the home and history clubs as well as the Wachtberger Wander-Verein, the partnership association and the Laienspielkreis Oberbachem, thematic walks, a lecture, cooking evenings and guided tours for school classes are offered and reminds of the Roman past of Wachtberg.
For example, a Roman legionary will tell about his work on the dedicated Wachtberg, present plants as living monuments from the Roman era, and present a funny lesson in international understanding between a group of Wachtberger "Germans" and drawn Romans.
The primary school of Adendorf is dedicated to the Roman theme during a project week.
With the Roman week, the numerous traces of the Romans in Wachtberg, which are often visible but no longer visible at first glance, are to be made possible again.
A small presentation of the find of the Berkumer Matron Sanctuary in 1879 will be remembered at the Wachtberger Rathaus.
Ebola: The epidemic is straining West Africa’s economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a severe blow to the economy.
Markets are lost - and international companies go a long way.
The devastating Ebola epidemic hits the West African economy a serious blow.
The harvest rotts in the fields, the mines are abandoned and the markets are lost - the virus has hard to add to the region.
Some international companies are also already on a distance.
"The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis, but also an economic one," says Donald Kaberuka, head of the African Development Bank.
Liberia is the hardest affected
"It's a total disaster, we lose a lot of money," says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells clothes on the second largest market in Liberia's capital, Monrovia.
Only those who want to buy food or something to disinfect Ebola will be on the market.
Liberia is the hardest hit by the virus, where more than 600 people were killed by the fever alone.
The health authorities recently declared that the disease was present in every corner of the country.
The virus spread in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
In total, more than 1500 people died, thousands more were attached.
Foreign companies deduct employees
Companies in resource-rich countries are suspending their operations.
Foreign companies such as the Arcelor Mittal steel group deduct their employees, and several international airlines no longer fly to the affected regions.
The local merchants and farmers also react: few merchants leave their homes to get resuscitation.
In some areas of Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are subject to quarantine, the export-related cocoa and coffee beans on the fields have rotted.
Farmers don't dare leave home for the harvest.
Food is becoming scarce
"People will travel less and less," says Phillipe De Vreyer, Paris expert on the West African economy.
The man who usually goes to the market and sells his vegetables, for example, prefers to stay at home.
Therefore, the population gets to feel the consequences of the epidemic directly and pressingly: food becomes scarce.
In the markets, the supply of basic foods, such as rice, is disappearing.
At the same time, the region heavily dependent on international companies threatens an image damage - with far-reaching consequences.
The greatest danger is that international companies will in principle avoid the area for a long time, says Philippe Hugon of the French think tank Iris.
Decisive is how far and how long the virus will spread.
Investors may feel "that it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and thus invest," warns Hugon.
The disease is also burdened by the country's hard-pressed state budgets.
The disease is also burdened by the already stressed state budgets of the countries concerned.
Moody's credit rating agency fears that their budgets will be strongly strengthened by the high expenditure on the health system and, in addition, by the worsening economy.
The African Development Bank has already promised to help the health systems of the countries concerned with 60 million dollars (45 million euros).
The effects are also noticeable in Nigeria, where only a few Ebola cases have been diagnosed so far.
Although the oil-rich region in the southern Niger delta has not yet been affected.
But elsewhere, many people are already at home for fear of infection.
Reservations in hotels also go back significantly.
Protectors celebrate their 50th anniversary
The Schüttenverein "Tannenwald" Berngau celebrates its 50th anniversary from 12th to 14th September.
On high-speed tours, preparations for the 50-year founding festival run from 12th to 14th September at the Schützenverein Tannenwald.
planned on Friday, 12 September, a big entertainment evening with the group "Dorfrocker".
On Saturday the big bolger shooting is at 6:00 p.m.
Afterwards, in the large celebration the evening of the mood with the "Stoapfälzer Spitzbuam" is.
Blaskapelle provides the music
Highlights on Sunday are the Feast Service and 9.30 o'clock in the parish church and the Great Detention at 2 p.m.
In the afternoon, the price distribution of the Federal and Gauschoeling is also.
A particularly beautiful sight will be the 25 dams with their Dirndln.
Festkapelle is the Blakapelle Berngau.
Mayor Wolfgang Wild and State Secretary Albert Füracker took over the patronship.
The original name "Schützengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" dates back to 1907, when the association was founded on 21 March for "social entertainment through exercise in room-to-room and small-caliber shooting".
The NS regime had caused the club to disband in 1937.
Only in 1964 have 19 young men found themselves again, who raised the "new" "Tannenwald" Berngau from baptism at the inn of Lukas on 30 April.
Karl March and Adolf Ried led the club as a shooter master through a difficult start time, where it was mainly about finding a club location and installing the shooting operation.
In the autumn of 1965, the Schützenverein started in the inn "Leininger" with two teams in the round competitions.
In the following years, the sportsmen, who had now been organized into seven teams, settled in all classes to the first Gauliga.
The club's records went off every year and the magical border of 380 rings was reached for the first time in 1980 by Rudi Meier.
Just as the performance of the active shooters has increased, the number of members has also developed positively.
After the club's "Leininger" location no longer met the demands of a modern Schützenverein, the then board of directors under the leadership of Johann Rinn decided to create a future home in the basement rooms of the new "Landgasthof Härteis".
After a work performance of 2700 hours, the parish priest Strasser granted the ecclesial blessing for the new shooter rooms on 8 May 1988.
One of the great highlights in the history of the club was certainly the 44th shooting, combined with the solemn ordination of the new shooter flag in July 1991.
On April 23 and 24, 1994, the Schüttenverein celebrated its 30th anniversary.
A Böllergruppe was founded in 1995.
Josef Schmalzl became a Büllerreferent.
A major challenge for the "Böller" and for the association as a whole was the orientation of the Bavarian Böller meeting in 2005.
In many hours of volunteer work, the club members have modernized the rooms and the shooting system in the Berngauer Hof last year, thus bringing it up-to-date.
Eleven Teams in Round Races
You can also see the sporting achievements of the Sagittarius Association.
A total of eleven teams are currently participating in the rounds: six air-gun teams, an air-gun team, a sports gun KK1, a youth team and two AH teams.
The 1st team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann has entered the district league 1 in the 2013/14 round from the Gauoberliga (highest league in the Schüttengau ANB).
The 2nd team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml has gone from the Gauliga Nord to the Gauoberliga.
In addition to shooting sports, events such as bockstones, carnival and king's ball, club trip and Christmas party have tradition.
The shooters are also present at the festivals in parish and municipality.
Tony Stewart suffers accident when he returns to the racetrack
Tony Stewart's return to the race track ended about halfway through his race on the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart went against the wall for the second time after his right front tires burst into round 172 and ended his evening.
Stewart drove his damaged car into the garage and left it without talking to journalists.
His team leader Chad Johnston said his 14-person team was disappointed, but now concentrate on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish we had a better commitment and a better result for him," said Johnston.
We're going to Richmond and we hope we can do better there.
Stewart had already gone to a wall during the Sunday evening race after a collision with Kyle Busch and had to have the right side of his car repaired.
"I went in with quite good hopes today for a good result," said Johnston, adding, "It just didn't work out."
Not long after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded into the tow and the team had packed and was ready for departure.
Stewart dropped three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit another driver in an ash railway race in the north of New York State and killed him.
He decided to return this week and win either in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to win a place in the persecution.
He returned to his workplace, during an investigation into the tragic incident that led to the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who had stepped on the road during a race to confront Stewart.
On Friday, the authorities announced that investigations on the cause of the accident would continue for at least two weeks.
No decision has yet been made as to whether Stewart has to expect a charge.
The three-time champion was received with great applause when he was introduced before the race.
After a start at 12th position, Stewart had already arrived shortly after in the first 10 and was temporarily in fourth place.
After a restart in round 122, bussed
Cars with No. 18 out of control after the exit from Curve 2 and collided with Stewart, with both cars driving against the wall.
Stewart went on, but fell back to 21st place.
Tanzfreudiger Young People Seeked
Simply try out Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and Head Lisa Neuzel (from the left) are looking forward to fellow fighters.
Like many other clubs, jazz groups in the TV Jahn also do all day lessons at the secondary schools.
After the summer holidays, some groups have strongly decimated.
Now, more young people are being sought for a sport that is healthy and fun.
In the two jazz and modern dance groups of Lisa Neuzel, once dancer in the Jazz and Modern Dance formation "Spirits", only nine children are still.
"Three in the group of eight to twelve-year-olds, six in the group of twelve to 15-year-olds," says the 20-year-olds.
With more active people, the whole thing would be much more fun, "you could dance quite different choreographies," she says.
Those who want to dance can sniff in the dance room at the former Hotel Meyer, Freistraße 9, between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m. on Thursdays between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m. or Fridays between 5 p.m. and 6.30 p.m. on Fridays.
"The training starts regularly with a warm-up program," says the trainer.
After that, various choreographies are performed.
JazzDance has the feature that there is no fixed shape and is therefore open to many styles.
Elements from folklore to classics up to sports and acrobatics are processed in jazz dance.
Of course, the gathering is not too short.
"We're also going to eat, watch dance movies and we've spent the night in the dance room," Lisa Nijzel reports.
In the group you can make friendships, share a beautiful hobby and do a lot more for your own motor development.
Whom jazz dance is not that way, it can also be found in one of the other offers of the TV Jahn.
Children and young people can always sniff into the classes in children's dance/jazz dance, Bambini ballet, video clip dancing and hip-hop on Wednesdays.
The dance trainer is Francisco Afonso.
Adult couples are welcome to the dance evenings on Monday and Wednesday.
Those who like discofox, slow waltz, Vienna walzer, rumba, cha-cha-cha and tango are allowed to look past and join.
Bulgarian prison guards protest nationally
Hundreds of prison workers from all over Bulgaria have organized a national protest in front of the Ministry of Justice in the capital Sofia.
In the peaceful demonstration, they repeated their demands for restoring their old working conditions, which have recently been changed.
Higher salaries are also on a demand list to be discussed with interim Justice Minister Hristo Ivanov.
For a month, officials have been symbolically protesting the new working hours and demanding a return to the earlier 24-hour shifts.
Despite the meetings between the Union of Prison Workers and representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, the National Bulgarian Ratio (BNR) reported.
Negotiations continue, the Director-General for Penal Measures, Rosen Zhelyazkov, announced to BNR.
The protest of the prison staff is expected to be supported by members of the trade union association of the staff of the Ministry of the Interior.
Ukrainian army has abandoned airport of Luhansk
In the eastern Ukraine, the pro-Russian fighters are still on the march.
After heavy fighting, in which also Russian tank battalions were said to have been involved, the Ukrainian army has given up today, Monday, the airport of Luhansk Rebellenhburg.
At the same time, the army reported that seven soldiers had been killed in the last 24 hours.
The Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had already drawn personal consequences from the severe defeats of his army in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the top army without mentioning any details.
Pro-Russian separatists shot off plane
In the fight against Ukrainian government troops, pro-Russian separatists shot a fighter plane and two military helicopters on their own account.
Some 100 soldiers had also been injured or killed in fighting in the Donetsk region, according to Russian agencies on Monday.
Coast Guard Ships sinked
The insurgents also claimed to have sunk two boats from the Ukrainian Coast Guard in the Azov Sea for the first time.
The Ukrainian border guard confirmed that two of his ships were under fire on Sunday near the port city of Mariupol.
Seven border guards had been injured, a speaker in Kiev told the radio 112.ua.
Two crew members were considered missing.
Local media made Russia responsible for the incident.
The separatists also reported that they had brought several villages under their control in the Donetsk area.
Diplomatic offensive in Minsk
The Ukraine Contact Group meets in the Belarusian capital Minsk today.
In addition to representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, a messenger of the separatists from Eastern Ukraine should also participate.
In advance, all actors used their appearances to publicise their demand.
NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia by the planned stations in Eastern Europe as a result of the Ukraine crisis.
NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels that NATO adhered to the 1997 NATO-Russia Council's founding agreement.
However, the NATO chief accused Russia of "a crack break" of the agreement.
"Today, we must face reality that Russia does not regard NATO as a partner," says Rasmussen.
From Russian documents and statements, it is clear that "they view us as opponents".
Increased NATO presence
Rasmussen has also announced his intention to strengthen NATO presence in Eastern Europe.
A "Readiness Action Plan" to be decided at the NATO Summit in Wales will ensure that "we will have more visible NATO presence in the East as long as necessary," said Rasmussen on Monday in Brussels.
Kiev and Moscow agree on new gas talks
Russia and Ukraine have officially agreed on new talks to resolve their gas dispute.
The negotiations were scheduled for next Saturday, said Russian energy minister Alexander Nowak on Monday.
A decision by the European Union is still to be taken whether it will also send a representative to the talks.
Because of the dispute over the gas price, Ukraine has not received any fuel from Russia for weeks.
EU energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger had recently communicated between the two sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also interrupt the gas supply for Europe.
Europe has around one third of its natural gas from Russian sources, a large part of which flows through Ukraine.
Merkel speaks power word: Toll will come "fully clear"
Now the chancellor confesses himself clearly again.
A free letter for all complicated details, however, is not.
Constant concerns from the CDU against the car toll have made the CSU feel sorry about it.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, after continuing resistance from her CDU, spoke a word of power for the introduction of a car toll.
"In order to say it quite clearly, she is in the coalition agreement, and she will come," said the head of the party on Monday after meetings of the CDU summit bodies in Berlin.
However, Merkel did not rely on a detailed model for the time being.
In the black and red government programme, "a certain parameter" is called.
Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) has made "a proposal, and it is now being further worked on".
However, the NRW-CDU insists on its No toll on all roads.
Merkel stressed that Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) also contributed constructively to the deliberations for a bill.
In addition to the topic, he also talked to Dobrindt about other ways to activate more private capital for investments in infrastructure, such as broadband development.
"There's nothing special about it." Schäuble left a "spiegel" report uncommented on Sunday, his house tested his own concept to reward motorway investors with toll revenue - after the 2017 election.
CSU-chef Horst Seehofer warned against developing in the cabinet toll concepts against the lead minister.
CDU-Bundesvize Armin Laschet reaffirmed his objections.
"The Coalition Treaty never assumed that all the circular and federal roads were to be tossed," said the North Rhine-Westphalian CDU head of state.
In that respect, it is an important signal that Seehofer has now announced to discuss the subject again.
Resistance to the plans also comes from the CDU Landesverbands Baden-Württemberg and Rheinland-Pfalz.
The background is fear that a toll will affect small border traffic to neighbouring countries.
Seehofer had demanded Coalition fidelity due to the toll criticism of the CDU.
The Left sees the plans as failed in the face of the dispute in the Union.
"The Murks-Maut is dead," said Party Chief Bernd Riexinger of the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Monday).
"The Minister fails with the toll." Dobrindt wants to introduce a vignette obligation on all German roads that will start in 2016.
However, domestic car owners may not be subject to additional burdens under Coalition Treaty.
They should therefore receive a full compensation for the toll via the car tax.
However, the model must not discriminate against foreign drivers in accordance with EU law because of their nationality.
Genetic disorder is often misdiagnosed
A British woman says she thought as a result of a misdiagnosis over many years that she would die.
Karin Rodgers lived almost all her youth in the belief that she had only a few years to live after she had been diagnosed with another disease.
It actually suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK reported that misdiagnosis is a common problem in people with CMT because there is so little known about this disease.
About 23,000 people in the UK are likely to suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness, an unsafe gait and curved toes.
Diseases also suffer from numbness or pain. The disease is incurable and progressive, which means that symptoms are getting worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed that she was suffering from Friedreich-Ataxia (FA) - a disease with very bad chances of survival.
Rodgers thought she was sitting in the wheelchair before she was 18, and she was dying before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children, who is 51 years old today, said, "As a child, I knew I couldn't do the same thing as the others.
I fell down constantly and everything lasted longer with me.
I could never ride with the other children roller shoe or skateboard and was often held in school because of my way to go and walk.
Rodgers said that at the age of 13 years after several operations to relieve her Achillessen and stretch her feet, she saw her health records when her doctor had left the room and read that she suffered from FA.
"I felt guilty because I was curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home looking for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA society," she said.
When I received an answer, I was shocked and panicked.
I thought I'd be in the wheelchair at age 18 and die at age 25, and in between I would slowly lose all my skills.
I made it all alone with me and planned my own funeral.
She said when she turned 17, she realized that her abilities had not decreased as much as she had imagined and asked her doctor.
He just got up and hugged me and said, "My love, I don't think you have it, or you'd be in the wheelchair now."
I think you're a little less life-threatening.
After some genetic tests, the CMT was detected.
"When he told me what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT Awareness Month to draw attention to this disease.
Stabsfeldwebel a. D. Berni Dieter has been working as a fireworks plant since the closure of the former military practice site.
For almost ten years, the former military practice in Munich has not been shot.
Nevertheless, every month the ammunition of death appears in the heart of the Swabian Alb biosphere.
The pomegranates are sometimes so dangerous that they need to be sprung on the spot.
A deafening bang sounds like the heart of the biosphere during the explosions.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot fell on the Munich military practice site, which was closed at the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operation.
Since then, the 6500-hectare area has been the core of the Swabian Alb biosphere area, which is open to hikers and cyclists on 13 designated paths.
Tax burden on businessmen in Washington increases with economic recovery
A recovery of the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax rulings for companies in the country increased slightly last year, while economic recovery accelerated, according to a newly published study last week, and the companies in the Washington area were no exception.
Companies in District, Maryland and Virginia together paid $27.6 billion to state and local authorities in the financial year 2013, an increase of 3.8 percent over the revenue of 2012 amounting to $26.6 billion.
Last year, the state and local tax burden of companies increased by 4.3 percent to $671 billion, compared to 3.9 percent a year earlier, and it was the third year of growth following the several years of falling 2009 and 2010.
State taxes increased more than local taxes by 4.3 percent, according to the study conducted by the services agency Ernst & Young with the Center for State Taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of the district's tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland's revenue comes from companies.
Virginia achieves the lowest tax revenue from companies at 28 percent.
Most of the increase in tax revenue is justified in a recovery of the real estate values of companies, the researchers say, which led to an increase in real estate taxes by 3.7 percent this year after the three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 percent.
While a large part of these profits came from large states such as California, New York and Texas, the process also seems to be in the Washington area.
Companies in the district, Maryland and Virginia jointly paid over $10 billion in state and local real estate taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 - an increase over the course of a year by 4.2 percent.
However, the apparent recovery of real estate values in Maryland is not so effective in increasing public and local tax revenue as real estate taxes are about one fifth of the tax rulings of companies.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.
"In Maryland: a large part of the real estate, especially in the tax area around D.C., is owned either by the government or by non-profit organizations that do not pay property taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, Managing Director of the Center on State Taxation.
For example, Maryland is forced to rely much more on income taxes in order to be able to offer the same services offered by other countries.
The recent recovery in corporate tax revenue cannot be attributed to the recovery of the real estate market alone
Business income also seems to recover, according to the data.
Companies in the region reported income taxes on state organizations of $2.3 billion compared to 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland took $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount of the region.
While the trend is moving in the same direction, local tax burden on companies does not increase evenly in all three places.
The rate of increase in the district was 4.3 percent of the national average, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9%.
Only Virginia reported an under-average tax revenue of 4.1 percent.
Virginia has, at 6 percent in all three fields of office, the significantly lowest corporate income taxes (in all three, there are fixed corporate tax rates).
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 percent and in the district is relatively high 9.975 percent.
A comparable study by the US Chamber of Commerce at the beginning of this year showed that Virginia requires lower state and local corporate taxes and a better tax environment overall than in Maryland.
In the study, the district was not studied.
Despite the advantages Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbors.
North Carolina has passed laws to reduce its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 percent in the coming year.
If the state continues to achieve its income targets in the coming year, this law could reduce the corporate income tax rate of the State by up to 3 percent by 2017.
In the meantime, it seems to be better for small businesses in the Washington area, so they pay more state and local taxes, according to the latest study.
Corporate taxes paid as personal income taxes by small businessmen - a transitional structure that most small businesses are organized - in the district, Maryland and Virginia last year rose by 20 percent to $2.4 billion, a significant faster growth rate than corporate taxes as a whole.
The researchers say that the trend and increase in corporate taxes throughout the country will probably continue this year, with an increase in general multi-defense revenue for the state and local governments by 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period of the previous year.
Nevertheless, the Washington area could be lagging behind if the Federal Government's reduction in expenditure had an impact on the labour market in the region.
Partner city: German beer for Guangzhou
Hops and malt - also in China a popular combination.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt's partner city in China now wishes for a brewery and also hopes for a direct flight link between the two cities.
German beer, brewed in Frankfurt's partner city Guangzhou - this is the urgent wish of the officials in China.
"We would be very pleased if a German brewery were to settle in our city," said the vice secretary-general of the South Chinese metropolis, Li Yiwei, this week while visiting a SPD delegation in his city.
In the course of the conversation, the official of the ruling Communist Party of China repeatedly returned to this concern of the twelve-million metropolis.
Guangzhou, also known as the Canton in Germany, was one of the richest cities in China, Li.
Therefore, people also had the purchasing power to afford themselves German beer.
Hessian SPD chairman Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel, who led the German political delegation, said to the host that he would be looking back in Germany for a possible partner for the project.
"It doesn't take much for beer: good water, grain and joy of life," he added at lunch with the party leader in Guangzhou.
This joy of life already radiates Mr. Li, he flattered the host.
As a result, the filling officer from Guangzhou met with Schäfer-Gümbel - but with red wine, which was served for the meal.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao dates back to German brewing art.
Tsingtao-Bier is brewed after the German purity bid.
More business
A second wish of the Chinese hosts would be a direct flight link between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Vice-Party Head Li.
The Lufthansa had offered the flight earlier, but in 2012 deleted for economic reasons.
"It would be worthwhile again," the local politician showed himself convinced.
"Business traffic between our two cities is increasing steadily."
At present, travelers have to take the detour via Changsha in the province of Hunan, lamented Li.
Also the administration of the province of Guangdong, whose capital is Guangzhou, is hoping for the flight.
The Deputy Governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, highlighted this wish in his conversation with the Social Democrats.
"This is a very good idea," replied Schäfer-Gümbel - the Chinese Deputy Minister Li Jinjun, an intimate expert in Germany, nodded.
Associated partnership
The lousy Vice-Chairman of Guangzhou hopes that he will be able to attend Frankfurt next year for a partnership meeting.
Li Yiwei was already at the Main, but not yet in this function.
He did not come into office until this year after his predecessor had been expelled from office for corruption accusations.
The local party leader Wan Qinglian also had to go.
The action against the Guangzhou officials is part of a national campaign against corruption in the party and administration imposed by Head of State Xi Jinping with hardness.
The new leader Li Yiwei had worked in front of his party career for an American company, which is extremely unusual in the Chinese Communist Party.
Before taking office in Guangzhou, he worked as a chief officer in Fujian, where the car builder VW built a large plant.
Frankfurt has officially entered more than a dozen city partnerships.
The link to Guangzhou 9000 kilometers away is one of the ones that are maintained by both sides, for example with a student exchange.
Last year, the 25th anniversary of the German-Chinese connection was celebrated.
The southern Chinese metropolis on the Perlfluss is almost as strong with its economic power as all Hessen.
Next year, they want to reach a gross domestic product of 250 billion euros, reported Li.
Family of Joan Rivers "presses the thumbs"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious three days ago since she was sent to a hospital in New York City, but her daughter has been hoping that the 81-year-old comedian will recover from her illness.
"Thank you for your continued love and support," said Melissa Rivers today in a announcement.
We're all pushing the thumbs.
Her mother, according to sources, was sent to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency for heart failure in a clinic at the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy.
The doctors keep them deliberately sedated and under close observation until they are more satisfied with their condition, which is still described as "serious".
The reactions came from many sides, including in the form of overwhelming online support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmentally friendly vacuum cleaners and rising wages
In future, stricter environmental standards will apply to cars and vacuum cleaners that are now on the market.
Similar to refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners will receive a label from 1 September on which the buyer can detect at a glance central data such as the energy efficiency of the device.
For new cars, more stringent nitrogen oxide values are applicable in the Euro 6 pollutant class.
In addition, there is more money for the scaffolding farmers: they receive a nationally uniform minimum wage of 10.25 euros.
Amazon buys tswitch for 1.04 billion $
AMAZON just confirmed what information had reported on Monday morning: The online retailer - and video producer, and a variety of other things - buys the video streaming service Tswitch for $1.04 billion (970 million US$).
The announcement comes surprising, not because no one had expected a takeover of twitch, but because it was widely suspected that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago it looked like the sale of Tswitch to Google's video service for a cool billion decided, and the collaboration also appeared natural.
Twitch, which was only founded three years ago as Justin.tv, was started as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to publish their braur pieces in games, a "YouTube for live games", such as an insider.
The tswitch interface.
And "let's play", a video genre in which better knowers give the (most older) games a touch of secret science theatre, are already very popular on YouTube.
It's just that YouTube is often called if you want to describe Tswitch, so the news that YouTube wanted to buy Tswitch was taken a little boring, a textbook example of an established technology company that buys up a potential competitor.
It is a mystery why the deal did not come about with YouTube, as the company reportedly was willing to pay as much as Amazon.
All we know about this right now is this statement by Emmet Shear, President of Tswitch: "We have opted for Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions and they want to help us get there faster."
Another secret, honestly, is the incredible success of Tswitch.
For Snobs like me, who explain that they prefer to do sports rather than watch it, it is difficult to understand the attraction that is supposed to be watching others play instead of taking control consoles into their own hands.
It's one thing to look over the shoulder at 3 o'clock in the morning, while she's slicking through Resident Evil, and something else to watch a spider shoot 20 times in a row in Call of Duty.
You could see all these games right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games, so watching without your own control of the eye perspective can be a really good recipe for headaches.
I admit that the quick runs in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age complete all games in record time are entertaining.
But as long as there is not a game or humor virtuoso, his twitch channel is probably not so interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know about it?
Tswitch is called by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic peaks.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money from it?
It's hard to imagine that Tswitch is as elegantly integrated into Amazon Instant Video as YouTube Tswitch could have just swallowed.
But Tswitch has something that every company would like: thousands of young men who are being advertised as advertisers.
As the chairman of Tswitch, Shear, said, Amazon and Tswitch both "believe in the future of gaming," and the medium shows no signs of shrinking, not even - swallowing - as a spectator sport.
At the Hüpfburg at the Burggartenfestival there was a lot going on Sunday evening.
The concept of the organizers was correct.
Despite the strong rainfall on Saturday evening, an estimated 1200 music fans came to the open-air festival in Burggarten.
At times, the intake had to be stopped.
"That was annoyed," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salzwedel l Light and fun.
From two Spanish words Maxim Sagraj and Ron Sem formed the name Amula.
The open air in the Salzwedeler Burggarten is supposed to radiate brightness in the day and evening through various shows.
Well, the fun comes by itself anyway.
This was already shown in the early Sunday when the first visitors to the Open Air opened.
The organizers had promised a feast for all generations.
And they succeeded.
Around the supply stations on the Burggartenwiese, Salzwedeler, as well as guests from the nearby and other surroundings, had made themselves comfortable.
They followed the first live appearances, swiped with their feet, enjoyed cool drinks - in short: pure relaxation and enjoyment were announced.
And that's all over the generations.
While the one was ringing on ceilings on the extra-cared white sand at the beach bar, others were chatting on a quarter of wine in the Vinothek, the young people were waving on the Hüpfburg, which was a great attraction for the smaller guests.
But even when childishing, the volunteers had their hands full in the truest sense of the word to become the master of the Andrang and to enchant imaginative creations in the little faces.
The larger ones used the kicker tables or participated in a skateboard workshop, which the Goodfoot crew made of salted wool.
Until the big rain came.
Shortly before 5.30 p.m., he looked down on the visitors, especially families looking for the wide and dry.
But the attractiveness of the feast did not stop.
"More people came than expected," said Ron Sem, who spoke of a "success all over the line".
That is why a repetition of the big party in the coming year is not against anything.
Although it is still necessary to work on the content and size of the event, Shem made clear in a first report on Sunday compared to the popular vote.
He was annoyed that in the meantime the intake had to be stopped.
Obviously, the security company had been booked with too little power.
The result: Some who had already paid no longer came to the site.
The resonance had been very good.
In a first careful estimate, the Salzwedeler spoke to co-organisers of about 1200 visitors who roamed in the castle garden.
There were problems with sound technology.
The Hip-Hop band Block`n`Rox broke off their appearance therefore.
The technicians were unable to create half a reasonable sound.
The planned Shisha lounges could not be built because the tents could not be brought to Salzwedel because of a tire pan.
"But next year they will be there," says the organizer.
The premiere of the Amula-Open-Air was more than successful by the number of visitors.
And that in bad weather.
However, the organizers have made some mistakes that will be left for the first time but have to be eliminated at the second edition.
In the social network Facebook, the organizers must also be critical.
"Sorry, but for twelve euros you just expected more," says Melanie Meier on the event page.
"Unfortunately, you have taken over a little," says Ele Zimmermann in the same place.
Others don't see the initial problems very closely.
I think it's very good that some not only talk stupidly, but also really try to put something on their feet.
Hat off!", Stephanie Jenß writes about the amula.
Now the organizers remain a year to turn these criticisms off.
New Radom in Berkum: Wattberg's landmark shrinks
It is not expected.
Rather, the component that is ready is waiting to be used in the distinctive building.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: almost 50 years after the construction of the TIRA space observation radar, the cover, the so-called Radom, is completely renewed.
The new radiom will be a little smaller with a diameter of 47,5 meters than the old one.
However, the size remains world record.
The last step to complete the new case is the cap replacement
The upper quarter of the old case is separated and removed with a crane.
After that, the last quarter of the new case is put on.
As far as the weather is concerned, the action will go over the stage at the beginning of this week.
Participant in the Ice Bucket Challenge disintegrates pine
Isabelle Roberts from Great Britain cried so much when her ice-cold water was poured over her head that she violated the bone structure of her face.
This Ice Bucket Challenge went painfully next door.
A woman was sent to the hospital after she had screamed so much at the Ice Bucket Challenge that she ran out of the jaw.
Isabelle Roberts from the United Kingdom circulated so much when her ice-cold water was poured over her head that she violated her facial structure.
"The water was so cold that I cried, and while I did, my jaw just stopped," she said to The Mirror.
Icewater is poured over the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts just seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but it didn't go, the jaw was cut, and then I understood something was wrong.
My mother and sister saw this too and almost laughed, but I had to go to the emergency room.
The 20-year-old from Great Britain was sent to the hospital to rethink the jaw after attending the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip was linked to an internet sensation and a thousand times on Facebook and Twitter.
Will the Burgvereine soon pull back on a strand?
In the last place, there was a conflict between the two Wolfratshaus Burgvereinen.
Now the board of directors are thinking about possible cooperation.
As a model for the reconstruction of the Wolfratshaus Castle, the deceased Richard Dimbath, former chairman of the Wolfratshaus Burgfreunde, led the project in the French Guédelon.
A year ago, there was no good climate between the Burgverein and the Burgfreunde Wolfratshausen.
So far, the views seemed to differ as to how to deal with the history of Wolfratshaus Castle and a possible reconstruction.
Now the two camps are moving together: discussions are soon to be held about a common approach.
Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfreunde) confirm this on request of our newspaper.
"I called Mr Piffl and suggested that we could sit down once," Sjöberg reports.
In his opinion, all members of both associations could again take a lead in the future.
Thus, there are faster visible successes.
While the Burgfreunde around the suddenly deceased Richard Dimbath until the last time had in mind a reconstruction of the castle on the mountain forest, for the Burgverein um Sjöberg the "Development and Experienceability" of the site is in the forefront.
Herbert Piffl, second chairman of the Burgfreunde, was very pleased with the call, according to his own information.
Since Dimbath's death, he's been in front of the castle friends.
A new chairman will be found in mid-September at a meeting of members.
Currently, according to the 74-year-old, the club counts about 40 members.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we left the club's activities out of respect." This "thinking phase" was necessary to "think how it could continue."
According to Piffl, the new chairman will then go into the conversation with the Burgverein.
Until then, the Burgfreunde could also create an up-to-date mood within their group.
A candidate for the Presidency is not yet available, says Piffl.
"But I'm confident that someone will find himself." He doesn't want to run for himself because he has his residence in Bad Tölz.
The new chairman should be a Wolfratshauser.
The Tölzer wants to work on the project "but very much likes to continue working on it".
The different points of view in terms of reconstruction will probably remain in the eyes of Piffls in the near future.
He honoured Dimbath as a "missionary" who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar, well advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an air lock.
Due to their high participation in the population as well as by voluntary helpers from all over the world, they are a tourist magnet.
Piffl: "I was also skeptical at the beginning.
But over time, I became more and more convinced that it would be useful to push forward the project."It could be a "institutional feature" for the Flößerstadt.
There's nothing else here.
Moreover, the project could be financed by EU grants, visitor tickets and potential sponsors, Piffl believes.
"I personally do not want to throw the idea of reconstruction overboard." He hopes that the Burgverein may be moving at this point.
Their goal of first documenting the story "is important and good".
After that, you could see on.
Smart ways to save on university textbooks
As the cost of university textbooks for many students amounts to more than $1,000 a year, the fast-second semester student Matt Schroeder considered a clever saving idea.
He invented a loan system for books from students of higher semesters and offered a nominal compensation to delay the sale.
"My math book usually costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a Chick-fil-A cookies," said Schroeder, 19 who attended the Covenant College in Georgia.
The books required for the last semester would have cost him $430, he said.
He spent $120.
The college management reported that on average, students spend more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and study material, but that there were different cost-absorbing options for the students.
Online stores and creative approaches such as the Schroeder are increasingly the solution of the choice for the students.
The renting of textbooks is becoming more popular, and so students can use a book for a semester, often at a significantly cheaper price than when buying.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 university bookshops, reported that the rental of dictionaries has doubled since 2011.
Surveys in the industry show that about a quarter of the books were rented in college bookshops last spring, said Neebos Vice President Tevor Meyer.
Less than half of all textbooks are purchased from campus bookshops according to the National Association of College Stores.
Here's the one time for the best deals.
Buy online
Some new books cost online only one third of the price for which they are available in the campus bookshop.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $290, but can be obtained at the specialized textbook retailer Chegg.com for $29.99.
Used Buy
If you don't care about the notes of other or normal traces of usage, used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is used on Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, graduate student at Brigham Young University, says he spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used issue of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business."
The book was sold new for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls, recommended students to ask their professors if previous expenses are allowed.
Sometimes the updates for the seminar work are not relevant.
In such cases, older expenditure can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest edition.
Besides Chegg and Amazon, Half.com from eBay Inc is also a popular alternative for used books.
Renting
The rental of textbooks is worth considering if you treat them quite well, remember to return them and you do not want to keep the books after completion of the course.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased book.
For example, a student could rent "Calculus" for the duration of a semester for about $20.
Find out about the terms of the business you rent, including the penalty fees, which may apply for writing notes, signed or traces of use.
tenants are careful: If you do not return the book, the penalty fees may even exceed the price of a new book.
Email Books
E-books instead of conventional textbooks are also an option.
Sometimes these books are rented de facto by providing an electronic license for a given period of wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
At Chegg you can rent "Calculus" for 6 months for about $61.
Bracey says that students in literature courses often find the best offers, as many classics today can be downloaded free of charge, while scientific and engineering textbooks can be very expensive.
I'm sure you'll look around.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon attend Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for the price determination of books, as you can be so sure to find the right textbook.
And before ordering online, you should check, Gault says, whether the book is actually in stock.
He learned this lesson on the hard tour.
He bought a book that had four weeks of delivery and finally paid the full price in the College bookshop.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" did not become a cashier
"The Expandables 3" of Sylvester Stallone played less than 30 million dollars of his 90 million dollars budget in the USA, while "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" recorded only 12 million dollars of his budget of 70 million dollars.
The film "Sex Tape", tailored to Cameron Diaz, recorded only 14.6 million dollars at the opening weekend, while children's films such as "Drachenzämmen easily made 2" also disappointed the revenue.
An article by the Telegraph film critic Robbie Collins suggests that the lack of quality in the films could be the reason for the children's films themselves.
In 2014 Collin described "the worst year" as "the worst year" for children's films and described "Drachenzämmen easily made 2" as a purely "functional" fantasy continuation.
For films for a slightly older target group, however, it seems that the quality of films is not necessarily the problem.
In July Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic evaluation for every summer film launch, which was shown on at least 2000 canvases between the American Memorial Day and July 20, 2013 and the current year.
The results are based on the opinion of cinematographers and film critics and suggest that this year's film hits are equivalent to those of last year's.
Some commentators believe that the development is due to changing vision habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's shortly-to-date jungle book film, said to Hollywood Reporter's website: "I think the times are changing."
We must accept this and not try to follow the past.
In contrast to the currently weak cash results of Hollywood productions, Netflix has recently achieved sales with the streaming content of 1.2 billion dollars, almost twice as much as last year, in which sales amounted to 837 million dollars.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios for focusing too much on comic filming and prophesied a "core melt" of Hollywood.
In the light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that his gloomy prophecy could well contain a true core.
However, due to the potential cash beaters expected in summer 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic:
The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, recently described the decline in cash income as simply "cyclic" and said to Hollywood reporter: "The next summer will be the biggest summer at the cinema bank at all, and no one will worry about business any more."
A few years ago, when the 2nd table tennis district class was removed for streamlining the league classification, it was a step in the right direction.
Now the Deutsche Tischtennisbund has added an additional 3rd Bundesliga to the program.
The result: whoever has not ascended has descended.
While Göttingen's top-class team Torpedo has avoided the descent in the Oberliga-Relegation, in the coming season, only fifth-class play.
==References====External links==* Official website
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Lower Saxony League, as well as the boys of the SC Weende.
The SG Lenglers and the Torpedo Reserve are entering the new Association League, and there are no Göttingen clubs in the Landesliga.
With the ladies the TTV Geismar plays in the Bundesliga, the Torpedo second in the Landesliga.
What looks like a better district class from the composition is now the new district superliga South.
TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Oberder SV, Langenholtensen, FC Weser and the TTC are appearing here.
In the district league play as regional representative Dransfeld and SC Weende, in the district class of TTC II, Rot-Weiß, the upper side of the SV II and the teams of the TTV Geismar II and III. The district top league of the ladies starts at least in goal strength.
Güntersen, the TTC and the TTV Geismar II are here with the game.
Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen are on the run in the district league.
With nine teams each
The SC Weende sends his girls to the little district league.
Also the District League season of the SCW boys - there still starts Torpedo II - is not complete.
In a district class, Geismar, Tuspo Weende and the Upper SV go into the season.
In the first season of the newly founded regional association, the two Göttingen Kreisligen start with nine teams each.
In the Western season are the Red-White II, Upper SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lengler II.
Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen play in the Eastern season.
The women's Kreisliga consists of Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and the SG Rhume.
This is still better than in the district of Osterode, where there are no women's teams at all on the circle level.
It is remarkable that no one of the six classes of the 2nd circuit reaches the target strength, here the innovative and driven circuit board will have to think about it before.
Nato Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
On the weekend there were protests of opponents of the NATO Summit in Newport.
On Saturday hundreds gathered in the center of Newport to an anti-nato march.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered in Cardiff in front of the town hall to hold a so-called counter-hope.
Stephen Fairclough has followed developments on the weekend and has talked to demonstrators who have traveled from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers flown out of the Blue Mountains
TWO youthful bush walkers were safed with the rope winds after they were caught the night over in the Blue Mountains in NSW.
THE 16-year-old girl and the 19-year-old man set out for their tour shortly after Sunday afternoon in Govett's Leap in Blackheath.
Concerned relatives called the police at about 8 p.m. when the two had not returned home.
A search force from local police and rescue services broke out and the pair was found at around 23 o'clock near the Bridal Veil waterfalls.
The girl had been hurt by the knee and the man had fallen and had hit his head.
Rescuers stayed overnight with the couple, and they were flew out on Monday morning.
They were supplied in stable condition with an ambulance to the Blue Mountains Hospital.
Escalize anti-government protests in Pakistan
The around 1000 demonstrators had been forced by soldiers from the PTV building, said information minister Pervaiz Rashid.
After about half an hour, the transmitter had resumed the radiation.
PTV director Athar Farooq said that the demonstrators equipped with sticks had damaged devices in the editor.
Dead or injured have not been reported.
The demonstrators call for the resignation of the head of government, to which they accuse election fraud.
The police reported that about a kilometer away from the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, on Monday, there were again clashes of around 3,000 demonstrators with security forces.
According to hospital records, a police officer was injured.
At the weekend, at least three people had been killed and more than 500 injured when demonstrators tried to get to Sharif's residence.
They demand the resignation of the Prime Minister.
On Sunday evening after a meeting in the army headquarters, the powerful military had called for a political solution to the conflict "without wasting time and using it without violence".
It also stated in the Communication: "The army remains obliged to ensure the security of the state".
The escalating violence has been a source of concern for a military intervention that has already been more frequent in the past.
The protests led by opposition politician Imran Khan and preacher Tahirul Qadir have continued since the day of independence on August 14.
Sharif refuses to resign.
Khan and Qadri had called on their followers on Sunday to endure.
"We won't go back without having forced Sharif to resign," Khan said.
Qadri spoke similarly.
Khan accuses Sharif of winning the parliamentary election last May by fraud.
Qadri calls for the resignation of the central and provincial governments.
Then a transitional government should reform the electoral system and proclaim new elections.
More than 40 000 security forces are in use to protect the government district.
At first, the demonstrators had waited peacefully in front of Parliament until Khan and Qadri called on them to come to Sharif's residence on the weekend.

With the 2:0 on Grödig, for Rapid a bitter week on Sunday has taken a conciliatory end.
"The victory is very liberating," said Trainer Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached an intermediate depth with the Aus in the Europa League on Thursday.
"The success experience was extremely important," confirmed Captain and Torschütze Steffen Hofmann, who made three progress with green-white.
Schrammel-Traumtor brings Rapid to Siegerstraße Rapid has shown the right response to the disappointment against Helsinki with the second season victory and goes to the Landesspiel-Pause with a success experience.
"We wanted to show a positive response," said foreign defender Thomas Schrammel, who, with his magnificent leadership Volley of the Sixteenseck in the 14th minute, won the course.
"I thought I'd cut in all the frustration from Thursday and put it under the slat," said the 26-year-old smiling.
When Schrammel met in a federal league on November 13, 2010 for the last time, it was still for Ried.
The first championship hit in the Rapid-Dress will therefore remain his special memory.
"For me, this is something very special, I'm from the rapid growth," said Schrammel.
Due to Mario Pavelic's short-term Becken-Blessur, Schrammel moved from the left to the right-hand defensive side and made his business very good there.
He has enough experience that he can also exercise this position in a mirror.
He's earned the gate, he's already done some assistants this year," said Barisic.
Team shows character Schrammel also delivered the flank to the 2:0 by Hofmann after an hour, which finally made the decision.
The guests could have written a letter before that.
"Thanks to God we have had a little luck today," said Schrammel, who thus alluded to the separation of performance and result over the past few weeks: "The results did not vote, but the playful was always good compared to the last year."
Barisic even found that one had been "better in many games than today" - against "the strongest team that played this season in this stadium".
The first three-pointer since 26 July has therefore proved that the team structure is intact despite the setbacks: "Today my team has shown that it has character".
To him no less pleased: "That we finally played too zero again."
A lot of work during a national game break The fact that Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger have several failures to complain about and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger gave their starting debuts make the victory even more valuable.
"You mustn't forget that," said Barisic, who lost over the past three days with Behrendt and Pavelic players, "who have been very stable lately".
The national game break therefore had to be used to " lick wounds and to increase a little in the physical field", explained Barisic, who has five U21 selection actors in his ranks.
One to which the break is probably particularly located is Captain Hofmann.
He tears down for the team, goes over pain.
Especially in this difficult phase, he has shown that he is a very important player for us," said Barisic.
Hofmann gave the game Rapids not only the structure before his change in the 68th minute, but also achieved the second goal.
For the 33-year-old who finished his 350th Bundesliga game, it was the first hit out of the game since November 2, 2013 (4:2 on the Admira).
Hofmann: "Can't believe that everything is good now" "We must have had a little luck too, but at some point the luck must also come back to us.
Now it was high time," said Hofmann.
He urged concentrated further work: "You can't always see this black and white.
We haven't played as badly as it was presented in the last few weeks.
But we must not believe that everything is good now.
He could not dispute the importance of his role for the team.
It's a very young team that I can help a lot at the moment.
They still stick to me in certain phases," said Hofmann.
Grödig-Coach Michael Baur had little to blame himself and his team.
He regretted the quick counter hit "out of the magic gate category", as well as the regular gate of use in the 40th minute, which was wrongly recognized by referee colleague.
The only accusation I can make to the team is that we weren't going to gate in some phases concrete enough.
We've had too few conclusions.
Interior defender Maximilian Karner saw it similarly: "It started badly, but then we found it pure and even made a gate.
In general, more would have been in it.
Under this eyelash, rest reigns
We showed a powerful tribe at our mystery task of the summer series "My piece of Röner Glück" last Friday.
Several of these tree giants still exist in the district, the pictured specimen is the "geßrußiche" above Unterweißenbrunn.
A bumpy footpath leads up to the 600-year-old oak.
It passes through groups, basalt stone piles and basalt stone seas.
A little below the quarries of Bauersberg, one kilometer north of the road to Weisbach, it stands.
Vital looks the natural monument, it rises beyond the other trees of the surrounding area and reminds of an American mammoth tree with an area of more than eight meters.
A small Buddha on a tree stump indicates that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
Despite intensive research, however, there were only indications of the origin of the name.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider specifically consulted the Bishop's Archive and asked older people from Unterweißenbrunn to find out what the subject matter is with the rest of the mind.
The result of his research remained the rather sober explanation for the name.
Thus, until about 80 years ago, the goat herds were said to have driven their animals from underwhite brown to the tiredly reddished meadows freed from stones.
At the foot of the tree, the exhausted animal keepers should have rested from the ascent.
In the meantime, the area has regained its importance, because in the meadows, in fact, breeding goats again.
The area has also been declared the core zone of the biosphere reserve, Schneider has further found out.
However, when entering the stone collections you should be careful, because the basalt warmed by the sun is also a popular place of stay for crusaders.
A hiking trail leads from Unterweißenbrunn to the tree, but it is a little hidden.
Further paths are signposted, which climb up towards the High Rhythm and invite you to an extensive hike.
Where's the Wasserburg?
However, a water castle, which is sought in our next task, is rather rare to be found in the height.
The reflection in the tomb already gives a good impression of the building, but we have in the district some historical buildings to which the building counterfee could fit.
Where is our "piece of Röner Glück"?

After weeks of tuition, Italy's Prime Minister and President-in-Office, Matteo Renzi, imposed last week on the EU Special Summit the nomination of his Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini as head of the EU's foreign policy, she will succeed British Catherine Ashton.
Renzi sees, as the government-based daily La Repubblica reflects, the appeal of his Mogherini, who is also a favorite in the government team, to strengthen the position of the social democrats and his own in the EU.
He also expects a boost for his "reform package" in Italy.
Last but not least, Renzi hopes that the repeatedly demanding left party base against him will calm down, because Mogherini will be assigned to it - albeit in a moderate way.
In contrast to the conservative representatives with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Poland, nominated as President-in-Office of the Council, Donald Tusk, will be the dominant opinion in Rome in order to achieve political compensation.
The EU's chief diplomat will also be Vice-President Juncker.
The still outstanding agreement of the EU Parliament is considered to be safe.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly have called the nomination of the 41-year-old politician of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) a "important recognition" of the role of Italy in the EU.
La Repubblica spreads optimism that the leading party offices, which have been proven for nearly two decades by Mogherini, are well-known for their ambition, will show that the "estandard challenges" will grow.
The native Roman is married and has two daughters.
Her party career began in 1996 in the youth organization of the then Democratic di Sinistra (left-wing democrats), which joined Margherita in 2008 with the Catholic Centre Party for the Social Democratic PD.
In 1999, Mogherini became Vice President of the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth (European Young Socialists) for three years.
With the election of 2001 in the Party Council of Left-Democrats, she joined the High Party Policy, working in the Department of Foreign Policy, whose head she soon became.
Its traditional focus on Italian foreign policy, such as the Middle East, was known by studies on NATO operations in Afghanistan, in which Italy is involved with a military quota, contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and with the democrats in the USA.
Since 2008, she has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies, where she is an expert in defence and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became a Premier in February 2014, he called Mogherini to his foreign minister.
Today, if the PD has a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country, which contributed to the more than 40 percent of the party's votes in the EU elections in May, Federica Mogherini will have a share in it, as noted in PD travels.
The premise in Brussels that the new EU External Commissioner had too little diplomatic experience, so if there is a lack of substance, the PD will be recruited.
In Brussels, particularly by Poland and the Baltic members, the consequences of Mogherini's mistrust are being pursued for the crisis in Ukraine and are defamated as a "rust country-friendly course".
It supports the Pipeline South Stream operated by the Russian company Gasprom, which is intended to transport Russian natural gas directly to southern Europe under the supervision of Ukraine, which also serves the energy security of Italy.
After Renzi took office as EU President in July, Mogherini traveled to Moscow on her first visit to the state.
Photos that they showed with Putin at the shake hands were taken in Brussels with pity, as well as inviting the Kreml chief for October to a Milan economic summit.
A total of nine young people started their training at emz-Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
This includes an azubi who has previously completed another training in the company.
In four training professions, the new employees will be active in the future: electronics (three trainees), mechatronics (two), tool mechanics (two) and process mechanics (two).
All Azubis come from the district of Schwandorf: Tobias Braun and Thomas Bücherl from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidgaden, Johannes Beer from Neunburg form forest, Felix Domaier from Oberviechtach, Daniel Worffree and Sebastian Zahner from Pfreimd as well as Ferdinand Strebl from Teunz.
The new trainees previously attended primary and secondary schools and real schools.
From Wednesday to Friday, the trainees of all the years and the trainers will take part in a team training event to Oberammergau, where, among other things, a full-day migration and rafting is on the agenda.
The company counts 435 and 950 employees worldwide.
The number of trainees spread across all years is 27.
The Socialists in France should "keep their mouth shut and put France in order," said Francois Hollande's most important ally.
Mr. Valls called on the deeply split left to show "their love" for the controversial socialist president, whose cabinet conversion met with disapproval of the vast majority of the French.
The President deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It's our duty to stay by his side," he said with great applause.
As a grueling gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government would not call into question the controversial 35-hour week in France despite strong demands for a reduction in the regime of Emmanuel Macrons, the new Minister of Economic Affairs.
On Saturday, Mr. Hollande urgently called on his fellow socialists to show themselves "united" with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the Minister of Justice, thrusts sand into the driveway in which she acted at a meeting of apostate socialist MPs and criticised the Socialist Party for taking the French "the faith in their future".
Marine Le Pen, the far right leader of the National Front, mocked the constant tomb struggles of the socialists and said that she could not imagine that the new Valls government would last for more than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls has no, they are forced to form a new government if the old has not even survived a summer.
"And the new will not survive the autumn or winter either," said Miss Le Pen to supporters.
She repeated her party's reputation for a resolution of the Parliament and said that she was confident that she would stand out as a winner in favour of the elections and would be ready for the government.
The ruling party of France suffered a defeat in the municipal elections in March and the right-wing national front was in the front of the EU elections in May.
A survey in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche revealed that 76 percent of French people believe that the Socialist Party is in danger of falling into several rival groups before the end of the Dutch term of office 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at the Sciences Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government did not aim to improve the economy and the record unemployed.
"There is a small window for opportunities, but public opinion must quickly feel that things are changing," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could worsen further.
Norwegian Cruise just before a deal with Prestige Cruises of $3 billion
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest cruiser in the world, is leading to the acquisition of the competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc for about $3 billion, according to industry experts.
A deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to the luxury cruise ships of Prestige Cruises and its wealthy clientele, while it is in competition with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
An agreement could already be announced this week, said the sources on Sunday and warned that the talks could also end without results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20 percent of Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to remain anonymous as the negotiations were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while a speaker for Apollo rejected a comment.
The company Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean Sea, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenue was $2.57 billion in 2013, an increase of 13 percent compared to 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also located in Miami, operates under the brand names Oceania and Regent, which together operate eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenue for 2013 of $1.2 billion, an increase of 6 percent compared to the previous year.
The cruise industry is a total of about $29 billion, and in the next few years it is expected to benefit from the strengthening of the middle class in emerging countries such as China and India.
The companies are trying to position themselves as the best choice among cruise providers for these new customers.
Prestige Cruises applied to the US regulatory authorities in January 2014.
Apollo is the majority shareholder in the company since a $ 850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was created in its current form in 2000 by a merger with a cruise provider owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a leisure and casinoic group under the control of the Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise went to the stock exchange in January 2013.
At the end of June, according to licensing authorities, Genting held 28 percent of the shares, Apollo 20 percent of the shares and the private equity company TPG Capital LP held an 8 percent share in the company.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruises together have over 82 percent of the passenger capacity in American cruise ships, according to the original application documents for the Prestige Cruises stock exchange.
Pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China the day after the election decision.
A peking faithful group swirled near the Chinese flag.
On Sunday, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress adopted a framework law allowing only two or three candidates for the leadership election in Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first achieve the majority support of a nomination committee, which is likely to be filled with peking faithful members.
This decision will make it almost impossible for oppositional democrats to be allowed to vote and will cause pro-democracy activists to face their threat and to paralyze Hong Kong's financial centre with "Occupy Central" protests.
Political reforms have long been a controversial issue in Hong Kong, and China's party leadership fears that the calls for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following the publication of a Beijing White Paper setting out China's leadership over Hong Kong in June, democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on the electoral process in the Special Administrative Region, where hundreds of thousands marched into the city's business district and organized a sit-in there.
Lis survey is organised by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
The Deputy Chairman of the Permanent Committee's Legal Commission, Zhang Rongshun, and the Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macau Office of the Council of State, Feng Wei, should be consulted during the day.
Student activists announced that they would gather in front of the Hong Kong leadership office in the afternoon.
United Kingdom did not provide any democratic elements until the end of the 150-year colonial government in Hong Kong.
Putin requires Kiev to open "Statehood talks" with the Eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to Russian media reports, demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian government launch the fight against the separatists in the east of the country and immediately open negotiations on the "statehood" of the apostate region.
His spokesperson Dimitri Peskov later made it clear that Putin did not mean that the territory of Eastern Russia under the control of the separatists would be part of Russia, but that its status to Ukraine would have to be redefined in order to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.
Putin's call to the Kiev government for negotiations at an eye-to-face with the pro-Russian insurgents, however, fits in with the strategy that he has apparently pursued since the beginning of the outpourings five months ago: aid for the separatists in taking over areas and pressure on the Ukrainian government to enable the newly proclaimed Novorossija region to have factual independence for an alliance with Russia instead of with the West.
In an interview with the state television channel One, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to reconquer the territories held by separatists in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were taken in March and April after Moscow had annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on 18 March.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently called the occupied area "Novorossija" or "Neurussland", a term reminiscent of the pre-revolutionary glamour of the Russian Empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who, in the course of the campaigns of Ukrainian politicians for the elections on 26 Oct. and while government groups attack civilian communities in the areas held by separatists, hope to be "captured in their illusions," Itar-Tass reported.
"We need to start discussions immediately, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organisation of society and the state status of the South-East Ukrainians in order to preserve the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskow said that Putin's reference to statehood must be seen in the context of greater autonomy, which has been discussed by the Kiev leadership for months to dispel fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are at risk.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the eastern areas the necessary autonomy, said Peskow.
This is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, said Peskov, "because it is not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but about an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The clarification of the Kremlin speaker to correct the "fehlin interpretation" of Putin's remarks underlined Russia's leadership's claim to deal with the separatist rebellion in the East, as opposed to the direct annexation of Crimea, which is the majority of the 2 million inhabitants of ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have far greater difficulties in annexed the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in the eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and pre-conflict surveys produced a large majority for the stay in Ukraine.
The autonomy addressed by Russian diplomats on international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations, giving the Kremlin de facto control over an area connecting the Russian territory with Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, which was annexed five months ago, is home to most of the Russian Navy as well as an important trading port and historical coastal region.
The regions between the Rostov area in Russia and Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian military.
In his speech on 7 June, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed that Ukrainian legislation - after new elections - should consider additions to the Constitution, which would allow the respective territories to have greater control over their finances and the status of languages.
But his idea of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to that of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels whose armament and incitement Moscow is accused of.
Putin's last call to Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders at eye level followed a further advance of the rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks invaded the previously peaceful region along the Azov Sea into the Eastern Sea.
Russia-supported separatists, who, according to fears of Ukrainian security officers, are the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to Crimea, took control of Novosibirsk.
For this reason, massive civil and military preparations have been made to secure Mariupol, a steel industry port with 500,000 inhabitants, between Novoasovsk and the narrow access to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke at a meeting of the EU leadership in Brussels on Saturday and urgently asked for action to prevent another Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are just ahead of a point where there is no return," warned Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now located in the territory of Ukraine.
The EU Summit decided not to take concrete action, the leadership called for further sanctions against Russia to enter into force in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukraine crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovajsk after two Russian tank colonies and 1,000 soldiers invaded the Donetsk region last week to support the besieged separatists, said Colonel Andry Lysenko, spokesman of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council Report on Saturday in Kiev.
The first probably 63 Ukrainian soldiers who were imprisoned by the Russian invasion of Ilovajsk were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian parachutists who had been captured on Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko announced on Sunday.
Naked photo scandal around Australian Celebrities and Gabi Greko
Geoffrey Edelste did not make any sense about his anger about hackers who probably stole naked images of his fiancée Gabi Grecko and a who is who of the A-promis from Hollywood.
The film city is excited after a series of clear photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence appear in a hacking scandal around the Internet.
The hacker responsible for this is probably equipped with 60 nude photos of Lawrence, Star from "The Tribute of Panem" and Superstars, including the models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, the singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Of the Australian actress Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne, private photos were supposedly also published due to an iCloud gap.
Listed are 101 Promis.
Noblest, who had engaged himself with Grecko last month, said to Confidential: "It's disgusting."
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and passed on to others.
Grecko, currently in New York, reported a news page that the hack was "damaging" and that the affected felt "injured".
The hacker probably has 30 pictures of Palmer with her ex-friend Scott Speedman, including two recordings in which she lies above without in a pool.
The film works Palmers include "Love is invincible" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovski and the actress Browning from Sugar Pitch were not available for comments on the hacked pictures yesterday.
A representative Lawrence' said to TMZ: "It's an disgusting violation of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his Tweet: "To post hacked pictures from a mobile phone is nothing but the sale of Hehlerware."
The spread of stolen images should not be tolerated in purely legal terms.
Radlers, joggers and hikers were there yesterday at the 8th wheel on the Große Feldberg and thus supported the association "Help for Cancer-Sick children".
The tour, which was a torturing for one, represented a slight training for the other.
In one, however, everyone agreed: it was fun.
Thomas Studanski should have slept well last night.
For the first time in his life, the head of the Oberurseler Brauhaus rode his bike on the Feldberg yesterday.
For the good purpose.
He can easily hide the small muscle cat there, especially since his participation in the 8th wheel on the Große Feldberg in favor of the association "Help for Cancer-Sick children" (Frankfurt) also personally brought him a valuable knowledge.
A great thing.
"I know now that I can do that - fine!"
Little pussy on the way in the applause curve?
No, if I had stopped, it would've been over...
Like Thomas Studanski, who is sitting for the CDU in the Oberurseler Stadtparlament, many of the 718 participants went to the mountains yesterday in the morning and came near the exhaustion, but happy to arrive on the plateau.
Others, on the other hand, found it easier to overcome the 11 km long route between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Dießner, for example.
The entirely reddish green politician from the circular day - red dress, red bike - did something at the start on the understatement ("Every amount of professionals, there is the goal!"), but then proved to be half a professional on the mountain and went through the finish after 45 minutes without need of breath.
He also went through the route in a slide, as did Nina Kuhn, press spokesman of the city of Oberursel, who together with Frank Grüneisen.
For the two triathletes, the "Feldberg-Radeln" was not necessarily a sporting challenge: "This is about Charity, we like to join - we would have made an exit anyway today," says Kuhn.
On the way they met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) had gone down to Oberursel in the morning to hit the high again.
The Frankfurter Florian Zierz had settled in the saddle at 9 a.m. in the morning, "make" the Feldberg twice to roll home with fun.
Fun also had "Freiten-Toni".
For the head of the Oberurseler Kultkiosk, cycling tours over the Feldberg simply belong to this.
He had spent 40 minutes with his 6.5-kilo racing wheel.
A crazy event.
For this purpose - I am happy to be there," said Andreas Balzke.
The trained Mainz says of himself that he is an "ambitionated racing cyclist".
That's what he must be, because he was on the road with the "fixie wheel", which is also race bikes, but without circuit...
The fact that it went up without a bike proved not only the 20 hikers who climbed up to the summit over the White Wall and the Fuchstanz, but also a jogger who drew a car tire with weights on a cord.
Bergwacht-Arzt Professor Volker Lischke, who with his team, equipped with all-wheel-bully and quad, said: "I know them" from Frankfurt, who is training for a special sleigh trail, only that he pulls the sleigh himself." So the man is somehow his own sleigh dog.
The 718 participants - and so many as never before - had been sent to groups in the morning.
The hikers first at 9.30 a.m.
The first cyclists and runners followed at 10:00.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bikers started.
Bent Hansen, Chairman of the association "Radeln auf den Großen Feldberg", gave the starting commands and wished the participants a nice trip.
For next year, he hopes that it will be possible to lock the route up to Feldberg to the safety of the participants.
