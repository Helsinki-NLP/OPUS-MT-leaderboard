Barack Obama is awarded the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth US president
American President Barack Obama is coming to Oslo, Norway for 26 hours to receive the Nobel Peace Prize here as the fourth US President in history.
In addition, he receives the diploma and medal and a check of more than 1.4 million dollars for his extraordinary efforts to intensify world diplomacy and cooperation among the peoples.
The head of the White House will arrive tomorrow with his wife Michelle in the North-West metropolis and will be busy all the time.
First of all, he visits the Nobel Institute, where he meets for the first time for the first time with the five committee members who elected him from 172 people and 33 organisations in October.
The Presidential couple then planned a meeting with Norwegian King Harald V and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit reaches its peak with the ceremony, where Obama takes over the prestigious prize.
He receives these as the fourth President of the United States, but only as the third who receives the prize directly in office.
The White House was already avant that Obama will talk about the Afghanistan war when taking over the prize.
The President does not want to avoid this issue because he knows that he is taking over the prize as a president who is currently at war in two countries.
He strengthened the war effort a few days ago by sending further troops to Afghanistan, which none of his critics forgot to highlight.
At the ceremony Obama also received the gold medal, the diploma and the check over ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
He intends to donate the money for charitable purposes, but he has not yet decided on a specific charitable work.
The event program then provides for a banquet with the president and his wife, in which, in addition to Norway's king and queen, the Prime Minister and 250 more invited guests will be present.
Obama was very reluctant from the beginning to the price.
For example, he argued that he felt that he didn't deserve the price quite.
He also repeated several times that the price is not just for him, but for all those who seek the same values as he does.
Immediately after the announcement, he suggested that this was "demand for action".
Naturschutzer is accused of extortion
The Leitmeritz-Policee accused the chairman of the "Nature Protection Community Leitmeritz" for extortion.
In several cases, he introduced vocations against some construction procedures last year, for the withdrawal of his vocations he demanded money from the investors in his favor, said the Leitmeritz-Police Spokesman, Alena Romova.
The Chairman of the Leitmeritz Nature Conservation Community is Lubomir Studnicka.
Now he's in prison and he's threatened with a prison sentence of up to three years.
The sorting containers in Brno don't smell good
In Prague, people can sort the beverage packaging, in the southern Moravian towns you can find again step-by-step and kick the sorting garbage containers.
And in Brno?
There you have to reserve a few minutes to find the appropriate garbage tons.
I don't want to say that the separation of waste in Brno wouldn't work at all.
But it seems to me whether the councillors are not sufficiently concerned about this problem, even if we are the second largest city in the Republic.
Brno is in the waste race in the Urwaldliga, not only because, as a citizen, we can always dispose of only paper, glass and plastics in the sorting containers, but above all by the number of garbage tons for such waste.
Did they try to get rid of the PET bottles in a collection basket at some point in the center?
That's art, and above all it takes time and strong nerves.
The only place I've found by chance so far is the Moravian Square opposite the Gans affected.
Mr Unterka should not be annoyed by his colleagues, but that is far too little for me.
In addition to the fact that the separation of waste is not a honey swallow in other parts.
That's why quite a few of my friends don't like sorting the waste.
Out of laziness.
It's too far to the garbage tons.
I don't wonder.
I offered myself after the celebration to dispose of a few glass and plastic bottles.
But on the Konicova road, I didn't see any color-wasted clays in sight.
Fortunately, I came to the right place when I was on the tram.
But the trash was almost over.
This is still the centre of Brno, which represents the whole city, isn't it?!
However, ecology and some kind of aesthetics probably leave the Brunner Socialists cold.
They prefer to buy the city an ice hockey league that makes us in the whole Republic shame, instead of buying a few garbage tons more and offering the sorting of other raw materials for a cleaner brown.
I am glad that I was able to confirm my acceptance with official statistics after I searched the Internet for a while.
According to the data of the company EKO-KOM Brno is really the worst in the whole district of South Moravia.
The "Paroubek" budget has withdrawn the money for pensions and sickness benefits
After the Left Party, despite the government's view, gave more money to farmers and officials, there is no money available in the budget for pensions, health care and construction savings.
But also not for the public debt or for the international court disputes.
This causes even more problems to the government in the second half of next year, says the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists enforced the salary increase for a number of groups, they calculated that the government would grant the money for the sensitive expenses, old age pensions or for the sick money. "This is just a delay of problems into the future, lay mines," says Janota.
Loans are paid at the same time as higher interest rates, and you have to repay the money at some point.
Too much to choose from where to take, the State Bank is empty.
If the social benefits or costs for the State are not reduced, the tax must be increased.
For all those to whom the left party now gave more money: the fire brigade, the teachers, the farmers.
And later for their children.
People don't have to be afraid they'll get this money to get the pensions or the sick money that's lost 1.8 billion of their account.
But for the price that the state owes itself even more - next year, not only 163 billion will be missing in the state fund, but far more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will increase so rapidly and together with them the costs and interest.
The State will need the money for compensation, then it will no longer be enough to increase VAT only slightly or to reduce maternity money, as the government did in its region deficit package.
Because of the money change in favour of some electoral groups, five billion will be missing next year for the extension of motorways and railways.
These are mainly the sections of the competition that can no longer be redesigned and, if necessary, discounted.
Most of all, which is not free of charge.
This means delay or cessation of thirty major buildings, and the creation of Europe money is also at risk, warns the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The CSSD has proposed that it resolves the flow of money in a lounge - it attacks the CEZ shareholders, where the state is the owner of the majority, and from which the money is then distributed into the transport fund.
The problem is that the level of the dividend is never certain and it is by no means an infinite source.
Last year, 18 billion from CEZ went into the budget.
Every year, the dividends pay the environmental damage settlements, the pension account is filled up and this money is also used as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
In addition, this trick increases the actual budget deficit to the level of 5.7 percent of GDP according to the EU rules.
But this does not end the carnival of upheavals.
Nearly three billion people lost their budgets for various compensations for victims of Communism and crimes or for court disputes, even for building savings.
Whether the state does without this money is not safe.
It's pure gambling.
If we lose an international court dispute, then we have to pay it anyway, Janota makes it clear.
The Minister then has to save the money within the resort or in the worst case attack the government budget reserve.
A hundred million are missing for the two-billion project "Staatskasse", which has already begun, which is intended to enable on-line monitoring, for which individual authorities are spending the money.
The first stage starts in January.
If the Minister of Finance did not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and in this case sanctions would come, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will control two operating systems
The Americans expect a mobile phone for the future, where the user can switch between different operating systems by pressing a single key.
The plans presented look promising.
It's enough to just press a button, and from Windows Mobile will be changed in just a few seconds Android.
This is exactly what American society wants to introduce VMware, which focuses mainly on the development of virtual software for computers.
We allow you to perform two user profiles on your mobile phone at the same time.
You can switch between these, you can separate them into two home and work profiles.
Both will work in parallel, according to Srinivas Krishnamurti of the company VMware during the interview for the magazine Computerworld.
It was presented in November last year and presented for the first time a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization of the smart phones is not a fiction.
VMware has already successfully presented the smartphone test pattern with two operating systems to the journalist.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with a RAM memory of 128 MB, which simultaneously ran the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The development of the new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
The company VMware is now working with European and American operators on the virtualization of smartphones and to the customer the devices are to come within 2012.
Snow shortage on the mountains torments the hotel owners
Snowless slopes worry not only the Giant Mountains residents.
The missing snow also frightens people from ordering ski stays in hotels and pensions.
This is why you can still get free rooms in Giant Mountains for all winter dates including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
Our pages are often visited.
People go through the offers, set prices, but in the meantime they are afraid to order bindingly.
And when they call us, they immediately ask if we believe this year's Christmas festival will be on snow or "on matsch", the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura, led.
If you want the New Year's Eve stay in the Spindelmühle exactly according to your ideas, no longer should you hesitate with the order.
If you prefer saving and where the quality of your stay comes only second, you can try to wait a few more days.
The Spindelmühle hotel owners now offer mostly only weekly stays for the New Year's Eve Day.
I think they'll be trying to sell them for a while, but then they'll have to give in, and go into shorter times.
And then the free rooms will disappear quickly, Jandura estimated.
The travel agency Ingtours in Vrchlabi always offers free beds on all winter dates.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which has not yet been sold out.
In our offer about half of the seats are still free.
That is why we have already prepared some cheaper Christmas stays for the last moment, led the director of the travel agency Ingtours, Petr Schefert.
The New Year's Day in Giant Mountains can also be offered by the Vrchlabi travel agency, but there are less free places here.
Good sales are also available for the first fourteen days in February, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year the interest in winter stays is also negatively affected by the fact that there is always no snow in Giant Mountains.
People wait for snow to fall.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snow within a week, Christmas will also be sold out, says Schefert.
Conversely and a little better than last year, the rooms at the Hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snezkou can be occupied.
We are about five percent better than in the previous year.
On New Year's Eve Day and Christmas, we only have a few free rooms.
There is great interest in Polish holidays in Janua, and in February the business will also run well, informed the director of the best Pec hotel, Karel Rada.
80 percent for New Year's Eve stays is also occupied by the Hotel Omni at the central parking lot in Janske Lazne.
On the other hand, half of the beds remain free for Christmas in the latest hotel in Janske Lazne.
We were pleasantly surprised this January year, for which we are already about 60 percent occupied.
A little weaker is now February, but at the moment when the snow comes, surely the interest in the stays in the Giant Mountains also increases, led the director of the Hotel Omni, Erik Sporysch.
In the meantime, the Giant Mountains hotel owners are waiting for a larger snow ascent.
On Thursday it should cool down and if there is rainfall, it should be snow on the mountains.
But after that, a warming should come again, Jiri Jakubsky informed from the location of the Czech Weather Office in Hradec Kralove.
USA: Repeating is Mother of Skill
It's almost funny, with what student zeal Barack Obama, the president with his reputation for the smartest, repeated the strategy of his predecessor in the Afghanistan question he himself considered to be the dumbest.
When he finally sweated out his longingly expected Afghanistan doctrine, it became apparent that he had written it over the copy paper from the bush-Iraq scenario three years ago.
Not only did he use the type of speech "as in Iraq" several times in the text itself, but he even used the name of the Bush Declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New forward" without tingling.
Three years ago, he himself criticized the Bush idea - fresh troops quotas in the Iraq plagued by the civil war - as "irresponsible and in its follow-up karastrophic decision".
The following months, however, showed that the Bush strategy based on military recommendations was the only possible and very successful strategy that is no longer spoken in the news about Iraq at all.
Bush’s reputation was not improved by this, because he objectively left his successor a much more grateful starting position than expected.
In Afghanistan Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will repeat.
In order to increase the quota of troops, the military asked him again, especially the chief commander of the Afghanistan operation General Stanley McCristal, who even in spite of the subordination habits harshly criticized the dwindling shooters in the White House.
He called for 40,000 soldiers to be able to reverse the situation for the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but did not come up with a better idea, so he cheated on the general by 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe he has pressed the promise for another 5,000, even though he himself originally expected at least 10,000.
His project to deduct the troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and complete this process within three years is highly problematic throughout the Obama strategy. The entire Obama doctrine leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the halved increase will bring the same effect as the measure in Iraq.
Despite the brotherly war of recent years, Iraq's society is relatively well structured, its leaders honor its values.
The Afghan situation is marked by contraindication - no one can rely on it and no agreements are held.
Under these conditions it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces who are used to changing their opinions every day.
The political institutions, even if they were formally set up correctly, remain only sham structures behind which the patriarchal common relations will continue to grow.
The balance of interests between the different ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially because of the inconsistency of the conditions that further complicate the Pakistan and Iran influences.
The establishment of a "active state", which is the minimalist goal of the whole operation, is also very unrealistic.
Time horizon of Obama strategy alienated by its voluntarism
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened, and now it is on the verge of explosion.
It is believed that the small soldiers, who broke out in the war cry about the "break home return", create a miracle here, only a truly romantic soul that cannot be impressed by facts.
From the political point of view, the date set for the withdrawal of troops is purely irrational because the Taliban will accept it as the indirect confession of the American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in the fights in Afghanistan is becoming a nagging factor.
European politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is related to the war in the Hindu Mountains.
Another possible factor that can radically influence the situation is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions do not affect the Iranians, there is a very serious question for the United States as to whether the problem should not be solved with troops.
This question has to be answered in the time period when America is moving to Obama for a victory withdrawal from Afghanistan.
However, every solution will also mean a dramatic turn of the Afghan situation.
The only consolation pavement for Barack Obama is the fact that three more years remain until the presidential election, and thus still enough time to reach another strategy, it would prove to be a total failure.
The managers of the bank Goldman Sachs no longer receive premium bonuses in cash
The executives of the American Bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive premium bonuses in cash this year.
This has been announced by the company, which responds to the sharp criticism of their wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers receives shares instead of the money, which can only be sold in five years.
In addition, the shares can be deprived of the managers in case they are overly risky.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is thus at the forefront of the efforts to combine Wall Street's premium bonuses with long-term performance.
I think Wall Street is aware of the further direction in which it has to go, led the former banker of JPMorgan, Douglas Elliott.
The problem lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs became the target of criticism after putting almost 17 billion dollars aside for premium bonuses for the first three quarters of this year.
According to Reuters, the total amount of premium bonuses in the course of this year is likely to exceed 20 billion dollars even in spite of the measure currently indicated.
The high premium bonuses in the banking sector have become the hottest political issue in a number of countries at the beginning of the financial crisis.
UK reported on Wednesday that the banker's bonuses, which exceed 25,000 pounds, are intended to tax 50 percent of the tax.
Similar steps are also being taken by France.
This year, women won Nobel Prizes in all disciplines except physics.
Today five record women in Stockholm from the hands of the king of Sweden Carl XVI. Gustaf took over this year's Nobel Prizes in the professional categories and literature.
In addition to the four female scientists, the German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller, was among them.
The Nobel Prize for Medicine has been awarded by two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with their countryman Jack Szostak for research in the chromosone field.
The Israeli Ada Jonah, together with the Americans, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, has received the award for the investigation of the ribosom structure and function.
The last Laureate gave the Nobel Prize for Economy, which American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson received for analyses of the economic report.
The only category in which no woman received a Nobel Prize this year was physics.
Today, scientists Charles Kao for research in fiber optics and George Smith, together with Willard Boyl, have carried out this award for the CCD chip invention, which is the basis of all digital chambers, fax devices or astronomical telescopes.
Each of these winners has received the diploma, the Nobel medal and the certificate of the purchase of the money price.
It is ten million Swedish crowns in every category.
If there are several winners in each category, the money price will be divided among them.
Traditionally, the American President, Barak Obama, has already received the most anticipated Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo this afternoon.
In his speech he acknowledged the controversy of his appointment, because he is only at the beginning of his path, and in addition he is at the top of the country that is leading two wars - Iraq and Afghanistan.
In keeping with his policy, however, he added that in certain situations wars are necessary for the fight of world peace, even if the price for it is high.
Minister Janota is considering resignation. Klaus invited him to the castle
On Friday, President Vaclav Klaus welcomes the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, who is thinking about his remaining in the government because he does not agree with the implementation of the State budget for the next year in the form that was approved by the Assembly of Deputies on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget and perhaps the remaining of Janota in the cabinet will be the topics of the Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the budget deficit is too high, which also deepens the crisis of public finances.
The President-in-Office, Radim Ochvat, informed about the meeting.
Janota wants to negotiate with the Prime Minister, Jan Fischer, on Monday about his remaining in his position.
According to the Budget Act, which now receives Klaus for signature, the Czech Republic should operate with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, however, Parliament voted on the Left Party proposals on money change and increased the money for state officials, for the maintenance of social benefits and direct wages for farmers.
The government has prevented the proposals of social democracy from increasing the budget deficit.
Between the Left Party on the one hand and the Government, Klaus and the Legal Party, on the other hand, there has been a sharp internal-political dispute, as a result of which the question mark arises about the further work of the Fischer Office Cabinet, on which the ODS, CSSD and Green Party agreed in spring.
Critics claim that the budget, as adopted by Parliament, is practically liquidating the package of savings measures imposed by the fishermen's government in autumn, and that according to their understanding, the debt of the state should end.
Klaus, who can sign the law on the state budget but does not have to, said today in the discussion breakfast with the entrepreneurs that politicians have for a long time neglected the "serious problem" of "the unsustainable deficit" of public finances.
In his opinion, there is no longer a good solution today.
An improvement could only bring about a strong government that could build on a broader consensus between the political parties.
The ODS president, Mirek Topolanek, suggested that the budget is cruel, and that the government should weigh its further existence.
The ODS vice-chairman, Petr Necas, told the CTK that the concept of the official cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party obviously no longer works.
In the editorial work, Prime Minister Fischer referred to similar words as "strong statements".
The CSSD chief, Jiri Paroubek, responded to the Topolanek words that the budget deficit was cruel, that the former government had prepared Topolanek for this year, and that exceeded 200 billion crowns.
Already on Wednesday, the CSSD rated the approval of the state budget as a success for the next year.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Mandela was played in the new film by Morgan Freeman by Clint Eastwood
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: The Unbeatn" in the world shows much of the country whose struggle and victories despite some criticisms that the main role was occupied by an American actor.
The story tells about sport, racial relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid government system in the South African Republic as well as its first black president, Nelson Mandela, in his life story represents the American Oscar actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that he was asked by the ninety-one-year-old Mandela if he could represent him in the Eastwood movie.
Another significant role is taken over by Matt Damon.
I told him, "When I play you, I have to meet you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who had received the prize for his role in the Eastwood drama from the boxing area "Million Dollar Baby", was already the leader of the movement to abolish slavery, from which he finally became a slave holder, a fictitious U.S. president, and also God in "Evan Almighty", but rarely anyone who lives and is as important to many people as Mandela.
The former South African stateman was in prison for 27 years for his active activity in ending apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was set on a free footing in 1990 and for four years he became president of the country.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "unbeatn", and at the same time it is the name of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The requirement was how to speak
The film depicts a true event in which Nelson Mandela joined forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, in order to join the country. The new President Mandela knows that his people are still divided by race and economy even after apartheid.
He believes that he can agree with his people through the sport, so he decides to join the rugby players who are outsiders worldwide.
Finally, the South African team rises to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for several years to bring Mandela's story to the cinema screen.
He had no other goal than to play this role so as to approach it as closely as possible to reality, said Freeman.
The greatest challenge was of course to speak as he did.
The actor said if he and the world politician were in the same country, he would try to meet with Mandela, eat with him at night and be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake Mandela's hand.
I found out when I shake your hand, I take over your energy, it is transferred, and I felt that I know what you feel, he said.
It's important for me to have become another person.
Matt Damon is in the film François Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team in which the white players have considered.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for the role in the hard rugby world.
It was a great surprise for him when he first met Peter in his house.
I remember when I sounded at the doorbell that he opened and the first thing I said to François Piener in my life was, 'I look much bigger in the film'.
Despite the obvious differences in the status of the actors compared with their actual models, under the direction of director Eastwood, "Invictus: Unbeatn" he received positive reviews and one also speaks of prospects for an Oscar.
The film critic of Daily Variety, Todd McCarthy, summarized his evaluation in the following words: "That was very good story, very well executed film."
In the film reviews on the web pages rottentomatoos.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive evaluations.
Light secret about Norway dissolved: The Russians have tested a rocket
A special lighting effect of unknown origin was observed via Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence only yesterday admitted that an intercontinental ballistic missile had been tested near the Norwegian border.
The launch, however, was not successful again and the rocket, originally called "Bulava", which was originally the pride of the Russian army, will slowly become a nightmare of Russian generality as well as the Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
His repeated presence at the rocket test also had no positive effect on the success of the pilot flights.
Bulava has usually not been started at all or damaged in the air.
In the Russian newspapers, one already writes about "Bulava" as about a "rakete that does not fly".
A rocket that doesn't fly, but lights
This already 13th attempt, happened normally at the beginning.
Only at the end of the flight did technical damage to the rocket occur.
The engine probably exploded in the third stage.
This time "Bulava" started from the Atom-U-boat Dmitry Donskij, which drove under the waters of the White Sea.
This type of rocket allows the launch from the submarine.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light caused by an undetermined flying object over north roads was actually the damaged "Bulava".
Furthermore, since the first moment, the Norwegians have not doubted that this is a Russian rocket.
The generality has held back this time, claiming that one cannot clearly speak of a failure.
The first two stages of the rocket did not fail and the accident only affected the third stage.
In the previous cases, the engines were damaged in the first stage.
Even if no test was started without error, the management of the Ministry of Defence considers only six out of thirteen to be unsuccessful.
The almost fifty percent success therefore meets the generality with optimism and continues to claim that the "Bulava" will fly without problems and will even carry up to ten hypersonic atom heads with a total weight of up to 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov has signed an annual contract with CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
The legendary defense player Vjaceslav Fetisov presents himself in a professional ice hockey game at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic winner and Stanley Cup holder is helping his team CSKA Moscow in distress, and is likely to be in the Friday Duel KHL against Petersburg.
Fetisov, who finished his career at the age of forty, in 1998, is currently President of the CSKA.
After Denis Kulyas got hurt, we urgently need another defense player.
Fetisov regularly trained and agreed to support the team.
We only need to clarify some remaining formalities, the agency AP quoted the coach of the Moscow club of Sergei Nemcinov.
In the meantime, it is not clear whether the comeback of the famous hockey player will only affect one game.
I mean, Fetisov is one of those who can raise the morale of other players, showed co-player Nemcinov.
When Fetisov returns to the ice, he becomes the oldest Russian professional hockey game after AP.
In the NHL, the legendary Stürmer Gordie Howe played a full season for Hartford with fifty-one years and was able to write 15 hits and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
He won two Olympic gold medals, seven world championships in the Soviet Union dress, and he also triumphed in Canada Cup and the Junior World Championships.
In the second part of his career he also gained successes in the NHL, where he raised the Stanley Cup twice in Detroit-Dress.
He has been a member of the Ice Hockey Star Room since 2001.
Hyundai gave up the trade unions. All overtime is lifted
The management of the Nosovice automobile factory Hyundai agreed with the union on the cancellation of all overtime.
Because of frequent overtime, the trade union announced the preparedness of strike on Monday.
This was confirmed by the speaker at the Hyundai Automobile Factory, Petr Vanek.
However, the management wants to agree with the trade unions on a Saturday shift this week.
We must not give up our production plan, which is a principle, which is why on Saturday, December 19, voluntary overtime was proposed for the reason that two working shifts would be worked, said Vanek.
The Sedmicka.cz website wrote that the company offered a bonus of CZK 400 to employees who would work the Saturday shift.
The staff will also receive them in retrospect for the Saturday shift of 28 November.
According to Vanek, the company has decided to change the type of motivation of the employees for the proposed overtime.
Either they can pay the overtime supplement or they can take a replacement holiday on December 28 and thus extend the Christmas holidays, Vanek performed.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday shift are paid the fare and lunch.
In view of the fact that the overtime was the most urgent and burning point regarding claims and complaints of trade unionists who had stopped production last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon with immediate effect on the cancellation of all overtime for December, Vaněk noted.
Until last week, the employees of the automotive factory had been forced to work almost every day after the eight-hour shift for 2 more hours.
Once the agreement has been signed, the commitment of the trade unions will be revoked.
Further negotiations between the management of the automotive factory and the trade unionists are scheduled to take place on Friday afternoon.
The trade union leader, Petr Kuchar, said on Wednesday that if they agree on the fulfilment of the demands and sign a joint document, they are willing to withdraw the preparedness to strike.
Last week, on Wednesday, the situation in the automotive factory increased, when about 400 employees spontaneously worked because of constant overtime.
They also protested the poor payment conditions and alleged shocks.
Management, on the other hand, held that employees must make the overtime to meet the automotive supply needs.
The trade unionists also called for no sanctions to be imposed on employees who had interrupted production last Wednesday.
In the area of overtime, trade unions call for overtime work to be reduced to a minimum.
In addition, this year they call for the payment of 5,000 crowns.
The Nosovice automobile factory Hyundai now employs 2000 people.
Serial production was started at the company last November.
By this September about 80,000 vehicles were manufactured here, the current production capacity is 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also acts in ‘stealed’ HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new connections to prevent the spread of HIV viruses in the organism.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works with viruses that are already resistant to drugs.
This fact outweighs the disadvantage that the connection to common virus variants does not work as strongly as one of the already existing medicines.
The disease AIDS cannot be cured yet.
However, patients can extend their drug composition and prevent the proliferation of HIV viruses in the body.
However, their intake is accompanied by a number of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of the virus propagation also results in the development of the so-called resistant viruses, which are no longer effective.
The work of the experts of three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, of the VSCHT (Chemical-Technology University) Prague and of the University of Heidelberg opens the way for dealing with virus resistance.
They have demonstrated that the substances known as metalocarborans act on the protein that is responsible for the reproduction of HIV virus.
The metalocarboranes are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the virus reproduction in a different way from all the medicines used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, the scientists come to new ‘improved’ compounds prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding on the viral protein.
The metalocarboranes have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-faceted cages, consisting of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms, coupled by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Sustained and persistent virus
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV virus fragmentation caused by HIV protease, no mature viral particles would develop.
When we disable HIV protease, we also disable the proliferation of the virus in the patient's body, explains the scientists in the press report published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the work published in the Scientific Journal of Medical Chemistry, the scientists describe whole series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are linked by a short organic chain, which is then systematically changed.
A little weaker, but more reliable
The effect of this range of substances against HIV proteases is tested in the test tube, also against their resistant (resistant) variants obtained from HIV-infected patients.
The effect of metalocarboranes on the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as in the clinically used medicinal products, but it does not lose its effect on the resistance variants that the medicinal products used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action, as well as its further features, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and possibility of further chemical designs, makes the Metalocarborans interesting for further development of effective anti-HIV drugs, says Pavlina Rezacova, Head of the Laboratory for Structural Biology of the Institutes of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Conflict about budget. ODS went to fisherman, who is fighting
The chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, called the approved budget for the next year "grey" and the government of Jan Fischer's Prime Minister should, in his opinion, consider their further existence.
The ODS statement referred to the Prime Minister as "strong statements".
It's supposed to be time for analysis.
The deputy ODS chairman, Petr Necas, said that the concept of the official cabinet with the support of CSSD, ODS and Green Party obviously no longer works.
According to Necas, the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in Parliament when it comes to the fight against the rising deficit, or whether it is about his remaining in the office with the help of the left hand.
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats to the problems of public deficits is diametrically different, and Necas has pointed out.
On Wednesday, Parliament adopted the 2010 budget, with more than 12 billion crowns on Link Party amendments.
Parliament has increased the money for state officials, for the maintenance of social benefits and for direct payments to farmers.
In doing so, the government has prevented the proposals of social democracy from increasing the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should operate with a residue of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS has left the room before the vote, so it has complied with the wishes of the government, because the modified budget is only a less bad version of the budget. Frase not clear
Disillusionment and futility
The Finance Minister, Eduard Janota, spoke about his disappointment and a sense of futility, whereas Prime Minister Jan Fischer argued that the government was still assessing the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota had been seriously threatened with his resignation in the event that the amendments would be accepted, the situation would look different.
According to Czech television, Janota has signed up to the Premier for Monday after the government business.
In doing so, he indicated that he was considering his further stay in office.
The reason for this is his disappointment over the negotiation of the budget.
According to Necas, to what extent fishermen are fighting for the budget deficit, the Social Democracy Nominants (CSSD) who had implemented the changes in the budget have nothing to do in the government.
The Prime Minister should also state clearly that he will resign if Parliament continues to adopt deficit-enhancing laws, such as those relating to sickness and pensions or the service law novels.
Topolanek: Ministers nominated by ODS were not mistaken
This is the case of the Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS have made no mistakes, Topolanek emphasized in a text message from the USA.
It has mentioned that in some ministries there are in deputy function people who confess to TOP 09 who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if fishermen choose to abandon the fight against the deficit level of public finances, "it is perfectly logical and correct that they rely on the left-wing majority currently in Parliament".
Then he is supposed to be unable to expect the support and tolerance of the Democrats.
I have not thought about it, and if it is up-to-date, then I will deal with it, the Minister of Defense, nominated by the Democrats, Martin Bartak, told the journalists in Parliament.
Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels in the afternoon at the European Council.
The ODS resigned at the request of the Prime Minister
At the same time, Necas stressed that the ODS would probably vote against the revised budget on Wednesday in Parliament if the Prime Minister explicitly asked the MEPs of the Democrats to allow the budget to be adopted.
We do not appear to be orphans, we are not small children, so he responded to the question of whether the ODS was not pushed back in the political negotiations on the budget by the absence of the party president in Parliament and in the Czech Republic.
I didn't realize my voice was missing.
Even when I gave up the mandate, I knew that in the next few months, above all, it would be about the Bolshevisation of Parliament and destruction of everything positive, Topolanek himself responded.
According to the new timetable of the CD (Czech Railway) fewer trains will travel for about the same fare.
The Czech Railway will end or limit some less-used high-speed and local trains as of 13 December, while other connections will be reinforced.
The total volume of transport is reduced by two percent from the date of validity of the new roadmap compared with today.
Most tariffs including basic and customer fare are not amended.
Several connections to the capital, for example, are given to the inhabitants of the Ostrava area, the railway uses Pendolino trains for this route.
The express train will no longer travel to Bratislava (Pressburg).
Fewer trains will also travel on the route Prague - Pisek - Budweis, in principle the direct connections from Prague to Letohrad will be reduced.
The largest reduction is planned by the railway in Hradec Kralove (King Graz) district, a total of eight percent, but Prague and the surrounding area can look forward to an increase.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tabor - Budweis route are also lifted, and to a few days a week, the operation of some express trains on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route is reduced.
Among the major changes is the introduction of the new direct transport route from Milovice to Prague, and currently the inhabitants of Milovice have to change to Lysa nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth route of the Esko suburban transport system, whose opening is possible thanks to the railway electrification from Lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
The long distance routes to the capital will end in the destination station Prague - Central Station.
The CD introduces more SC Pendolino connections between Prague and Ostrava and the trains to Sumperi/Jesenik will drive at the time of two hours.
The Pendolino has not allowed passengers to travel to Bratislava since 13 December.
This year's invoice for regional railways: increase by 200 million
The high-speed trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, and in total the railway will receive four billion crowns for the so-called loss of liquidity next year, exactly as this year. Local trains will provide the districts and pay eight billion crowns in total next year, with the state shooting three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million Czech crowns more expensive.
For the local trains and the express trains, the railway has recently concluded a ten-year contract, until now the contract has always been concluded for only one year.
The railway praises the system, perhaps it has not taken advantage of the price increase of the large majority of tickets.
Changes occur only with one-day network tickets CD Net and with cheap internet tickets eLiska.
For passengers without the customer card, the price CD Net is increased from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The eLiska price will then depend on the driven plug, until now it was uniform for the journey between any district cities and cost 160 crowns.
Philippine millitants arrest more than 50 people, the children were released.
Millitante today abducted 75 persons in the south of the Philippines, including some primary students and their teachers.
This is what the AFP agency mentioned, which originally only informed about 65 abductees.
All 17 children detained were released after eight hours, including a teacher.
The abduction took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
About 19 millitants reportedly used the hostages as a living shield in the escape from the police.
The local negotiators are now trying to release the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP agency, the billions belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the arms fraction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CCP).
According to AP, the police persecuted the kidnappers for the violence that demanded revenge between the two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, the right to stand was imposed because of the recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre, which was associated with the election to the Board of Governors, were 30 journalists.
Because of suspicion of participation in the massacre, the governor of this South Phillipan province and his father Andal Ampatuan, Patriarch of the influential Ampatuan clan were arrested.
On the island of Mindanao, Muslim separatists are also active.
On Tuesday, however, the peace negotiations with the Phillipan government began again.
The history of South Africa affects everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Nelson Mandela
In the next few days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwoods will come to the American cinema "Invictus: The Unbeaten", which includes part of the life story of the former president of the Republic of South Africa, Nelsona Mandela.
The role of the world-famous fighter against apartheid has been given to Morgan Freeman, who was supposedly elected by Mandela himself a few years ago.
The supporting role of the legendary South African champion in Rugby, Francois Pienaar, has received Matt Damon.
With the cinema launch of the film, reactions from critics as well as the public are also loud.
Nelson Mandela
He is named Nelson Rolihlaha Mandela, born July 18, 1918 in Mvez, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sakhar Prize, then in 1993 together with de Klerk the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was elected President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
Great expectations are placed in the film because it comes into cinemas at a time when in South Africa, on the one hand, the preparations for the World Cup are culminating, but at the same time, the media shake the world public with frightening news about the rising racial hatred and discrimination against the inhabitants of the black ruling majority.
According to the news agency AP, the reactions to the new film in South Africa are for the time being positive, despite numerous reservations against the occupation of the main roles with American Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is still proud of his own words on the new film.
I have dreamed of this role for many years and have prepared well for it.
Several times I also met Nelson Mandela personally so that I - as you say - can receive his energy, he performed in the interview after the festival premiere of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it's good to be able to get to know Mandela's personality and his message with this film.
This is a history of South Africa, but it affects everyone, he added.
In the dress of the rugby national team
The film is based on the book template of British writer John Carlin, freely translated ́In the role of the enemy ́: Nelson Mandela and the game that united the people portrays the South African champion of human rights within its first presidential term.
In the course of the film, Morgan Freeman strives to bring together two racial groups, separated for years and days, and like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also plays in the South African National-Rugby-dress, which then won South Africa.
For entering the grass in the dress, which is almost like a sacred act in South Africa, Mandela harvested large ovations fourteen years ago, mostly from the white audience and thus won the recognition of the white population.
The Rugby Championship may be able to join the people together again to a single people, led the rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa is improving, it will only show up.
However, the white South Africans are skeptical, as in recent interviews for LN of the rugby fan, Christopher Dawson, who fled from the country to the UK.

In the Louny area, transformers burn for more than 10 million crowns
The fire broke out in the morning at the transformer of the company Ceps in the switching system near the municipality of Vyskov in the Louny area.
In the fire, according to the spokesman of the Usti nad Labem District Fire Department, Lukas Marvan, six units attacked.
Originally, the fire brigade wanted the transformers burned out, but later it changed the view and now the fire is extinguished with a mixture of water - foam and special extinguishers.
The cause was a technical defect, a transformer-internal closure.
No one was injured, the harry was at risk, according to the company spokesman, Pavla Mandova, the safety operation of the management system.
The damage was estimated at several 10 million crowns, and more precisely the damage will be counted only after the fire.
The destroyed transformer must be replaced by a new one in accordance with mandateova.
For more than 10 years, Ceps has had nothing similar to it, errors such as these are rare, they have been supplemented.
The power supply was not interrupted by the fire of the Trafostation, according to the spokesman of the company CEZ for North Bohemia, Sona Holingerova, which did not affect the functioning of households, authorities and companies.
A.G. Ceps operates in the Czech area as the sole operator of the line system, the electric lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renovated and develops 39 switchgears with 67 transformers, which transmit the electrical energy into distribution system and line with a length of 4339 kilometers.
Jancura raises criminal charges for slandering three of the CSSD's heads.
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jancura, today raises criminal charges for slander against three social-democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the district of South Moravia, Radko Martinek from the district of Pardubice and the head of the Olomouc district, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a twenty-minute inteview in the radio journal.
The complaint is linked to the company's efforts to operate regional transport in some districts.
However, all regions have ultimately signed the long-term contracts with the Czech Railway.
All three leaders are attacking us and saying that we are taking the raisins out, and we have presented the offer only on the extent to which it was agreed with them.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech railways because we would know the prices of the Czech railway that were completed last week.
That's how we're left with nothing but to defend us.
Because of this slander of the Society Student Agency, Jancura told the radiojournal.
At the same time, he argued that he had evidence from all districts that they had taken their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing an indictment for the European Commission.
Hasek considers the collection of criminal charges to be further continuation of Jancura's medial show, which serves him as a free advertising for his society as well as for his own person.
I am of course willing to defend my good name and the good reputation of my district, and I also call on other leaders to do so.
I assume that even in this matter, it will become clear that it is Jancura, who manipulates the public in the matter of regional one-way traffic and uses lying and false arguments, said Hasek.
Jancura reported last week that he had invested several million crowns in advertising, which will indicate the adverse step of the districts.
He told the radiojournal that he wanted to interrupt the campaign after Christmas and continue it after New Year.
He specified that he would lead the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign launched Jancura after the districts had agreed on the operation of the regional railways with the Czech railway and had not issued any tenders for the order in a high of 150 billion crowns.
According to Vancura, such conduct is illegal and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
According to Jancura, because of the criticism of train traffic in the districts, a member of the CSSD had already threatened him.
The only threat was if we don't give up on losing the bus licenses.
He introduced himself as a member of the CSSD, I know who it is, I don't say his name, Jancura told the radio journalist today.
Vaccination against pneumococcal free and voluntary
Vaccination against pneumococcal changes the habit from January onwards.
She is the first one to be free and voluntary for the families.
But even now, votes are reporting that the mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
Culinize the preparations for the introduction of the free vaccination against pneumococcal.
The medical institution already sets the maximum prices of vaccines that health insurance must pay.
The experts are also aware of the vaccination process.
New vaccination
Vaccines free for August children
From January on, children can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcal, which were born on August 2nd last year and later.
The condition that they have not yet received a dose of vaccination.
Those who have already started vaccination in the past year or earlier must also pay for further repetition vaccination themselves.
The first dose must be given between the 3rd and 5th months of life of the child.
Last year, a quarter of the families had their children vaccinated against pneumococcal.
The parents paid 1600 crowns and more for one dose.
Four doses are required for the vaccination of the youngest children.
Overall, the experts estimate that health insurance for the vaccines spends 300,000 to 450,000 crowns a year.
But they save in the treatment that the children would need without vaccination.
So far, the state has spent about 500,000 per year on all children's vaccinations.
The mandatory vaccination was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcal causes medium-ear inflammation, but also severe infections including cerebral inflammation and blood poisoning.
Pneumococcal infections kill up to 28 children aged up to 10 per year after examination in hospitals.
Outside the Czech Republic, the compulsory vaccination of children against pneumococcal was introduced in approximately 40 countries.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccination could be compulsory in the future.
From January on, this will be paid by the insurance companies and voluntary.
For example, the head of the civil society association Nahlas, Rudolf Kalovsky, mentioned that the vaccination would be better.
His association already advertises for the Pneumococcal vaccination in the long term.
The experts at the international conference in which our association was involved were not very satisfied with the fact that we have a voluntary vaccination.
That's not quite ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad that we have succeeded in achieving at least that.
I think that's the way we have to go now, Kalovsky led.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococcal.
At that moment, we are not considering this at all, his spokesman Vlastimil Ssen said.
The voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, the doctors claim.
The chairperson of the specialist society of practical pediatricians, Hana Cabrnochova, admits that a voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
If all children were vaccinated, then you could think about reducing the number of re-vaccinations "In a situation where the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccination was started as a voluntary," says Cabrnochova.
The experts expect more than 80 percent of parents to have their infants vaccinated against pneumococcal next year.
Vaccination against pneumococcal is also groundbreaking in that it is the first surface vaccination paid by health insurance and not by the state.
Insurance should spend the money for prevention, thus saving them for further treatment, Cabrnochova explains.
The doctors must buy the vaccines themselves.
However, this is a concern of the practical pediatricians who are concerned with the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original plan, the vaccines should be purchased by the insurance companies and the doctors will then receive them on the same path as other vaccines issued to them by the State.
However, some Members feared that the insurance companies could "export the money from the health insurance system".
Therefore, the doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves and wait for the insurance companies to pay them.
It is estimated that the individual practical doctors will have to invest 40,000 crowns per month, which is a significant sum.
That won't be easy at all, says Cabrnochova.
U.S. artist son involved in "Museum Theft"
The son of the famous American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta was accused of trying to steal 20 million dollars of paintings from his father's museum.
According to the Pennsylvania police, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was captured in his vehicle with trailer when inviting 90 paintings.
It means that Frank Frazetta junior and another man would have used a excavator to enter the museum in the Pocono Mountains.
The 81-year-old Frank Frazetta Senior is famous for his presentation of figures such as Conan der Barbar and Tarzan.
As reported by the Associated Press news agency, the artist stayed in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP quoted an unnamed police officer who said that Frank Frazetta Junior could have been motivated by a family feud.
According to a police affidavit, Frazetta Junior claimed that he was instructed by his father that "he should enter the museum by all means to bring all paintings into a camp."
The Agency informed that Frank Frazetta was advocating seniority to have granted any permission.
Labour defends budget and tax increases
Ministers have defended the tax increases and expenditure stops announced in the previous report against the criticism of the opposition, the economy and the trade unions.
The conservatives said that Alistair Darling had left an opportunity to "remove" to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit by putting out the decisions until after the election.
The treasurer was also gunned for targeting low and medium-income workers.
His main proposals include a 0.5 percent increase in social security and a 1 percent capping limit on public pay statements for 2011.
Social security policy
On the other hand, the trade unions have protested that low wage recipients are being punished for a recession that they have not caused and warned of upcoming "problems".
The increase in social security - to about £3 billion a year - has annoyed the private sector, which says this is a tax on jobs, although attention should be paid to the economic upturn.
The increase limited to those who earn more than 20,000 pounds a year will affect about 10 million workers.
PREVIOUS ETA REPORT CONCERNING
Increase in social security by another 0.5% from April 2011
This year's economic decline by more than the expected 4.75%
New 50% tax on banker bonuses
1 per cent increase in corporate tax for small enterprises
Control axles for electric vehicles and wind turbines
Increase in public pensions by 2.5%
According to the Treasury estimates, someone with an annual income of £30,000 will be poorer by £90 per year and someone with £40,000 per year will be poorer by £190, while a person with an annual income of £10,000 will be richer by £110 per year.
Ministers said that their deficit reduction target by 2013 meant "difficult decisions", but they also said that 60% of the additional tax burden would fall on the 5% of top earners.
Minister of Finance Stephen Timms argued that the sketched tax increases and expenditure stops would be "a drop on the hot stone" compared to the necessary measures.
"These are great figures. They will bring us deficit reduction and this is absolutely necessary over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident that the economy would return to growth by the end of the year.
The Labour Party's prediction of future economic growth – which affects the level of re-indebtedness and the speed of deficit deduction – was questioned after the Treasury Chancellor was forced to revise earlier figures.
He said in his opinion that the economy is likely to decline by 4.75% this year - much more than the 3.5% reduction predicted in April - while debt would be £3 billion higher than previously estimated.
Missed opportunity
The conservatives who want to launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday to warn of the "crisis of guilt" of Labour said that the planned debt of 789 billion pounds is unsustainable over the next six years.
They added that ministers have failed to present a credible plan, how they will repay it and press "cynical" against difficult decisions until after the election - which must take place no later than June 2010.
"They said nothing of importance about what they're going to do," said shadow finance minister Philip Hammond. "They had their opportunity to do this, and they let it pass by."
"The significant announcements will only be made after the election, whoever wins them."
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police are protected from future cuts, unlike in the proposals of the conservatives, which see the loss capping coming faster and more quickly.
But the Liberal Democrats said that the money won by the tax increases and expenditure stops is used to cover the expenditure for the next year, not to reduce the deficit, and therefore argue that the plans are "built on sand".
The political editor of the BBC, Nick Robinson, said that at the time of the announcements - such as the above-mentioned inflation adjustment with some invalid pensions next April - the treasurer would suspend the accusation of the vote, as the money could simply be recovered next year.
Labour insists on providing the extra assistance if people need it most and that the situation will be re-examined in September 2010.
"Hohler Etat"
Although the ministers have not announced any budget details beyond 2011, economists say that the pressure on public expenditure will only be borne in the medium term.
The recognised Institute for Tax Investigations said that the Treasurer's figures would mean significant downfalls in many areas, possibly in the future also in the fields of transport, higher education, science and defence.
"It only shifts the pain to later," said his director Robert Chote.
"The significant announcements will only be made after the election, whoever wins them," added Roger Bootle, economic advisor to the business audit firm Deloitte.
"This was just the hollow pre-eat report. The markets recognize this."
FBI investigates "Deceptions of US citizens in Pakistan"
The FBI investigates the arrest of five reported US citizens because of the suspicion of extremist connections in Pakistan.
The men were arrested in an attack on a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern Pandshab province, the American Embassy in Pakistan reported to the BBC.
The FBI said it was being investigated whether these were the same men who were reported missing last month in the U.S. state of Virginia.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs said that they are also looking for information about the men.
Three of them are said to be Pakistani descent, one is Egyptian origin and the other has a Yemeni background.
"If they are American citizens, we are of course very interested in the charges they are accused of and under what circumstances they are being held," said Spokesperson Ian Kelly.
The FBI spokesman Katherine Schweit said that the authority was informed of the arrests and was associated with the families of the missing students.
"We work with the Pakistani authorities to find out their identities and the purpose of their stay there, if it is actually the missing students," she said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington announced that the men were arrested in a house belonging to the uncle of one of the students.
He said that the local police had already been interested in the house and that no charges had yet been filed against the arrested men.
The Reuters news agency reported that it rejected Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton from commenting on the arrests, but she said that the US must "cooperate more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan in eradicating the infrastructure of terrorism, which continues to recruit and train people".
The five students were reported missing by their families in northern Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty Condemns Misuses in Iran
According to a report by the human rights organisation Amnesty International, it is still as bad as human rights in Iran, as it has been in the last 20 years.
The report details "misuse patterns" by the regime, both before and after the campaigned presidential elections in June.
One man quoted in the report indicated that he was beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran rejected earlier criticism of its human rights balance.
Official bodies said that such criticism was politically motivated.
After the contested election of President Mahmud Ahmadinejad, thousands of people were arrested in Iran and dozens were killed, leading to the biggest street protests since the Islamic revolution of 1979.
dozens were sentenced to prison and prosecutors said that at least five people were sentenced to death.
BBC Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne, who is now in London, said that at the beginning of the protests the highest leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, recognized some of the abuse claims and ordered the closure of the Kahrizak police station.
But since then, there has been no tolerance for criticism by the authorities, our correspondent said.
"False Confession"
Amnesty International quoted the report of 26-year-old computer science student Ebrahim Mehtari, who said he was accused of "working with Facebook networks" and protesting against the results of the elections.
"They used to hit me in the face," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, on my head. They threatened me with death and they humiliated me."
After five days he signed a false confession and, still bleeding and half unconscious, was released on the street, Amnesty reported.
The beaten presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some demonstrators who had been arrested after the election were tortured to death in August in prison and others were raped.
The Iranian authorities denied the charges of rape, but admitted that abuses had taken place.
Amnesty also mentioned the case of a former prisoner who said that with 75 others he had been held in a container in a detention centre in Kahrizak for more than eight weeks.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian Parliament and the judicial authorities had set up a committee to investigate the disturbances after the election and the government's reactions, but according to Amnesty, the mandates and the power of these institutions would be unclear and the results obtained by the parliamentary committees had not been published.
The group said that in the last three weeks at least 90 people have been arrested to prevent further demonstrations.
Skihang was established in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn a landmark into a race track in Bristol.
The ski slopes of this park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who fought for money prices.
On the top of the slope in the Brandon Hill Park there was a short jump at the beginning of a 100-metre-long slope.
The student John Hickman, who studied medicine in the fourth year, said that there was a beautiful view from the top of the slope, but it was also quite intimidating.
It is a great view with all the lights of the city shining below.
He added: "There are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country here - some real talents."
Prices were awarded for the best pieces of art or tricks performed on the slope.
After the event on Thursday evening the snow will be left to melt.
Still she and we
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters voted in favour of a ban on the construction of minarettes and the concern about the alleged Islamization of Europe is widespread, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a well-founded and well thought-out report on whether Muslims can be integrated into one of the most clearly secularized societies in Europe — and integrated.
Some readers will read this new book out of admiration for the author's last work: "Why the French don't love headlines" (original title: "Why the French Don't Like Headscarves") (2006), an elegant and densely argumenting study of a dispute issue that has shared and occupied the country for a period of one and a half decades and whose effects still exist today.
Bowen's latest book offers a more comprehensive and bold spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he not only wants to know what politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is really happening in the field.
He spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now offer the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as it is called Bowen "Islamic Free Spaces".
He's a good listener, he's giving up debates between teachers and students on the issues that worry them the most.
Should a Muslim marry (or both) in a mosque or town hall?
Should young Muslims be taught about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it allowed for a Muslim to use a sentence-oriented banking system to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly prominent matters, he claims, which make up daily life, quite unlike the political dramas that the media employ.
The author recognizes a new generation of imamen, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a well-known name, possibly with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, an Arabic-Muslim scholar and academic born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how it is possible to be a good Muslim on the one hand and a good citizen on the other in a modern secular society on the other.
You don't have all the arguments on your side.
Conservatives are suspicious of the idea of French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists surveyed by Bowen are mostly at odds with their Salafi counterparts – purist Sunni Islam's advocates associated with Saudi Arabia – who today show a small but influential presence among European Muslims.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But an agreement requires giving and taking on both sides.
He questioned the extent to which French political decision-makers (and intellectual elites who so passionately guard the separation of church and state) really feel committed to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may experience a harsher treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews who, in turn, had to make their historic compromise with secular Republicanism.
He recognizes a "strengthening of the screws" rather than a growing pragmatism.
Can Islam be French? After reading this book one tends to say "Yes, but not yet".
The World’s Most Insolent Outlook
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatic than any other environmental region on earth.
The ice that characterises it melts at alarming speed and takes life with it, which nowhere else can survive.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing interests have entered the water that has recently been open, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors in their keel water.

In the complicated history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic researchers who have proven themselves in hunting the polar bears.
Admiral Nelson's encounter with an polar bear as a brave 14-year-old fiancée to the lake, who fought only with the rifle piston of his Muskete, is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bears who were caught swimming behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers were brought to zoos and circuses.
A circus performance at the beginning of the 20th century showed 75 polar bears at a performance.
Even today, zoos still typically have a millionth of the life of a wild animal. The climate is rarely suitable: the polar bear in Singapore was very green by the algae that grow in the hollow hair of its fur.

Ellis refers to the reports of other authors and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters represent for the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, the laying continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters use powerful storm guns in helicopters and motor-sled Inuit to track their prey.
Ironically, the ice will remain the longest in the waters in the north of these two hunting nations.
In his new book "After the Ice" (original title "After the Ice"), Alun Anderson, a former editor of the science magazine "New Scientist", offers a clear and disturbing description of the science of the Arctic and a thrilling insight into how the future could develop.
Not that scientists have all answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of change.
But this is not due to a lack of explanation.
The pioneer trips of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries were the first to suggest the twirling of the package.
In the Cold War, undersea boats take into account the moving ridges during the submersion.
A useful addition are satellite measurements and the large-scale deployment of measuring probes on icebergs, but much is still achieved by fearless people camping outside the cold.
Anderson takes a look at the strange, tiny world of the inflow system within the Arctic ice formed by saltwater cinnamons that are pushed together during freezing.
But, starting from the bear on the ice to the microscopic little wonders in the ice, all of them are threatened when once the summer ice passes, which is expected to occur between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months ... could this be us"
Marine infantry was among the 6,000 who lay down in Arlington Kranze
The upper-free De'Angello Robinson traveled for seven hours by bus to place a single wreath on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other marine infantry, who made the trip from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the National Cemetery in Arlington to adorn graves, the day was a tribute to the men and women in whose footsteps they stepped.
In a few months, wherever we are brought back, we could be that, said Robinson about the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I would like someone to do the same for me, so I try to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who had gathered on Saturday morning to lay cranes on the tombs of veterans in several sections of the Arlington cemetery.
Morrisl Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, founded this tradition in 1992 when he and some others decided to decorate several hundred graves at the Arlington cemetery.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition and Morrill and his wife Karen, who make this journey every year, stop in various cities along the way to conduct events dedicated to the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreath's Across America (grains all over America), which also extended the event to other countries.
This year, volunteers laid more than 16,000 wreaths on the tombs at the Arlington cemetery, in areas on Pentagon, on the tombs of the Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, in the Battery Park in New York, and at the Memorial for the United Airlines flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second time, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 for the purchase and transport of the cranes.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster said she made the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a deceased professional soldier.
Although their husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said, this is their way of giving back something that brought the victims.
She said that this is a small contribution, as we civilians can support our soldiers.
It's like visiting a family graveyard.
Packed in layers of warm clothing, the volunteers wandered across the extensive lawns and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers had older graves from the 1st and 2nd World War and the Vietnam War as a goal, as they are not visited as often as the newer graves, according to the organizers.
The mood was happy, children played, and couples held their hands, while the fresh pine branches were carried to the gray-throated tombstones.
Each round wreath was dark green with a small red loop attached to the upper part.
Section 60, which is nearby and where mainly veterans of the wars are buried in Iraq and Afghanistan, remained almost silent.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 cranes to adorn this section, but the gloomy mood of the current wars fulfilled this area.
Individuals cried openly, others prayed and families and friends held together in the icy air.
Some read aloud the names ground in stone, while others bowed down to small black and white cards, which had been put for those in the damp mud whose tombstones had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who shed bitter tears in front of her son's grave.
It went 8 hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the graveyard of Marine Infrastructure sub-offender David Shane Spicer, who fell into battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free ..., my son paid for it, she said.
"If I haven't been a long time, I want someone to remember him."
Contractors of the U.S. government arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban government arrested a contractor from the US government who sold mobile phones and notebook computers in the country, said representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc. based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for customers such as USAID, the US authorities for international development and the World Bank.
Consular U.S. representatives of interest in Havana are trying to gain access to the prisoner arrested on December 5.
The special charges have not yet been published, although, according to Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost everything under the charge of "hazard".
All so-called counterrevolutionary activities, including light protests and critical writings, are at risk of arrest.
Animosity in government graffiti and statements are considered to be serious crime.
Cuba has a growing blogger community led by the popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, who often describes how she and her husband are persecuted and attacked by government representatives.
Sánchez has repeatedly requested permission to leave the country to receive prices, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractor is likely to increase the tension between the Communist government of the Castro brother in Cuba and the Obama government, who had sought a "slow" approach to improving relations with the island.
The news of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times on Friday night.
The new US policy places emphasis on the fact that the United States will provide a counter-performance if the Cuban government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, although they are new and sought-after products in a country where the average earnings of a government employee are 15 dollars per month.
The Cuban government has only allowed ordinary citizens to purchase a mobile phone since this year, they are used for sending text messages, as a 15-minute phone call would cost a day's wage.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and at some government offices, such as universities.
Cubans who want to log in often have to report their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
On Cuba, the arrest of an American is rare.
Most of the few U.S. citizens who are in prison in Cuba sit behind bars for crimes such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berbena, the press officer of the U.S. Interest Office in Havana.
Berbena said she couldn't give any further information on the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that would be legal in any other free society - the delivery of free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of the group "Human Rights Watch", which recently issued a hard report on freedom in Cuba entitled "New Castro, Same Cuba", an allusion to the appointment of Raul Castro as leader of the country that replaced the sick older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the defendants would be arrested, sentenced and detained very often within one day.
He said that probably any solution would be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, precisely at the time when both countries are moving towards more dialogue.
Pakistani government representatives plan to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, Pakistani authorities discovered a supposed leading head of a conspiracy aimed at sending five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill US soldiers, and said that they hoped that this case could help to discover an extensive network of terrorist candidates who are searching the Internet for radicalized young men.
Investigators said that they had been looking for an opaque insurgent, known as Saifullah, who had invited the men to Pakistan after he had found them because one of them had made comments on terrorist attacks on the YouTube Internet video page.
Saibullah became the leaders of these men after their arrival in Pakistan and tried to help them reach the remote area of Pakistan's tribal belt, which is the home of Al Kaida and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of Pakistan's intelligence, who was informed about the matter, said on Saturday, Saifullah could not convince the Al-Qaeda leaders that the men are not part of a CIA conspiracy to intercept the terrorist network.
As a result, they were held for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far away from the inhospitable mountains in the northwest, which have become a terrorist refuge.
They were considered part of a hidden operation.
That is why they were rejected, said the government official who wanted to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The government official said that the men were by no means discouraged and continued to try to get the right recommendations to get access to the Al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested by Pakistani law enforcement authorities.
The case of the five men - who are still in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI - underlines the crucial role of the candidates in identifying future terrorists and possibly even more important in deciding who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, the U.S. intelligence service has made it a matter of utmost urgency to house human assets within Al Qaida.
The promoters of the organization act as gaters who do not let in those whose commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and those who could be spies.
American would-be recruits are subject to a special examination by A Kaida, said analysts.
However, due to their potential access to US targets and their propaganda value, they are also considered to be extremely attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, the highest-ranking analyst of the NEFA Foundation based in the USA, said that in recent years terrorist groups have become much more cautious as to whom they allow access, for the US intelligence services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you try to get someone into these groups, what better way could you go than to follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed?, said Kohlmann.
The model is now much more based on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of demonstrators call for climate action in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets on Saturday and demanded more bold action by the negotiators in the Bella Congress Centre in the city.
Demonstrants said that 100,000 people had joined the event, whereas the police estimates amounted to about 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists lit small explosives near some government buildings in the city center.
On one day, when little happened at the UN-funded climate negotiations, thousands of activists with transparency wandered through the city, on which stood in English "There is no Planet B" and one in Spanish, which said "The Earth says "Genug".
Some stars joined the protest, for example the Danish model, the photographer Helena Christensen, who said that the journeys to Peru, the birthplace of her mother, make her aware of what heart-rending problems the country has to deal with because of the already noticeable effects of climate change.
That is part of the reason why I decided to take part in the great demonstration - in order to pass the word on and appeal to the world leaders, to establish a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It's not an easy task, but it needs to be done now and there's no way around it.
The police stopped the demonstrators from coming too close to the Bella Centre and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because of the fact that they were either masked or brought pocket knives.
According to Danish law, these actions are prohibited at demonstrations.
According to a spectator who did not want to be mentioned, because he is involved in the climate negotiations, masked protesters in black clothing lit several explosives near the main Copenhagen canal, near which several ministries are located.
They threw them near the buildings, he said, adding that they started as a light rocket, but then they were followed by "a few big explosions".
Inside the Congress Centre, people gathered in front of TV screens to follow the demonstration all afternoon.
But the protest has apparently not reached the consciousness of the main functionaries, such as Su Wie, China's chief climate negotiator.
When asked if he thought that the demonstration had a constructive effect on international considerations, he replied in English: "This is something I was not aware of at all."
He then continued in Mandarin and said, "Because the venue is large, I can't hear what's happening outside."
He noted that it depended on the perspective of the individual whether the demonstration would harm or help.
It shows the concentration of the general public and various sectors on climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "they can also be said to disturb the negotiations or the freedom of other people".
Test data show persistent racial gap
The testimonies to mathematics performance were welcome good news for the public schools in Washington D. C.
Although the Washington district is still far behind the schools of the country producing the highest performance, the testimonies show that the fourth and eighth graders have made progress in the past two years faster than cities that include Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is included in the latest figures of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is the persistent performance gap between African and white students, both at local and national level.
The average score of white fourth graders from Washington D.C. rose in the last two years from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but only by three points from 209 to 212.
The power gap actually rose between 2007 and 2009 from 53 points to 58 points.
The progress of the Afro-American eight-coursers remained essentially the same; it fell by a statistically negligible point from 245 to 244.
The average score of white pupils was not included in the test data as the sample size was not large enough.
The picture over a six-year period is also not more encouraging.
The gap, which separated white and black fourth graders in 2003, when the first NAEP was recorded in this district, was 60 scale points (262 to 202).
And although the score reached by the children of both groups has grown in this time span, the difference has hardly been reduced by now 58 points.
Some educational advocates of the district last week expressed their concern that the results celebrated by school Chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and democratic mayor Adrian M. Fenty were driven forward for the most part by white students who are already powerful children.
This indicates that we have increased the overall rating by treating those at the upper end of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, member of the board of directors of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group who stands for educational equality in Washington D.C.
I don't jump up and down for a team of two or three points, said the democratic Washington City Councillor, Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth class of the Eaton primary school.
Brown, a frequent critic of Rhee's management style, said that the message of the exam score is that the city's secondary schools urgently need attention.
Of course, you always want to see the positive signs, I respect that.
What scares me, however, is that we do not spend nearly the time and energy we should use for our secondary school.
Rhee said that the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of the weak students.
This autumn, for example, some teachers will be trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at students in the upper classes of primary and secondary school, which basic skills of reading have not been mastered at the beginning of their school career and which are significantly behind their same-age classmates.
Daily mathematics, a curriculum that highlights from kindergarten to sixth-class games and life-seeking experiences, was brought to Washington under the former senior school inspector Clifford Janey, and this curriculum is attributed to some of the NAEP progress reported last week.
I believe that we must continue to work to make the best measures available to students below the level of grades, Rhee said.
Others say that the NAEP results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system while continuing to provide the additional money and resources for the weak schools that are necessary to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, professor of education at the University of California in Berkeley, who studies urban exam results.
The conventional remedy is to focus its resources and management reforms on schools located in the poorest areas of Washington, D.C.
The objective could lead to political aftereffects that are working against this important item on the agenda.
The weakness is of course, as with other city school inspectors, that she tries to keep the white and black middle class.
Our focus is to ensure that we build a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the city districts so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive excellent public education.
In an interview this week, Janey, who is now a school inspector in Newark, said that one of the most important elements to close the performance gap is to extend the traditional public school year, which is currently 180 days in Washington, to compete with the charter schools.
One has to increase the school year to almost 200 days to have the power to change, said Janey, who with his teacher union last year reached an agreement over 185 days a year, which he considered to be a "milestone" on the way to a greater increase in the next contract.
Higher education for more people than future prospects
The bus reaches the Gettysburg College with a loud pipe.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, rises and flashes for a moment at the sight of the white columns, the brick facades and emerald green lawn.
Graciela's parents have hardly finished high school in El Salvador.
Until recently Graciela, who was found in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Their attitude and the attitude of the group's other eight-coursers to explore Gettysburg, where the class costs $38,690 a year, was more of an awe-inspiring visitor than that of an enthusiastic future student.
"Yes! I will be here soon!" said Graciela, who would like to study medicine when the leader announced that they had now entered the building for natural sciences.
"Wow, really?" she said thoughtfully when she was told the low professor-to-student ratio of the school.
The College in Pennsylvania was the 7th that the children have visited on their three-day tour and now they have fully recorded the intended message: The question is not if you go to college.
The question is, where.
On the one hand, there is a growing concern over the large number of US-born children of hispanic immigrants who do not end high school or become pregnant as teenagers, on the other hand, there are hundreds of thousands who receive college education necessary to get up in middle classes.
In fact, one of five of these "second generation" of HispanoAmericans completes college – which is a remarkable achievement because many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the United States without completing high school.
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because they will show the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the country's labour force.
Those who investigate powerful children say that they often have a natural affinity for school and an inherent drive for success.
Many of them also have parents who set their children high goals and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But consulting programs also play a major role in helping Graciela and millions of children like them to come to college, especially if these efforts persist over a longer period of time.
If you look at low-income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them find a way through the system, a single measure will not solve the problem at any time, said Patricia Gándara, researcher at the University of California in Davis, who studied hispano-American students.
We need to think about providing these children with a supporting network from preschool to high school.
The federal program that Gracielas College-Tour financed is a useful example.
It is known as GEAR UP - boosting a gang - and provides more than 300 million dollars a year for local school systems to start college preparation programs that start when low-income students are in high school and continue to run until they finish high school.
According to the U.S. Department of Education, the programme has helped more than 10 million students since 1999, more than 60% of whom went to college.
Iraqi Oil Ministry concludes contracts with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has, with two auctions completed on Saturday, been able to lead larger oil companies to rebuild their damaged infrastructure.
The 10 contracts concluded with foreign oil companies by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are ready to play an important role in the renovation of the Iraqi oil industry, which has been paralysed for decades by war and economic sanctions.
US companies could only book shares in two of the 10 auctioned fields for themselves.
Seven American companies had paid for participating in the second auction, which started on Friday.
The only company that offered a bid has cut short.
Two American companies were able to conclude contracts for fields auctioned in June.
The thinly sown representatives of American oil mults at the opening of the Iraqi oil industry surprised the analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its gates after 6 years of war and instead of US companies, Asian and European indicate the way, said Ruba Husari, the editor of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service.
There will be no further offers in Iraq for a long time.
Security concerns, underlined by massively coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability due to the US military's withdrawal, have probably prevented American oil companies, said analysts to become more involved in Iraq, which has the third largest proven crude oil reserves in the world.
US companies were in some cases disadvantaged because competitors, especially the Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower wage costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not have to account for shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that could conclude contracts with the ministry.
Larger US companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who maintain close relations with the Iraqi oil ministry and have been with technical advice in recent years, have gone empty.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main actors in two of the contracts agreed this weekend.
The state China National Petroleum Corporation has offered more contracts than any other company and has been able to go home with large packages of contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, said the spokesman of the oil ministry, Assam Jihad, that China is on its way to becoming one of the world's largest economies as well as a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company will be able to compete with its contributors and meet its obligations to Iraq.
For pre-selected companies pre-selected bids were issued, which were then compared with the fee per barrel of oil that the Ministry was willing to pay to increase the emissions of each field beyond the current level.
Top-Planner of Al Kaida apparently killed in Pakistan
In the event of an obvious U.S. missile attack along the Pakistani border with Afghanistan this week, a top deployment planner of Al Kaida was killed, according to U.S. terrorists on Friday.
This would, if it were confirmed, be the second deadly attack on a high responsible terrorist organisation this autumn.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani authorities, were to have been killed by a number of rockets that hit their vehicle on Tuesday near the city of Miran Shah in the province of North Waziristan.
Local authorities reported that the rockets were fired by a drone type used by the CIA in Pakistan's lawless tribal belt.
They drove in a white vehicle towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, said a representative of a Pakistani civil intelligence service from Miran Shah by phone.
Locals suspected of belonging to the militants ran to the spot and quickly took all that was left of the "fully destroyed bodies".
The local authorities could not confirm the identity of the victims, but two representatives of the U.S. terrorism fight led undetermined evidence that Somali was one of the dead.
Somali was described as the leading military planner of Al Kaida, who conducted operations of terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was involved in conspiracy around the world, noticed a senior official who wanted to remain anonymous, pointing to the delicate character of the US air attacks on Pakistani soil.
If one assumes its central role, this included planning attacks against the USA and Europe.
He took strategic instructions from the top leaders of Al Qaida and put them into operation plans for possible terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. government representative said that Somali quickly got up in the Al-Qaeda hierarchy and had best connections with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be aware of some Americans, said the second authority representative, but this does not reduce the danger he posed to us and our allies.
If his death were confirmed, Somali would be the second leading Al Qaeda or Taliban leader who was killed since September when a similar attack by Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant group in the tribal area, and three other top activists were killed.
Since the summer, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, a website entertained by a non-profit organisation, the pace of attacks by the CIA drones has declined from an average of six operations per month to two.
The decline can be based on improved tactics of terrorist groups that have taken steps to reduce their aggressibility while at the same time brutally killing suspected informants, the page reported.
Leading UN envoy in Kabul will resign
The UN's leading ambassador in Afghanistan, Kai Aide, said on Friday that he would resign from his office in March, which would end a stormy term of office that was saddened by allegations of widespread corruption in the Afghan presidential election supported by the UN.
Eide's departure takes place when the Obama government decided to send another 30,000 US soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said that he was supporting the increase in troops, but he also expressed his concern that the US timetable for the military retreat, which is to begin in 18 months, could cause other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the construction of Afghan security forces and thus send the right signal to Afghans that they can trust the international community, said Eide in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilians to help Afghanistan's political conversion.
The military increase on the military side must correspond to an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Aide said that he did not leave his office, but only fulfilled an agreement with his family in March 2008 to stay in Kabul for only two years.
He said he wanted the notification to UNO-
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now to ensure that he has time to make a replacement.
What I said is that he'd better start looking for a successor, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
Ban has begun to search for a replacement according to UN representatives.
The UN representatives say that he has considered the Swedish-Italian Staffan di Mistura, who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad and the Frenchman Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who previously led UN peace operations.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, had charged him in September with preferring President Hamid Karzai in the presidential election in the country and hiding evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Aide has rejected all accusations, but he also said that the accusations of Galbraith - who was fired - "have undoubtedly caused damage to the mission because already there was a great deal of skepticism about international interference in the election".
Aide said that he recommended the appointment of a leading civilian representative to coordinate the aid measures of the American-led forces in Afghanistan.
He also insisted that the UN leadership allow its successor to recruit more personnel from the United States and other Western countries who donate for the Afghan mission, and said that this would strengthen their confidence in the proper use of their money.
Eide expressed his disappointment at the restriction of his forces in Afghanistan and said that the cumbersome UN regulation has undermined his ability to bring in capable people.
The UN rules are designed in such a way that since May, he said, only one person could be hired.
This is disastrous and should not go on that way.
US Minister of Defense Gates: Iran must expect additional sanctions
Minister of Defense Robert M. Gates said Friday that the World Powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because he did not participate in talks about his nuclear plans.
Gates spoke to a group of about 300 US soldiers in northern Iraq during a 7-day journey through the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq and played down the prospect of a military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In Iran, there are no good choices, he said as an answer to the question of a soldier about the likelihood of such development.
"One of the things that lie on my soul is, if we have learned something from Iraq in the last six years, which has its own unpredictability to the war."
The Obama government is considering a sanctions package aimed at Iran's military and political elite, but Gates has announced that some sanctions might also affect average Iranians.
He said that a "package of positive and negative incentives" is needed "to convince the Iranian government that it is in fact less protected with nuclear weapons", because "their people will suffer from the sanctions."
On Friday, in a statement by the White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, the American government joined the top European politicians in warning that Iran must expect "belief" consequences if it does not comply with the requirements of the UN Security Council and its nuclear monitoring organisation, the International Atomic Energy Authority, with its nuclear programme.
Iran continues to claim that knowledge of nuclear technology should only be gained for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on 1 October, Iran said that it would resume the talks to limit its nuclear programme and would refrain from a substantial part of its stock of enriched uranium in exchange for urgently needed nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor.
The US government has insisted on this kind of agreement to build confidence between the two parties and to win time for negotiations.
However, Iran seems to have left the negotiations on the provisional agreements since then -- in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership disagrees on whether they should commit themselves to the United States.
That Iran has simply left the international community with regard to some of the proposals it had already agreed to in early October, has, frankly, brought the international community, including the Russians and Chineses, together in a way that it has never been in connection with important additional sanctions for Iran, said Gates.
President Obama has set the 31st Dec. as a deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals before continuing to follow other options, including those called the Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton.
In an opinion delivered in New York, the Iranian delegation to the United Nations has condemned what on Thursday it called "groundless and unfounded claims" by some Security Council members on Iran's nuclear activities and said they are willing to continue the talks with the United States and five other world powers "to achieve an appropriate long-term solution".
Gates, who was to return to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in the morning before flying to the oily Kurdish region in Iraq to meet the soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish authorities in Irbil.
The tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq remain high, in particular with regard to borders, property rights and the distribution of public revenue.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict to prevent US plans from reducing the American force from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also tried to disperse Kurdish concern about the upcoming withdrawal of troops. U.S. representatives quoted Gates, who said to Masud Barzani, president of the Kurdish regional government, "We will get your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a united Iraq.
We won't leave you."
A change in the price of older China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that gave them talks that "Mother Earth is too tired to entertain more children" and "A baby more means a grave."
These lessons they have learned so well that, as government officials in Shanghai, who through the low birth rate and the ageing population suddenly started to change the course this summer and encourage young couples to have more than one child, their answer was immediate and final: "No matter what".
We have already invested all our time and energy in a child.
For a second child, nothing is left, said Wang, 31, a staff manager with an 8-month old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, which has produced two generations of notorically thick, retiring individual children who are lovingly called "little emperors", a population crisis is emerging in the country.
The average birth rate is 1.8 children per couple compared to 6 at the time when this policy entered into force, the UN's
Population Issues Division, while the number of people aged 60 and older in 2020 is expected to increase from 16.7 percent of the population by 2050 to 31.1% in an explosion-like way. This is well above the global average of around 20 percent.
The imbalance is stronger in rich coastal cities with educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and older people made up almost 22 percent of the reported inhabitants of Shanghai, while birth rates were below one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, head of the Shanghai City and Family Planning Commission, said that couples must have babies in the childbearing age to "help reduce the ratio of the ageing population and reduce the labour shortage of the future".
Shanghai will soon be "as old -- but not as rich -- as the industrialized countries, such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
A gradual relaxation
In the country's Constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy is likely to be the most controversial decision introduced by the ruling Communist Party to date.
Couples who violate this policy must expect enormous fines - up to their threefold annual salary in some regions - and with discrimination at their workplace.
Chinese state representatives have attributed this policy to avoiding the critical demand of natural land resources, whereas human rights representatives have condemned abuses in the enforcement of policies.
In rural regions, some officials who already had a child have forced pregnant women to leave.
Many couples had also had sex-selective abortions, resulting in an unnaturally high relationship between men and women.
In recent years, government representatives for the population have gradually weakened their attitude towards a single-child policy.
In 2004 they allowed more exceptions to the rule -- including city dwellers, members of ethnic minorities and cases where both husband and wife were single children -- and in 2007 the tone of many hard slogans was mitigated.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at the University of Beijing, said that government representatives recently discussed even more radical changes, for example, allowing couples to have two children in which a partner is a single child.
Shanghai became the first Chinese city in July to launch an aggressive campaign to promote more births.
Posters that taught families to have only one child were replaced almost overnight by guidelines describing in detail who would be in demand for a second child and how to apply for approval.
The city administration has sent out city staff and volunteers for family planning to visit couples at home and move information sheets under the doors.
She also asked to provide psychological and financial advice for those who had more than one child.
The reaction was not exactly encouraging, said family planning representatives.
Disappointing reaction
Although officials from a small rural town in the outer areas of Shanghai said that there was a recovery in the applications of couples who wanted a second child after the campaign was launched, the urban districts did not report any change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, still receives only four to five applications per month as an example.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that despite the campaign, the expected number of births in the city for 2010 will still be around 165,000 -- slightly higher than 2009, but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the Family Planning Committee of the village of Caolu in Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want to have children anymore.
They want to give their first the best, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that they would like to have two children and that this was also legal.
But they have, like many Chinese, only a minor health and life insurance of the government.
Without a social network, they say, this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West falsely rate the one-child policy as a human rights issue, said Yang, a structural engineer whose wife is pregnant in the seventh month with her first child.
Yes, we are deprived of the possibility of having more than one child.
But the problem is not simply a policy.
The problem is money.
Other couples indicate psychological reasons for their hesitation.
Wang, the head of staff, said she only wanted to be a child because she was also an individual child. "We were the center of the family and used to everyone taking care of us.
We're not used to taking care of others and don't really want to."
Chen Zieian, a 42-year-old who belongs to a translation company, said it inextricably.
For parents from the middle class with double careers through which the birth rate falls, he said, it is about being successful and for that one must be selfish.
The age group of today's 20-39-year-olds grew up to see their parents fight during the early days of the Chinese capitalism experiment and they don't want such a life for themselves, he said.
A single child, he said, also places enormous demands on the time of parents.
A mother must give up her social life for at least two years.
Then there is the space question -- "You have to rebuild your apartment" -- and the life planning -- "If the child is 9 months old, you must already have a CV for the best preschools."
Most of his friends are willing to go through this once, Chen said, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to achieve a higher standard of living, he said.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
UNO Group drafts emission reduction plan
The UN-funded climate conference -- which has so far been characterised by wild poses and mutual accusations -- again focused on Friday on the publication of a document which will record an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gases for the next 40 years, with industrial nations having to learn the greatest burden in the near future.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement on greenhouse gases, has shown both the remaining obstacles and the way forward.
But it was considered to be an important progress in a negotiation that will take place next week as more than 100 top politicians from all over the world will arrive in Copenhagen.
The text, which was formulated by a UN working group of its own, is silent about the amount of money that rich countries should give to poor countries so that they can cope with global warming in the short and long term.
It also offers a range of key options, including how industrial and large emerging economies can limit their carbon emissions and how high the upper limit value of the global temperature increase that policy makers would contribute to.
The process is given great flexibility, according to John Coequyt, executive representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who designed the six-page document, has summarized a 180-page text of negotiations to focus on what the leading climate protection representative of the UN Yvo de Boer called "the great whole".
It shows the groundbreaking of a possible agreement in which industrial nations would jointly reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by 2020, compared to the 1990 limit values, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent over the same period.
Together, countries could reduce emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Community has also given the talks on Friday a boost through its assurance that over the next three years it will provide $3.6 billion a year to help poorer countries adapt to the impact of climate change - from mastering floods and droughts to avoiding deforestation.
Friday nevertheless brought the same verbal fireworks that had determined the talks last week.
The American Climate Commissioner Todd Stern has rejected formulations calling for binding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialized countries, compared with voluntary reductions for larger emerging countries, if these are not financed by the industrial nations.
This move announced that the Obama government is driving a harder line with China, as representatives of the Bush government not even two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without major emerging economies and taking action, according to Star, who also complained that the text is not going far enough to ensure that the reductions could also be confirmed by outsiders.
Stern gave his statement one hour after the Chinese vice-president He Yafei explained that the leading American climate negotiator lacked either "reason" or it was "most irresponsible" of him that he said at the beginning of the week that the United States would not help China financially to master global warming.
The fact that the future economic march of the great world powers is at stake has opened up lines of break both within the industrial nations and between the industrial nations and the emerging economies.
The current struggle relates equally to the saving of individual economies, as well as to the saving of the planet, with China and the United States acting on account of its corresponding commitments, while poorer countries claim that the two dozen most influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take more courageous measures.
Ricardo Ulate, a Costa Rican delegate, said that it was not surprising that the great powers should fight for those who would bear the cost of slowing down greenhouse gas emissions, as even affected countries have been able to take more aggressive action to account the countries with very high greenhouse gas charges for their actions.
This is clearly a game that will develop a new economic domination, says Ulate, who is also a regional climate change advisor for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries most exposed to the impact of climate change stated that they would continue to fight for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although the leading participants say that the talks will at best lead to a political agreement.
The alliance of the small island states with 43 members presented a 24-page contract in the early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who leads the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the offensive of the small island states "exercises political pressure on the entire political process," partly because they are now united and call for measures from emerging countries, such as China and India.
The talks got a new urgency when the delegates focused on the fact that most open questions have to be resolved before the arrival of the leaders in order to reach an agreement.
High-ranking representatives, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister of State, escaped their planes and raced through the Bella Center's passage to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences to settle claims that will be negotiated during the next week.
The pure extent of the assembly -- 13,000 people go into and out of the congress centre every day, guitar-playing activists organize night shows in which they make fun of the countries that they think are betraying and selling, and draft contracts are passed on by hand instead of by e-mail -- is already a challenge.
The intensity is just beginning to build up: almost all the important ministers are here now and from Wednesday 60 will be government leaders in Copenhagen.
We are coming to the Oberliga, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice President for Global Policy of Organization Conservation International.
The heavy weights come.
Great Britain's first 225 km/h fast train redefines the Monday feeling
Monday morning at 5 a.m. 13 p.m., a pipe will penetrate the darkness to announce a train departure, which is a revolution in the UK's traffic.
The first high-speed donor train in the country will reach Ashfort, Kent, London St. Pancras 225 km/h and travel 93 km in 38 minutes.
As Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, Dame Kelly Holmes will go on board the first Javelin Pendler Service from London.
He hopes that the new UK service will eventually connect fast, reliable trains to an international rail network and connect the large agglomerations of Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could become lively donor cities, working hours would be radically reduced, and switching aircraft and cars to rail would reduce national carbon emissions and congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three major parties believe in this vision.
But the many billions of British pounds required for the construction of a new national rail network, the inevitable planning battles and fears of environmental damage could still break the British high-speed rails.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company founded in January to present a feasibility study to the government, will, according to the Times, present the report to Lord Adonis on 30 December.
This gives it a detailed route map of the next planned stage of the high-speed rail network.
The new railway line to connect London with the West Midlands will pass through urban areas and places where the environmental impact is controversial.
In the open area, the plan will show the concept within a distance of 25 meters from the final route.
HS2 is also intended to provide three options for a larger, northward leading high-speed rail network.
Lord Adonis will respond in spring.
The preferred option is a Y-shaped route, where a single high-speed route would lead to the West Midlands.
The route would split in or near Birmingham and a branch would lead west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another towards northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the best working option," said a railway insider.
After completion, the travel period between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first section, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow travellers to return the London-Birmingham route in 49 minutes, compared to today a little over an hour.
The designs offer trains the opportunity to drive at a speed of 400 km/h, making the British rail network the fastest in Europe.
The first route was planned in such a way that 400 meters of long trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 people can drive on it.
Up to 18 trains could be in operation per hour on the line London-Birmingham.
This, in turn, would mean that in London a terminal station would be necessary, where 20,000 passengers could be completed per hour.
Given the spatial constraints in the capital, it is expected that an existing station would be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Railway experts say that only St. Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether this plan should be continued or not, but the lengthy public consultation and planning measures mean that a final decision will only be taken after the parliamentary elections.
But even if it sets the wheels in motion, the rail network must be built in sections.
The trains would first have to switch from the high-speed trains to existing railway lines in northern Birmingham, which would continue to be more than three hours in the travel period between London and Scotland.
This is considered to be a crucial break point in order to ensure a change from aircraft to rail, a corrective measure for the rail revolution.
Tax paid for mortgage for 75,000 pounds of a conservative
Alan Duncan, the leading deputy member of the Conservatives, charged the taxpayer with thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orangery that he could build in his residence in his constituency.
The party's prison spokesman, who was downgraded by David Cameron because he complained about the fact that House members had to live "by lean rationalities", increased his mortgage by 75,000 pounds in order to build an oak wood plant to his second house in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge the taxpayer the additional interest income, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
Those responsible for the House approved the requests at the time, and they were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who carried out a review of the expenditure of the House members. Last night, Duncan said that the applications could have been "not even cleaner or more understandable".
Duncan, one of the richest House members, has a two-storey house in a village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
Nearby houses have achieved a purchase price of almost one million pounds (1.1 million euros).
The ground floor includes kitchen, living and dining room, but the Fees Office, an expenditure control station of the House, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year he built a winter garden called "Orangery" in the plans.
Neighbor described him as a "glasshouse for entertainment".
Even during a recent investigation of his previous mortgage contracts, Duncan was not invited by the Committee on Standards and Privileges to comment on the increase in money.
The Committee approved it last month following an examination of its expenditure from the breach of the rules.
In 2004, Duncan transferred the security for a mortgage of over 271.406 pounds (300,000 euros) from his London house to his constituency house, which he had bought in 1991, a year before his election as a Member of Parliament.
This week's documents show that Duncan was reimbursed about 1,400 pounds (1,500 euros) per month as mortgage interest by March last year.
In April his claims increased to more than 1,800 pounds (2,000 euros) per month.
The interest rate of Duncan's RBS mortgage has not changed during this time, which suggests that the total increase was used to finance the cash collection of 75,000 pounds (85,000 euros).
The normal stepless RBS mortgage rate dropped from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March of this year, where it is still standing.
The most recent documents published by the Unterhaus show that Duncan continued to assert his right to 1,250 pounds (1,400 euros) per month this May.
Duncan lost his position as opposition leader of the House in September, after an undercover reporter filmed him when he said after the spending scandal that Members of Parliament would live "by lean rationalities".
"In essence, it means working for the state, living by lean rationalities and being treated like S***e."
He said, "I have spent my money for my garden, and I am entitled to a very small portion, measured by what is heard.
And I could have demanded the whole damn sum, but I'm not doing it."
The Member of Parliament, a millionaire from his former career as a wholesaler of oil, was attacked for the first time in May for his expenditure, when it became clear that he had requested thousands of pounds for his garden before he had settled with the Festival Office that this could be considered "as excessive demand".
As a protest in Duncan's lawn, an activist dug a hole in the form of a pound mark after it became known that he had applied for 4,000 pounds (4,500 euros) over three years.
When he was questioned last night about the increased mortgage, Duncan said: "This was approved by both the Fees Office and the following by Legg for an increase in value."
He added: "There is no debate about avoiding and extending or bending the rules or the like.
Everything is perfectly transparent and moves strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It could not be cleaner and clearer at all."
Come all of you believers to admire Brighton's beach hut adventure calendar
Beach huts in Brighton have found a new life as an interactive Advent calendar for the winter months.
"Beyond", an alternative church group that stimulates spiritual discoveries through creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their huts every December with Christmas songs as their theme.
The event started on December 1st and visitors were allowed to watch the latest hut every day from 17:30 to 18:30 with free glowing wine and traditional Mince Pies, pastries filled with dried fruits.
The Christmas songs selected so far are "I saw three ships", "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The first Noël", where the hut decoration is the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an volunteer clergyman of the Chichester diocese and head of Beyond.
He said, "We want to make religion more important to people in a post-Christian society.
As a church, why do we expect people to come to a strange old building? I think the church should go to the people and organize enthusiastic celebrations.
The idea of the beach hut adventure calendar started as a conversation with some friends at dinner.
Brighton is such a fantasticly creative and lively place and we try to express this by our spirituality."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world for climate.
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated on Saturdays and in Copenhagen to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against climate warming, where the police have arrested several hundred.
At least thirty thousand people, according to the police, a hundred thousand according to the organizers, have marched in the cold of the Danish capital, on the verge of the United Nations climate conference, which should lead to a conclusion that could enter into force from 2013 on.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish chairman of the Climate Change Conference, increasing world mobilization for climate contributes to what these demonstrations illustrate that the "political price" of failure in Copenhagen would be very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital took place shortly after the train passed, when a group of 300 demonstrators, dressed in black, had smashed windows with plasters and hammers, a journalist of the AFP noted.
Anti-unrest police immediately and without consideration, intervened.
The police have announced that 600 to 700 people, according to their assessment mainly members of the Blacks Blocs, have been arrested in the east of France, in April, of these extremely violent groups that have already made themselves famous at the Nato Summit in Strasbourg.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, has been arrested the conditions under which hundreds of militant followers were "without distinction", sharply criticized, and has underlined that about one hundred of you were "always held in the streets on Saturday evening", despite the extreme cold with handcuffs and in sit position.
The rather peaceful move has gone from Parliament towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to enter.
A stage was installed to welcome the intended speakers, for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of the former South African archbishop Desmond Tutu.
Most of the demonstrators arrived with buses and trains from the big European cities, but also many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, as well as some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most of you with sky blue raincoats, have made a first run in Copenhagen in the morning, as you have followed the call of Earth's friends to form "blue tides" for the "climate justice".
Today we are going to the streets to demand a reparation of the ecological debt in favour of the south, explained Lidy Nacpil, Phillipan activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't keep going and say: we have time, Angelique Kidjo, singer from Benin.
There are rivers in Africa that dry out, watercourses where you can walk, just as it has never been the case in the past.
For the first time in the history of Climatic Diplomacy, founded in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Agreement, the movement of global critics has approached environmental organisations.
Member of the European Parliament José Bové, the shape of the global critic, announced that he came to Copenhagen to link "Climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no difference between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world."
The Asia-Pacific area, where many islands are particularly vulnerable as a result of warming, has given the launch of the demonstrations.
According to the organizers in Australia, about 50,000 people have gone to the streets.
In Manila there were several hundreds of people, mostly students marching in red, who have been hottening Bandanas, where you have celebrated the solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Djakarta, but also in Canada, a few hundred demonstrators took place to demand an energetic approach to climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the "350" network have gathered several hundred people, namely in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (Nordic), Bordeaux (West), and Lyon (East).
Some people gathered in Geneva.
The separatist Abkhazia has elected his president, Georgia denotifies that it is a "line" here.
Abkhazia has elected his president on Saturday, this happened a little more than a year after Moscow had recognized this pro-Russian separatist Georgian territory as independent, tbilissi declared the "string".
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgian war of August 2008 for control of the South Ossetian territory, another Georgian secessionist area recognised by Russia.
The constituencies have closed at 10:00 GMT.
Electoral participation was about 58% a few hours before the constituency, according to the Abkhaz constituency.
The first preliminary results should be announced in the night from Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including the previous President, Serguei Bagapch, categorically rejected the idea of reuniting with Georgia, condemning the election.
These elections are a farce.
On the other hand, Georgian President Mikheil Saakachvili regrets the fact that Abkhazia is now under rest assured total occupation, explained his press spokesman, Manana Manjgaladze.
Besides Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this area with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world perceives it as part of Georgia occupied by Russia.
After it had separated itself from Georgia during the 1992 - 1993 conflict, with several thousand people dying, Abkhazia wishes to prove by this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, a new era, as an independent state, has explained Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claims to have chosen Herrn Bagapch.
She was one of the voters who went to vote in a constituency that was in a school in the capital Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful landscapes on the Black Sea.
Large signs on which Bagapch can be seen on the side of the Russian President and the head of government, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are located everywhere in this small area that has 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, located in the east of the country, the district chief, Beslan Archba, has prepared a warm welcome to the Russian representatives who have come to monitor the election.
We, the Abkhaz people, are grateful, he said at a small celebration as an allusion to Moscow's support, in particular with regard to the decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament, answered and raised a glass of vodka.
The opposition on its part, represented by the former vice-president and two Russian businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, has criticized the agreements reached with Moscow in the previous year, as the one in which Abkhazia Russia leaves the control of the railway for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banba, claims neither to support the current government nor the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is necessary to win the election.
If none of the candidates reaches this limit, a second round of elections must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: Demos worldwide, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated all over the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement from the Kaufhagen climate conference, where the police, ready to use at any time, arrested about 700 people on the verge of an important demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to the police, have demonstrated in the afternoon cold in the Danish capital, who receive delegates from 193 countries until December 18th, in search of an agreement to come into force on January 1st, 2013.
From Parliament, the peaceful train marched towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations take place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the centre and did not try to penetrate.
A stage was built to welcome the intended speakers for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of the former South African archbishop Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the train had passed, a group of demonstrators, dressed in black and armed with bricks and hammers, began slamming in, found a journalist of the AFP.
Anti-unrest police officers immediately encircled you and intervened without consideration by throwing some of you on the ground.
The police have announced that 600 to 700 people have been arrested and have made it clear that they are mainly members of the Blacks Blocs, these extremely violent splitter groups that have already made themselves famous at the Nato Summit in Strasbourg, in the east of France, in April.
In the evening, a police officer suffered an injury to the chin during the incidents where, according to police, about twenty people were temporarily arrested. Four vehicles burned near a occupied house.
"We have the extreme groups under control," said Henrik Jakobsen, the spokesman of the police, while the helicopters of the forces of order cry in the air.
Most of the demonstrators who arrived by train or by their own vehicle from major German cities, from London, Amsterdam or Milan, were Europeans.
However, there were also many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, and Africans.
Almost 3,000 people, mostly in the sky blue raincoat, formed in the morning in Copenhagen after the call of the "Friends of the Earth" to a first group, which should represent the "blue seas" for "climate justice".
"Today we go to the street to demand that the ecological debt be repaid to the people of the south," explained the activist Lidy Nacpil of the Jubilee South Coalition of the Philippines in Copenhagen.
"We can't say 'We still have time'," says the singer Angélique Kidjo from Benin.
"In Africa, there are rivers that break down, there are watercourses through which you can walk, which has never been the case before."
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was launched in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-global movement has approached environmental protection organisations.
The French Member of the European Parliament and Globalist José Bové, told AFP that he had come to Copenhagen to "combine climate justice and social justice." "There is no difference today between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world."
The Oxfam organization has mobilized several personalities, such as the Danish Model Helena Christian or the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, who is addressing the masses.
The Asian-Pacific area, in which many islands are particularly vulnerable to global warming, has given rise to the demonstrations.
According to the organizers, about 50,000 people have gone to the street in Australia.
In Manila several hundred people, in the majority of students, dressed in red with bandanas, have made in front of the city administration of the Philippine capital for solar energy advertising.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, hundreds of demonstrators have also gathered in an action against climate change.
In France, several hundred people joined forces during the demonstrations organised by the 350 network, especially in Paris, Marseille in the south, Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the west and Lyon in the east.
Several people gathered in Geneva.
According to Chatel, the subject of geography and history stems from the school reform of the Lycéen.
In an interview published in the "Journal du dimanche" Sunday newspaper, National Minister of Education Luc Chatel explained that the subjects of geography and history are strengthened by the school reform of the Lycéen, even though they are not necessarily taught in the terminals (12th school year).
"The students of the Première (11st year of school) now have every four hours of the week and the same programme," confirms Mr. Chatel.
For the minister "this hypocrisy must be overcome", because according to him "the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile", but generally a concentration "the best student."
"The economic and social profile and the literary profile (ES and L) must not become a sub-profile of the scientific one," he continued. He stressed: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals who have been outraged by the lack of historical-geographical education in the terminals on technical lyces."
On Saturday, an IFOP survey published in the Humanité showed that nearly seven out of ten French (69%) criticise the state project of the removal of mandatory education in history and geography in terminals S (12th school year with scientific profile). Many teachers and intellectuals also complained about this project, as well as the left and some representatives of the rights.
The Minister replied that there was no question of restricting the philosophy of the program of terminals S.
Luc Chatel also defended the educational reform for teachers, while 16 organisations (students and trade unions) called for a protest against the project for Tuesday, which in their opinion is the victim of the educational training of future teachers.
The Minister explained that they were subject to a professional qualification examination in Master 2 (M2) at the beginning of the year and at the end of the year of an approval examination, during which their teaching skills were examined.
In addition, they conduct internships during the year in the M2 and then teach a year before the students as teachers in the internship.
He continued: "If you add all the internships offered before the performance exam, you can reach more hours spent before the students, i.e. more than 300 hours."
Finally, the Minister stated that he wanted to offer "the individual right to education" - a "a matter that does not exist in popular education."
He confirmed once again that he wanted to abolish the school card "until 2012".
15 minutes for the climate at the "Ecole Normal Supérieure"
Fifteen minutes to talk about the commitment at the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice President of the "Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change" had to face on Saturday morning at the Ecole Normal Supérieure in Rue d'Ulm in Paris.
As a journalist of the AFP noted, the Nobel Peace Prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, in which experts contact the audience for fifteen minutes with filmed contributions.
One wants to do something to reach people and in them the feeling of wanting to learn more, said Edouard Hannezo, 22 years and one of the organizers of that day, on the verge of the conference. The name of this event goes back to the names the students gave to the fish in the basses of the school.
"Among the experts, around twenty discussion participants were selected, including according to their charisma," he explains.
"Climate warming can be said for hours, but the core targets can also be set in a few minutes," said Jean Jouzel of the AFP, who spoke only with the help of films before about 50 people.
"This is part of our role as a scientist," he stressed in the hope that the listeners might learn from the fact that "the Copenhagen Conference is based on an absolutely serious scientific dossier."
The videos filmed by these conferences will be available online from December 15 on the school page.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February and will take place every two months thereafter.
Payment default : angry prison guards, actions planned
On Friday, the unions of law enforcement officials called for a general day of action to ensure that the premiums and overtimes, the payment of which has been postponed for budgetary reasons until January, were transferred before Christmas holidays.
The 2nd Trade Union of Penitentiaries ("FO-Pénitentiaire"), called on the employees who have no service to demonstrate and block them in front of the penitentiary on Tuesday morning, in order to draw attention to the "theft of what is theirs".
The Third Trade Union of Criminal Enforcement Officers ("CGT-Pénitentiaire") called for "uniting to a strong mobilization in the various prisons" on which the non-payment of the overtime, night supplements and Sunday and holiday supplements in October is burned as "damaging and unacceptable".
The first union of law enforcement officials, the Autonomous Federal Criminal Union (UFAP/UNSA), called for "general mobilizations (...) to show dissatisfaction and anger."
The management of the Detention Centre and the Ministry of Justice stated that the overtime in 2009 had increased considerably and not all had been planned in the budget. However, they guarantee that the remaining claims will be paid in January.
As the Ministry of Justice announced in the evening, Michèle Alliot-Marie sent a letter to the unions of the law enforcement officials guaranteeing that payment will be made next month.
"I know very well about the efforts of staff to maintain and modernise our system of fines," said the Minister of Justice in this letter.
"I have ordered the management of the Penal Enforcement Centre to take immediate action so that such a situation, which has resulted from the lack of assessment of the overtime, does not repeat itself in the future," added Ms. Alliot-Marie.
The December wage is therefore poor, except for the management staff who benefit from high service and target premiums, explains the UFAP/UNSA, for which the "budget constraints" have to be met.
"This is an absolute scandal," the interregional trade union FO in Marseilles, announces to boycott "all assemblies and convocations" up to new instructions.
"The staff don't go to work on Sundays and holidays if the hours from October in December are still not paid. This also applies to their overtime", also threatens the FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
"At a time when more and more tasks are being assigned to us without more staff being recruited, the attempt to enrich itself at the staff's funds is more than inappropriate," says Bordeaux's CGT trade union.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some of which are less affected than others.
In any case, however, it is wrong to note that the Secretary-General of the UFAP, Jean-François Forget.
Obama believes that he is always distributing Christmas gifts better than he himself receives.
The American president, Barack Obama, who will spend Christmas with his family in the White House for the first time, has looted at TV-Talkmaster Oprah Winfrey that he will always distribute better gifts than he himself gets.
On a special show, which was broadcast over the ABC channel on Sunday evening, the president and his wife Michelle gave insight into how they will spend the holidays in their new illustrated home.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family, will be part of the game.
"Santa Claus also loves Bo", says Michelle Obama, adding that the dog of course also gets a gift.
Michelle Obama decided to reject her husband’s claims on the quality of the gifts. “I made you beautiful gifts last year,” she nods the president.
"So please," he called them schelmish and pointed to the first lady's pearl chain: "And who gave it to you?"
During this one hour broadcast in an informal atmosphere with the well-known television moderator who had so vehemently supported Barack Obama during his election campaign, the president and his wife also talked about gifts she loved most as a child.
Barack Obama remembered a bike with ten courses and also a basketball that his father, whom he saw very rarely, had brought to him for Christmas from Kenya.
"I remember when my father visited us once and brought me a basketball," said the president.
"Only much later in my life did I understand that I had this ball from him."
The First Lady remembered her doll house.
"I didn't know at all how to order the furniture in a house, so I put them all on the wall instead of grouping them around the fireplace. But I loved this little doll house," said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday once again operates, RTL confirms that he was put into the artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was once again operated in Los Angeles for significant "damages" after surgery in France. According to the surrounding persons, the situation was "under control", although RTL confirmed that the singer was put into the artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock musician was once again operated on Thursday from Wednesday to Thursday at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, after the American doctors had found "damages due to the operation of a tape disc incident", which he had suffered in Paris on November 26, according to his production company in Paris, which added that these damage would have required another operation.
The production company of the singer nevertheless wanted to clarify that the situation was "under control" and stated that a new medical opinion would be available in 48 hours at the latest.
However, according to RTL, the partner during the last tour of the singer, Johnny Hallyday was put into an artificial coma to avoid "smearing and complications".
However, it was only after 48 hours that one had a little more certainty about the condition of the patient than he opened his eyes, adding RTL.
On demand of the AFP there was neither a confirmation nor a comment from the production company.
RTL also confirms that "from certain sources", that after its first operation in Paris, "no pressure" was imposed.
The rocker had been operated in the international clinic of Parc Monceau because of a tape disc incident.
The procedure planned for several days was performed by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor who had already treated many stars.
This was not available for comments to RTL on Thursday evening.
After the operation of Johnny Hallyday, the singer was delivered to Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday due to a follow-up infection after the procedure.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, who is very close to Johnny Hallyday, told RTL on Thursday that his friend was just going through a "deep valley". However, he assured him that one would not have to worry about the rock musician, since he was "a good fighter".
"He had called me before he left for Los Angeles. I told him it was stupid to put himself on a plane for twelve hours after such an operation," Eddy Mitchell said.
On Wednesday evening, the producer of the singer, Jean-Claude Camus, confirmed that Johnny Hallyday "reacts well to antibiotics" and that "the infection is inhaled".
Mr. Camus also said he spoke to Laeticia, the singer's wife, and he felt no particular concern.
Nevertheless, the concern for the health of the singer has increased ever since he spent nine days in a hospital in July after he fell on his yacht.
Two months later, in general amazement, Johnny Hallyday was talking about having a "small intestinal cancer surgery", which caused a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer recorded his long "Tour 66" as a farewell tour.
Since then, however, every health problem has been commented on in great detail. Fans and journalists have not forgotten that the singer on stage had difficulty moving.
It was not until mid-November that the surrounding persons had to re-enter the hospital.
Euro-2009/ Kurzbahn: First place for Bousquet over its favorite distance
The Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, three-time medal winner at the 2009 World Championships, won an international title on Thursday about his favorite distance, 50m freestyle, at the Euro-2009 on the short track in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition, last time the polyurethane suits were allowed, there were only three world records, while a real record flood was expected.
A record was improved by Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 4 x 200 m layers and the two others by Russia at 4 x 50m locations of the gentlemen.
Shame for Bousquet, who wanted to catch the 50m freestyle after the world record, whose record he holds in the large basin (20.94).
At one of the two king's distance in swimming, 50m freestyle, 28-year-old Frenchman claimed in 20.53 sec,. in a final with ten swimmers at the start (usually eight) - a premiere at international level.
Bousquet forced the Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and the Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but he did not manage to break the world record (20.30) as planned.
"One can believe in ever greater and in the present case I have said that if the world record is in my range, I will try."
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers started in polyurethane suits, which are forbidden from 1 January 2010.
With 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations end their Epos in Istanbul, which started in 1999 at the same competition for the first time.
The use of the combination has not paid off this time for the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in the Basin this summer in Rome and world record.
The young swimmer has not managed to improve his best time over 400m freestyle (3:32.77), yet with the second best time in his career (3:34.55), before the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Dane Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
"I didn't give everything this time.
I knew I couldn't get a world record today, but I defended my title and fulfilled my job."
"Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future," said Biedermann.
USA : Tomb plate at Zola estimated at 1.5 million US dollars
A Roman tomb that appeared with the French writer Emile Zola was estimated at $1.5 million on Thursday, according to the art dealer Sotheby's.
This plate is two meters long and 63 cm high. It dates from the IIIrd century AD and has always been rated at $150,000 to $250,000.
The marble, on which "four scenes of the Dionysos are represented in a sophistic architecture décor, surrounded by satyren and Bacchus figures, is a rare piece. There are only four or five of them in the world," said Florent Heintz, Vice President for the auction of Roman and Egyptian antiques at Sotheby's, on Tuesday opposite the AFP.
It was sold under hundreds of pieces.
"The sale is still running, but this part is certainly what the buyers have offered most to do up to now," says Sotheby's spokesman Dan Abernethy to the AFP.
The discovery of this acquisition of the marble part by Emile Zola goes far back.
The record was at home in Rome for almost 300 years in the famous collection of the Borghese family, after which she appeared piece by piece with the French actress Cécile Sorel, who found use in her bathroom of her Paris hotel and with Paul Reynaud, Minister of the III French Republic and President of the Council before Marshal Pétain came to power.
The next fifty years are in the dark.
In searching through the Louvre database, Florent Heintz discovered that this record was part of an "heritage of Emile Zola" that was opened in 1903, one year after the death of the author of the "Thérèse Raquin" and the "Rougon-Macquart" fresco.
Zelaya's exit attempt from Honduras towards Mexico has been eroded
On Thursday, Mexico had declared the conditions for the transfer of the overthrown Honduran President Manuel Zelaya on domestic soil no longer compatible, after this ledge by the coup government had rejected as unacceptable.
After a telephone call with President Zelaya that took place at night, everything seems to indicate that there is a difference as to the possibilities for carrying out this transfer, said Patricia Espinosa, Mexican Minister for Foreign Affairs.
According to the immigration authority, the Mexican government's aircraft, which had arrived in Salvador on Wednesday for the purpose of transferring M. Zelayas, had returned to its place of departure.
The coup government wanted M. Zelaya to "resign" and sought political asylum under guidance for him abroad.
The overthrown president, however, rejected this, as he wished to return to Mexico as the most welcoming, official head of state.
The coup regime "has suffered a further failure by wanting to give up on my costs (...), they wanted me to give up," said M. Zelaya to Radio Globo on Thursday, in which he has often spoken since the start of the political crisis that has been in the Central American country for five months.
I can stay here well and I would like to stay here for ten years, here I have my guitar, added the fallen President who had fled to the Brazilian Embassy of Tegucigalpa two and a half months ago, under attack of some chords.
The Mexican Embassy has sent us a request for guidance, which we unfortunately cannot accept, since it does not include a request for asylum, on Wednesday Oscar Raul Matute, Minister of the Interior of the coup government, told the Honduran Radio HRN.
I did not seek asylum in any country at all, had Manuel Zelaya answered in an interview with the Telesur Channel, which is located in Caracas.
A possible exit from Honduras, he had underlined, he would only take up as president of the Honduran people.
On Wednesday, the rumors of M. Zelaya's departure had mobilized the supporters of the overthrown President, who had joined the Brazilian Embassy and gathered around them, and the military there had strengthened his efforts.
The Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the position of the coup government.
This, according to his assessment, revealed the marginal character of this government in view of international standards.
Zelaya, who had approached the socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, had been overthrown on June 28th, on the day of the popular survey organised by him in preparation for his re-election, against the advice of the Supreme Court, the Army and Congress.
From his exile in Costa Rica, he had returned surprisingly on September 21st and had fled to the Brazilian Embassy.
He leaves them, he is arrested for high treasons, who is accused by the justice, according to the coup government.
The coup president Roberto Micheletti succeeded in organising a presidential election on 29 November to replace M. Zelaya.
Although Porfirio Lobo was recognized by the United States during the controversial election, it was rejected by the Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, the Cogress voted massively against M. Zelaya's return to office until the end of his mandate on 27 January.
Wall Street on the Upswing, the US trade balance nourishes optimism
The New York Stock Exchange concluded on Thursday with a high, the figures of the American trade balance show a price recovery of the United States' shares and their partners: the Dow Jones has increased by 0.67%, the Nasdaq by 0.33%.
According to the numbers at the closing point, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen from 68.78 points to 10.405.83 points, the Nasdaq, which is dominated by technology, from 7.13 points to 2.190.06 points.
The extended Standard & Poor's 500 index was written at 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1.102.35 points.
There are good news from various industries, Lindsey Piegza judged by FTN Financial.
However, this remains anecdotal under the premise that the market is focused only on "half-full glasses", it failed.
According to Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are mainly fixed to the figures of the American trade balance, "which has an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter".
The United States' trade deficit fell by 7.6% to 32.9 billion dollars in October.
In contrast, the analysts expected a deficit increase.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The big news is the increase in the total volume of trade, especially in goods exports, which reflects the economic growth of the US's main trading partners, said Christopher Cornell of Enterprise Research Economy.com.
In return, unemployment messages in the United States have risen against all expectations in the last week and have now reached the level of 474,000 requests.
However, during the last four weeks, the average for new jobseekers "was down to the lowest of the year," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The profitability of government bonds to 10 years has increased to 3,482% compared with 3,432% from Tuesday evening, with the profitability of bonds to 30 years to 4,492% compared to 4,408% from the eve.
Cuba: hundreds of partisans in power pipe "Lamen in Weiss"
On Thursday, several hundreds of partisans standing on Cuban power have blazed the wives of political prisoners who met in Havana for the purpose of the World Human Rights Day and have also avoided another rally, which temporarily arrested a good dozen dissidents.
Around the forty "Dames in Weiss", wives or nearby political prisoners, were blazed on open streets by partisans of the government under Raul Castro, just as they were on foot march into the center of the Haupstadt to demand the liberation of the political prisoners, a journalist of the AFP confirmed.
Down with the Yankies!, "Söldner!", "the street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "It lives Fidel and Raul!", the authorized partisans with raised fist scandalized the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilian agents who had appeared to "guarante their protection".
A similar demonstration against the "Dammen in Weiss" had taken place in Havana on the eve of the night, in which neither the injured nor the arrested came.
In the Havanan district of Vedado, on the other hand, a dozen dissidents, who also participated in the Thursday demonstration in the face of the International Day of Human Rights, were temporarily arrested by civilian police, confirmed a report by the AFP.
According to this journalist, the police have forced the dissidents who have been exploited by the government's partisans to enter civilian vehicles under force.
The temporary detention of dissidents under such circumstances is usually limited only to a few hours.
As candidates at the Sakharov prizes awarded by the European Parliament in 2005, the Women in Weiss organized an unauthorised march for the purpose of "Please the release of all political prisoners", whose number according to the list of dissidents has around 200 persons, explained Laura Pollan, one of the leaders whose husband Hector Maceda is serving a prison sentence of 20 years.
M. Maceda belongs to the group of Cuban dissidents who were detained in March 2003, of which 53 were behind bars until now.
The Cuban authorities felt the opponents to the regime as "Söldner" or "Agents" in the service of the declared arch enemy, the United States.
A rarity in itself is that Cuban television reported on the demonstration events held on Thursday between militant pro-government fighters and "contra-revolutionary" reports.
The Cuba led by a united party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of evading rights and freedoms, in particular those of freedom of expression.
Insanity kills eighty-year-old with the knife and leaves 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
A two-knife-armed madman killed an eighty-eight-year-old on Friday about late afternoon at the main business time in downtown Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) and injured five more people.
According to the first information of the survey, the 28-year-old attacker had injured the eighty-year-old from previously unexplained cause in or before a pharmacy on the Boulevard Jean-Jaures with two knives and so, police information accordingly, under the presence of witnesses.
The old man, born in 1929, according to a responsible police syndicate Alliance in the hospital, has suffered the consequences of his injuries.
In or in front of the same pharmacy, he predisposed a couple with a pregnant woman.
The man, about in the Dressigers, intervened and was injured.
The two first victims were severely injured in the hospital, where the eighty-year-old died.
The other injury is at risk of life, since, according to police sources, it has apparently affected vital organs.
The pregnant woman has become sick as a result of the events, and according to a police source, she has been hospitalized in the "shock state".
The armed man, who, according to police reports, seemed to be under alcohol or drug influence, should immediately escape the street, the same Boulevard Jean Jaures.
He would have injured two more passersby, apparently by chance: a thirty-and-forty-year-old, the latter of both difficult.
The scenario remained in the dark in the evening.
He had been armed with two carnivorous knives, which he carried crossed behind the back, declared on site Arnaud Pressé, a responsible of the syndicate Alliance of the territory of Hauts-de-Seine.
Several passersby, including young people, are said to have tried, according to the AFP's reports of witnesses, to bind the mad.
I saw a guy in the Driesigers with a green vest.
Three young people tried to intervene.
They couldn't do it because the guy was well built, reported Alberto, a waiter of a nearby bar.
A horde fell over him, he added, including a city police officer who broke the wrist.
Still on the Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at the level of house number 61, two city police officers, including their superior, tried to arrest the armed man and were injured with knife-stitches, such police records.
The event has taken place in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are a number of shops.
Passers-by came to me to tell me there's a injured person out there.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old person lying on the ground, I put her in first-aid position and noticed a claping wound in the stomach area, said Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, the AFP.
Five minutes later, a second, about thirty-year-old person was injured by cut wounds.
Finally, the state police forces arrested the man who did not carry any ID papers.
The Procuratorate of Nanterre has commissioned the District Office of the Criminal Police of Hauts-de Seine (SDPJ 92) to investigate the case.
The mad man was hospitalized on Thursday night.
In view of his condition, he has not yet been heard in court.
A police source does not rule out being transferred to a mental hospital.
According to another police source, there were six police officers in order to hand him over to the Clichy police commission, where he had been discharged.
He was "in a state of exasperation" like "all the mentally confused of this kind, in which the forces release themselves during the Tathergang".
USA: Polanski's lawyer again calls for an end to the prosecution
For the time being, the lawyer of the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski has repeatedly demanded on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, Western United States) to drop the prosecution against his client, who is currently in court at his place of residence in Switzerland due to a moral breach more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, lawyer of the director of the "Pianist", has sued three judges of the Court of Appeal in the second district of California gross procedural errors at the time of negotiation in 1977.
At the time of the trial, M. Hummel explained before adding that the conduct of the judge Laurence Rittenband, who was responsible for the trial, "was running down a cold back."
According to him, the judge Rittenband, who had died in the meantime, had discussed with a prosecutor who should have told him that Roman Polanski had earned a farmed house, before he had fallen his judge's ruling, what constitutes a serious procedural error.
This discussion was launched in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski: persecuted and coveted), specifically by the inquiring prosecutor David Wells.
Finally, at the end of September, M. Wells had declared that he had "lyed" the authors of the documentary film.
Should the Court refuse to terminate the criminal proceedings, Mr Hummel would ask for the conduct of a trial that would enable him to present the evidence of his argument.
On the other hand, the indictment has repeated the evidence already presented in the first instance, i.e. that a discussion on the abolition of the offences brought against the defendant cannot be seriously considered as long as Roman Polanski does not appear in court.
The 76-year-old director had fled the United States in 1978, even before proclaiming the penalty for "illegal sexual relations" with a minor of 13 years.
Since then, he has not traveled to the USA.
The deputy prosecutor of Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, had declared that Roman Polanski "must be there to attend the trial".
In this matter, would you like to spread the message not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants who are fleeing a way out?, asks Mrs Asayma.
In their opinion, "the filmmaker asks the Court of Justice for a favor and thus despises its authority".
One of the three judges – who now have 90 days to announce their decision – even pointed out "that there were still other escape-talternatives".
Hummel was not the only one who had requested the prosecution of Roman Polanski.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also demanded the removal of the criminal proceedings.
She recalled that her client would no longer bear to be harassed by every resurgence of the Affaire Polanski and added: "No one in this room can say that this procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years are enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested in Switzerland on 26 September, on the grounds of an American arrest warrant.
After spending two months behind bars, he was sentenced to a house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad, pending a possible extradition.
Wall Street is inhibited by the rise of the dollar and ends without price.
The New York Stock Exchange closed on Friday with no price in a market that was torn between better indicators than in the USA and a rise in the dollar: the Dow Jones won 0.63%, while the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
Based on the final figures available at closure, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has increased by 65.67 points to 10,471,50 points, while the technologically dominated Nasdaq has delivered 0.55 points to 2.190.31 points.
The extended Standard & Poor's 500 index has increased by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
"Truly, the market is pretty quiet," stated Mace Blicksilver from Marblehead Asset Management.
"It remains strictly limited, the volume of trade has become very low, and I think that this will remain so until the end of the year."
The trend was supported by the publication of better economic indicators than planned, which "helped to improve the market view to the solidity of the recovery of the economy", the analysts of Charles Schwab summarized.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November, thus already two months in a row and far more than planned.
Furthermore, American consumer confidence improved significantly in December, up to 73.4 compared to 67.4 in the previous month, according to the University of Michigan index preview.
However, the indices have been slowed down by a new rise in the dollar price, which has reached the highest level compared to the euro for two months, thereby pushing ''the sectors susceptible to the economic situation downwards', said Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
The technological values have thus lost some ground.
The bond market has declined.
On Wednesday evening, the yield of the treasure bond over 10 years rose by 3,540% compared with 3,482% and that of the bond over 30 years to 4,497% compared with 4,492% of the previous day.
Election of the Miss World again in South Africa
After a month of rounding through South Africa, the 112 candidates for the title of the Miss World will pass the last obstacle on Saturday in order to realize their dream: to be chosen as the most beautiful woman in the world and to watch this in front of a billion television viewers.
During this great beauty fair, which will be held for the second time in a row in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already received their ticket to the semifinal.
Ms. Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were named Miss Sportive or Miss Top Model during their African stay.
This was a true truffle of pleasures.
Nice cities to visit, such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Hoorn, was simply extraordinary.
I've seen many things and had a lot of experience!, said Miss Sierra Leone with full enthusiasm.
This competition will take place for the ninth time in South Africa and will be broadcast live on Saturday, starting at 5 p.m. (15 p.m.) from Midrand, north of Johannesburg.
I couldn't imagine a more beautiful country to hand over my crown.
This experience was simply fascinating.
I am happy to have made this experience twice, underlined Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the South African summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges of experience with candidates and the discovery of "breathing landscapes".
After a month of galas, samples, encounters with the press and safari, misses now focus on the competition.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to enter the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, who was elected in 2000 and will also be present at this election, as well as Aishwarya Rai, who was elected in 1994 and both became Bollywood stars.
Of course, it's the dream of every woman to be crowned once as the most beautiful woman in the world, but it's not just about the look.
We are ambassadors of our country, and I would like to come home with the crown, and Miss India throws a wide smile.
According to the organizers, this 59th edition is underlined with music and dance.
The candidates defil in traditional costumes and not to forget in bathing suit.
The performance is presented by a television presenter, the Chinese woman Angela Chow, by the ex-beautiful queen from South Africa, Michelle McLean, and by a responsible of the Miss World Committee, Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it knows how to receive the world with an unsurpassed warmth and pride, assures Julia Morley, President of the Miss World.
Like last year, the candidates made a safari, visiting the famous township in Soweto, but this time they tasted by bicycle and local cuisine.
However, the meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who gave them the hand, was quite extraordinary.
Not usually for a head of state, Ms. Sierra Leone noted.
Her most beautiful memory, however, undoubtedly remains the trigger in Cape Town (Southwest) for the World Cup in June 2010, a kind of country to advertise for this event a little more.
I'm wrong with people I'd probably never be able to approach.
I will certainly return to the 2010 World Championship, promised Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
According to his son David, the news about Johnny Hallyday is "very positive"
The news about Johnny Hallyday are "very positive," assured his son David on Friday on his arrival at Los Angeles Airport, where he visited his father who had been in the hospital for a few days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, everything is going very well, David Hallyday explained to the press when he left the plane, in which he arrived shortly after 13.00 local time (21:00 CET) from Paris.
The son of the singer, who made a relaxed impression, assured that he would go to the Cedars-Sinaï hospital "fastest" on Monday, in which Johnny Hallyday was sent to Paris for a bacterial follow-up infection after an operation on a tape disc incident on November 26th.
The singer "was put into an artificial coma that night in Los Angeles to relieve his severe pain and to be able to perform his treatment, announced the press service.
Johnny Hallyday was transferred to an artificial coma by the doctors of the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was sent to Paris on Monday for a bacterial follow-up infection following a tape disc operation on November 26th.
The singer had to undergo surgery again during the night of Wednesday on Thursday due to the sick changes caused by the last intervention.
His wife Laeticia attended a school event in the French gymnasium of Los Angeles on Friday morning, in which her daughter Jade went to school, a photographer of the AFP discovered.
The head of the department for orthopaedic and traumatological surgery in the Hôpital Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer in the hospital in Los Angeles on Monday.
The producer has severely burdened neurosurgeon Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who operated on the singer at Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris on 26 November.
They told us he did the purest massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were completely disheartened, said Mr. Camus.
I heard about the possibility of starting a trial, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday "has traveled much too fast and this with the permission of the Parisian surgeon to Los Angeles".
I made a personal phone call with this doctor who assured me that he considered this trip to be completely unproblemable, which was very surprising to me, since I already have two tape disc operations behind me, he added.
Shortly before, he announced to RTL that the singer would apparently have left the hospital after the operation "without drainage, without everything".
Dr Stéphane Delajoux is very well known in the artist environment.
He had operated the actress Marie Trintignant, a few days before her death in Vilnius, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he practised at that time.
In 2007, he had also operated on the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to absorb a hematoma after a brain hemorrhage.
However, he is also a doctor with a dubious reputation who has been sentenced several times because of failed operations and not to forget for tax evasion and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, lawyer of the Medical Chamber, called him "a man without a skrupel" who has "regularly" to answer before the board of directors and is "everything else than recommended".
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux made a statement on Friday about his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
This said that the intervention would have been "perfect" and post-operative investigations would have been "normal".
The operation "no bleeding caused and therefore does not require drainage," he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer whose health problems have been expressed since the last summer seems to be challenged.
It is quite clear that it is too narrow for a continuation of the tour on 8 January (in Amiens), Mr Camus said.
The UDF (United for French Democracy) Party Alliance becomes energetic and calls on the Nouveau Centre Party to stop using its seal
On Friday, the Party Alliance, supervised by François Bayrou's MoDem Party, strongly responded to an attempt to take over the seal, the party once founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, from the chairman of the Nouveau Centre Party, Hervé Morin, and invited him, under the threat of a judicial persecution, not to use this seal on any more documents.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to take over this UDF seal, since he felt that François Bayrou would not be worthy of defending this political heritage after reaching the left hand.
By the way, the Minister of Defence, whose party is the UMP, wanted to reaffirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
He had received the support of Mr Hervé de Charette (formerly UMP, now NC) who claimed the ownership of the UDF brand, as he was the first to apply for this brand at the "Institute national de la propriété industrie" in 2004.
However, the office of the UDF party alliance supervised by François Bayrous's friend broke the silence and made it clear that they did not allow themselves to be expropriated and set a time limit for the Minister and the Member, under the threat of a judicial persecution, to stop using this seal and to transfer the trademark's property rights.
You have made numerous statements in recent days that you would propose to your political movement to take over the UDF seal+, the Party Alliance wrote in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 office members, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the MoDem Party and Senator Jean Arthuis of the Centralist Alliance.
You probably also thought you had the right to have the name of this movement +Nouveau centre+, the slogan + today's UDF + printed on their political material as well as on the homepage of your website.
As you know, you have no right to use this seal, explained the UDF's office and asked the NC party to "remove the mention of the name UDF from all material as well as from (your) website."
In addition, Hervé de Charette " was required to transfer the trademark's property rights to its legal claimants".
If you refuse to do so, we will bring an action against you in order to respect the law and to defend the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatorys warned.
In their letter, they emphasize that "UDF" has been a full political movement since 1978 and reminds him that Morin and his friends "took the choice" to leave these 2007 to establish a competing movement, as others had already done in 2002 to establish the party "UMP".
The Nouveau centre party therefore has no rights, according to the signatory, to use the UDF seal (Union pour la democracy française).
They continue to recall that the last UDF Congress in 2007 adopted the three-year accession to the MoDem Party and the establishment of a branch for the defence of "material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "at the time he applied for the brand name, he had not been a member of the UDF for three years" but the UMP.
He benefits in a scandalous and fraudulent way from the lack of the deposit of the acronym UDF to carry it out for himself.
Furthermore, you must bear in mind that this recklessness is the best way to turn into a crime, and ironize the NC's strategy: "In politics as well as in life, it seems more dignified to us to make a name for ourselves instead of trying to get out of anonymity by, fraudulently, acquiring a name upon which one has no legal claims."
Affaire Liliane Bettencourt : François-Marie Banier is condemned for exploiting weakness
On Friday, the Court of Nanterre decided to judge the artist François-Marie Banier in order to determine whether, as the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt claims, he took advantage of a weak moment of the eighty-year-olds to hide part of her wealth.
The 62-year-old photographer, who is known for his star photos, will have to answer for exploitation of weakness in court on April 15 and 16, 2010, a criminal offence that will be punished with a imprisonment of up to three years and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will indeed be a process in this affair, which is worthy of the saga of one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter feed and at the same time have the reins of the cosmetic empire L'Oréal in hand.
However, the 15th Chamber also ordered a medical examination of the 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt, which is jointly conducted by three doctors.
The Erbin and main shareholder of L'Oréal has so far refused to undergo such an investigation, especially under the conditions presented during the investigations by the Procuratorate of Nanterre.
The doctors appointed on Friday are expected to present a report before 10 March 2010 in which you will clearly indicate whether and at what times Liliane Bettcourt may have found himself in a state of weakness.
I think she'll go through this investigation.
I'll talk to her, the lawyer of Mrs. Bettercourt, Me Georges Kiejman, explained after the trial.
As regards the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, he is very pleased with the court's decision.
This is an excellent news (...). The report will prove that he (Banier) manipulated this old lady that you need to protect, he confirmed.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter has started a criminal lawsuit against François-Marie Banier, photographer and all-round artist, accusing him of having exploited her mother's weakness for years to cover out gifts of a total of one billion euros in the form of bank checks, insurance policies or paintings.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt had always denied being manipulated by the photographer she viewed as a long-standing friend.
Although the court would have to examine the admissibility of the action brought by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, on Friday the plaidoyers of lawyers led to a large family debacle.
Thus, the lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt called on three letters sent by his client to her notary (1999, 2003 and 2005) in which she wrote that she mistrusted the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
According to her lawyer, Liliane Bettencourt added: "Please explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier for fifteen years, one to twice a day.
I have never been able to speak to Françoise since her marriage."
The Procuratorate of Nanterre once again considers that the applicant had no right to respond in this way, especially because, in the last days, a principal judge has refused her application to initiate a judicial defence proceedings against her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully legal, is not protected and has no guardian.
No one has the right to act in their place," affirmed Marie-Christine Daubigney, representative of the Procuratorate.
The Court has now decided to give a judgment after the case for the admissibility of Mme Bettencourt-Meyers took place.
Manager revolution or the end of the Strategic Early Enlightenment?
If nothing changes in the leadership of the big French companies our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been for nothing ...
For over a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies in relation to its employees, the position of the companies vis-à-vis told consumers before the marketing revolution: It is for staff joining "values" determines the best, as it was once designed to hang on the consumer products designed by the technicians in the factory.
By placing the customer at the centre of the company the marketing revolution has given the strategies of conquering the markets in the place ... although authoritarian temptation products separate factors preferences of the customers to hang again regularly!
Demobilisation of employees can lead to fatal demoralization.
The suicide of France Telecom, PPE or Renault is only the tip of a much larger phenomenon that affects employees in particular.
This demobilization has a negative impact on the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, especially those of F&Eund, which is even more crucial to those of economic intelligence.
In fact, the IE (Intelligence Economique = Economic Intelligence) "calls for a proactive approach and a forward-looking view by all the parties involved (...); it demands a commitment from the employees to which the instructions of authoritarian management completely contradict.
That is why we call for an operational revolution, which would be to put employees in the center of the company's concerns on an equal footing with customers.
The very benefits of internal surveys
Will internal surveys, such as the questionnaire submitted by Orange to his wage earners, stimulate this revolution in terms of management practice?
I'm afraid not.
- First of all, because I was able to see that, in view of a new situation after many detours, the whole structure finally manages to do what it has always done.
Also because authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power - increases proportionally to the meaning of its own failure.
And finally, because most executives have a much simplified idea of human behavior.
Their interpretation of psychology is mechanistic.
Through intellectual comfort, they take over the old behavioral theory, which has recently been reactivated by the American "neutrosciences" and unwittingly widespread by research institutes and media.
Thus, and by suggesting that it is possible to use the "hebrew" (sic) for employee engagement, a recent Le Figaro.fr survey of Ipsos strengthens the executives in an attitude toward a mechanistic control system that is not suitable for today's world.
Identify and measure the mobilization factors
Instead, an operational revolution necessary for the smooth functioning of modern companies requires the adoption of a definitive view of human behavior.
It is to integrate a basic protocol into any consideration or practice of the control: it is only possible for the payee to commit himself to the company if it clearly appears to be a means of achieving part of their dreams, ambition and projects.
Currently, only the studies from the multifunctional analysis take over this conception of the motivation of the employees.
These studies have shown that they assess their business on the basis of a predetermined doxa that allows them to estimate what it offers them to achieve their goals of life through their perceived image of the company.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, the managers of the companies can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and place their human resource management in the right place again.
They thus create a fertile soil that is favourable for the coordinated development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
The talk of Oslo: the "righteous war" brings Obama praise from the right
The American rights welcomed the speech given by Barack Obama on Friday evening in Oslo and was satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize defended the concept of "right war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives who ridiculed the award of the prize to Obama on 9 October praised this time the President's speech, the example of the former Vice-President's candidate in the 2008 elections, Sarah Palin.
I liked what he said, said Palin, the face of the right wing of the Republican Party in the daily US Today, and added that she herself had raised the subject of a "sometimes necessary" war in her memoirs that had just been published.
Of course, the war is the last thing I think the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We have to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, tried on Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of violence; a way of explaining his decision of nine days ago to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, expressed the opinion that the president had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really good, the former president of the House of Representatives, who especially recognized the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in Obama's words.
In some parts, I have seen this speech as a historical one, explained Ginrich, who was interviewed in the radio broadcast "The Takeaway".
The previous Member, considered by some as possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said that he was pleased to have seen a "president of the left" who reminded the members of the Nobel Committee that they "could not be free and would not be able to give a price for peace if the use of violence did not exist".
For Michael Gerson, former writer of George W. Bush and now editor at the Washington Post, Obama has given "a very American speech".
In addition, he is a "cosmopolitan" how "he always does it," he said, "like an American president," when he pointed out that the Europeans are "living like a security bubble that they did not create themselves and for whose protection they do not do much," says Gerson.
Among the few unsuspected rights, former UN ambassador John Bolton, a falcon of the era Bush, described the speech on the National Review Online website as "difficult, prodigious and uninspired".
To the left of the president, democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is concerned about how Barack Obama defends the use of the forces.
If you pack the war under the cover of justice, you can simply justify the massacre to the innocent, he warns.
However, the moderate left press continues to be praised by the President.
The Los Angeles Times, which still believes that the Nobel Prize was early awarded to Obama, called the speech itself a speaker like him, known for his talent, "monumental work".
The talk in Oslo "provides a timetable for managing international decisions against conflicts, poverty and oppression", says California's daily newspaper.
The New York Times believes that Obama "proclaimed the necessary discourse" and calls his speech "dark and exemplary at the same time".
Remoter: Three Marathons for an agreement to secure the supply for Christmas
After a three-week negotiating marathon, the trade unions of the Road Association and the TLF - the only employer organisation that remained until the end - reached an agreement on Friday evening that put an end to the strike order and the threatening heavy supply shortage at Christmas.
At the signature meeting on Friday evening, Secretary of State Dominique Bussereau, responsible for transport, welcomed the agreement which was started on Wednesday morning after several weeks of negotiations.
After a second night of negotiation, the negotiators separated in the early Friday morning, hoping to sign the agreement quickly in the late morning.
Although the three employers' associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had left the meeting.
However, more than six hours passed from the beginning of the meeting at 11:00 a.m. to the conclusion of the agreement and only at 6 p.m. the agreement was signed.
The conflict "had done a lot of damage to the companies" and "it was to be feared that he would affect the holidays at the end of the year," says Bussereau.
The agreement provides for a 4% wage increase for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest wage groups (international transport).
Thus, the hourly rate for workers with the lowest wages increases from EUR 8.72 to EUR 9.06.
"That's not very much, but we start small first," says Patrice Clos (FO).
Activists are now required to stop blocking the supply centres.
"However, there will probably always be some contradictions that are not satisfied with the agreement," he adds.
TLF President Philippe Grilot spoke of a "good agreement", although it was "slow to grant these wage increases in view of international competition".
According to him, the increase is 170 euros per month for the low and 100 to 120 euros for the high wage groups.
"This agreement is based on common sense and respect for employees," says Maxime Dumont (CFDT), whereas Thierry Douine (CFTC) spoke of "a historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) said in this regard about "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for an increase in travel costs by 3 % and the maintenance of the total road transport budget in the first half of 2010, which will in particular allow to address the issue of 13 months' salary and the modernisation of collective agreements.
M. Bussereau recalled that "the reduction of taxes for employers amounting to EUR 100 million" was the subject of an amendment from the government to the 2009 bill of corrected finances, which was adopted by the National Assembly on the night of Thursday to Friday.
The government calls for "an identical" vote from the Senate.
The TLF's signature allows the initial agreement to apply to the companies associated with the organisation and to be applied to the entire profession in the case of an extension by the Minister of Labour.
This will be the case "in shortest time", insurance Bussereau.
The opposition of employers' associations can only delay the procedure.
The FNTR association advocated a "deceptive trade" because the EUR 100 million "had already been promised to the sector to compensate for part of the carbon tax".
The State Secretary for Transport forced us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but in order not to hurl the goose eaters on the approaching Christmas days, the Unostra complains.
For the Otre Association, the agreement is "throwing up a large grave for small and medium-sized enterprises in the industry in the next 12 months".
Line RER A: Disturbed this weekend, trade unions dissatisfied with RATP's proposals
The disruptions on the RER A line, the largest high-speed network in France for the Greater Paris area and the Île-de-France, continued on the weekend, while a meeting on Friday, the second day of strike between the trade unions and the management of the RATP (Independent Paris passenger transport administration) continued to wait for strikers with their demands for pay increases.
At this important shopping weekend before Christmas there were no trains between 10:00 and 20:00. On the central line (between La Défense and Nation) only one of two trains and outside the central line only one of four trains was ready for use.
The connection to SNCF trains was interrupted in Nanterre Préfecture, which forced travellers to change.
The Galeries Lafayette department store chain, which counts 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "the RATP is trying to connect the big shops to traffic technology."
The line RER A runs through the Paris agglomeration from west to east.
The route section of the RATP connects Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre as well as Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one of two trains was scheduled at the main traffic time, and almost none during the low traffic time.
As on Thursday, there was no human feeling on the platform, as the inhabitants of the Île-de-France had opted for the situation.
So early in the morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less crowded than usual, especially because of the lack of gymnasiasts.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne) Jack Nbakina, engineer (29), said he would have been extra "a half hour earlier up to get to work on time".
The SNCF, which had planned to provide assistance to travellers by staff and regulatory forces, pointed out that there had been no bottlenecks at Saint-Lazare Train Station.
The trains operated by SNCF on the RER A line or in the direction of Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or left via the Saint-Lazare railway station to ensure the connection to the metros.
On Saturday and Sunday, general meetings of the strikers took place again, during which the results which the associations had classified as "low" after the meeting with the leader on Friday afternoon.
The RER managing director proposed the specific preparation of a protocol for the RER A line with regard to all relevant aspects, working hours, careers, etc.
However, this is not what the drivers want. According to Thierry Garon (Sud), they demand a long-term wage supplement.
The CGT was indignant that the RATP itself put its wage award proposals in brackets and stressed that the leadership "cannot solve a problem, while this was possible for the long-distance drivers and the SNCF."
The RATP made it clear that a new meeting on the "comprehensive review of working conditions" was scheduled for Monday.
This also shows the associations that the company "ignores the weekend drivers".
In the morning, about 150 drivers visited the establishment of a committee in Paris.
Once again it was the leader who so far rejected any discussion during the strike and suggested a meeting after a calming down of the situation.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened to spread to the line RER B after a pre-announcement of usa and indépendants.
The associations demand a pay supplement of 120 (usa) to 150 euros, of which 30 are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants), and also complain of the deterioration of working conditions on this route, on which millions of travellers travel every day.
The RER drivers, who have many years of professional experience, receive a gross wage of 2,200 to 2,700 euros and a pay supplement of 600 to 650 euros for shift services as well as Sundays and holidays.
Turkish Constitutional Court resolves pro-Kurdian party. Decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court announced on Friday the dissolution of the country's pro-Kurdish main party, a decision following immediately angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country and Istanbul.
This decision threatens to make it very difficult for the government to do its job, which is trying to reach out to the Kurdish community in order to put an end to the conflicts which have been going on for 25 years.
The "Party for a Democratic Society" (DTP) has been dissolved because it has become a "rate for activities which are detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity", said the President of the Constitutional Court Hasim Kiliç four days after the decision to the press.
According to Kiliç, the decision would have been taken unanimously by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes needed to cast the resolution. Furthermore, he pointed out that 37 of the party’s leaders, including chairman Ahmet Türk and Parliamentary Aysel Tugluk, were excluded from the political situation for the duration of five years.
The judge also announced the abolition of parliamentary immunity, which Turkey and Tugluk enjoy, as well as the confiscation of the goods of the party.
The DTP now has 21 seats in Parliament (of 550).
The party leaders stated before the ruling that the parliamentarians would rather leave Parliament than meet as non-party parliamentarians.
The decision followed a procedure initiated in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Turkish Federal Court of Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya. He accused the DTP of following the "wissenungen" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is regarded by Ankara and many other countries as a terrorist organisation.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political display window of the PKK rebels.
The party guarantees that it has no connection to the PKK, but refuses to call it a terrorist organisation and calls on the government to negotiate.
The Constitutional Court’s ruling is in the hands of the government, which is seeking to meet the Kurdish community and propose a series of measures to strengthen the Kurd’s rights in order to keep the Kurds from supporting the PKK and put an end to the conflicts.
The DTP leaders confirm that a resolution could lead to a re-ejection of tensions in south-east Anatolia, where numerous demonstrations against PKK chief Abdullah Öcalan's arrest conditions in recent weeks have led to clashes with the police.
Since the court's announcement, thousands of demonstrators have gathered in front of the DTP premises in the million-dollar city of Diyarbakir in the southeast, largely populated by Kurds.
Ordinary forces used tear gas grenades and water-throwers when the demonstrators began to throw Molotov cocktails and stones.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
According to the ruling, Turkey assumed that the decision of the court "will deepen the despair even further".
"Turkish cannot clarify this (Kurdish, n. d. Redaktion) question on the basis of the ban of a party," he explained to the press.
The government, consisting of a party that emerged from the Islamist movement, also regretted the decision.
"We oppose the closing of the parties on principle.
This doesn't solve the problems," says Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
"This decision is a torpedo of the democratic opening that was promoted by the government," said political market observer Ahmet Island.
"It is obvious that the PKK's response can be addressed," he adds.
On Thursday, the PKK became known for an attack that killed seven soldiers in the north of Turkey three days earlier, one of the most brutal attacks in recent months.
The snowfall can come
A really cracky winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to harass the citizens, says the FES Winter Service Manager.
But so that his employees can try out and control the entire vehicle technology.
In the weekend it could be that far for the first time, according to meteorologists.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
The FES proceeds with a precise plan.
As soon as it snows over the surface in Frankfurt and temperatures are below zero degrees, 20 so-called A-tracks are taken off with large-scale vehicles, explains Brauburger.
These include major traffic and transit roads such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also fire brigades, public routes, pedestrian zones and routes with gaps, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
The service of the FES starts at 3 p.m.
The approximately 1040 kilometers would have to be spread in a maximum of three hours with moisture salt that is better liable.
Therefore, the FES starts at three o'clock at night, "so that the routes are free until the professional traffic begins".
It'll be hard if it only snows at 7.30.
Then we have a problem, says the Winter Service Manager, "because then no one is willing to make room for the scattered vehicles."
Only after that, if it no longer snows, are supply and development roads, including the Rat-Beil-Straße, on the line.
The last priority is side and side roads.
There will be complaints there, Brauburger knows.
At five o'clock in the morning, the foot people of the FES are getting on the road, points of danger and transitions are given priority.
The FES can't usually take care of all the bike paths.
There is a special service in Frankfurt, which keeps an eye on the bridges from 22 to 4.30 o'clock, says Brauburger.
As there is on these fast smooths, as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees, the scatter is on the way.
If necessary, this is called by the police.
The cradle of dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like many other carnivorous dinosaurs: The two-metre long and 1.50-metre-sized animal ran on two strong hind legs, had a long skull with sharp, bent teeth, short arms with sickle claws and a long tail.
If the species had lived a few million years later, it would be nothing special.
But Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these characteristics, reports Sterling Nesbitt from the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in Science magazine of Thursday.
The animal lived some 215 million years ago in today's New Mexico, which was then on the equator in a dry zone of the supercontinent Pangea.
Tawa opens a new window on the early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
He shows us a lot about the relationship, the spread and the characteristics of the early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other palaeontologists began a excavation on the Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
We have sometimes found a dozen dinosaur bones in one day, which is unprecedented for deposits from the Trias, reports team member Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History.
Some of the bones quickly identified the researchers as a new species.
During the excavation, they gathered the remains of a total of five individuals.
Fund confirms theories about Dino early history
The name "Tawa" is derived from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it is an extraordinary find: "Dinosaur fossils from the trias are extremely rare, most often only individual fragments can be found."
Other dinosaur experts do not necessarily share the enthusiasm.
This find is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
After the current teaching opinion, dinosaurs appeared for the first time about 230 million years ago.
However, many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, which is why the assignment of these Ur-Dinos is mostly controversial.
For example, the experts debate when the exes split into their three main development lines: the carnivorous theropods, which later included the tyrannosaurus rex, the Velociraptor and also the birds, the four-legged sauropods and their relatives, and the plants eating Ornithischia (foil basinsaur), for example, of the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
After the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hallae is an original Theropod.
It has an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
On the skull of Tawa hallae, for example, the researchers found evidence of airbags, as they also possess the descendants of the Theropods, the birds.
Thanks to the airbags, breathing the birds is more efficient than the mammals.
At Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were apparently filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive Theropod with air bags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the relative line of the huge Sauropods later also had airbags and lightweight bones, probably the common ancestors of both groups had already produced this useful innovation.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, the researchers concluded that the exes appeared there for the first time.
Thus, the three development lines separated early and spread from South America over all the continents, which at that time still formed a single land mass as a supercontinent Pangea.
For this, the fact that the team together with Tawa hallae found the remains of two other, not particularly closely related theropods.
The three cannot derive from a common, immigrant ancestor, the researchers argue.
We believe that there were at least three waves of migration to North America, says Alan Turner from the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the science study.
Of course there are also contradictions.
An even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in today's Poland, says Bonn palaeontologist Martin Sander.
His opinion could be distorted because in South America many primitive Dino fossils have simply been preserved, while on other continents there is hardly anything to be found.
As the dinosaurs managed to develop from a relatively rare sideline of the reptile tribe to the dominant land vertebrates of the Middle Ages, it is still mysterious.
During the Trias, the dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of today's crocodiles and the flight-sauriers, and with numerous other lizards.
Toward the end of the trias, dinosaurs spread around the world and developed many new species, while the relationship on the border of the Trias to the Jura died out.
Success story did not last forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There may have been a mass death that the dinosaurs happened to survive, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted so that they could beat the competition out of the field.
The success story did not last forever.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact of a group of animals helped to flourish, which had also developed in the trias and since then had a shadow existence: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signers are international.
Professors of the University of Toronto insist on it, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley in California.
Teachers from Naples are present, from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police room of the occupied casino of Frankfurt Goethe University is beating waves worldwide.
278 professors and lecturers of Goethe University, as well as universities throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America are in solidarity with the protesting students on the Westend campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they "misappropriate" the police intervention made by the Bureau.
University President Werner Müller-Estler had left the building occupied by students and teachers in the educational strike empty last week, because walls and works of art had been stained.
Five students were injured.
The property damage, judged by the Signatories, did not justify "the violent resolution of self-organized courses of students and teachers by a police command".
The room represents a "unacceptable intervention" in the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves "deligitimisation and criminalization of protest" and is derived from the contents.
The Bureau had withdrawn the necessary discourse.
Teachers call for the immediate recruitment of criminal proceedings.
The majority of occupations did not support the damage to property, it is said.
Protest legitimated
The youth of the Verdi Trade Union and the German Trade Union Confederation are also solidifying with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of a growing concern for its own future, says Verdi State Youth Secretary Alexander Klein.
However, Hesse's Minister of Science Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) defended the actions of university president and police.
We are grateful to the president.
Destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, she said at a current hour on Thursday in the Wiesbadener Landtag.
We understand the protest, but we do not understand Vandalism, according to the CDU countryman Peter Beuth.
Otherwise, the opposition groups saw SPD, Green and Left.
The CDU takes painted walls to the pretext to criminalise the protest, said Janine Wissler (left).
Instead of dealing with the arguments and demands of the students, one has cleared.
The left has submitted a request to the Minister of the Interior to report on police use.
New Silicon-Valley
For many years it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of ten districts of the capital Moscow, was a strictly guarded location for secret arms research in the Soviet Union.
Today, the municipality with its 216,000 inhabitants, 37 kilometres from Moscow's centre, is considered the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Significant research and production facilities for micro- and nanoelectronics are here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd have had contacts with the Frankfurt science site Riedberg - with the university institutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Center (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday Selenograd and Riedberg signed a "Protocol for Closer Cooperation" in Frankfurt.
The Moscow Deputy Mayor Yuri Roslyak and Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation, for Frankfurt signed planning professor Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises of the NCI will travel to Selenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
It is about continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
Firms of the FIZ will be able to take a foothold on the growing Russian market.
Conversely, Russian science companies want to collect orders in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electron Technology, the large companies Sitronics and Rossijskaja Elektronika.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist plan town" for arms research.
Selenograd (literally translated "Grünstadt") received its name from the wooded hill landscape in which the research institutions are embedded.
Stuttgarter Brakeklotz
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be set high enough.
For the supporters of the project it is simply about "the new heart of Europe".
That's right. S21 is much more than laying down a station, more than a monumental construction project that will plunge the city of the Baden-Württemberg capital for a decade into curative construction site chaos.
Stuttgart 21 was born from the spirit of the 1980s.
At that time, railway stations with tracks ending in the middle of the city were regarded as 19th-century traffic fossils, which acted like the brakes of a modern rail traffic, because it once took a lot of time to move locomotives from the rear to the front.
Get in, hold on, keep driving - that's how it should go.
That's why the main stations should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a transit station, which is about half the trans-European rail magazine between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - therefore the slogan of the "heart of Europe".
S21 is actually being addressed, even though the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have realized that in the Hessian and Bavarian big city it is almost priceless to implement the deepening.
However, the main railway stations have no longer had a problem with entry and exit, since there have been modern reverse trains with motor vehicles and control cars at both ends.
Nevertheless, Stuttgart 21 next to the ICE new construction line to Ulm is now under way.
National and local politicians have enforced it.
The railway is involved also because the risks of the largest infrastructure-individual project of the Republic of the taxpayers and not of the state group are borne.
The project can still be justified in urban terms.
New urban space is created, which - you think the computer-generated graphics of the planners - is equipped with a lot of green.
S21 is harmful to the rail transport system.
The transit station and the development of the route are intended for passenger traffic, which was attributed to enormous growth, typically in the 1980s.
At that time, there was not the competition of cheap flyers.
However, modern transport policy must first be to strengthen freight transport, as transport on the rails is considerably more environmentally friendly than by road.
But the new construction line is not suitable for freight trains because of heavy ascents.
Even more serious is the fact that S21 indirectly attacks many other railway projects.
About six billion euros are expected to be tumbled in the Swabian.
That's the official number.
Experts consider ten to 15 billion to be realistic.
It is fixed that the money will be missing from other nodes and bottlenecks in the next decade.
A total of sixty larger projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the extension of the 180 km long route through the Rhine valley.
Since 1987 it has been built on the track at the time.
Urgently it would be necessary to press the tube right here.
But S21 will act as a brake clot.
The Rheintal line becomes a bottleneck for international freight transport: in the heart of Europe.
Government examines judgment at the airport
The state government has left open in the Wiesbadener Landtag whether it will review the decision of the Hessische Verwaltungshof (VGH) to ban the night flight.
The CDU/FDP coalition has commissioned experts to have the more than 400 pages of the VGH ruling examined legally, said Minister of Economic Affairs Dieter Posch (FDP).
On these days, VGH in Kassel had stated in writing that the country would have to reorganise the night flight ban in the event of the construction of the planned north-west runway at Frankfurt Airport.
The approval of 17 flights between 23 and 5 o'clock, as the national government provides, is not compatible with the legal protection of the population from nightly noise.
The coalition must decide by 4 January whether it is going to review the judgment.
The opposition criticized this delay and urged the government's representatives to give up a revision at the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD leader Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel called on CDU and FDP to return to their pre-election promises for a night flight ban. Otherwise, this should be regarded as a "wordbreak".
It's damn hard if you can keep your word, said Green Chief Tarek Al-Wazir in allusion to the FDP election slogan "We keep word".
Minister Posch rejected the accusation of Schäfer-Gümbel, the state government tried to come to their night flights with "justice and trickery".
An accurate legal investigation takes its time.
The coalition does not want to operate on the basis of a "fast first impression".
We need a legal settlement, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
Just as they represent the opposition, the statements of his group on the ban on night flights had never been.
US Banks Pay Back Help
The crisis-stricken U.S. major banks strip off their state shackles.
On Wednesday, the Bank of America paid back the aid from the Tarp Bank Saving Fund to a total of 45 billion dollars (about 30 billion euros) at a stroke.
And the Citigroup, according to a report by the US-Sender CNBC, also plans to repay the state aid.
The institutions aim to clear up the limitations associated with the adoption of the money, such as the limitation on the payment of manager bonuses and the payment of high fees.
The Bank of America had gotten a good 19 billion dollars of fresh money from investors over convertible bonds.
The rest of the sum she took from her own cash register, which was well filled, among other things, by branch sales.
On Wednesday evening, bank manager Kenneth Lewis expressly thanked the American taxpayer: The money injection had helped over a very difficult time.
The moneyhouse had risen to the height of the financial crisis with the acquisition of the investment bank Merrill Lynch.
The Citigroup also intends to obtain money on the capital market in order to exempt itself from its liabilities to the State.
As early as Thursday, the US bank could announce an increase of some 20 billion dollars in its capital, reported CNBC, calling on circles.
A Citigroup speaker didn't want to express himself.
In June Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already paid back their help.
Quick Choice
It all went faster than thought.
A few weeks after the ZDF Board of Directors forced the current chief editor Nikolaus Brender out of office, the station can present a successor.
Last night the panel wanted to vote on the staff.
Peter Frey, head of the ZDF capital studio in Berlin, was a favorite.
However, there was no confirmation from the sender - officially not to presuppose the procedure.
However, this proposal should not have been implemented by the Board of Directors.
Frey, chess candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 board members.
The result of the vote was not yet determined when this issue was closed.
Two weeks ago, Schachter, with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years, failed on the Board of Directors.
Only seven members spoke out for Brender, seven voted against him. Brender’s election was a great defeat for chess, however, an expected defeat.
The Union majority in the Board of Directors had already signaled weeks before the election not to wish to confirm Brender in office.
He had organized the opposition to the editor-in-chief of the Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch.
With the argument that under Brender, the ZDF's messages had lost their turn-on rates, he rejected another term of office of the well-respected chief editor.
Therefore, until shortly before the election, there were protests in which the political influence on the ZDF was scourged.
At last, even 35 state lawyers had interfered in the debate, which estimated Koch's approach as unconstitutional.
It didn't use anything.
To the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and romance.
After that he worked in the south-west radio and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983 Frey moved to ZDF, initially to the "today-journal".
Follow-up stations: personal speaker of the editor-in-chief from 1988 to 1990; correspondent in Washington, 1991/92; director and moderator of the "Morgenmagazin"; until 2001 head of ZDF's foreign policy; since then head of the ZDF capital studio.
The Greens announced a constitutional suit after the election of Brenders, who was elected by the branch magazine Medium Magazine on Wednesday as a journalist of the year.
Koch's rejection on the Board of Directors, the Rhine-Palatinate Prime Minister Kurt Beck, stated last week that the countries should change the ZDF State Treaty in such a way that staff proposals of the intentionant cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, Beck was excluded from the supervisory bodies of the ZDF.
Brender's likely successor, Peter Frey, had recommended to the Board of Directors a wise move - by strongly criticizing the panel immediately after the Brender election.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, both chessmen could nominate him for the position of the editor-in-chief and the board of directors, without suspecting of having a party-goer in office.
In the party arythmetics, Frey is nevertheless credited to the left-wing liberals.
Study is unraveled
Part success for the students: After a year of education strike, the ministers of culture of the countries finally agreed on Thursday: at a meeting of Ministers of Culture and University Editors Conference, both sides agreed to want to improve the terms of study with Bachelor and Master.
Students should be able to cope with their studies in the future.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the test loads: in principle, each study module should only complete with a single test.
In addition, the work load of the students will be reviewed and "a realistic and reasonable measure" ensured.
Politics and universities also want to simplify the recognition of examinations between universities within and outside Germany.
The countries committed themselves to making common structural targets for Bachelor's and Master's programmes more flexible.
Moreover, there should not be any different country rules.
Less testing
Since the beginning of student protests in June, cultural ministers and university rectors bear the winged word of the better studyability in their mouths.
Now it was filled with a concrete content for the first time.
The so-called accreditation board decided to drastically reduce the number of examinations: "Each module usually concludes with only one examination," says a 30-page paper, which aims to partly re-enter the admission of studies.
With the "significant reduction of the audit burden", said Reinhold Grimm, President of the accreditation board, a "feel development should be stopped which significantly affected the studyability."
In addition, "study" is to be "the crucial criterion" in design in the future.
Modules such as content are "excessive to check", whether "necessary engagements by students in the choice of the
It is not possible to take part in any of the events.
The students would have "promote to have room for play, to enable and promote their own initiative".
The rules are to be applied for the admission of new programmes, but also for the review of existing ones.
These must be "reaccredited" every five years – which means, however, that it will last until 2015 until all the courses have been reviewed.
Ten accreditation agencies throughout the country are responsible for this task, which are subject to the Accreditation Council set up by the countries.
In October, the Ministers of Culture asked the countries "repressively" to influence the agencies in such a way that the material filling is not too large and the examination regime is not too strict.
In individual federal states, universities and colleges have already agreed with the state ministries on appropriate measures.
As the only country so far, Rhineland-Palatinate granted additional resources for the further development of the Bologna process.
Of the money, universities are mainly intended to set up tutor programmes and to strengthen study advice as well as audit and foreign offices.
Country and universities want to spend ten million euros on this.
At the beginning of 2010, the government intends to introduce a novel of the higher education law into Parliament.
After this, only a single examination should be required for the completion of a study model.
The purpose of the study is to make it more flexible and to ensure recognition of certificates at other universities and to facilitate access to the Master.
By the end of next year, all the country's studies will be reviewed for their studyability.
On Thursday, government and opposition had again argued about the study conditions in the country.
In addition to praise, however, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The Federal Board of Directors of the Juso School Groups demanded that the design of education policy no longer be "closed behind" by the ministers and university directors.
At the latest after the educational strikes, students as affected should now "speak a word."
The future academics received support from the president of the University Editorial Conference (HRK), Margret Wintermantel: "We need the students' experience," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Culture, with which the HRK discussed a joint reform paper.
The Trade Union Education and Science (GEW) did not go far enough in the Bonn decisions: it called for a legal claim that would allow each graduate to have access to a further master's degree course.
On the other hand, the countries must ensure that sufficient Master's courses are available for today's generation of Bachelor's students tomorrow with the best possible study conditions, says GEW's Board member Andreas Keller.
Countries need to recruit significantly more lecturers.
However, the Ministers of Culture did not express themselves to a more free access to the Master.
More than one footnote to Herta Müller
Entering in Germany and out is almost no control..." is the starting line of a poem by the poet Werner Söllner, in which these in disturbing speech fats address the arrival experience of a dissident who has gained freedom but at the same time lost his language space.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in the Romanian Banat, had initially worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a reader in a children's book publisher before moving to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded various literary awards, in 1993 he gave the legendary Frankfurt poetic lectures at Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been head of the Hessische Literaturforum at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
On the last Tuesday, during a conference in Munich, he saw to it that "German literature in Romania in the mirror and in the mirror of its securitite acts".
Söllner visibly insures and sets out a statement in which he obtained his cooperation as IM for the Romanian secret service Securitate, among others Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of the participants, Söllner had received the German Language Prize in 1989.
The recruitment attempts had started in a sluggish way, first in 1971.
I am, concluded Söllner, "so someone who has not defended enough against intimidation attempts of the securitates."
The poet Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
At the same time as the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and its unprecedented literary discussion with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene, and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, is shaken by a case that makes clear the abysses and disquietings of a political system based on surveillance and arrogance.
Werner Söllner is, as far as one can say according to previous knowledge, not only perpetrators but also victims.
In his securitate act IM Walter played a role, according to the confession Söllner of literary scientist Michael Markel and referred to the positive influence of IM Walter for him.
He had cut him out in all the difficult points for him at the time, according to Markel.
It would be a moral need for him to make this remark.
Söllner's statement was unexpected in the form and before this audience, however, the confession of an earlier dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service is not quite surprising.
Germany had been a cozy reserve for the Securitate Spitzel, and had already written Herta Müller in July after reading her own file, 914 pages.
The persons concerned, one may suspect, are speculated and in some cases also knew what a clear name was hidden behind the cover name Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Unlike in the case of the very process-proof sighting of the Stasi-acts in this country, the handling of the legacy of the securitate monitoring is still very diffuse.
A systematic investigation has been abandoned and hindered in recent years.
One of the Birthler authorities of the respective National Council for the Processing of Securitate Acts (CNSAS) was founded only in 1999 but the publication of the files has since been more sluggish.
Only since 2005 has there been a law governing the administration of the files.
According to the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, the influence of former Securitate members in Romania is still very high, where an earlier Securitate chief from Temesvar expressed a negative opinion about the award winner.
She's having a psychosis, after all, she's only been questioned once.
The infamy of power meant being able to express itself in the form of freedom of expression.
Certainly, the case of Söllner, as so often in connection with silent debt, is inevitable.
Why only now? Who has been damaged? The thoughtful response of the listeners to Söllner's confession makes it hoped that the continuation of this chapter will be determined by a desire of knowledge rather than by debt and shame.
In order to restore the work of Herta Müller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Saturation Supplement Champions League
It looked like a dressed outsider from a very nice Christmas party on which a sports goods manufacturer had distributed Goodies when the new VfB trainer Christian Gross accompanied by an orange plastic bag of the equipment went to a C-class a quarter of an hour after midnight. ̈
The man with the distinctive glatze let himself be chauffed because of the still strange city.
Otherwise he could have driven himself - alcohol was not in play after all, and drunk for luck the 55-year-old was just as little.
Had been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow work will continue.
Or let's go.
In the words of the first three days of the Swiss commitment: "We have achieved the eighth finale", namely, in the Champions League thanks to the 3-1 success against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not let ourselves be blinded by the success: it will be a brutal hard fight against the descent."
The " much more important task" is to be done on Sunday.
Then it is necessary to repeat in Mainz the king-class performance in the league day-to-day.
And to stop the quite again revealed weaknesses after the fast three gates by Marica (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.).
Solution
The eighth final of the Champions League (Hinspiele 16/17. + 23/24 February/ Rückspiele 9/10. + 16/17 March) will be released in Nyon on December 18th.
So the joy over the brilliant understanding of the Babbel successor remained.
Not only the supposed healer, who had taught the uncertain Stuttgart professionals self-confidence, willingness to use and joy of playing in the short time.
I went to the players and told them to think about their strengths, and stopped them to be more courageous, Soulklempner Gross explained the simple sounding recipe of success, which, however, had no longer been used under Therapeut Babbel.
He opened up a certain magic, admitted Babbel's proponent Jens Lehmann, "if a new impulse comes in football, sometimes things happen that you wouldn't have thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, after a weeks of injury break, immediately advanced to the best player in the field thanks to his dynamics, tried to describe the established "phenomen" with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the workings of the new superior: "He is a man who is pervading and demanding discipline.
That's what we need in the current situation."
There was a obvious lack of this under Babbel.
The VfB Stuttgart is not yet above the mountain, warns Sport Chief Horst Heldt
However, the VfB Stuttgart needs mainly Konstanz.
Like Gross, players and managers were guarded against overestimating the victory against a weakened and completely overshadowed defense of Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen at 0:4 that evil awakened, Khedira gave thought.
And Sport Chief Horst Heldt urged that although a seasonal goal had been achieved, the other was still in far distance.
We're not over the mountain yet.
The fact that hero was not significant on his 40th birthday even after the first home victory for three months was due to the events of the weekend, which revived in the form of a TV interview by goalkeeper Jens Lehmann, which was broadcast immediately before the start of the game.
There are decisions that make others and not the Jens, hero countered the harsh criticism of Lehmann.
He had accused the board of directors of weakness and had decided to change the coach on pressure from puberty fans.
Also that his free day had been deleted after games, Lehmann regarded as a sign of lack of sovereignty and disfavor.
Lehmann's statements were "influenced by pure egoism", hero turned back and announced consequences for the closing man.
They're probably not going to be friends for life anymore, the two forty-year-olds.
But after all, they agreed with all the others that without the preliminary work by the retired coach team, the playful and battleful strong idea would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a large share of success," said Heldt and Lehmann unisono - and the man also agreed with the plastic bag.
WM-Fight in Gravity
Hot Duel in Bern: Time and again provoked challenger Kevin Johnson World Champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended its heavyweight title after version of the WBC.
The judgment of the Court of First Instance was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains Box World Champion in gravity.
The 38-year-old champion, according to the version of the WBC association, defeated the American Kevin Johnson unanimously on Saturday in Bern by points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko it was the third successful title defense after his comeback in October 2008.
Prior to that, the Ukrainian was twice the world champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, the K.o. that everyone expected did not work.
Klitschko expanded his balance to 39 victories in 41 professional battles, twice he had to give himself beaten due to injuries.
In the 24th battle, Johnson had to take the first defeat.
Before about 17,000 spectators in the Bernese Arena, the 2.02 meter big Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight, especially with his left hand.
The 11-centimetre smaller Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, repeatedly withdrew from the world champion's beatings, so that Klitschko could not decisively bring his dangerous rights to the finish.
All in all, passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and tried only to get over the rounds.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his beatings only rarely hit the world champion.
After all, he is only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who went with Klitschko over the full distance of twelve rounds.
The challenger had provided some whirlwinds before the battle in the Swiss capital.
He insulted Klitschko as "hospitable zombie", who "can't do anything right."
On Friday, the champion let himself be provoked to push Johnson's sunglasses off the nose, "to see his eyes."
Fourth victory after Klitschko's Comeback
Klitschko also remained victorious in his fourth fight after his comeback on October 11, 2008.
After almost four years of time, he had beaten Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin at the time and had recovered "his" WBC belt, which he had to give up without fighting before.
This year he was forced to defend Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and in September Chris Arreola from the USA.
In this fight I only got one blow and I am very good in shape physically, Klitschko had founded the quick return to the ring.
His dream, however, remains the union of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is the world champion of the WBO and IBF associations.
But the WBA belt is worn by the Britishman David Haye after he was able to dethrone the 2,13-meter-large Nikolai Walujev in November.
Haye had previously cancelled a fight against Vitali Klitschko for September.
It is said that his doctoral company is already planning to fight Klitschko in the London Wembley Stadium.
Case Kunduz
Frontal attack from the opposition: Head of Green Group Jürgen Trittin has referred to Defense Minister Guttenberg as a liar for false information on the Kunduz affair.
SPD and left demand information from the chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the recent findings of Kunduz's air raid, the opposition Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) underwent a conscious deception.
The Minister said "knowably the untruth" to the deadly bombardment on two tank trains from September, said Green Group leader Jürgen Trittin on Saturday in the ARD news release "Tagesschau".
They call it national: He lied.
The order to kill had been issued in disregard of the rules of the International Protection Force for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the substance of the report that NATO had read to Mr Guttenberg, said Trittin.
On Friday it became known that the attack was not only about destroying the kidnapped vices, but also about killing two Taliban leaders.
In the US air raid requested by German Kunduz commander Colonel Klein, up to 142 people were killed or injured, according to NATO study report.
Greens, SPDs and left asked Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to speak immediately before the Bundestag and to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms. Merkel must clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the government's Afghanistan policy - and whether Chancellor's office, federal defence and intelligence have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and Green-College Renate Künast demanded.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm firmly rejected the criticism.
The Chancellor's Office did not influence the concrete operations of the Federal Armed Force in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there were also doubts about the presentation of the Ministry of the Backgrounds of the release of General Inspector Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert.
According to the SPIEGEL, the two Guttenberg have correctly and fully informed about the backgrounds of the tank laser attack.
Officially, they had said that they had denied the existence of NATO reports and had denied the Minister sensitive details.
However, from the environment of the two top officials, they stated that they had even pointed out several reports to the Ministry of Defence, including a two-sided document by the Commander Klein and a field hunter report.
Wichert is said to have asked in a letter for clarification of the facts, reports the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung".
He hasn't received an answer so far, it's called.
The Ministry did not comment on the allegations on Saturday and pointed out that this would be explained in the Bundestag Examining Committee, which wants to establish itself on Wednesday next.
Dream worlds
Some see images in a watchful state and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in mentally ill and in drug noise the boundaries between imagination and reality are blurred.
As long as it happens in sleep, everything is fine.
If we lie with our eyes closed in our dark rooms, we can give ourselves unrestrainedly to the wildest ideas and imaginations.
However, those who experience traumatic conditions in the watch, see and hear things that others do not see or hear, in the modern Western world are usually considered crazy or drug addicts, at least as special ones.
But such images and voices do not only arise in the mentally ill or in the intoxication of drugs.
Blame is our imagination: the same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels, sometimes make sure that the boundaries between dream, delusion and reality blur.
Dream-like changed wake-conscious states can occur in different forms, at best we call them visions, in the worst case craziest.
Even though triggers and effects may differ, the visions of mysticist Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, Shamanian rapture conditions, psychosis and hallucinations can be traced back to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of the neuronal messengers of the brain - especially dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - is degitified and the interaction of different brain parts is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and insane thoughts occur very often during schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity has no power over him anymore
The connection of delusion and dream has occupied philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of dream in a watchful state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, found in 1861 a "great similarity of error with dream conditions", for Sigmund Freud, the dream was even "a psychosis, with all inconsistencies, delusions, sensual deceptions of such a one".
It's autumn 2001, when Henning T. turned into a comic figure.
His body is two-dimensional and squeaky.
Gravity has no power over him, he's floating on the ceiling.
He feels a kick.
Behind him winged devils with blood-red, distorted frets, tumbling.
They hunt him, kick him with heavy, flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels the pain all over the body.
Loud, evil voices sound like walls and radio.
He can no longer bear them, the voices that insult and insult him.
Henning T. tears two cables out of the stereo system, knots them to a loop and attachs them to a hook on the ceiling.
He climbs onto a speaker and lays the loop around the neck.
Jumps.
The loop is loosening.
That's supposed to be a lesson to you, the voices in drum-fucking choir, "go to the clinic and get you healed!"
Today, Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychosis, the last is two years back, the first nearly 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizo-affic paranoid psychosis, and he is also manic-depressive, he takes medications, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
In the psychosis, I have experienced the worst fear and deepest despair, he says.
The tricks are cruel reality
About one percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia at least once in life, and in psychiatric clinics it is treated as second most common after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, those affected can usually no longer distinguish between the interior and the outside world, they get into an exaggerated state that can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship or persecution.
Especially common is listening to the voices - voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Also optical hallucinations are not rare.
The affected person can no longer separate important things from unimportant ones, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like the dream, the psychosis also opens the locks for a flood of ideas and fantasies that stems from deeper layers of consciousness.
The awareness of reality in the psychosis is subject-centred, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, senior physician of the Hospital for General Psychiatry at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrene is located in the center of the event, everything has a meaning aimed at it.
At the same time, he gets into a passive role, he is overwhelmed by the events and cannot actively shape them, just like in his dream.
Thus, schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
Realism is usually impossible for them, the tricks are cruel reality, they are excluded from awakening.
To have experienced hallucination once in a lifetime
Unlike in the dream, says Fuchs, "but the sensual and spatial structure of reality, which is perceived in the psychosis, remains in principle."
The crazy thoughts and hallucinations are in reality, the alienation of the experience takes place within the real framework.
Why exactly our brain beats caprioles is still a mystery for researchers.
Exceptional states can cause any person to lose the reality in a short time, says Fuchs.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that the genes are not alone determining factors.
Researchers assume that there is minimal brain damage in patients.
We suspect that the neuronal maturation of the brain at an early stage of development is disrupted by a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, for example, explains fox.
But there remains a mystery as to how the disorder of the neural system comes about, which also does not manifest itself for many years at first.
Environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be triggering psychosis when the disposition is present.
Hallucinogenic drugs can also trigger psychosis as they intervene in the transmitter system.
When Our Brain Goes Hot
The crazy one is, psychologists suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive medications to get rid of them, others spend money on drugs to get them, says Lübecker psychology professor Erich Box.
Whether imagery is considered pleasant or unpleasant is often only a question of the point of view.
Box has been collecting reports of hallucinations and sluggishes for ten years, and last year he evaluated his results in the book "The Irreal World in Our Head".
Hallucinations belong to the typical accompanying symptoms of psychosis, but also to amazingly many other diseases.
These include, in addition to mental disorders such as borderline or depression, diseases such as migraines, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's and skull trauma.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions even the brain of healthy people is hallucinating.
Hallucinations, says box, are composed of memory contents that are normally held back.
They arise when brain areas where sensory perceptions are processed are overactive or too little inhibited; if our brain is running hot or if stimulation is missing.
Drugs can cause this condition as much as brain damage or psychosis.
But it's also stimuli, stress, pangs of love or other mental exceptions.
In recent studies, up to a third of the respondents reported having experienced hallucination at least once in life.
In summer 2005 Sarah K. is 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, where she attends the gymnasium.
A normal girl, actually.
If there were not the pictures and voices.
During the break it may happen that a sluggish boy with long, dark hair addresses it.
When it answers, the fellow students look surprised - nobody else sees or hears this boy.
They think this shy girl is a crazy daydream, but Sarah K. doesn't dream, she knows.
She's awake, she hears and sees this boy, just as she hears and sees the girl in the bank next to her.
She can even feel his presence, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is that she likes the boy.
Am I crazy?, she sometimes asks herself.
But she knows that this boy and the other tricks are not real and disappear again.
At night the apparitions are mostly frightening
Often the tricks are also a burden.
When she sits in the classroom, she sometimes cannot follow the teaching material, because the teacher in her eyes and ears is just presenting a new student, while explaining mathematical equations for all the others, both hearing and visible.
At night, the apparitions are mostly frightening.
If she waits for sleep in her dark room, which comes much too rarely and far too late, she often cannot distinguish whether she is awake or already dreams of whether the pictures she sees are made of the fractures or the girl with the bleeding cuts of arms and legs, in front of her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, she screams at the shapes.
Parents and friends don't tell her that they'd think they were crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She passed school last year and lives with her friend.
A year ago, hallucinations stopped.
Since she made contact with the psychologist box on the Internet, she knows exactly that she's not crazy.
Wahn is also a work of art from despair
If someone is socially isolated or suffers from stimuli, he is likely to have hallucinations after a while, says box.
I suspect that the brain is then under-employed and provides itself for its entertainment.
Sarah K., a single child, was afraid of other children as a little girl, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at the age of 13, that the man she called Dad since she could think was not her physical father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations have the same brain areas, which also process real impressions and sounds, it is difficult to distinguish people like Sarah K. from tricks and reality. "Every experience," says Boxe, "is taking place in the brain, the reality is there.
Hallucinations are also images that cause the brain to arise, so they are so real."
Also nocturnal dream images rate box as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, psychological healthy people are able to recognize their imagery as irregular.
Boxes therefore advises its patients to appreciate hallucinations as a special ability.
Border state between dream and hallucination
Unfortunately, in our too much awareness-centered world, imaginary experience is mostly pathologised, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief physician of the Clinic for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy of the Florence-Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a severe, painful disease, but it also has positive, creative - wahn is also a work of art from despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has explored the so-called oneiroid form of experience, a particular form of traumatized alert consciousness.
Oneiroide are highly complex, detailed Quasi dreams, which the living person considers to be real and which he cannot distinguish from the watchful state even after.
The oneiroid state of consciousness arises in trauma or disease-related extreme situations, for example in polyradiculitis patients who experience motor paralysis when fully conscious.
When a person is threatened by self- and world loss, for example by persistent, complete inability to move, he replaces the life-threatening real situation with his own imaginary world, which is decoupled from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of border state between dream and hallucination.
Since dealing with a situation in reality is not possible, a world change takes place, but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
An intense form of sense-making and sense-making in an in itself unbearable situation that allows people to have their own design ability, not to suffer in nothing of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
The Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Clausen also describes his oneiroid experiences in his book "Heart Change" as the rescue action of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness travels for days after a heart valve surgery with subsequent heart transplant, while his body is condemned to motionlessness at the intensive care unit.
Clausen dives into a self-created world, visits strange times and places: he experiences himself as a bedridden, old man, aboard a train's anatorium, a robot watches over his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among nobles who produce intoxicants from blood.
Swallowed by a Greek on the motorcycle in his home country, he surfes with his hospital bed in the early snow of the Alps and meets a Korean mafioso.
He goes up completely in the imaginary event, everything is real, even later in memory.
These inner journeys are fundamentally different from every dream for Claussen.
Dream is a different state, he describes his experience.
By contrast, the memories of mental travel are super clear to me after years and in minor details.
More clearly and intensively even than truly experienced.
The intensity of this experience is spreading the horizon of our other life-world experiences, says the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, oneiroids, psychoses, hallucinations, and drug noise show how fragile our inner images of external reality are also on guard.
Any change in the state of consciousness, sums up the psychologist box, "can lead to a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that may well be enriching.
The snowfall can come
Burda
Children should take over the publisher at the age of 27
The new publishing director Kallen is an intermediate solution: Hubert Burda wants to give his company into the hands of his two children in the long term, he told the SPIEGEL.
The holding is expected to be 100 percent of the family in the future.
Hamburg - The publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the long term.
Both children inherit at the age of 27 and have the firm will to enter the company, the 69-year-old told the SPIEGEL.
The details have been carefully arranged.
The question of whether they are also active in the company arises only after that.
The question is also whether they are able to do so.
One cannot introduce 7500 employees to his children if they are not sufficiently qualified.
This kills the children and the company too.
Burda had announced on Thursday that he was withdrawing from the board of directors from January and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
The 52-year-old Kallen has been a member of Burda's board since 1999.
First, he was responsible for technology.
Later, with the Treasury division, the responsibility for corporate assets came along and after the exodus of Jürgen Todenhofer also the responsibility for direct marketing, abroad, pressure and finance.
For the first time, no member of the family is at the head of the publishing house.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who was 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
The designation of Callen also serves to bridge "10, 15 years", says Burda.
The holding company should also belong to 100 percent of the family in the future, said Burda.
With regard to the Schickedanz and Schaeffler cases, Burda said that family companies are not sure about the downfall either: "This always involved families who were infected by a capital search that completely speculated and thought they could rise to the very big player.
My strategy was never.
He never had world power dreams, says Burda.
I do not see myself as the political preceptor of this country, as it was Springer, nor do I want to play with 'Time' in the World League, these stores have grown too big.
Perfect Beauty
Everything you want in terms of beauty and well-being is now at your disposal.
At least this is what El Corte Inglés has done, which recently opened a shop with an area of more than 1000 m2 in the shopping center in Callao (Madrid), where everything is all about personal care.
In the wellness area, which is located on the eighth floor, you can find among other prestigious companies such as Hedonai, which provide a dehairing with laser; Spaxis, with rooms for relaxation and beauty treatments; the hairdressers Luis & Tachi, Marina d'Or with a gym or L'Occitane with its natural cosmetics.
But there is also a food department, which is characterized by its tea house with more than 130 different teas.
Enjoy a relaxing massage together with your partner while at the same time having a fantastic view of the capital, or for two hours renting the relaxation area to put your own beauty party on your feet with eight friends and then relax in the hot tub or with massages and a glass of champagne, these are just some of the many possibilities that Spaxión offers.
The total area is 250 m2, which is divided into 12 rooms for the latest facial and body treatments and for hydrotherapy.
For example, for cavitation in the fight against cellulitis or with vibrating surfaces.
The gym also has this kind of equipment, there are also virtual trainers who take care of the training units of the customers and thus offer them a perfectly personal training.
You start a training unit by entering a personal password on a touchscreen that is located opposite the devices.
After that, various videos show you how to do your training sessions properly.
The head of the gym guarantees that 15 minutes (including warm-up and stretching exercises) are sufficient to train the body muscles.
And if you want to look past the hairdressing salon after training your body, the company Luis & Tachi has a room where treatments for regaining hair beauty, shine and health are offered for your hair in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to be the key words for this wellness area in the middle of the city, which is always open from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. in the evening 365 days a year.
The Different Decolletés
Christmas is getting closer and closer and that's why it's a good opportunity to copy the look of the stars and bring their tights into our wardrobe.
The shape of the decolleté, which is very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the points to be considered.
Here are some proposals.
The singer Fergie has chosen an exaggerated and very complicated decolleté, which can only be discouraged.
Endesa and Barcelona by electric car
The electricity company Endesa has created the "LIVE Office" together with the city of Barcelona.
This is a project for the development and promotion of the electric car in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE Office" (logistics for the introduction of the electric car) will define and coordinate the road map for the introduction of the electric car in the city and make agreements on mobility through management, coordination, subsidisation, etc.
On the other hand, the project 'LE' will be designed to promote the electric car and to summarize opinions and actions in the areas concerned.
This is an attempt to advance the means of transport of the future.
3 "electric cities"
However, Barcelona is not the only city to be involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville also participate in this project.
These are the three cities selected by the government in the project ‘LE’ to accelerate the introduction of the electric car.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Government of Catalonia (la Generalitat).
This framework agreement seeks to promote the activities of research and technological development in the autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These activities are, among other things, those related to energy and, in particular, to its performance.
However, it is by no means the only initiative in which Endesa participates in the promotion of the electric car.
The company participates in standardisation groups across Europe and maintains a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees "a horizon of rest" for the automotive sector
President José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, prophesy of the Spanish automotive industry, which is the country's largest exporter, "a horizon of peace".
In the presentation of the 2009 economic report by the President of the Government, Zapatero once again recalled the measures launched by the government to support the automotive sector in the course of the government year.
"Without the plan for the competitiveness of the automotive industry, we today have a panorama of neglect and the closure of some of our main production plants," said the President of the Government.
"Thanks to this plan and to the willingness of car manufacturers to produce in Spain in a very competitive industry, we can see a quiet horizon for this industry, which is our largest export industry," he added.
He also recalled that the competitiveness plan, which is part of the overall automotive industry plan (PIA), has provided EUR 800 million for projects of 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which in turn provided investments of more than EUR 3 billion.
The head of government stated that these investments are intended both for the development of new models and for the modernisation of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also underlined the government's efforts to stimulate demand, in line with Plan 2000E, which is applied in cooperation with autonomous communities and car manufacturers.
According to the head of government, this plan allows emissions of new vehicles sold on the Spanish market to be reduced on average by 6 %, which in turn led to a "strong increase" in the approvals which "40 percent" increased in November.
On 20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
In Madrid, the first edition of the International Classic Motor Fair will be held, an exhibition for professionals and lovers of the world of engines.
This fair will take place from February 5th to 7th, 2010 at the Pabellón de Cristal of the Casa de Campo in Madrid.
On an exhibition space of 20,000 square meters, 200 domestic and foreign exhibitors will present their brands.
Not only can you marvel at classic motorcycles and vehicles, but you will also find all the possible articles in connection with the world of engines at the ClassicAuto Madrid.
This way you can find accessories, spare parts, components, fabric accessories, accessories, publications, miniature cars, etc. at the fair.
Hundreds of articles from the world of classic engines that will delight collectors and lovers.
Among the companies that will participate in this trade fair are Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, vehicle sales; Juan Lumbreras, restorations; Coupe-Francisco Pueche, sale and restoration of automobiles, specializing in Mercedes Benz.
Skill tests in the field of outdoors
In addition, the sales activities at this fair are supplemented by parallel events: meetings, sports car exhibitions, skill tests, events and competitions.
Skill tests with classic cars and motorcycles are also carried out on a specially equipped race track in the outside area of the exhibition grounds.
Mazda3 i-Stop: Eco-friendly sportiness
Mazda wants to prove that sportiness is compatible with the protection of the environment.
For this reason, Mazda recently introduced the engine's automatic stop and start system, baptized on the i-stop name, in the Mazda3 model, which is currently only available for the 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
This second generation of Mazdas 3 stands out by its good grades in the overall picture.
The final processing, the execution of the vehicle, the comfort, its street behavior, the mechanics, the i-stop system ...
All these aspects are "very good" at the new Mazda3.
Starting at the front seats you can find that the front seats offer an excellent ergonomic and good hold.
Furthermore, the game of the steering wheel is excellent.
In further viewing the unit consisting of the instrument board and the dashboard, Mazda is located with a variety of buttons and switches in the eye-catching colours red and blue, on the same line as the Japanese trend towards a futuristic interior design.
This style reminds us partly of the style of Honda Civics.
Therefore, it can be said without a doubt that both the Mazda 3 and the Civic, both Japanese models, stand out from the sobriety of German cars, especially the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to exceed.
The passenger room of these two Japanese compact cars offers more than ever the appropriate comfort so that four adults can drive comfortably by car.
To all of this comes a large and clearly shaped trunk.
The stop and start system is now only available for the 2-litre petrol engine with 150 hp and a 6-speed circuit.
This engine is a real pleasure. It stands out by its fineness, its quiet sounds, its performance and its low consumption.
And all those who don't drive many kilometers a year should consider this i-stop with petrol engine because of its great comfort in gear switching and its low consumption, even though at Mazda above all the diesel models are the most sold.
With regard to the equipment, the so-called Sportive model selected for the test drive is a special feature, since it has a much larger number of elements from the series equipment.
From the series equipment, the assistant for the change of track (RVM) above all emerges, which thus eliminates the dead angle, as well as the controls for traction and stability, speed control, light-sensitive interior mirror, the on-board computer with a large screen, the sensors for parking, an independent air conditioning, rain and light sensors, Bluetooth and audio bluetooth as well as the chromed 17-inch furs.
In addition, this version also includes, as if not enough equipment yet, the Premium package, which contains the following for additional 1,500 euros: in addition to other elements, especially the learning bixenon headlights and the sound system BOSE with CD-charger.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is particularly outstanding in terms of materials used, because of its driving behaviour and variety of equipment.
Moreover, those who don't travel many kilometers a year can also buy the i-stop version, which is only available with a 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
The only negative to this model is its slightly higher price, which is between 21.770 euros for the Luxury model and 23.270 euros for the sportive model.
However, the Mazda3 offers us every day as a counter-performance at this high price.
A premiere with lots of glamour
L. A. rolls out the red carpet of sensuality for Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premiere of "Nine", the stars, dressed in models that look as elegant as sexy, radiated more than ever.(Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as elegant as ever, chose a dark "Lady" dress.
The promises of FonPeek
Peek is at first limited, a device with which you can only read your emails without a way to see certain attachments or surf the Internet.
It enjoyed its five minutes of fame when it chose Time magazine as one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the street is rather unlikely, but the idea in itself is of particular interest to young people.
Unlike the smartphones, Peek costs very little and has a very cheap flat rate, for example only half of the price of the flat rate of an iPhone.
After the company has seen the success, it has launched two new devices: one that is only intended for Twitter, the other with a lifetime free service for data, quite unlike the peek, where you have to pay a six times higher price.
Fonpeek, which was presented at the Le Web event yesterday, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same boundaries, however, as its American counterpart, has a surprise ready.
The monthly maintenance price for the telephone, about 12 euros a month, includes roaming for the whole of Europe.
Those who travel around the world with a smartphone already know what it means to miss out on all the data to be able to read their emails once you have crossed the country border or if you are desperately looking for a café with WIFI (or a connection with Fon).
The idea of roaming with flatrate is incredibly seductive and should have been possible for a long time.
It is true that some telephone providers already offer special contracts and prices for stays abroad, but in my experience you already need a PhD in physics and a good glasses to read all the small prints.
The repeated criticism by the European Commission regarding affordable roaming tariffs for Europe has almost always been ignored.
Outside one's own country, one is always afraid to read his emails and that is right.
The fact that a small device like FonPeek (where it's always amazing that it has the name Fon, although it doesn't have a WiFi/WLAN) can offer this kind of tariffs means that telephone providers have to think slowly, but safely and start to consider different ways to use their data network.
Kindle is another good example of this, and its prices include downloading books and further requests on the Internet.
Without vet and no hooks.
This is an internet-enabled device and you pay for it only once, when buying, and not month after month.
And that's exactly what I expect from FonPeek one day, a purchase opportunity with lifelong internet access as the peek already offers in the USA.
And that's not because I want to buy it.
I read my emails by phone, thank you.
But I expect this because I believe that it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The fetish color of Michelle
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the American First Lady.
As President of the United States, Barack Obama already appeared in a dress and coat of this color and has chosen the same color again to accompany him in his, without doubt, second most important moment in his life: the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama wore very similar models on both occasions: besides that it was almost the same color - a shiny green yellow -, the clothing consisted of three parts - dress, jacket and coat made of the same fabric, and to it she wore somewhat large-sized embroidered or a necklace.
It even goes as far as it seemed at first sight that the First Lady of the United States wanted to follow the example of the Princess of Asturias and decided to wear the same dress on more than just one occasion.
However, the two dresses differ greatly in the fabric from which they are made.
At the introduction she wore a lace dress and a patterned velvet in Oslo.
The accessories were also different: for the first time green shoes with half-high heels and for the second time a similar model, but gold-colored.
Also the hairstyle was different every time: the hair was put up as a hair wreath on this occasion, while the hair was open at the previous time.
75 % of the working mothers have been having problems at work because of their motherhood
Discrimination in work has increased in recent years, especially among the younger women who want to have children.
CSIC's study on women's fertility and career in Spain, in cooperation with the Institute for Women, comes to this conclusion.
The survey of 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 leaves no doubt as to whether 75% of women working in employment see their career opportunities restricted on the labour market due to their motherhood.
The study reveals that there are major differences in the decision to create a family and the number of children, depending on whether women work or not and, if so, what kind of occupation they practice.
Those of them who do no other activity outside the house, work only half a day or do not have a fixed employment contract will rather be mothers and have more children.
In contrast, women move with a permanent employment, especially in the public sector, the establishment of a family and motherhood and therefore have fewer children.
"The women in the age group between 35 and 49 years of age with a fixed position receive their first child on average only 3.7 years after moving together, a number that increases to 4.1 years for women with permanent employment who have taken longer to achieve this and who have been moving together and the first child has only realized much later.
Furthermore, the type of work also has a major influence on maternity, though less than the calendar in terms of conception," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that needs to be taken into account in the age of women in marriage and the first child.
According to the survey, the higher the age at the time of marriage and the first child, the higher the level of education.
This difference could also be seen in women of the same age.
For example, the women in the group were between 35 and 49 years of age, depending on whether they had only the primary education or a higher education, on average with 25.1 or 32.1 for the first time.
There is also a further difference between women depending on their level of education.
While the women with the primary degree are already married before their first permanent position and have their first child, women with a middle or high school degree are doing exactly different and are looking for a permanent position and getting married after it and then getting their first child, says Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
L'Oréal Paris recently added a new name to his envied list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
As of next year, the German actress will be the image of various products of the brand and will also say the widely known advertising statement "Because you are worth it".
The main actor from "Joyeux Noël", one of the most elegant actresses at international level, will become another famous sign like Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her were the last to join this exclusive club the actress Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millonaire").
In men, the cosmetics company also has only exceptional ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (" Grey ́s Anatomy') and Matthew Fox (Gospel College of Evangeline in Lost).
The award ceremony of the British fashion industry
The British have an important word to speak in the fashion world.
Their highest representatives - fashion designers and models, both yesterday and today - met at the annual award ceremony held in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
On this occasion they were all published.
The ex-model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was elected the best model this year.
Manuel Vicent's poker game
Manuel Vicent presents in "Poker der Asse" (Alfaguara, pictures of Fernando Vicente) the three-dimensional X-ray images of writers who accompanied him in his literary life (and, in some cases, in real life).
He does not use a predictable and fearsome genre (short biography, life and work), but looks for a similarity to the glowing heart of the Creator.
The trip is exciting and Vicent does not save on horrors or enlightenments.
Besides that this book is a delicious reading pleasure, it is also a moving invitation to read and read again and again.
Here are some excerpts from the book.
About Albert Camus: "When reading his pages, I found out that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but rather a spiritual, almost sensual drive, just as I always felt it, without finding words for it: the joy contrary to the unwholesome fate, the morale without guilt and the innocence without any God."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorian Christian, he wrote about what he had in his blood, not in his mind, between powerlessness and ignorance, with a captivating poetic humor, without any sense, like the knife blade that would almost have killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our husband was led by this woman with a passion that lasted for thirteen years, whose flesh was engrossed by the emotions of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted in coming to heaven on the way of destruction."
About James Joyce: "The Odysseus" was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the 8000 peaks in worldwide literature, one has to climb up the north wall, on the wall where the best climbers always try to get new."
About William Dauphin: "He was a comical chewer.
He sometimes said about himself that he was the heir of a landlord of the county, and other times he said that he was the son of a black and a crocodile.
Both dreams bore witness to a certain kind of grotesque."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer recorded the crazy cry, which was cried out from a bridge by that personality from Munich, so that his echo sounded in his literary way until deep into the night of the 20th century. This he made on a journey on which he fled from himself and, with a speech of violence, begged the afterworld before the worms.
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she kneeled and prayed: my dear God, I ask you to do everything in your power so that I may finally stop writing like a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave these verses of Spencer are engraved: 'the sleep after the effort,/ after the thunderstorm of the port,/ the rest after the war,/ after a full life one finds pleasure in death."
About Virginia Wolf: "In her luggage she always had her depression.
The husband took it with complete normality when she told him that Eduard VII was spying on them between the azaleas or that the birds were singing in Greek.
It is not known any other case where the man was so patient and fell in love with a neurotic whose literary talent was still much bigger than her madness."
About Pío Baroja: "What else did Martín-Santos do than try to infuse Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet mean, if he didn't bring Baroja up to the weapons of it?
What did Cela do, except to destroy the glory of that man, that he might put himself on this podcast?"
Fig aggression
My 70-year-old mother walked through our district in the village of Fuenlabrada last week, when suddenly a group of young people between 15 and 18 years of age came next to her and our dog, our dog is a mixture that we brought out of the shelter and which weighs just six pounds, and then they missed him two steps from the bright sky and so badly injured him.
We cannot put our indignation into words, because it is incomprehensible to us, because the fun is supposed to be in a cheap aggression against a small and helpless animal, which was naturally carried out on the leash.
In addition, the suffocation attack that a woman who was walking comfortably received when she wanted to correct these persons because of the incident even feared for her own life, for if such a madman attacks a dog, he may also do the same with a woman, a child, an older master or probably even with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The incident occurred in a normally quiet district at five o'clock in the afternoon on an ordinary Tuesday.
The dog's been camping all day.
Of course, we have returned an advertisement in a nearby police department, but we have great doubts as to whether this will bring something at all and to prevent any prejudices from the beginning, we only want to make it clear that the cowards were Spaniards.
Our disillusionment over the events has prompted us to show this incident.
We cannot understand what must be done in the minds of these young people that they find a cheap attack on a helpless animal funny on an animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and persons have remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
The tire manufacturer Michelin, in cooperation with the Spanish Transport Safety Foundation (Fesvial), launched a campaign to promote helmet use, especially among the younger motorcycle drivers, as both companies announced today.
This initiative aims to draw attention to the importance of helmet use, as it is ultimately the only protective element that can prevent head injury or even death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign was part of her commitment to road safety, which "contains more than just the design and manufacture of products that are becoming more and more secure every day" and also confirmed that they also contribute to the development of this objective by other actions of educational and informative character.
This new campaign to promote helmet use on the motorcycle, which runs under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will distribute posters at a first phase to over 500 motorcycle workshops in order to achieve the best possible distribution.
Finally, Michelin stressed that transport safety is "a constant concern" of the company, and precisely because as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles, they are always committed to one of their main objectives being the development of ever safer products.
The sale of small trucks increases slightly again
After nearly two years, the car market for small transporters finally begins to see some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9.425 vehicles registered in Spain in November represent an increase of 12.6% in 2008 and, more importantly, they are therefore the first increase even after 22 consecutive months with a steady decline, according to the figures presented by the manufacturer association Anfac and the car dealer association Ganvam.
However, these good figures are currently only to be enjoyed with great caution, as the reference data used for comparison are November 2008, which was a particularly bad year of sales with a 60 % decrease over the previous year.
However, it should be borne in mind that, apart from the increase in the last month, the total registrations of these 11 months are still 40 % below the sales figures for the previous financial year.
Since January, a total of 95,853 vehicles have been sold, but in this number all vehicles consisting of the small transporter market are included: passenger cars, pick-ups, small vans, small vans and lighter small lorries/cars.
Furthermore, the same thunderstorm clouds in the sky are still the most affected by demand, because even if some of the vehicles are bought by private persons, the majority of sales to small and medium-sized enterprises, which in almost 100% of all cases make the purchase with a third-party financing.
For example, these restrictions, which are the result of the turnover of credit institutions, must include other factors, such as the increase in the rate of unemployment or the duration of the bad economic situation.
In this panorama and in contrast to the passenger cars, financial support has been little in the purchase of a vehicle of Plan 2000E.
This plan, however, is not only intended for private individuals, but also for self-employed and small enterprises, if they want to buy a small transporter up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emissions which may not exceed 160 grams per kilometre, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday, Ganvam reminded us that it is absolutely necessary for the state to pay special attention to these small trucks as well as, of course, to industrial vehicles (last-cars and buses).
The car dealer association prophesies for 2010 a year similar to the one that has just passed, for which it expects a sales failure (in passenger cars and off-road vehicles) of 19 %.
Support for brake maneuvers in critical situations is now mandatory
As was the case with the ABS anti-lock brake system at that time, and just as with the stability control ESP, the emergency braking aid systems must become a requirement in European cars.
In fact, they are already mandatory for all newly approved passenger cars and light transporters, and for the remaining vehicles, a karenz period has been set by the end of February 2011.
The aim of the measure adopted by the European Union is to improve the protection of foot-and-mouths, but these braking systems can also help to prevent many accidents due to their operation.
The task of the emergency brake assistant is to exert more pressure on the brakes in the event of a critical brake maneuver, which recognizes the system on the brake pedal by means of the brake strength performed by the driver.
However, this system does not exercise this pressure until the end.
According to an investigation commissioned by the component manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles, a third of the drivers involved in an accident were no longer able to hit the brake pedal before the crash and half of them had not braked with full force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The brake aid, on the other hand, intervenes in the braking system with maximum force and thereby reduces the braking time and thus also the brake distance that a car saves during the braking process.
According to a study conducted by the EU, up to 1,100 fatal accidents that cause harm every year could be prevented if all cars were equipped with this type of emergency brake assistant.
There would be even fewer accidents - it is expected that every fourth accident with personal injury could be prevented - as soon as the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems become popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that detects obstacles (via radar or a camera) and warns the driver, while at the same time exerting a slight pressure on the brakes.
If the driver responds, the system will help him increase the pressure on the brake pedal if it becomes necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the collision is inevitable, the brake assistant exerts the maximum pressure on the brakes in order to keep the damage as low as possible.
General Motors shifts the plan for Opel until January
While the staff of the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) were already informed by Nick Reilly, the new Chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April, probably on 8th, according to Javier Ortega, the American vehicle manufacturer points out that he needs more time to complete the Opel rescue plan.
Nick Reilly, the new Chairman of GM Europe, wants to achieve that the site concerned already gives its approval to each point of the plan in advance.
And for this reason, it may be that the final document, which will first be presented to the workers and then to the governments of the countries in which there are works, will be postponed until the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, GM is assured that it will take a decision in the next few days regarding the sale of Saab.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the American car builder to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to be in contact with some possible new buyers.
One of these buyers could be Geely, who would also like to buy Volvo, but the Dutch manufacturer of the Skyper sports cars, who has back cover from the Russian group Converg, is gaining ever stronger approval.
If none of these buyers were to reach an agreement, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year, if it has not been sold until then, will continue to be maintained.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive jewels, the engineers used the Boxster S as the basis, and they really managed to make it 80 kilos easier, which makes it only 1.275 kilos.
In order to create such a thing, they were the first to abandon the automatic folding roof, which was replaced by a wall roof with a manual drive, so that only 21 kilos were saved; thanks to the aluminium doors used in this model such as the GT3's "disappear" another 15; by removing the air conditioning even 13 more; in addition, the fuel tank was reduced from 64 to 54 litres, thus saving another 7 kilos; by installing sporty Bacquet seats another 12 and saving five more with the light 19-inch furs.
Then, too, by abandoning the audio system CDR-30, one had reached another six kilos less and by replacing door handles with handles made of fabric the missing kilo reached.
Although it is also available with the PDK double-coupling gearbox, the test drive was carried out with a 6-speed manual gearbox, mainly on the smaller California country roads, on mountain ranges that were really very curvy.
In his driving behavior, he can only be given the note impeccablely.
The reduction in his weight, however, has by no means led to the fact that he would no longer be so safe on the road.
It's the opposite: we haven't tried such a small and light model for a long time, but at the same time it also gives you a feeling of great security at the curves, even at high speed.
He's a little athlete, able to warm his muscles at a low passage in the required time, until we give him the orders to race, brake, recover and then get everything out of his engine again ...
The car does everything we can with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to its steering, which is as communicative as well as precise.
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon.
A motor sound for all tastes
The sound of his V6 boxer with 320 hp (10 more than the Boxster S) has been very successful and you can increase it with the 'sport' option as well as with a system that can change the engine noise, which was already used for the first time in the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is unimaginable brutal, whether out of the stand or when re-accelerating.
The suspensions are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the country streets on which we drove the Boxster Spyder was already quite damaged, but the car mastered the hitholes well.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do throughout the course; and this, although we found ice in the morning gray and roll split in some of these curves in the morning.
In summary, you can say that it is an ultra-light car, a car with which you have an indescribable driving pass, as it might otherwise be rare and in it is much more than just a small improvement of the Boxster Ss.
The car will be on the market in February 2010 and will cost 70,831 EURO.

The singer, a bus friend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of the cosmetic line Coco Cocoon and an occasion starlet at the fashion shows of 'maison', she presents her evil face with the same neck rigidity as her pockets of Chanel.

The Basque Gives Himself a Victory in Israel
The Caja Laboratory, despite the many outstanding players in the team of Dusko Ivanovic, celebrated an excellent triumph with 82-91 during its visit to the complicated football field of the Maccabi Electra and thus came to first place within his group after the grand performance of Mirza Teletovic, who was the best of his team with eight triples (29 in the rating).
The Vitoria team was able to replace the significant failures of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large dose of deployment and teamwork, even though they have to wait for their victory until the bitter end.
The great hits from the perimeter with 16 rated triples contributed to their final victory.
The game began with the lead of the blue-reds, who sat at the top of the ad panel from the beginning.
Since the first four baskets of the Vitoria team had already come out of the perimeter, it was already possible to imagine that they had come to the field with well-heated wrists.
It was English and Teletovic, mainly responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was hardly different, only that the team from Álava chose a Barac's inner game and the game of Eliyahu, who was received on his return to the team with whistles and applause, which is his home to continue to grow their advantage until the break (34-43).
Teletovic has already begun to highlight himself as the best of his team with 13 points, even if the "minus six" rating of Splitter had already suggested that this would not be the best evening of the Brazilian.
Nevertheless, despite the clear advantage of the break, the game had not yet been decided and the Maccabees wanted to remind the vitorians once again that not everyone wins on their field, and thanks to the constantly attacking "hand of Elías" they came back into play.
Eidson and Pnini made a decisive contribution to the "yellow" turning around the row (50-49).
More Disadvantages
The team of Ivanovic, injured, but anything else but dead, had to prepare a few moves with meeting security to get air again and at one of them suddenly came the gun of Mirza Teletovic, who with three almost consecutive triples and with the support of English and Ribas made sure that on the ad panel was again displayed a calming distance from (54-67) which the host could beautify at the end of the third quarter with (57-67).
The alveses were blushed in the last quarter and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already announced that they would not allow anyone to take away the victory they had earned honestly in the first three minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson resigned, the best of their team not and tried to give their team back by three points from the line (70-77).
Nevertheless, and although it was placed out of place for Fouls, Ivanovic's team did not give up, defending itself well and although the Israelis were still catching up in the last minute (80-85), the game had already lost a winner and Tel Aviv for the first time in this season.
Injuries prevented Unicaja from being told the forehead
Unicaja lost loud in Greece against Olympiacos and had to take the lead in the group B of the Euroliga to him, and that was marked in a game marked by the failures by the players of Unicajas (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially in the inner game, which facilitated the Greeks' victory.
The team from Malaga was not afraid of the mood in the hall of peace and friendship or of the opposing team, which is perhaps one of the strongest in Europe and has a lot of money.
Thanks to their play presented in the first quarter, the Andalusians were allowed to start dreaming. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two of them through Omar Cook and one through Guillem Rubio, blinded the hosts in the 9th minute from 12-18.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the one Unicaja, even though the local team with an inner game between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis managed to display the ad panel in the 13th minute 22-20 in their favor, the minute in which, due to an action, it would almost have come to the beating between the two Americans Beverley and Williams and therefore both were disqualified.
The Greek team finally began to warm up and its superiority on both sides of the game, while leaving the Englishman Joel Freeland due to an injury and the three self-inflicted mistakes of Carlos Jiménez left clear traces of the Unicaja.
Among its players in the field and the Lithuanian foreplayer Linas Kleizas, with its triples, they increased their advantage in the 19th minute to 44-32.
It was impossible to catch up
The third part of the game was characterised by many attacks against the Olympic team, which despite its 19 losses was superior and even managed to compensate for the difference in the game carried out in Malaga with 66-48 in the 27th minute, which in turn led the group to weaken.
Unicaja tried to get away with the many failures and the excretion of the injured shot Robert Archibald during the game.
Despite the many disadvantages for the Unicaja in the 31st minute thanks to the spring guide and the triples of Cook and the use of Lewis again came a little hope for 66-57.
Nevertheless, it was impossible, as soon as it attacked and showed its superiority with centimetres within the basket area, the Olympiacos could not be braked.
In the 37th minute, Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic managed to raise the basket difference to 81-62 and Unicaja had to beat himself and had to take the lead atOlympiacos.
How much should you earn from your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can now experience their salary due to their profile thanks to the new application Trovit, the search engine with most ads of real estate, job offers and cars in Spain.
The tool "How much should you earn?" calculates the salaries of users based on more than 140,000 job vacancies available at Trovit in Spain. Users can enter a form on Facebook that allows them to enter their profession, professional experience, age and city in which they work.
Already after a week after the application was available for the first time, the search engine found out that the Spanish worker on average "feels badly paid", explains Trovit's controller Albert Ribera, in a press release.
The Spanish are the worst paid according to the data that Trovit has through its search engines in Great Britain and France.
A British programmer receives an annual gross salary of 45,226 euros and a Frenchman of 31,059 euros, unlike the 24,000 euros that a Spanish earns.
Consequently, a truck driver has an annual net salary of 34,247 euros in England, 25.751 in France and 16,420 euros in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid work in Spain is a waiter with an annual net of 11,592 euros; followed by the work of a seller with 14,725 euros and that of a worker with 15,667 euros.
The most frequently sought-after posts on the Internet in the last three months are those of a driver, half-day jobs and social workers.
Brazil calls Zelaya a date to leave
The Brazilian government has set a time limit for Manuel Zelaya's stay in her Embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The President who has been discharged from the Office shall leave the diplomatic representation by 27 January 2010 at the latest if his mandate officially expires
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegate of the Brazilian Embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knew that before that date he must have left the message in which he had found asylum since September 21.
"He is aware that he has to go on 27 January, as his mandate expires on that day and he has to look for a new accommodation."
The station also quoted the ex-president, who confirmed his intention to leave the message before the appointed date: "My position is to go as soon as possible, logically with the back cover of the government of Brazil," Zelaya said on the phone.
After the elections on 29 November (with which Porfirio Lobo was the winner), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian Embassy until January.
However, this week he tried to get refuge in Brazil.
However, this failed because of the refusal of Zelayas to recognise the status of an asyl-seeking politician who wanted to impose on him the "de facto" government, chaired by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you!
After the most tempting days since last spring, when the asset inflation was the dominant mood in the markets, uncertainty has returned to the markets, which is in no way surprising, since this is its natural state, in an environment where the brokers make decisions about a naturally uncertain future.
The measure used to stabilise the markets was to settle the debt with the direct purchase of assets and indirectly leave the liquidity free at interest rates that move around zero so that banks buy assets for calculation.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets are almost finished and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, they are beginning to spread some sand into the gear, as the BCE näc already suggested with its annual auction taking place next week.
That is why investors doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without these heterodox measures and we are currently witnessing a reversal in reducing risk premiums.
The fleets of the stock exchanges and the differences in corporate bonuses are rising again, even though they are still far away from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
The States were forced to address the private risks and government debt is increasing again.
We now rely on quality and the USA, Japan and Germany are the preferred place of refuge for investors, which in turn leads to an increase in the differences of the eurozone countries in terms of Germany.
Spain was hardly affected by this episode of instability until now, but then came Standard & Poor's and threatened to come down with a new revision regarding the assessment of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty does not harm to silence the defenders of the moral risk who once again tried to raise awareness of what they had caused in the world economic policy, since they had slowed down the devastating effects that the restriction of credit to job losses would have had when they were supposed to have decided on a new day for the action of thanks.
Nevertheless, what happened in Dubai points to a tribal war between the Emirs in order to restore power in the Emirates, and the development in Greece was predicted even earlier.
A government that conceals government debt, elections and a new government that is drawing the same line.
Prodi made it in Italy to Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal to Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to rescue Hungary from non-fulfilment of its foreign payments at the beginning of the year and thus allow a euro-member country to cease fulfilling its obligations.
On the other hand, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and to take its citizens in the need for extraordinary action to maintain the stability of state funds.
Yes, as expected, we are in front of an episode of normalising the risk premiums, after some outlays on too high amounts, would now be within the expected.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to worry as long as the differences in public debt increase at the same rate as European corporate bonuses.
However, if the European differences were to be reduced and the Spanish continued to increase, this would be a special Spanish risk.
This is a farce from Standard & Poor's. While the preferred indicators force a large part of the market research institutes to prefer their scenarios for recovery and to correct their 2011 scenario upwards, including the OCDE and the European Commission, which are therefore coming back with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, all this does not promise a long life in spite of warnings.
Once again, it seems that it is an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish shares, although at the moment "prudential driving" is announced.

The chairman of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to appear yesterday before the Parliament's Subcommittee, where the strategy for Spain's energy supply will be debated over the next two decades.
After his appearance, followed by the chairman of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press a few tips on what he had submitted to the Subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to the president of Iberdrola, Spain will have to invest EUR 50 billion by 2020 and another 60 billion from that date until 2030, provided that current nuclear power plants continue to operate.
If this were not the case, the necessary investment would not amount to 60 billion, but to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that it is no longer necessary to invest in an increase in energy production capacity, but in distribution networks and international alliances.
From 2020 onwards, the question will change and performance should be increased.
His proposal focuses both on gas and coal plants with carbon dioxide collection facilities and, of course, on renewable energy.
In this case, it assumes that 18,000 MW will be needed more, under the presumption of course by other "support energies".
Galán, who believes that the draft law for a sustainable economy, which has just been adopted by the government, is in line with what his company has called for, never wanted to say anything against this law, how to create incentives for national coal consumption, which would be the opposite of all policy strategies in the fight against climate change.
In his opinion, "in the long term, this direction is clearly set, despite some "individual" measures, as the chairman of Iberdrola called them.
Whether it be, Galán believes that decisions on investment should already be taken, even if they are long-term, as it will take some time and a stable remuneration framework should be created to tackle them.
Ferrovial gets the "handling" from Aer Lingus at ten airports
The subsidiary of Ferrovial for services at airports on the ground, the Swiss port in Switzerland, is the preferred partner of the Irish flue company Aer Lingus for the luggage service at ten European airports where they are represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The agreement, which has not yet been published, is based on five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the government of Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares yesterday signed a protocol for cooperation to create an innovation centre for intelligent infrastructures.
The Alliance is planning investments of 20 million by 2012, of which 50 % will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be to examine energy efficiency at motorways and airports.
Acciona competes with High Depth and Bouygues for its first motorway construction in Australia
Acciona is fighting for the approval of its first motorway in Australia, a market where they are already represented as energy and water companies.
The construction is a tunnel that will cost 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about 1.047 billion euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German high depth are its competitors.
A 5 km long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for Acciona to establish itself in the country as a construction company and highway operator.
The city administration wants to have completed construction at the end of 2014.
After the administration had decided on a public-private cooperation (PPP is the English abbreviation) to advance the project in accordance with a business plan established by Ernst & Young, the administration is already in possession of a final list of candidates for construction and toll management.
In anticipation of the offers presented in May, the estimated investment amounts to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (€1.047 billion), with three consortia, consisting mainly of European construction companies, competing in the last phase.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first company is one of Australia's largest construction companies, while the second is based in Italy, one of the best in civil engineering.
Against the Acciona team, the Consortium of Northern Direct, formed from the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield, which is responsible for the infrastructure and the French Bouygues construction group.
The third and last consortium, which is in the narrower election, is called LBRJV, formed from the capital of the Australian Leighton (daughter company of the German construction company Hochtief, which in turn belongs to ACS), the also native Baulderstone (in the possession of the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the French company Razel, which specialized in public construction.
The Australian market for infrastructure promises huge construction and privatisation, however, has an obstacle to overcome, as only through the purchase of a local construction company can one access.
A strategy followed by the companies Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and which must be followed by the Spanish building giants.
Even ACP has gained access to this market only through its 30 % interest in high depth, owner of the said Leighton.
millions of assets
In this geographical area, Acciona is of the highest importance for the industry, where it is already very well known because of its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination industry.
Among other assets, it already has its largest windmill park (192 MW) in Victoria and leads the group of companies that were commissioned to build and manage Adelaide's desalination plant with a budget of 700 million.
Its intention now is to consolidate in these two areas and use these synergies to gain access to the construction and infrastructure branches.
The underground toll route, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and called Northern Link (Nordzubringer), has the purpose of connecting the western motorway in Toowong with the surrounding street in Kelvin Grove (see map) to a length of 5 kilometres through tunnels. This is the largest measure to reduce congestion on Brisbane streets.
The roadmap issued by the city administration foresees the allocation for summer 2010 and the start of the construction work in December next year.
Although this toll line is already to be opened for traffic in the last months of 2014, construction work is expected to continue until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
It has two lanes in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland government is involved in financing with 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros).
For high depth Brisbane is already a big business.
Australia repeatedly awards substantial orders to high depth, which yesterday signed a contract with the government of 154 million.
The ACS subsidiary will improve the infrastructure of the domestic broadband network with fiber optic cables by means of its local subsidiary Leighton.
This improvement will allow 400,000 people to quickly access the Internet and employ the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the King George Tower’s 27-storey construction project in Brisbane’s Australian city. The construction work has not yet begun and Hochtief has received 129 million.
Also in the United Kingdom, in Manchester, it competes with Laing O'Rourke for the construction and administration of two schools for 25 years.
Initial investments amount to 75 million euros.
FCC receives the order for a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC has provided itself over its subsidiary Alpine, the construction of a tunnel over 2.1 kilometres long for a motorway in Slovenia over the sum of 64.5 million euros.
The company received this contract only a few days after it had received the surcharge for the construction work to expand the Bosruck tunnel (Austria) over 130 million.
In this way, Alpine strengthens its experience in tunnel construction.
The start of the construction work is planned for the beginning of 2010 and its execution will last more than 32 months.
Sra. Rushmore receives advertising from Renfe
Renfe has attributed the advertising and marketing services to the agency Sra for the next two years. Rushmore reported about three million euros annually.
In this contract there is also the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Sra. Rushmore was selected among 16 agencies which presented itself for this competition, which was awarded by Renfe, of which 4 came into the final round, among them TBWA, which was responsible for advertising in the last three years.
From now on, Sra. Rushmore will be commissioned to design and manufacture the campaigns.
Punish over 63 million for France Télécom because of the suspension of competition.
The competition regulatory authority in France has imposed a penalty of over 63 million euros on France Télécom for anticompetitive behaviour in the Caribbean regions belonging to the country.
According to the Authority, the telephone provider has restricted competition in landline and mobile phones by signing exclusive contracts, price plans and loyalty programmes for consumers on the verge of regulation.
Together with this penalty, the former French monopoly and still state-owned companies have accumulated more than 560 million euros in penalties since 1994 because of the disability of its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday was even increased, as the authority that is watching over competition believes that France Télécom has committed similar violations in the past and has therefore become retroactive again.
Application trade
On the other hand, the subsidiary of the French company has followed the example of other telephone providers and has opened an application site on the Internet to increase revenue from businesses that do not come from the telephone connection.
In principle, this application website of Orange is active in France and the United Kingdom.
One has to wait until 2010 until this settlement will also be available in other countries, such as Spain.
The game at the Champions League has brought Madrid and Barça to 476.4 million since the beginning of the season.
The 1992 Champions League has developed into a source of income for football clubs.
So much that Real Madrid and Barcelona have since taken 476.4 million, bringing them the third and fifth place of football clubs that have earned the most money in the league.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
To win the UEFA Champions League brings not only fame. It is also one of the main sources of revenue of the big clubs.
According to UEFA, the league has distributed up to €5,362.5 million to 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) who have participated in this event since its inception in the 1992/1993 season.
Real Madrid and FC Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The white club is third in Europe, which has earned the most money through its participation and the only one who has won the trophy three times next to AC Milan.
The last winner of the former European Cup in 1992 is the final winner of the Catalan champion.
The list is led by Manchester United and Bavaria Munich, two teams that also took the most money by their participation in the last Champions League.
And that, although they lost to Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only third in the countries that could take money through the champions, although it has more titles than all the others (five, unlike four bee Italy, three in England and two in Germany).
Distribution
This obvious contradiction is explained by the complicated money allocation procedure applied by UEFA.
In this financial year, the organization, whose chairman is Michel Platini, expects revenue of 1,090 million through the Champions League.
From this money, UEFA provides 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 football clubs that participated in the qualification preliminary round (including the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
Moreover, those who fought for a match received 3.8 million by their sheer presence, in addition to the 550,000 euros for each game they fought.
There is also a bonus for winning (800,000 euros) and for a match (400,000 per team).The clubs that have come to the eighth finale each receive three million; the four that have come to the quarter finale, 3.3 million.
The last four receive 4 million each.
The winner earns 9 million, unlike the second, who receives 5.2 million.
Thus, a football club receives at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million fixed revenue.
Barça again earned 2.5 million in the European Supercup in August.
However, the variable payments for which 337,8 million are planned will be added.
This money is given proportionally at the value of each individual television market.
The Spanish is one of the first and has 4 assigned places.
Last year's champion receives 40% of the assigned money, 30% of the second, 20% of the third place and 10% for fourth place.
The other part is distributed according to the number of games they play in this year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million for 29.9% participation in Sos
The group Nueva Rumasa yesterday sent details about the sale of shares with which it intends to acquire a ceiling between 25 and 29.9% of Sos' capital.
A percentage that does not force them to make a public tender (opa) due to the number of shares.
In concrete terms, Nueva Rumasa offers 1,5025 euros per share paid out to ten years and with an interest rate of 1% per year due to this shift.
Yesterday, the Sos shares closed at EUR 1.85, which is why Nueva Rumasa rated the company at 18% below the market value.
According to Nuevan Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real assessment of Sos.
The offer is linked to the appointment of eight of the 15 consultants.
The group from Jerez gives shareholders a period of 15 days to inform them of their interest in the sale of their shares.
CNMV assured that it had not been informed about this offer, although Ruiz Mateos confirmed that it had entered into contact with the Authority.
At a conclusion, the deposit would amount to 611.7 million, while the value of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos further restructures his management.
When trying to stay on the verge of possible purchase offers and the courtships of his ex-manager, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar announced the appointment of María Luisa Jordá as head of the internal book audit.
A decision that makes her the first woman to have a high position in the food business.
This is a newly created post, which is directly under the chairman of the group.
This is anything but polemic because the company is involved in a court battle because of the suspicion of redirecting more than 230 million of Sos to other societies of the Salazar family.
It cannot be ruled out that over the next few months, Soss will shift further capital.
In view of Salazar's credit, the ex-consulters Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (CCM and Unicaja representatives) appeared before the National Assembly yesterday and confirmed that they had approved the shift of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV approves the public exclusion of Paternina submitted by the investment company Mer
The National Stock Exchange Commission (CNMV) approved the public exclusion invitation for Federico Paternina presented by the investment company Mer on 9 October.
The Authority stated that it approved this invitation to tender after it had been demonstrated that the conditions comply with the law-enforcement laws and therefore that the content of the explanatory leaflet submitted, after the amendments of last 2 December, could be considered "adequate".
CNMV has also announced that this offer aims at the acquisition of 550.008 Federico Paternina shares at the price of EUR 7.65 per share, which in turn amounts to 8.95 % of the company's capital, consisting of EUR 6.142.786 in shares admitted to Madrid and Bilbao.
In addition, it has been announced that 5.592.778 million shares have been fixed, which cannot be transferred in any way until the completion of the tender and whose price has been fixed by Federico Paternina in accordance with the law.
New vehicle assessment programmes
In these days of storms and accidents, not only the car workshops deserve
Every day thousands of vehicles involved in an accident are dragged into the workshops where an expert has to assess the damage caused and the costs of repair.
No accident is the same and the calculation of the costs for the parts and hours of work can be a lengthy and complicated task.
The calculation of the repair costs of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros per hand, including the parts and working hours, may take up to two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest computer science tools, it is a matter of minutes
Therefore, almost 100 % of the experts use this type of system.
Service providers and application providers for the assessment of accidents and repairs collect the information they receive from manufacturers to process them afterwards and offer them to their customers in the form of a useful program.
In Spain, Audatex, part of the American group Solera, is the market leader; 80% of all opinions are produced with their products.
GtMotive and Eurotax are the two other companies competing in the tool market for assessment and preparation of a report.
Working with the data that manufacturers provide is anything but simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, Sales Manager of Audatex, 63 manufacturers and importers are cooperated, each providing the information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed is getting larger and bigger, until the point that more versions, variants and motorizations have been on the market over the past five years than they have been in the past fifteen years.
As soon as a new car enters the market, work begins for the companies.
It is a laborious task, because each one of the thousand parts of the vehicle has to be catagolated and its price entered.
In addition, each model creates an "intelligent" graphic image, on which you can "click" different parts of the vehicle.
If this is a much-sold model, work can be completed in a week if the procedure proceeds quickly.
In the case of less common cars, it may take up to three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information at 99.2% of the cars sold in Spain.
Among the more exclusive models, they have information about Porsche models, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini.
With regard to the road-driven vehicle park, it is above 99%.
For the purpose of carrying out documentation work and the production of databases, Audatex has eight centres distributed worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, the USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them specialises in certain brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanics for mechanics) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests EUR 90 million annually in the development of these databases.
Every month they record 2.5 million data and their customers get the updates every second day.
The development of this huge flow of information enables companies to use it in different ways and thus offer different products.
The most common use is the use of repairs and repairs, but, depending on the country, there are also tools for the management of scrap parts or for the calculation of the fall or residual value of a car.
The only company that informs about a leader who is aware of the value of the used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer this offer in Spain, but in the United States.
With the transparency of the products that Audatex offers, you can easily get an overview of the type of support it gives to industry experts.
This company offers ten different tools, with the star of the products AudaPlus, a standard solution for the assessment of accidents for the assessors.
It includes vehicles, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the estimated repair times or the painting prices of the manufacturer.
This tool is paid according to the purpose of use, i.e. for each opinion.
The most expensive is for customers who rarely use it at a maximum of ten times a month, namely 5,75 euros per month.
On the other hand, every insurance company that produces thousands of opinions negotiates the price with Audatex.
With other products, such as AudaVIN, you can fully identify a vehicle and the equipment with which it ran from the assembly belt only by means of the chassis number.
AudaGlass deals with the vehicle disks, and AudaSubastas is a service open to the specialist market on the Internet that can be offered for vehicles that have been declared total damage.
Your statistical service is very useful in identifying trends, conducting geodemographic analyses, or in maintaining information on the variations by brand and model.
For example, it is possible to examine how many models of a particular car brand had to enter the workshop due to pans or how many of them were involved in a serious accident during a given period of time.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of computer tools.
It sells among others Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and provides in the same way digital images, access to parts or prices and official working hours of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for assessing damage, pans or maintenance of vehicles.
The GT expert for opinions is a reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Their business volume has increased by 20 % per year over the last three years and in 2008 sales amounted to EUR 10.8 million.
At the beginning of last year, they started to go to the international market with the opening of an office in Paris.
Audatex, on the other hand, was founded in Germany in 1966 and was established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its business is carried out in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. They work with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of which are in Spain.
The total turnover in the world of the group Solera (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) is $557 million, 3.35 more than in 2008.
In this respect, the company has revenue of 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than in the previous year.
In 2005, the group of Solera was worth one billion dollars on the stock exchange and today its shares are traded at a value of 2.4 billion dollars.
Since 2007 they have been on the New York Stock Exchange and part of the reference index Standard & Poor's.
Auction of accident cars on the Internet
Last October, the group Solera Autoonline bought a flat-froom on the Internet for the sale of accident vehicles and motorcycles.
This purchase meant the payment of EUR 59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could increase to the remaining 15% next year.
The purpose of this purchase was to offer its customers more services and value-added, with the opportunity to gain access to a huge international market.
This assessment and purchase service applies exclusively to industry professionals, such as insurance companies, experts, car rental companies, workshops, scrap and car dealers, who have to register before their activities.
This platform was founded in Germany in 1996 and manages more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany alone.
Its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
Today the website has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 reviewers.
Every day 3,000 ads are managed and 100 new ads are added to the Spanish market every day.
Under Spanish legislation, a vehicle whose chassis number has been logged out may no longer drive on the roads, but certain non-damaged parts may be used as spare parts.
The cars with historical value may, however, be re-licensed even if they have been logged out after difficult administrative procedures.
Estimated cost of the workshop in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex ensures that the user receives a cost estimate in just four steps: identification of the vehicle, search of the spare part, creation and creation of a cost estimate.
The easy handling of these systems is a fundamental condition, especially in order to convince older professionals who are normally more or less opposed to the use of these new computer techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, 666 of which are passenger cars, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 small transporters and 44 trucks.
Of course, you need a computer with Internet connection to use.
After the model to be repaired has been identified by the chassis number, a graphic of the respective model appears and then the required spare part is selected.
The user can include variables such as the price for working hours, surcharges or discounts and then print out the cost estimate and pass it on to his customers.
However, AudaTaller is not a tool for assessing AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop-oriented does not include estimated working hours.
The cost of using this tool is 350 euros a year, an amount that the customer can pay without further delay.
Currently, the company Audatex is working to offer these images in three-dimensional formats.
This is an innovation that automechanics have been waiting for for a long time, as one can choose a door with it for example and then turn the image completely around to look at the inside.
