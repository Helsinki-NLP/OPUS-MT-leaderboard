28-year-old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old cook who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping center.
The victim's brother said that he can't imagine anyone who would want to harm him, "At last it went up again."
The body found in the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as the 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, the medical department in San Francisco reported.
The San Francisco Police Department said that death was classified as murder and the investigations are ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told the ABS station KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who used to work as a cook in Boston, had received his dream job six months ago as a cook at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco.
A spokesman of the Sons & Daughter said that they were "shocked and destroyed on the ground" about his death.
"We're a little team that works like a close family and we're going to miss him painfully," the speaker continued.
Our thoughts and condolences are at this difficult time with Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia stated that Frank first lived in hostels, but that "the things went up for him at last."
"He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend," said Louis Garcia KGO.
Louis Galicia said he couldn't imagine anyone who would want to harm his younger brother.
He was a friendly person with a big heart.
His way of connecting with his family was always to cook something, to prepare dinner," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to take part in any kind of discussion.
He was the brother who swam with the current.
"With everything that goes wrong in the world, he was this uncut diamond that lit brightly every day," he said.
Anyone who has information on the case is asked to call the SFPD's phone call under number 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I am always put in drawers
Jennifer Aniston doesn't always have to be perfect or successful.
In an interview, the Hollywood star has now made this absolutely clear.
"I am always put in drawers or get stuck from outside label, which usually have little to do with me and reality."
"I myself don't want to be perfect and successful all the time."
"Truly said, these things are better for me."
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh that she is considered "Miss Perfect", as she explains in the current "Cosmopolitan".
The actress prefers to spend her time at home, form television with loose dutt and Mexican food, as the magazine says.
They ask the question of children's desire: "We women don't have to be married or have children to be perfect," says Hollywood star.
In her new film "Mother's Day - Love Is Not a Children's Game" Aniston is seen as a single mother of two sons.
The film will run with us from August 25th.
Golfer Langer gets the Sport Pyramid
His experiences on the horse can be seen.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and some colleagues were looking for a little change with a ride on the beach.
It was a premiere for the 58-year-old.
CHIO: "Golden Sports Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes, the horses remembered their party evening, they hunted home in the fast gallop to the feeding ropes.
One kilometer at this pace, I was scared.
"It wasn't a good experience," says Langer.
And with that the riding career ended again.
On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament victories - was again near horses.
He and his family were led over the ALRV plant, and he didn't even swing on a horse for photo purposes.
Longer was in Aachen for the first time and thus also at the CHIO.
The reason was quite convincing.
The German sports aid gave the Golden Sport Pyramid to the man from Anhausen as part of a small gala.
The friendly sportsman is not lacking in awards.
Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silbernes Lorbeerblatt, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...
Even the British Queen has already adored him.
The 18th prize winner of the Sport Pyramid is longer.
In Aachen he met the first winner of Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
"This award means a lot to me," says Langer, "because it is not only awarded for sporting successes but also for social engagement."
Langer has been promoting young people for decades.
And so he also passed on the prize money of 25,000 euros.
With 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time US masters winner was admitted to the "Hall of Fame des deutschen Sports" on Saturday.
Among the outstanding are the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the fighters Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the rower Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob driver Meinhard Nehmer, the Judoka Frank Viennake, the jumper Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumously the handballer Erhard Wunderlich.
Many of these sports legends came to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrated society migrated to the Springstadion, where the Lavazza Prize ran.
Bernhard Langer kept his distance from the big animals.
Clintons and Trump's Economic Policy Compare: It's all about the money
Investment in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump want to do so.
However, the two US Presidency applicants disagree on tax and energy policy as well as on a principle issue.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, rather philosophical, difference.
The one about the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep it rather small and warns about how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says.
He himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, says Trump.
It will go back to regulation, and it is committed to a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for businesses.
Clinton, on the other hand, says that the state has certain tasks to perform, it has disadvantaged opportunities to open up, and it needs money to do so.
Therefore, taxes for the rich would be increased, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure.
Trump and Clinton say that they have to invest in this.
The democratic candidate even announces the biggest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.
State investment programmes in infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are strictly rejected, for example, by the Republicans' state-critical tea party wings.
So there could be internal discussions on Trump.
The differences in energy and climate policy are more evident.
Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and to re-create coal production in the USA.
Oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas, and the Paris Convention on Climate Change is intended to announce it.
Clinton, on the other hand, wants to explicitly expand renewable energies with its investment programme and demands: "A country will become the superpower of clean energies and create millions of jobs."
"It will probably be China, Germany or America - I want us to be."
But not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other.
TPP, the Trans-Pacific Trade Agreement, does not want to sign.
At the same time, however, both do not want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply to better protect American jobs.
They're supposed to be paid better, too, for example, Clinton.
The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger wage.
He wants to raise it to $15 per hour.
What Trump wants to do on this question is not quite clear: Once he says: the minimum wage must be up, then he says he should not be changed.
But the major discussion over the coming months is likely to be more about the tax policy of the two camps.
On the one hand is Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and its citizens in order to boost growth.
His critics keep him in mind that the budget deficit would only be even greater.
On the other hand, Clinton, who at least wants to demand from the rich, says that they pay more taxes, and their critics say that more taxes are not the solution either.
Escape: "Every woman who has fled has experience with sexual violence"
Sexual violence almost belongs to everyday life for women fleeing alone.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house offers refuge.
Four women sit in a large kitchen.
Everyone has a baby, which is at most one year old.
One put her little son in the arm.
He looks curiously into the room with big eyes.
His mother stares at the tabletop.
Until she realizes she's being observed.
She smiles short and kisses the little one.
The scene is normal.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is head of the department of Condrobs, a provider of social assistance services in Bavaria, and deals, among other things, with the topic of women on the run.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralized accommodations for single-fleet women and their children in Bavaria.
In January, Condrobs opened the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid.
She was officially opened recently.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men - not even as visitors.
The exception is a guard at the door.
"It is not exaggerating to say that every woman who comes here has experienced sexual violence on her flight," says Bahr.
"Men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they are threatened with torture or death or because their families send them to Europe as hopemakers," she says.
In women, other reasons for the escape prevail: "Many steal secretly because they see no other way out".
In their home country they have experienced sexual violence, forced ewes, homicides, slavery or forced prostitution.
That's what's driving them.
On the run, it continues.
"For example, the demand for a bottle of water for a sexual act is not rare," says Bahr.
And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Who believes that this will end as soon as they arrive in Germany, wrong, tells Bahr.
Here, too, single women in refugee shelters would often be considered inferior and, worst of all, abused.
This means that about 90 percent of women living in the accommodation in the north of Munich are traumatized, she estimates.
"Some of the children certainly didn't come up voluntarily."
Many women are so used to saying nothing.
"Or they don't trust to talk openly about the experienced because the shame is too great."
Since they often don't know how to help, it only needs more accommodation for them, Bahr demands.
In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.
On the question of whether they knew of a project similar to that in Munich in their area of responsibility, some respond with No.
In the Upper Palatinate and Upper France, for example, there is no such thing in government accommodation.
Even in Schwaben, refugees alone are not housed separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, government press spokesman.
In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Middle France there are floors or own houses in some common accommodations only for single women and their children.
The exception is Niederbayern, where there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be housed separately from men.
In a study published for the Committee, it says: "It is very important for men and women to be housed separately."
"If privacy occurs or men and women are accommodated together, violence against women can be continued."
In particular, the laundry rooms should be separate and easily accessible to women.
How much the women feel about this protection need can be read at the Andrang that exists on the house in Munich.
"Since we've talked about it, we have a long waiting list," says Bahr.
You could easily open a second house.
Streak to Assistant Doctors: Demands for New Labour Fighting Measures
Representatives of the assistant doctors have called on their trade union to approve new work fighting measures in their disputes regarding a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called on its entire Council to approve more work fighting measures from the beginning of September.
The JDC stated that ministers had failed to address the concerns about the Treaty.
Assistant doctors and medical students voted in July on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA.
He was rejected by 58% of his members who voted in the elections.
In a letter to the members, which was published on Twitter on Thursday evening, the chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government would have remained "persistently quiet" to problems, resulting in the rejection of the contract.
She said: "In view of this, the JDC Board of Directors has agreed to reject the proposed new contract completely and to request official renegotiations on all your concerns."
In response to the government's silence, the JDC Board of Directors has today submitted a formal application for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve a ongoing programme of escalating labour combat measures beginning in early September.
The disputes led to assistants reaching six times this year, the first total failures in the history of the NHS.
The head of the BMA Assistant Doctor Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed terms of the contract, which had been recommended by the BMA.
He informed BMA members during the meetings, which took place before the vote by 54,000 medical assistants and medical students, that the Treaty was beneficial and should be adopted.
After the vote, Minister of Health Jeremy Hunt said that the contract for doctors in England would necessarily be introduced.
Russia and Turkey: An "Alliance of Outsiders"?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and to announce an official war of words and economic sanctions that lasted for eight months.
But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish opponent in the gold-plated hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I can't deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.
There was the handshake, yes.
But Putin's smiles were slender, and he hardly radiated warmth, even for his restraining conditions.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his "loved friend" Putin - according to a report all five times.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but would even improve.
The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan had behaved as if nothing bad had ever happened.
His enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite.
But one of Putin's lasting cools showed that the head of state of Russia had not forgotten anything.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the shooting of a Russian fighter aircraft at the Syrian border through Turkey.
Moscow's reaction at the time was hot.
Putin distributed and accused Ankara of having fallen into Russia's backs.
The offense was even greater because it was committed by a supposed friend.
The restoration of confidence will be difficult, if not impossible.
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media carried out a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.
At one time it seemed as if the Turks were to bear the blame for everything.
The most serious were the accusations of senior officials that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from the illegal oil trade in Syria's areas controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He fought this vehement.
But in St.Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward.
Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin was apologised by President Erdogan for the excuse he wanted to hear.
Russia was able to win some kind of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are clearly obvious.
Erdogan needs first and foremost all the friends he can get after he was almost deprived of his office last month in a failed coup.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.
But there are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has decreased by almost 90%.
In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when flights are resumed.
They count on a late-seasonal storm to the Mediterranean Sea.
This week, public television forecast cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.
A report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows: "Tourists there for a long time, tomatoes here for a long time."
But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West because it considers its reaction to the attempted takeover of power to be a weak response.
To this end, the continued resentment about the sluggish pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin – which is committed to taking advantage of the cool mood and reducing Turkey's relationship with the West.
The Russian head of state in Ankara surely won a bonus for demanding support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup.
This is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep fear of regime change.
The summit meeting in this magnificent palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to present one, as an analyst once described to me, "Alliance of Outsiders": two countries, who are in breach of the West and feel ill-treated and are now allied.
Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently played the role as peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposite sides.
It could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents said at the press conference that they had not even stripped the subject.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found with Syria.
But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster when NATO member Turkey shot off the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state at least talk together again.
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
According to the bank's CEO, the RBS brand is only to be reduced to a back office role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan informed BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was connected to the bank's global ambitions.
Since then, the bank has distanced itself when it almost collapsed and had to be saved eight years ago.
During this time, "RBS" brand streeters have used to protect other end-user financial brands.
She supported the international sport with a million pounds of sponsoring, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to focus more national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, the decentralised headquarters and the stock exchange listing will switch to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller brands for the private customer business that will be given more importance - Couts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and employees in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RSB brand will become our investor brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed, as we will now become more a bank of brands."
When the bank became a global brand itself, RBS became a global brand.
I am now saying that we are not pursuing global goals but local goals.
Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers among these brands.
RBS has already said that it will no longer continue its Six Nations Sponsoring and that it will increase the perceptibility of the various brands in its sport sponsorship.
"It is time for us to develop into the bank of the brands, because how do we concentrate on making this a better bank for customers (we asked for it)?" said the CEO.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would have been a great bank for our customers and launched these brands.
But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think, you will see many changes.
We can start these brands again, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori achieves his 3,000th win at Newmarket on Predilection
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket that brings him 3,000th profit
The Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British win at Newmarket on Friday.
He set a milestone on Predilection, which is trained by John Gosden, on his local race track with his second win of the night.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the milestone in the flat race.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
The three-time winner Dettori, who won Ghayyar before, said, "It's something special."
I am very emotional because my family is here too
I'm very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday evening with 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very modest.
Dettori takes up the jubilation when he wins the victory on Predilection
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jockey Richard Johnson and the retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who achieved more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, the nine-time derby winner had 4.493 career victories
Frankie is one of the best jockey of modernity and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone that only a few have reached before him.
It has style and is strong, but it is its tactical intellect, which distinguishes it from the others in the weight control room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for races, his enthusiasm and Charisma has been a fan of this sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that if he wasn't just a weekend and big tournament jockey, he'd already win 6,000!
Frankie has been driving in GB for almost 30 years, which is great.
He has a living personality, which is good for a British race, but beyond that he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the sign of the British flat race for two decades.
It was nervous.
A whole series of big tournament wins, including his famous "Glorious Seven" in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived an airplane crash and received a drug ban.
Three years ago he had difficulties when he returned from his six-month barrier, but he showed an impressive characteral strength to defy his twins and return to his best form.
And he's not finished for a long time - Dettori once said he wanted to continue in competitions up to his at least 50th year of age.
Russia's Putin fires Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly released his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was part of Putin's closest circle of trust for many years.
The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environmental and Transport Affairs.
In a Kremlin statement, Putin had "appointed the release of Ivanov from his duties as chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration without giving any reason."
Anton Vaino, who has been Ivanov's deputy since 2012, was appointed as his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he graduated from the renowned Moscow State Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo.
On the Kreml website, it is said (in Russian) that he was later the head of the protocol and the head of staff of the government staff.
About his appointment he said to Putin: "Thank you for your trust."
I think that it is the government's most important task to support your work as head of state with regard to draft laws and controls for the implementation of your instructions.
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Do the smiling faces convince?
This step has made Moscow mysterious.
For a long time Sergei Ivanov was one of Vladimir Putin's closest relatives, working as he did for Soviet intelligence, the KGB.
As chief of staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the chief of staff would resign at their own request.
But despite the smile for the cameras, only a few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So is there the consequence of some kind of power struggle here?
Nobody knows that right now.
But the official claim that a man who was once praised as a potential president wants to lead the Russian environmental policy suddenly met with great scepticism.
In his remarks to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said "it is true that I asked you in a conversation in early 2012 to entrust me with these very complicated posts - you might almost say - difficult posts for four years.
As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov accepted the post in December 2011.
He was previously Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, former member of the KGB State Security Service.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed as his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov one of five people he trusted most.
Once it was assumed that Ivanov could become president of Russia after Putin's second term, since a third term of office had violated the Constitution.
But this post was taken by another nearby ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister before becoming President three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds Star Thomas Gibson fired after beating producers
Gibson was involved in a physical discussion in the set of the series in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, who produce the series, announced their termination in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologised publicly on Thursday for the announcement of his termination.
On the set there were artistic differences and disagreements.
I regret the incident," he said in a communication.
Details of how the character Gibsons from the series that follows a team of FBI agents are written out are expected to be published at a later date, according to the opinion of ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old who previously played at Sitcom Dharma & Greg was present since the first season of the series in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and I've put my whole heart's blood into the last 12 years," said Gibson in a message published on Friday.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but that will no longer be possible.
I would just like to thank the authors, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and, above all, the best fans you can wish for a series.
The planned emission of the twelfth season is scheduled for September 28.
Riddles of fish landing in the garden in Banff
A resident of Banff requested help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks that the 75 fish could be sandaals that were spewed out by a fountain.
Mr Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, published a video of the spectacle on Periscope, hoping that someone could throw some light on the appearance of the two-inch long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
The £1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the northern deck of Queensferry Crossings to the viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four locks of the "cover blowers" approaching the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 ropes.
The £1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017.
Minister of Economic Affairs Keith Brown made a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go from land to the bridge.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry Crossings.
We are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic measure in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for the fit.
A total of almost 79% of the entire bridge decks are in place and the final section of the deck today in Rosyth gets a concrete cast for the deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "The first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project.
In this fantastic project, the closure represents forward-looking building and civil engineering.
After the installation of the last road deck section and its connection with the North Tower deck under construction, we then had to close the remaining gap on the north or the country side.
This was reached by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.
Massif, since the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs approx. 6,000 tons and had to be pulled up at a slope of about 3%.
The tolerances on which the team worked were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Rescue in Moelfre Bay: Three men have "lucky to be alive"
Three men have "lucky to be alive" after being thrown by their fishing boat in front of Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station struck alarm on Friday at 13:20 BST after a crew observed the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had difficulties swimming safely, while their boat moved on its own strength.
"We saw how the boat turned around in its vicinity and introduced us to the worst," said Moelfre Vince Jones's rescue station head.
"Happyly, the strong winds already blew the boat out of its reach until we let it into water," he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man at the age of 60 was exhausted and found hanging on a boje without a life jacket.
They all arrived on board the coast rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
Mr. Jones said, "The three men who have been thrown into the water are lucky and alive.
Although the boat engine had an emergency stop line, it was released by the person who controlled the boat at the time of the start of the boat.
Someone's been watching over these men today.
seriously injured - man comes across his ex-girlfriend
A man attacked his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and seriously injured.
As the police reported yesterday, the 50-year-old had got the key to the apartment to get his personal things.
Instead, the alcoholic perpetrators cut his ex-girlfriend's clothes.
When he got into the apartment, he got on her twice.
The 44-year-old was injured by the hand and the body.
The police were able to arrest the culprit.
While the 50-year-old destroyed his ex-girlfriend's clothes, he called his mother.
He then alarmed his sister.
Together with her companion, the 45-year-old wanted to calm down her brother.
But she couldn't move him to leave the apartment.
That's why she left the house with her companion.
On the street they met the ex-lifemate of the man.
When the two women entered the apartment again, the 50-year-old pushed his sister aside and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
Who builds Braunschweig's cheap apartments?
The SPD and Greens believe that investors will be much more committed in the future.
How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years?
At the next Council meeting, the SPD proposes a "working concept of living".
But dispute is programmed.
First of all, the question is: Who should build the cheap apartments?
A scheme has so far been missing.
SPD President Christoph Bratmann says: "We agree with the Greens: If you want to build on urban areas, 20 percent of all apartments will have to be social housing in the future."
However, the favourable apartments can also come into existence.
However, the big dispute in the town hall is, says Bratmann: "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private land?"
"We want investors on such areas to build at least 10 percent, but as much as 20 percent of apartments as possible as social housing."
A new urban housing support programme, which will cost millions and will still have to be financed, will provide incentives.
The problem, says Bratmann: "There is currently no agreement between the political groups."
The CDU wants to make as few rules as possible for investors.
The left still wants tough conditions for investors.
Despite this, says Bratmann, the situation on the housing market is getting worse.
If the concept of action is implemented, this will provide for additional tasks in the construction management.
More staff is needed.
It's unclear whether we'll get the experts.
But the program is still not completely available: because the around 1260 new apartments that were supposed to be built anyway.
But how does the loss of more than 1300 cheap dwellings, whose promotion will end in the next few years?
By 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments.
In order to prevent this from happening, says the planning spokesman Nicole Palm, it is now necessary to buy out-going bonds from the city.
In addition, it would be necessary to think about getting apartments back into the price range.
This is possible in the West Town.
At one time, the problem was solved.
Because in the West City, deadlines expire at the end of the year.
Around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price fixing for cheap apartments.
Only, that's what the owners, the housing companies don't want.
Because the number of social housing in the west city will be increased dramatically again, away from the objective of so-called blending.
There should no longer be a concentration of social weaknesses in just a few districts.
The Greens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion.
Group chairman Holger Herlitschke says: "For a broad majority, the CDU must be in the boat."
They focused on more construction sites for single-family houses.
What does not mean, however, is that a compromise cannot be reached.
Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it
It is fascinating to see how the world changes.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their free time staring on screens was complained by many in the last decade.
Pokemon Go is about getting people off the sofa and getting more active.
The time on the screen was initially on the TV, then on video games and lastly limited to smartphones.
Therefore, it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not exclude each other.
I refer, of course, to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters that were first created for the video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs were created).
How many phenomena of pop culture decreased the interest in publishing the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.
The market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that overloaded the servers.
Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, the players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pokémons that are tracked with a GPS and, once they have been found, can be "photographed" (via a screenshot on the phone) or "captured".
A generation who played the game when she was younger joined the fool and jumped for the search from the sofa.
In the U.S., the game led to a significant increase in steps that the "average" person travels every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, recently informed Washington Post that within two days of the launch of the game, the number of persecuted people who train 30 minutes each day was rising from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go - it only sees raw data to increase performance.
Many public education campaigns on health that people want to "take 30 minutes of time," "come from the sofa" and "be active every day" hit deaf ears because many public messages are boring to health and come from people who look miserable.
Nevertheless, the importance of sports cannot be overrated.
Those who regularly drive sports reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to mention here.
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it causes people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.
Thus, three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.
Some people even make new friendships on the hunt.
As always, there are mueric game destroyers who always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could run into a door.
What's up?
There's been a breakthrough.
Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit had been able to track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to run sports as this game does.
The new will lose its appeal and the use will decrease over time.
However, due to Pokemon's success, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with getting active in the real world, helping many people hunt to be more active, fit and healthy.

Simone Biles creates gold in women's tournaments
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all of this.
Dynamic on the jumper.
effortlessly on the beam.
Breathing on the ground.
Brilliant on the whole line.
And now, finally, Olympic winner.
On Thursday, the 19-year-old American gymnast announced the title of multi-war and increased the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.
Her overall result of 62,198 was clearly in front of the silver medal winner and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.
The Americans are playing Simone Biles on the floating beam during the single multi-fight finale of women in the art tournaments at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a multi-fight title and overall the fifth, while strengthening her reputation to be the best of her generation or even even of her generation.
She broke out in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey found an end at this moment.
This success puts her in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought her sports to new heights:
For the last three years, Biles has dominated her sport, 15 world champion medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the 1984 Olympic winner Mary Lou Retton said of her that she is "the best gymnast I've ever seen."
She was expecting a final exam in Brazil, a competition that did not go so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.
Not with a handful of gold returning to the family in Spring, Texas, would be considered a disappointment.
The Americans Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embraced each other after winning gold and silver in the women's single multi-fight finals at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday
Biles took the first medal on Tuesday, while serving as an exclamation mark at the farewell party of the retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles insisted on never having planned the future during her long journey, that is not really true.
Part of their ground exercises - which contain their typical tumbling pass - are adapted to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a little child and discovered by Trainer Aimee Borman's mother during a school trip to the gym, where Borman trained, became powerful.
Since the summer of 2013, she has lost no more multi-war competition, a victory series that will last as long as Biles wishes.
Even though Mustafina led easily through two rotations, the picture cheated.
Swivel beams and floor turns - where Biles holds the World Championship title - lurked.
With 15,433 on the floating bar she got back up again - and with a 15,933 on the floor another on it.
Raisman hugged her gently as they expected her finality - a pure formality - and tears flowed on bile’s shiny red, white and blue eyeliners when the vision she once described in her collection book became reality.
Raisman's performance was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place, but the bronze medal went in a tiebre to Mustafina.
This time the 22-year-old team captain, called "Oma", had an advantage.
After her ground practice, she threw kiss hands to the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes appeared doubtful.
As far as Biles is concerned, the rapidly expanding tweet of the 19-year-olds from the beginning of this week has a completely new meaning:
Police: 3 victims shot in serial murder when listening to music in the car
According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot who had been killed in one of the most deadly attacks in Phoenix's first serial murder case for a decade while they were talking in the car and listening to music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on June 12, while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said.
The perpetrator fired eight shots from a handgun while standing on the passenger side of the car and then fleeing with another vehicle, is to be read in the report.
The police reported that the triple murder did not seem to have been the result of a robbery, as the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900 who were in possession of one of the adult victims.
Phoenix Sgt.'s police officer Jonathan Howard said that shooting seduced the investigators to get a closer look at whether it's connected with four previous attacks.
A total of seven people were killed in hispanic residential areas within four months in nine attacks and two more were injured.
"It happens in a residential area in front of a house," told Howard KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, early in the month.
It is assumed that the suspect used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence they had led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same murderer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized due to her injuries and died later.
Liner, 31, and Ellis daughter Maleah died on site.
A witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the three-time murder and which is assumed to be the work of the serial killer.
Researchers found cartridge sleeves and secured a ball from the seat as well as bullet fragments from the engine room.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly: "It's getting better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But like the least of his peers, Edmund has microcephaly, the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Picciuto knew nothing about during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was, I can't do it.
I can't do this.
I didn't get involved in that.
What's wrong at all -- of course, they've been allowed to do it," she said.
Her husband Vincent and her were told that Edmund may never recognize her and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far as to propose to institutionalize him.
"My first answer to that was 'I didn't know that people were still doing," said Picciuto.
Edmund can run with the help of a walker.
Edmund could not sit or scratch until his third year of life and he can still not speak.
But he's making progress slowly.
He can walk with support and cycle.
He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund thought out for "Please sing something before me."
"We teach him sign language," said Picciuto CBS News.
But it's not a typical sign language -- she says. Edmund invented some characters alone.
Microcephaly has a variety of causes: genetics such as Edmund as well as infections with viruses such as measles or zikavirus during pregnancy.
Symptoms and forecasts may vary greatly.
It is too early to say how it will affect the life of those infected with the Zikavirus.
Picciuto remembers the emotional price of an uncertain future.
I was constantly asking what was going to happen?
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't really know.
I haven't been asking for the prognosis for a long time, because I don't expect anyone to really tell me.
But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers of babies with birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
It's gonna be better.
You know it'll be better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rains, floods give rise to rescues in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rainfall and large floods in Louisiana forced the governor to call the emergency on Friday. More rainfall is expected all Saturday.
Many rivers in the southeast of Louisiana and the south of Mississippi flooded their banks and threatened with large-scale flooding after extreme rainfalls, reported the National Weather Service.
The Governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards announced that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and are already on the road to help the affected communities.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, announced that the requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags increased.
Steele said that only the municipality of Tangipahoa had requested tens of thousands of sandbags.
A flood warning system is used over large parts in the south of Louisiana until Saturday.
The weather service stated that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area.
In the south of Alabamas a flood warning system was used on Friday, while in the area of Mobile it continued to rain.
The river Comite near Baton Rouges and the river Amite near Denham Springs, both of which are located in Louisiana, are likely to reach record levels over the weekend.
Meteologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many houses in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a downstream flood in Ascension Parish is a danger, as these will only slowly flow into Lake Maurepa via the runaway rivers.
The river Tickfaw, south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level on Friday at 09.00, which was ever recorded.
Rescue teams still bred people from the floodwaters in the districts of Amite and Wilkinson in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those who were saved on Friday near Gloster.
Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house, rose strongly overnight.
He said that another stepson who lives nearby would have warned him.
"We woke up and the water flowed and streamed in," said Hansford.
It reached my waist.
His wife told Hansford that in the 48 years in which she lived, she had never seen such a high point of the river.
Hansford said he and his family members had all the disabilities and he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said that emergency helpers had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Gloster, where they had been accommodated until Friday.
Krautmann said that the flood "has spread rapidly" as there were still severe rainfalls and that the authorities are reluctant to consider evacuation instructions.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livingstone reported rain from midnight to Friday morning of 13.75 inches.
Krautmann said that the soil had been well-fed by the rainfall since Wednesday.
The authorities indicated that severe rainfall and road floods caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and educational failure in five school districts.
The CBS daughter station WWL reported that one assistant in Tangipahoa listed 200 flooded houses.
The inhabitants were evacuated into two churches, which were now both flooded.
The municipality of Robby Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets who were washed by the flood.
Emergency accommodations were set up in the cities of Amite and Hammond to accommodate the evacuators.
"As soon as the water begins to go back, they will be able to return to their homes," he said.
In the city of Hammond the municipality of Tangipahoa nearly two dozen streets were closed due to the flood and sandbags were provided for the residents to take away, who hope to keep the water from their homes and shops.
"The last great flood we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum from the city administration.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississippi, emergency manager Rupert Lacy of Harrison County said it was still raining on the Gulf Coast.
According to his information, a handful of houses should have been reported flooded on Thursday, but no reports have yet been reported on Friday.
Keith Townson, Manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen before," said Townson, "and it's still coming."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "drenched by bullets", survives shooting in Philadelphia
The police report that the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, this week already the second time a 6-year-old child is shot.
The young man's grandparents identified him as Mahaj Brown for CBS Philadelphia.
The grandparents reported that Brown suffered several shot injuries, including in the loin, leg, arm and belly, but that he was conscious of his transport to the hospital.
"He went through a lot, his little body was holes," his grandmother Delores Melendez told the transmitter.
I just can't believe that.
The condition of the boy was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations.
The boy's family told the transmitter that he was likely to recover again.
He should have started the first class in a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two at the age of 29 and one at the age of 32.
One of the 29-year-olds is in critical condition; the other two victims are in stable condition according to CBS Philadelphia.
The boy was found on the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old who is in a critical state, reports the transmitter.
The other two victims were not in the car, and the police were just determining whether one of the injured men of the perpetrators could be among.
Researchers told CBS Philadelphia that a crossfire had apparently come between several shooters.
Patrons for stormguns, which were traced back to various storm rifles, crossed the crime scene.
It seems that this was clearly a continuing struggle.
On the road, on both sides of the walkway, there were sleeves.
Thus, there seem to have been several armed fighters who were very active in this field," said Anthony Ginaldi of police in Philadelphia to the station.
Several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area.
There was no arrest and the police are currently reviewing reports on the surveillance video.
On Tuesday another six-year-old girl was hit by a crossover beater on her arm when she played in front of her house in the West Oak Lane residential area.
She recovers, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's what I imagine under the women's Olympic team in the gymnastics for more than one reason.
First of all, I have been with every summer olympia since 1984, and the USA has never been so dominant.
And second, this team has three turners, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of different skin color.
The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, who is Jewish and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally reflects the USA.
It has solidified the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.
In the last four years the number one among the female turners was an African American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.
That shows strength.
At the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner, and America rejoiced.
Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they provided unexpected yet mastery Gymastic routines.
On Thursday Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American who won gold at an individual multi-game event for women.
Team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We experience the top of this sport, but that's not how gym classes look throughout the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all made the same way as Aly and Madison to make it to the Olympic team.
They are the "Last Five" because the next Olympic team will only have four gymnasts on the team. In addition, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a coach.
But reality looks like gymnasiums are a expensive sport and gymnasiums primarily in private gymnasiums, which are maintained by parents who pay for the training, equipment, travel, clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnasiums and families). The list can be continued at any time.
The majority of these gymnastics are located in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.
In these clubs, the gymnasts receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, both have trained their athletes since they started playing.
We need to enable the communities of countless young girls, inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, to have a quieter and easier-to-reach gym.
I founded my 20-year gymnasium.
At my events we offered free and affordable tours in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young people (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.
In September we will expand to Detroit (my home town) in order to offer the youth high-quality gymnastics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Turnen develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.
It's the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to be interested in gymnastics and that's great.
It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.
That's such an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by getting the Olympic team gold and thank you, taking so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
Assistants want to organize further strikes after they have rejected Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistants who voted in an election rejected him.
In July Hunt had revealed plans to introduce the contract forcefully and said that the NHS was in a "no-man country" and any further delay would be harmful to employees and patients.
The first assistant doctors are to receive a new contract, which includes changes to night and weekend work to improve care at unspoiled time.
Dr Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA Committee for Assistant Doctors, said last night: "Assistants continue to have serious concerns about the proposed Treaty, in particular that it will fuel the current workforce crisis and fail to treat all doctors in a fair manner."
In just eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors falls under the new contract, progress has to be made and the time is running out.
The BMA's efforts to resolve the disputes by means of talks met with the government's opposition to participation and sometimes to ear-drenching silence.
This happened to a promise that Jeremy Hunt had only made last month that his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt has to act now, lift the pressure and address the concerns of the assistants."
If he does not, the assistants have made it clear that they are willing to carry out further work fighting measures.
The last strike at the end of April provided for a postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 dates, since nurses and doctors were involved to provide doctors with cover on the strike chain.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting the reformed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants a better weekly wage for the 54.000 assistants who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Director General of the NHS Staff, called on the assistant doctors to end the strike.
Mortimer said: "Arbitration measures do not reach anything of the few, but already burdened teams and service providers and only prepare the patients, caregivers and their families for anxiety, distress and interruption."
In the last two months, we have spoken to the Committee of Assistant Doctors and have responded positively to the concerns of the Ministry of Health and other Ministries regarding the guardianship and whistle blowjob.
The employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from a career break, training courses, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training leave and gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious it was for employers, the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.
The £2-per-day drug that can reduce heart attack risk
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £2-per-day drug after authorities have recommended to administer this more people for a longer period of time.
The anti-rinsing drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attack for people with heart disease.
The drug has been given for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of stroke or other heart attack.
The NHS Regulatory Authority NICE has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
The NHS Regulatory Authority NICE has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty materials in the arteries walls that form coverings.
If the coating breaks apart, it can cause a blood clot that clogs the blood flow to the heart and causes a heart attack.
When the blood clot dissolves, it can flow through the bloodstream and block the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who already had a heart attack are at higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca and distributed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more unlikely.
The NICE draft manual, published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre, said: "Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who have had a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences."
Fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person.
Experience shows that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
Through a provisional recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
The information on the effectiveness and safety of ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years, and the draft instructions do not recommend treatment that goes beyond this period.
Political Correctness Culture makes electoral fraud flourish in Muslim areas
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year on the occasion of a government report on corruption
A culture of political correctness has led to widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities knowingly being ignored as a destructive government report revealed today.
Former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks the police, election observers and town halls to ignore evidence of election abuse due to "hypersensitivity to ethics and religion".
The former Minister for Integration and Local Government, who is now an anti-corruption king, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up lock-off tapes outside of election cabins to protect intimidated voters.
He recommends that voters carry an ID card with them to prove their identity in elections.
At the moment, a voters simply have to name his name and address.
The report proposes that non-removable ink be applied to a person's fingers when they vote in order to prevent someone from choosing twice.
Whistleblower should get more protection, says Sir Eric.
It calls for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions from non-official committees or working groups.
"This not only serves to protect the municipal government from the broader culture of corruption and financial fraud associated with it," he said.
The report was arranged by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlet's electoral scandal in East London.
Last year, a Special Election Court decided that the office of mayor Lutfur Rahman should be removed from his office after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community in a cynical way" and that he had silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobia accusations.
Rahman is said to have "led his campaign on the basis that it was the religious duty of Muslims to choose him."
Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the consequence of a imitation in which one person chooses someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
He was particularly alarming about the fraudulent choice of letters - in which older members of the Muslim community would have pressured people to choose a candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including driving IDs to prove the identity
His report states: "It was appropriate to demonstrate that pressure was exerted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, in particular women and young people, in order to choose according to the will of the elderly, especially communities with Pakistani or agility.
"There were concerns that... state institutions would have knowingly ignored such behaviour due to "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethics and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean the system, including the prohibition that political activists process letter election documents to stop "elections".
The report, which is considered by Theresa May, also calls for tougher registration checks to prevent the use of the electoral list for immigration and social fraud purposes.
Consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID card.
Do not use removable ink on a person's finger as soon as it has given its voice to prevent someone from choosing twice.
To carry out systematic checks on the nationality of a person in order to ensure that they are eligible for election.
A three-year limit on applications for automatic mail election.
Prohibition that political activists process complete letter elections and envelopes of letter elections.
The police have the power to set up locks to set up electoral stations.
A change of law that facilitates an intimidation charge in accordance with the Representation of the People Act 1983 (Volksrettungsgesetz 1983).
Photographer ban in election stations.
Require that only English be used in the electoral stations (with the exception of Wales).
Intensification of the training to ensure that the employees enforce the rule that voters go to the electorate alone.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "surprising" that after the Tower Hamlet's case no criminal charges were filed.
"The Electoral Court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his alternate for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices inappropriate," he said.
It became guilty for a number of reasons for sufficient - in accordance with the high requirements in criminal proceedings.
He also criticises the ineffective "abbreviations" of the election registration departments of the town halls.
Sir Eric said, "The court ruling in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.
Our country, as the mother of Parliaments, bears a proud heritage, but the worrying and hidden spread of electoral fraud and denial of certain authorities threatens this good reputation.
Crazy to Kate's two-way cyclist and other famous Olympic sports enthusiasts in Rio
This week, fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio have been advised by the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, except for Rand and Band, who has proved to be an impressive double walker of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But this summer the 24-year-old Olympionist is by far not the only athlete to fight for gold, who has his own famous double-goers - at least not if one can believe the social media.
In honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that are currently flickering on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of Olympic Ionics that have more than just a certain resemblance to Hollywood celebrities.
The hunter and the wolf: team member of the U.S. team in the archery Brady Ellison, left, is compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since his childhood
Besides Kate's double walker on the bike track, many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain archer could be the twin of A-Promi Leonardo DiCaprio.
The team member of the US team in archery Brady Ellison has caused an attack on Twitter after pictures on which he sees the Wolf of Wall Street Star in secret.
In fact, the archer received the insanity in the social media and admitted that he had heard since his childhood that he looked like Leo.
"I myself do not see a great similarity, except for facial hair," told Brady of the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I guess I'm gonna take it as a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly focus even more on this year: the ever-increasing similarity between the British striker Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina with her large, expressive eyes should be able to go through as a double-ganger for the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the swimming pool, the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Glee Star Matthew Morrison for years.
A gang higher: This user believes Nathan is the "athletic version" of the Inception actor
Another continuing comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who has similar heavy eyebrows and lips.
The Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimova has more than just the suntanned skin and blond hair like the actress Annalynne McCord, while American Nathan Adrian was attested by fans to equal an "athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt".
Strong women: Football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar facial shape and eyes
Not the only ones: A Twitter user was very happy that others noticed the similarities
Theory put into space: According to this user, there may be a reason for the similarity of the couple
A Twitter user explained her satisfaction that "the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical."
In fact, the U.S. football star Hope Solo and the Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar facial shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney and the gold medal winner in the turn Gabby Douglas, whose own beautiful, broad smile is similar to that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.
CBC commentator for the Olympic Games apologies for his statement that Chinese swimmer "has died like a pig"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of the fourth place of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at Dr 4x200m outdoor swimming season outraged viewers of the CBC live transmission of the Olympic Games on Wednesday
The Canadian station CBC had to apologize after one of his commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "went off like Mief" and died like "a pig" during the race.
Commentator Byron MacDonalds thought that his microphone was turned off when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m freestyle swimming season.
MacDonald, who had been brought to CBS's commentator team to give more "color", could be heard saying, "This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby."
Too excited, went down like Mief, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
The Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second stage of the swimming season 1:57,79 - 1,61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, which enabled Canadians to unlock the gap with China.
Visitors across Canada responded quickly after being shocked by the tone and the language
Emmett Macfarlane tweete, "Did the CBC commentator just say that the 14-year-old swimmer from China "has died like a pig"?????
The idiot didn't understand that they were still on the air."
Ai Yanhan from China was described in the final 4 x 200m freestyle swimming season for women: "This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby."
The criticism against Byron MacDonald on Twitter came quickly and hard, in which many spoke to him
Twitter users did not hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all look like racists.
Shortly after, Scott Russel, who moderated the CBC show, apologized live for MacDonald's comment and said, "We apologise that the comment was broadcast about a swimming performance."
It was an unhappyly chosen formulation, we are sorry that it happened."
CBC apologised at the end of the day for more than 90 times among the people who have responded to the comments on Twitter
Commentary colleague Scott Russel had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald
CBC copied and inserted his apologies with more than 90 other Twitter users who complained about MacDonald's comments
The network also apologized quickly and issued a communication.
We sincerely regret that these statements have been made and that it has been possible for them to be broadcast.
Yesterday night we quickly apologized to our audiences on the show and our followers in the social media.
To clarify one, Byron's comments related to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and an unhappyly chosen formulation. Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on the show and tried to justify his comment by saying that it was not his intention to interpret it as a personal attack.
"I would like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made after the women's swimming season in the CBC Olympic mission," he said.
"I have been referring to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person."
Of course, there was no intention of disregard and I am very sorry."
Buyer in Primark begs about woman trying shamelessly underwear in the middle of the shop
The buyers didn't know where to look when a woman took off her clothes in the middle of a Primark to try underwear.
To make the situation worse, she patterned what she looked like in it, pulled her out and put her back into the shelf.
She continued and tried four pairs of underwear in a shop in Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone.
The Primark store at Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone, where the woman tried the underwear before putting her back into the shelf
A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman had tried the underwear, "she dressed again and left the shop without buying anything."
She said, "The people could not believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the sales surface, she took a pair of underpants out of the cover, pulled off her own tights and pants and tried them on.
"She didn't even try to find a slightly more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, naughty like Oskar."
"Everyone stared when she pulled out the underpants, who obviously didn't like her, because she put her back on the shelf."
She repeated the same thing with three other underpants before she finally decided she didn't like anything, dressed and went out again.
"She didn't seem to be disturbing that she was watching someone - or thinking about the person who might be buying the underwear that she had tried."
Ms. Davidson, 33 who lives in Kent, said, "How disgusting to think that someone would take underwear with him who was wearing another person and who was not washed."
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Mrs. Davidson added: "As I found out, the staff tried to remove the clothes from the sale after she left - which is just as good."
"I would hate to go home with a new pair of underpants and find out that another woman was wearing them and moving them out again and they weren't washed."
A spokesman from Primark said: "Primark is aware of the incident that took place in our Folkstone branch on Tuesday, 9 August."
All the products in question were withdrawn from the sale.
How to protect yourself from gun attacks with Krav Maga
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a grandmaster of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close distance.
Regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to turn the spear around for your robber.
If you approach from behind, you should turn around first so that you can see your attacker and "get out of the line of fire," says Mizrachi.
Then grab the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before you hit it in the face with your free elbow.
Then hit him with the knee in the bar and twist while the attacker bends in front of pain, the gun out of his hands. Hit him with the running in the face and move backwards while they point the gun at him.
In the case of attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the shooting line, grab the gun and twist it so that the attacker cannot shoot.
At the same time, lower the weight on the gun and hit the attacker on the chest, then twist the gun out of his grip before they move backwards and turn the gun on him.
Sounds difficult?
Take a look at the video to see exactly what it's all about.
But remember, in a robbery it's safest to hand over your money - unless you're a Krav Maga Grand Master.
Traveler Ian Wright scratches his tongue in the most dirty places in Europe for a guide
A British traveler underwent a serious test of his immune system and sluggish flex - by leaking some of the most dirty and disgusting places in Europe.
The moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk scraped his way on a Euro-Shine, a platform on the Piccadilly Circus, a rinsing button of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to demonstrate the resilience of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he's going to let himself in.
But the experiment, filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", brought some surprising results to light.
The idea of licking the rinsing button of a train toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.
On his journey through Europe, Mr Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing left that he leaked, more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.
Mr Wright became known for testing the resilience of his intestine by traveling through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things.
From public countries to railway stations to toilet wash-buttons, the task was definitely to test his immune system.
In the film he said: "I was relatively unconcerned as a child as far as my health is concerned and I have put all kinds of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."
In the film he definitely lived up to his reputation.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
His sample line showed a luminometer number of more than 4000 units.
In comparison, the Luminometer number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to lick off after their luminometer number was more than 4000 units, while freshly washed hands had one of less than 60
Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom
In the film he says, "That's the worst thing I've smelled in a toilet."
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not gonna lick anything here because it's disgusting in here.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.
The company equips Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.
Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something fascinating to see and at the same time explain the benefits of probiotics.
We carried out crazy brainstormings that ended up saying, "Let's call Ian."
They claim that the interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the meaning of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "Let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked some of the things I had told him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film."
Of course, there were things that made it easier to get Ian to lick them and others in which this was quite difficult.
I'm glad we recorded some of these dirty treats on film."
In a 2015 Valio survey of 84 percent of all lactic acid bacteria surveyed, in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent, they reported at least occasionally using products containing added lactic acid bacteria.
A Social Family Destroyed Before Delogging Social Apartment in Saltash, Cornwall
An a social family left her social home after a delogging with a damage of £50,000 because she had terrorized her neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown by their estate in Saltash, Cornwall after a long list of complaints.
After they were violently removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found property in an irreparable state.
The walls showed claping holes, wood sections were torn up, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricationd to the walls.
The family has been relocated and it is assumed that she now lives in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works for the house management at Cornwall Housing, said she feared that the apartment could no longer be repaired.
She said, "It was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I believe that people do not have to live in this way.
There are many things to consider, as this property will probably be considered as not so beautiful part of Cornwalls.
The family is infamous and its reputation is also.
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had committed included street fights with baseball batons, intimidating residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screaming, fights and curses.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the rental contract, received an arrangement for antisocial behavior in June.
In some rooms of the house, which may be torn down, old garbage was found
In the estate where drugs were traded in the past, the wood parts were torn up
Neighbors said they saw them fighting on the street and had to be called regularly by the police
Cornwall Housing, after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to take off voluntarily this week, was depriving her and her partner this week.
The delogging was hailed by relieved neighbors who said that their life was made hell.
One of them said, "They didn't joke about anyone."
We lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad.
The countless times we tell the police here are incredible.
"Today we couldn't sleep."
We got up because it was so quiet here - that's not what we're used to!
Now, where they're finally gone, it'll be nice.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighborhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said it would have failed the family to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years
On the overcrowded side of the town hall, garbage and old toys were thrown down
He added: "It is a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and their family's family's behaviour, as a delogging is always the last step to consider Cornwall Housing.
This was a very difficult case, as the behavior was extreme and their actions had to be appalled to their neighbors.
I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall have done, as well as members of the community who have come to us courageously and have given us the information.
I hope that this development will give some neighbors comfort and convey the message that antisocial behavior is not tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but they were all over 20.
A dirty mattress left in one of the bedrooms of the house after the delogging on the floor
Workers of the house administration will now have to clear away garbage mountains that surround the house
In 2014 the police carried out a razzia in the house and found over 70g cannabis as well as scales, paraphernals and cash of £1,700.
Skeldon received a fine after she had been guilty of possession of a Class B drug in commercial terms.
She claimed that the money was for a tombstone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After they were without a shelter, it is assumed that Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many of the house's walls were covered with graffiti.
The police say she'll be depriving tenants who don't comply with the house rules.
Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall Police announced that the communication was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not comply with the house rules.
"This is about those who think they can behave without self-punishment and those who have been damaged by such behavior," she said.
Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal paniced after a deep-flying military jet over the beach
Sun worshipers in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
A Portuguese P-3C Orion Air Force plane set off an incredible crash flight
Air Forces indicated that it was on a training flight, but insisted that there was no safety risk
This was the moment when scared tourists start to panic after a deep-flying jet falls over a full beach.
Dramatic video recordings showed how the military aircraft flew almost in reachable proximity to the sun worshipers on the beach section in Aveiro in northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers sprang up when they understandably began to worry about the noise of the jet engines without first seeing what was happening to them through the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many holidaymakers who posted videos about the dramatic Fly-By in the social media, said: "Two times it flew very deep and there was a moment when it looked like it was crashing."
Nuno Arroja added: "I was surfing right now and it felt like the plane was falling on me."
Tourists on Aveiro beach were panicked when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep
The Portuguese Air Forces today indicated that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to fly so deep that this was the only way to recognize them.
The speaker said that due to the poor visual conditions, the jet flew a little deeper than usual due to nearby fires, but the air forces insisted that safety was at no time at all threatened.
Surface fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer, in which four people died on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese air forces today indicated that the pilot had to fly so deep due to the conditions - strong fog and fire smoke - which restricted his view
The plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
Supercup: Barca with concerns against Seville
Seville - FC Barcelona fights for the first step to the first title win in the new football season on Sunday.
The Catalans compete in duel around the Spanish Supercup outside against the FC Sevilla, and the replay rises three days later at Camp Nou.
The double-winner has to give up Neymar in the power fair with the sublime Cup finalist and ruling Europa-League champion, among other things, who competes with Brazil in the Olympic football tournament.
In addition, he is also missing the goal of Marc-Andre ter Stegen.
In training, the German suffered a bending in the knee, which explains the question of Barca for the first time in favor of Claudio Bravo.
The Chilean International and Ter Stegen have been competing for the status of number one in Barcelona for two years.
Coach Luis Enrique has so far refrained from making a clear decision and left Bravo in the league, but Ter Stegen's performance in most of the other competitions.
Before the first compulsory game of the new season, the Spanish champion has doubts about the fitness status of the team, which was humiliated by 0:4 on Saturday in a test game by Liverpool.
Even at 3:2 in the sample gallop against Sampdoria on Wednesday, Lionel Messi and Co. did not really convince.
Seville, on the other hand, has to digest the 2-3 defeat after an extension in the European Supercup against Real Madrid and strives for the second triumph at the "Supercopa de Espana".
Barcelona is the record winner in this competition with eleven successes so far.
Ma Long in a separate league to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis olimpier.
The 27-year-old defeated his countryman and title defender Zhang Jike 4:0 (12,5,4,4) in a one-sided final in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday.
The world rankings first won the "Golden Grand Slam" with successes at the World Cup, World Cup, World Tour final tournament and even Olympia.
Bronze went to Japanese Jun Mizutani.
As expected, the two Chinese made it into the final game and made up the title among themselves.
This made it clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would pick up the single title in the sign of the five rings.
The last non-Chinese on the top Olympic step was former SVS-NÖ-Legionary Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left alone on the record, between the sentences and at time-outs they had no coaches with them.
They had moved back to the gallery and left their shooters alone in the fair competition.
"I've played the matches for my country so far."
"I play for myself in the finale," Zhang said.
After the game, gold and silver medal winners posing with the China flag.
The match itself was unexpectedly one-sided.
Ma had to fight with his 28-year-old opponent only in the first sentence.
After that, he determined the speed at the plate and left Zhang only 13 points in total.
Because of Ma's superiority, not the expected captivating match developed.
Nevertheless, enough breathtaking ball changes were to be seen.
Mizutani won the bronze match against 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov 4:1.
In his quarter final against the German European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov, the white man had suffered a rib injury, then was in medical treatment, had to be satisfied with sheet metal.
The Swedish Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and Jörgen Persson (42/2008) had, by the way, become a similar high table tennis age Olympic-fourth.
Donald Trump overcomes violent problems in the election campaign
The leadership of the U.S. Republicans is plagued by massive concern that the majority will also be lost in traditional conservative states.
Presidential candidate Donald Trump now admitted weaknesses in his election campaign in the former Republican stronghold Utah.
A rare moment when the normally large-scale and self-confident multimillionaire expressed such concerns as correspondents reported.
After throwing 16 rivals out of the race within his own Republican camp, the doubts about his success in the fight for the White House now grow.
"We have huge problems in Utah," Trump said to evangelical Christians, who asked for support in important states such as Ohio, Florida or Virginia.
To blame for false reports about his candidate, he resumed his well-known media chatter.
Republik Hochburgen wackling
Utah is usually a secure bank for the Republicans.
According to a June Survey USA survey, Trump and his rival from the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, were on the same footing.
While other institutions see Trump in the front, it is not with the distance that is common for Republican candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are also considered at risk.
In an interview by CNBC, Trump replied to the question of how he wanted to stop Clinton's advance: "Genauso, as I have done so far".
And then after that, this will be "either successful, or I will make a very nice, long holiday".
He does nothing but "to tell the truth."
If it is not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that is all right, Trump continued.
Then I return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, the Trump party should have threatened to remove funds to support its election campaign, should it not be able to present better survey values.
Instead of that, the Republicans' candidates for the Congress are to be taken more seriously under the arms.
Olympia: Threesome fraud in doping testing
The IOC wants to set up a Disciplinary Commission on the case.
Kenya's athletics are threatened by the second doping event at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.
After an attempt at fraud at a doping check in the Olympic village, Kenya sent a coach home.
The International Olympic Committee informed immediately to set up a Disciplinary Commission to investigate the case.
A Kenyan official had reported that the former Sprinter and today's Coach, John Anzrah, had given a Urine test in the Olympic Village under the name of the 800-metre-runner Ferguson Rotich.
This has been reported to Kenya's team management by the doping controls.
The World Federation of IAAF asked the IOC for information on the case in order to work out its own investigations, a IAAF speaker reported.
"Depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent measures of the IOC, the IAAF will carry out an evaluation," said an IAAF Declaration.
"He (Anzrah) went to the doping control station and issued himself as Ferguson Rotich, signed the sample and signed it," said Kenya's chief de Mission Stephan Arap Soi.
He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete, who was on the list for the training checks of the world anti-doping agency.
Ferguson Rotich had become over 800 metres of World Cup quarter in Beijing in 2015.
Four days earlier, the Kenyan athletics delegation chief Michael Rotich had been deducted from the Rio games.
He is said to have informed athletes of upcoming doping tests for money payments in his country.
According to media reports, he was arrested on his return to Nairobi airport.
Kenya has been under special observation with the IOC after numerous doping procedures.
In the announcement of the more than 2000 doping targets imposed by the IOC before the Rio Games, it was unusually pointed out in advance that athletes from Kenya and Russia in particular are being taken into vision.
The World Anti-Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.
The law was passed a few weeks before the Olympic beginning.
As a result, WADA took Kenya from the list of countries whose doping fights are in accordance with the rules of WADA.
Kenya is considered a great runner nation.
The country's athletes won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.
In a series of television reports by the ARD, accusations have repeatedly been made that doping funds are easily accessible in Kenya and that there is a significant mentality of sports fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound recently requested a similar investigation in Kenya, as he had done in Russian athletics.
It has been demonstrated that this sport has been performed in a comprehensive and systematic manner.
Russia's athletics were then excluded from the summer games.
Salzburger "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
During the Shakespeare year, the Salzburg Festival presents the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic love pair, similar to Romeo and Juliet.
With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical conquers Salzburg: the "West Side Story", Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.
Artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled the role of Mary in a youth dream.
In the orchestral tomb the Simón Bolívar Orchestra under the direction of the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm," he shivens.
We always say she's very Latin-American.
There are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and melody.
It is a wonderful mixture, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I'd say we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!
In this production Bartoli plays an older Mary.
She reminds herself of her love with Tony, while the younger Mary plays and dances.
The role of Mary has always fascinated me.
First of all because it's musically extraordinary!
And then there would be Maria's personality.
She says it in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and whitty and bright".
It is therefore wise, of course also naïve, and very passionate.
"She is very similar to me, my Italian character, which I have as a Roman," Bartoli laughs.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It's such an honor for us to work with her.
She's an immensely generous person.
And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"
Conducting is a necessity for him.
You can see it in each of his movements, in his eyes, it's his life!
It is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a happy approach to life, which is very important at all!
For American director Philip Wm. McKinley, the "West Side Story" is very up-to-date: "This piece is about prejudice and fanaticism."
Today we have the refugees, then the Puerto Ricans went to New York, and the New York people did not want them.
They are the same issues, and they are as meaningful today as they were at the time.
59 years later, the piece is still relevant.
London Schoolgirl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join the IS, reportedly died in Syria.
The lawyer Taeye Akunjee said that her family learned about her death in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago.
It was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air attack in Raqqa, the group's bollwerk in the country, reported ITV News on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, died shortly after she had planned to leave the war - torn country and return to England.
"One can only hope that the only good is - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going to a war zone - to stop people from ever making this decision," said Akunjee.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from East London boarded a plane for Turkey and then entered a bus at the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was told that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months.
Reid says that in the event of a election victory, Clinton will remain with Garland as candidates for the Supreme Court
Harry Reid, leader of the Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that the presidential presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
The Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland's confirmation since Barack Obama was nominated in March.
The majority leader in the Mitch McConnell Senate is of the opinion that the next president will appoint the successor of the deceased judge at Antonin Scalia Supreme Court.
Reid said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expected Clinton to choose Garland "with a certain degree of certainty".
A speaker from Reid later said that he had not yet spoken to Clinton if she would nominate Garland and he speculates.
He praised Garland and said Clinton's team wouldn't worry about a new candidate.
Garland is the supreme judge of the U.S. Court of Appeal for the District of Columbia.
Raid said that Republicans blocked Garland's nomination were Lakaien and helpers of the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also noted that Donald Trump was not suitable for the President's Office.
Treats wants Nacktkalendar for "Women and Men"
The Treats Magazine works with photographer David Bellemere to release a 1970s Pirelli-inspired Kalendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their NU Muses Calendar for 2017.
The editor-in-chief of Treats Steve Shaw told us early this year that his nude magazine differed from old school playboys, since "Playboy is for men".
I'm doing this for women.
Apparently, he believes that the calendar also does.
"We have to return to depict timeless and classical nudity, in which both women and men feel comfortable and inspired by these images of a female body," said Shaw in a press release on the release of the calendar.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit their images online or personally at open casting call in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish community calculates with mass flight
"Whoever doesn't adapt and praises Erdogan, sits on packed suitcases," says Ercan Karakoyun, Chairman of the Gülen-near Stiftung Dialogue and World.
The Kurdish community of Germany expects ten thousand people seeking protection from Turkey to flee to Germany in the short term.
In the medium term, it could even become "some hundred thousand", believes the president of the association Ali Toprak.
The Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany because of the harsh action of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup experiment.
"In the short term, I count with tens of thousands, in the medium term with several hundred thousand protection seekers from Turkey in Germany, when the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition," says the association president Ali Toprak of the "world" of Friday.
Because the government had already covered Kurdish strongholds with sanctions months ago, 500,000 Kurds in Turkey are on the run.
After the crushed coup, secular and oppositional ethnic Turks would be added.
Many will want to start again in Europe if they are further suppressed in Turkey.
"It can't be that a state that takes up refugees itself produces refugees in its own country," said Toprak.
The head of the association complained of the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish but also in Alevitan cities.
In this way Erdogan wants to increase the exit pressure on the remaining Kurds.
"They are the last great minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have been exterminated or displaced for the past hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a CDU member.
The head of the association demanded that the Federal Government "position itself as sharply as Austria against Erdogan and its followers".
In Germany, too, a "hexen hunt" against Erdogan critics takes place.
I don't feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months.
The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad.
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and oppositionists.
The branding as a member of the Gülen family destroys teachers and other academics' professional existence.
"He who doesn't adapt and praises Erdogan, sits on packed suitcases, by the way, also the kemalists and seculars," said Ercan Karakoyun, Chairman of the Gülen-near Stiftung Dialogue and Education, the "world".
As the newspaper reports on figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, even before the coup, the Turks presented the largest group of asylum seekers in Germany recognized for political persecution.
On the 30th of June, this was 11,386 people, and thus almost 29 percent of all as aylene-based people (39,625).
This survey does not include those who have fled from war, poverty or perspektivelessness.
The right to asylum under the Basic Law is exclusively political, i.e. from the state, individually persecuted.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "Go where it hurts"
Rare Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: The locals do not get anything from the summer election campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country day.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.
In 2021 the country elections will not take place again directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.
Because it's not stupider than before: summer holidays, heat and country elections - that bites.
The locals to be convinced by the campaigners are on holiday.
Most holidaymakers who are in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so don't choose the country day.
In addition, practical problems arise: During the holidays, helpers hang up the posters, blow up balloons, distribute flyers, and end up counting voices, only laboriously push up.
Until 4 September 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has yet again to pass the people by.
The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.
And it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Selling, leader of a SPD/CDU coalition, must fear his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys.
Exciting will be how strongly newcomer AfD cuts off and what remains at the end of Coalition.
Selling, 66 years old and since 2008 head of government, makes an almost inconspicuous election campaign, one looks away from his big posters.
He travels through the country, distributes roses and chats a little with the people, just as his legendary dictionary predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.
Otherwise Seelerring got cold feet and blamed Chancellor Merkel on the blossoming of the AfD.
Their refugee policy, their "We do this" has accelerated the rise of right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful office now.
The CDU with its top candidates, the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced what it is like to make elections in the right place at the wrong time.
She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to major rallys; Merkel Bundestag is located in the northeast.
But the target group was not right, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony there than Mecklenburger and Vorpommern.
"There was probably the majority from other federal states," said Vincent Kokert, General Secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in the NDR.
But no one else from other parts of Germany is sorry to listen to Angela Merkel once.
Otherwise, the Northeast CDU largely abandons the usual electoral stands on marketplaces and in front of shopping centres with umbrellas and balloons.
That, says Kokert, only plays a "subordinate role".
The Union has also noticed that in the country, it is breaking away the basis for it to work very hard to find a wire to the people again.
It goes like the left, the SPD, the green: hardly exists in the widths of the country.
However, the advice of the CDU campaigner Kokert to his fellow fighters is also self-evident: "You have to go where it hurts, namely where people are: village festivals, golden weddings, every birthday celebration has to be used".
Because much is at stake, Selling has now called his SPD into a particularly committed election campaign.
In surveys, social democrats were most recently behind partners CDU (25) and just before the AfD (19).
At the 2011 election, the SPD had won clearly with 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).
The Greens, a small party with seven percent in the surveys, are expected to make the leap into the country day.
They make the holiday note a modern virtue and move their campaign largely to the Internet.
"Online election campaign", it is called the country president Claudia Müller.
Otherwise, green campaigners are searching for local voters among the holidaymakers.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, is just floating through the Mecklenburg Lakes with a houseboat and still finds it beautiful.
Your impression: "Electury in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment".
B27-rehabilitation: restaurants suffer from blockage
At the speed with which the B 27 is renovated, there is nothing to mess with.
For those responsible for the construction work, which starts at 5.30 a.m. and ends only at 8 p.m., there is all kinds of praise.
"They've made everything pretty juicy," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet gas station.
It's a superteam.
There's no delay either.
The construction site could be moved to the south on schedule at the beginning of the week, until the end of October everything should be finished.
It is also appreciated that those responsible for the construction work are welcome, for example when it comes to setting up emergency services.
Since the construction site has migrated to the south on Monday and the blockage of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen has also been removed and the connection to Rottenburg has therefore been restored, the traffic situation within the village has relaxed.
Citizens can now travel both sides of the B 27 from Ofterdingen.
The distance traffic through the place seems to go down.
"There were sometimes significant complaints," says the Deputy Head of the Florian King, responsible for the traffic management of the renovation.
The residents of Bachsatzstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise, because many of them were looking for a sleek path and were more familiar with their navi than with the signage.
This led some trucks to collapse in residential areas.
Since the speed limits were not met, the municipality strongly demanded the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.
"There were significant excesses," says King, who was able to learn about the situation on the spot.
There have already been two to three flashes per minute.
The fastest was in the tempo 30 zone at 77 kilometres.
Since the construction site has continued, however, it has become quieter.
For businessmen at B 27, it is only a little comfort that customers from Rottenburg now have the street open again.
Businessmen don't like to look into the cards.
But that the B 27-rehabilitation has led to sales losses, let everyone who is asked see through.
However, some are more and some less affected.
Those who have less to do with the "end customer", i.e. produced for other companies, for whom the renovation has hardly any consequences.
Also at the Autohaus Maier Thomas Sulz speaks of a "highest slight decline", but also acknowledges that of course "the running skills are missing".
The most visited are the locals along the road.
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the steak house, formerly crown, finds clear words.
That's already a threat to existence.
Not only did he, but all the restaurants " met it hard".
The customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.
We must be glad about every euro of sales.
He counts the sales losses to "more than 50 percent".
The road renovation had "thrown back for two years".
He had to release half of his staff.
If I had a company with 4,000 employees and half had been released, politics would have reacted differently.
Instead, government president Jörg Schmidt replied to a request from Göhner, whether there could be a financial compensation, by saying that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation at B 27. Now it must also bear the disadvantages of the renovation.
Göhner knows from other districts where such a thing was handled more generously.
In all the complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.
Finally, the family business has been located here since 1715, he refers to the long history.
He can understand that other regulars are now less often looking by because of the complicated traffic management.
If you can't get there, it's also beautiful elsewhere.
The return of his regular clients after the completion of the renovation work has no doubt as to that.
Despite crises with BSE and avian influenza, Göhner considers the impact of B 27 construction on his clientele to be the biggest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its long history.
Six months of construction work, that's already brutal.
In the name of the fight against terrorism, laws are constantly being taken.
Following the recent attacks, Minister of the Interior de Maizière is now presenting a thick security package.
But what does a tolerance status have to do with terror?
And what does the coalition partner say to all of this?
Thomas de Maizière gives the reconciler.
All his proposals were "politically acceptable" to the coalition partner, says the Federal Minister for the Interior in presenting his new security package.
They don't overwhelm anyone.
Other further points would initially be discussed within the parties.
I'm also involved.
As Minister of the Interior, however, he was on the basis of results and a "achievable consensus" within the coalition.
After the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, De Maizière has missed a little time before presenting his conclusions on security in the Republic.
But these are all the more important.
Some things are already known, announced, surveyed: A new security authority is not new to care for the cracking of encrypted communication.
Neither is the fact that Germany has to implement several EU standards on passenger data and arms law.
The reputation for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities does not come as a surprise.
In part, de Maizière launches a second run for proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD: He wants to punish sympathy advertising for terrorist groups and stop jihadists with double citizenship from the German passport.
"These will be difficult points for the SPD," the CDU man admits.
He nevertheless considers this reasonable and does not demand anything that the coalition partner has no chance at all.
A few new ideas will also be presented by de Maizière.
They have some of it in themselves: He plans quick procedures for deportations and more ways to arrest people before deportation.
Refugees who are specifically brought into the country should have their smartphones checked in advance and disclose social media accounts for a security check.
In the case of tolerances for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to put some worse than before - for example, those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers in order to hide their identity.
Some of them are politically and legally sensitive.
Some of them also seem unforgivable and leave questions open.
And on a number of points - in the treatment of patients for example - the question arises: What does this actually have to do with security and terror?
Yes, de Maizière says it is important to distinguish between the topics of refugees and terror.
But it can't be said that the suspects of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
In addition, many people were concerned about security in view of the high numbers of refugees.
And things that were deeply occupied by the people were not allowed to stand out even in election times.
The internal security is enormously focused.
First the attacks in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The uncertainty is great.
And yes, there's going to be elections.
Union and SPD are therefore increasingly responding to the issue of internal security.
In the past few days, it has been high between the two parties.
Only a barley dispute about the equipment of the Federal Police, then about a security-political idea collection of some of the Union's internal ministers, in which the head of the board also demands a Burka ban and a departure from dual citizenship.
De Maizière is also trying for conciliatory tones.
He doesn't think he's going to take a two-pass away.
We have satisfied the discussion in Germany.
I don't think it makes sense to reopen it.
And in the case of a Burka ban, he has constitutional concerns.
Whether its own package is constitutional at all corners and whether it is actually "adequate" for the coalition partner, still has to be shown.
There's a lot in it that could cause a fight.
However, the SPD is also currently trying to profile itself on the subject of internal security.
Head of the Party Sigmar Gabriel only carefully signals willingness to talk and says: "The SPD is willing to talk about everything that helps to further increase security".
Volkswagen is still going through with a smile.
Despite diesel scandals, extradition figures are rising worldwide.
But it's not going around in all markets.
In the recall action, there is a vortex about a term.
Volkswagen starts in the second half of the year during the extraditions.
Although Europe's largest car builder has been able to show a plus in the course of the year, thanks to its many brands and some well-running markets, the diesel affair can be further developed.
However, in July, the core brand VW weakened mainly in Western Europe and again taxed total sales, as reported by the company listed in the Dax.
Worldwide, the VW brand sold 1.8 percent less vehicles in July with 449100 cars than in the previous month.
Sales in Western Europe alone, after China's second most important market, were 14 percent below the previous month.
In the home market in Germany, extraditions fell by almost a sixth.
Head of the brand Jürgen Stackmann reduced the weaker figures from July to two sales days less in Europe.
In addition, in some core markets, there had been a "changed economic environment" in which there had been a buyback.
In addition to the situation surrounding the coup test in Turkey, the British vote on leaving the EU also stressed a speaker.
In the U.S., where the exhaust affair first escalated, there is also a minus to be found.
Large support for VW is the Chinese market.
Overall, the mainly affected housemark of the Lower Saxony continues to be glaring through the diesel scandal: After the first seven months, only a drop in extradition of 0.9 percent is recorded to 3.37 million vehicles.
Head of the Group Fred Kappler was able to show a sales increase from January to July.
1.3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen at this time, 5.904 million worldwide.
Volkswagen had manipulated exhaust tests with a software.
In Germany alone, VW calls about 2.5 million cars to upgrade to the workshops.
In the course of the changeover, VW confirmed that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects.
After upgrading the vehicles, there was no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance.
The automaker will issue a "guarantee-equivalent" certificate to the customer after the changeover, but do not refer to a "guarantee" as it was called on Friday in corporate circles.
The reason is legal fines.
The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen now gave its German customers a guarantee for converted diesel models.
This had been confirmed last Monday by VW representatives at the Federal Ministry of Transport.
The Ministry of Transport confirmed that there was this meeting.
"VW has to fully fulfil the requirements of my investigative commission and KBA."
"Deviations from this are not accepted," said Federal Minister for Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) according to Ministry.
VW has assumed the guarantee that no deterioration occurs in the case of fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power after the upgrade and that all vehicle type-approval relevant values have remained unchanged.
Volkswagen itself does not use the term "guarantee" as it was called in corporate circles.
With the broad term "guarantee" Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers, for example, come to a workshop half a year after the changeover, for example, with engine damage - and this could lead back to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
Also in the interests of customers, it is important to avoid any other damage that has nothing to do with the exhaust scandal, as it was said, in the case of any possible guarantee schemes.
Therefore, VW does not use the term "guarantee".
The Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee demands from rich savers in future criminal interest rates - as the second institute in Germany.
On Thursday, bank manager Josef Paul said: "It's only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on giro or daily cash accounts."
The Bundesverband Deutscher Banken speaks of an individual case and does not see a signal in it: Normal savers should not "fear to pay for their savings-gross criminal interest rate".
Banks have to pay their 0.4 percent fines overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB).
This fee is charged by the Raiffeisenbank Gmund from September on by private and corporate customers for deposits of over 100,000 euros on current or daily cash accounts.
"The first 100,000 euros are free."
"The next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year in the future," said Paul.
For a long time, he has been holding 40 million euros, which could be removed from one day to another and which he cannot use.
"They are on the central bank account with me and cause 0.4 percent costs," said the bank manager.
"I can't lie down for every million 4000 euros."
The cost is now passed on in accordance with the 'polluter pays' principle.
Just leaving the cash in the trustees of the Raiffeisenbank would be far too dangerous: "I've already experienced four robberys, I don't like the fifth!" said the bank's board.
Most customers would understand and switch to other investment forms.
Only a few migrated to other banks.
The cooperation association Bavaria stated: "The extreme monetary policy rate of the ECB causes considerable costs for all banks".
To carry them on their own is "permanently impossible to operate".
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management, credit cards or transfers.
With penalty rates for deposits of three million euros, the Thüringer Volks- und Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land had made headlines with its skate bank branch in 2014.
Michael Kemmer, Managing Director of the Banking Association, said: "We do not expect private customers to have to pay all-round fees for deposits, and competition in Germany among banks and savings banks is far too strong."
A banker said that at Lake Tegern there were "a clientele that is somewhat more luxuriantly equipped with wealth".
"This can become a problem for a small bank" if they keep money free of charge.
Founded in 1911, the cooperative bank Gmund has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
The region is home to famous actors, athletes and entrepreneurs.
The cooperative association Bavaria "are currently not known to any other banks that calculate a deposit refund for private customers," said Spokesperson Ernst.
The President of the Federal Association of German People's Banks and Raiffeisenbanken (BVR), Uwe Fröhlich, had declared at the end of June: "The threshold to go negative towards the private customer is very, very high".
Competition is tough, and there is a danger that investors will get out of the way.
The customers in Germany will not like this in width.
Destination Plates: who actually buys records?
Lonely men middle-aged love plates.
Before you hurry to the comment section to oversow it under the pseudonym NotAllUnsealMenMittlerenAlters with harsh insults, this statement derives from current data.
According to YouGov, the much discussed recovery of records is not due to a boom in Millennials that wants to welcome the novelty of physical objects but to midlife nostalgia.
Those who recently bought a record are likely to be between 45 and 54.
In fact, the 18-24 age group is the most unlikely buyer group.
It is also not a hoard by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older plate buyers keep their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending their time alone (69%).
But are the results of YouGov right?
If this blog were a news report on television, the camera would follow me as I walk in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wear a modest grey suit and study wildly before I stop, hold my hands and say something definite like, "So, let's take a closer look at it."
So let's take a look at it.
Even though the heart of Sohos slowly loses its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic plate specialties.
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to estimate their age and mood through observation.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, to which I follow from Sister Ray (number of data: two young women, three men middle age) into Reckless Records (number of data: eight men middle age, one woman, probably around 20) is for a day because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill up for the few hours.
Is he a collector, I ask?
"I guess so," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.
These records, shown above (he sent me the orgasm by e-mail, I didn't follow him home), clothes the walls of his living room.
The reason he owns such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they appeared and buy again items he sold when he was young and pleaded.
"Many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. Things I was probably too young to buy them," he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and like to spend alone, adding: "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much.
That's my vice.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets are on the YouGov profile.
However, he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media hype, people who have heard about the comeback and who see themselves causing themselves to buy their old records again.
Of the conversations I have conducted, people have usually got rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again," he says.
This would explain the boom to followers of the record Revival of a certain age.
But what about the supposed emotional meaning of records?
It only takes a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a soothing community of like-minded people.
According to Wez, some of the older customers took offense at the contactless payment system.
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record covers, from objects that wake up happy youth memories.
"I think sometimes it can be the filling of an emptiness or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," says Wez.
That's what I do as a collector, and I think many people do.
It is a simple way to work spiritually.
"We are like their social workers!" an employee whispers from a panel pile.
A survey by the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month have not heard it yet.
The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not have a record player.
At this time of the news report, I would probably look very concerned as I browse through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (number of data: three men of middle age), has noticed a "Trophaene aspect" of the Revival.
"Someone just came in here recently and said, "I don't own a record player, but I would like to buy a radio head record so I can put it on the shelf," he says.
This is not a large percentage, but it definitely happens.
More productive, less musicy.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
These are younger people, not older ones, who come in slowly.
Fopp, who has devoted almost an entire floor to the records, has a colorful audience when I go in.
There are pairs around 70, tourists taking photos, teen boys and women middle age.
Even though the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beast's latest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz comes from the speakers - it is good to see such diversity among customers.
None of them look unusually lonely, but nagging psychological traumas are hard to detect when standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been running around the store for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale.
It's more like making a window trip than a big shopping.
She doesn't deserve much, so collecting records is not a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It is easy to listen to music from a computer or in other ways, but the beauty of records is..." she drives off with a infatuated sigh.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
As I appear to pattern the jeans hotpants, I watch a group of young teen girls who group around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter think about buying a Crosley record player.
To the left is a staircase, a wall full of records of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, essential records for an average collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them.
It's pure "Plattenkunst".
But given that each attraction for these items means more money for the industry and some customers could send into the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain about.
It is no surprise that a population that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends most on luxury items such as records.
Even though my research showed that the results of YouGov are true, they do not take into account, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors who exist in reality, record stores and online forums.
These people probably work hard in school or in offices.
They certainly don't spend their Thursday tomorrow with strolling through record stores of Berwick Street and foliage through plates, while avoiding the stark look of an eerie, 30-year-old false moderator who doesn't look up on the shoulders of any suspicious men of middle age.
The Greenland shark is the longest living vertebrate - video report
Scientists say that Greenlandhai has the longest life span of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies sharks, says that the record was in a female that is assumed to be between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long
French court rejects offer about demolition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
A French court has refused an offer from the authorities in Calais to tear down dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.
At a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be empowered to tear down 72 provisional shops in which persons inside the warehouse sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, from barber services, or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.
The prefecture of Calais argued that these places should be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would pose a fire and health risk.
Humanitarian groups informed the court that shops and restaurants were important, as the free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They also explained that the provisional shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A Lille court ruled that there would be no legal basis for disfellowshipping people who operate the 72 provisional transactions, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were "absolutely comprehensible."
Judge Jean-François Molla said that the grocery shops, cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than simply feeding people who "live in extremely precarious conditions."
He said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by the tear down was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is non-profit and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes, as well as advice on asylum matters for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café.
In a letter to the Guardian, it was said that the closure would be "for these children a disaster, of which the youngest eight years are old."
The two aid organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp had risen to over 9,000 people - the highest number up to now - after a steep increase in new arrivals during the summer.
Despite Olympic disappointment, Martin remains fighting
Despite his disappointing appearance in the Olympic time trial, Radprofi Tony Martin does not want to be interrupted.
"I continue to watch the World Cup, remain confident and fight," wrote the 31-year-old on Thursday before leaving Rio de Janeiro on Facebook.
He has no explanation for his miserable twelfth place at the sugar hut.
"I honestly find it difficult to comment on yesterday's time trial," said Martin.
He had to analyze in peace what reasons led to the debacle.
Martin actually wanted to compete for the title during the World Championships in Qatar in October.
"I'm going to look at everything that we've changed lately."
"This includes my position," wrote the three-time World Championship champion, who lost more than three minutes on Wednesday on the 54,5 km on Olympic winner Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland).
Olympia: Tennis pro Siegemund misses semifinals
The victory of Laura Siegemund ended in the Rio quarter finale: The world rankings-32. from Metzingen were missed by a 1:6, 1:6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico/WTA-Nr.
34) the semifinal of the Olympic tennis tournament.
Siegemund, plagued by back problems, could only carry out her supplement once and was powerless compared to the previous rounds.
On Thursday, Angelique Kerber (Kiel/No. 2) had the chance to jump into the lead round.
The Australian open winner met the British Johanna Konta (No. 10).
As the last German tennis professional, Tommy Haas had won a medal (silver) in Sydney in 2000.
Two German DTB starters in the quarter finals of summer games had been in place last in 1992.
A German duo has never been in an Olympic single half-final.
Group increases in start-up for live video game transfers
Watching other people playing video games is a huge trend - it also wants to benefit Microsoft.
The technology group buys the start-up beam that specializes in this hobby.
How much money is spent on the acquisition, Microsoft did not report on Thursday.
Beam started his offer only in January and already has more than 100,000 users.
You can watch others play, but you can also intervene yourself.
For example, they can give up missions to the players and confront enemies and provide equipment.
The Playful Activision Blizzard launches a new HD video service for the booming world of e-sports.
On the way to the global media event, Facebook should help.
The advertising industry has already stopped.
The employees of the start-up, which has been based in Seattle, Washington, will move to Microsoft headquarters in the California Redmond, as Beam co-founder and chief Matt Salsamendi reported.
For the customers, therefore, no change should be made as a result of the acquisition.
According to Microsoft, Beam is integrated into the video game department around the Xbox console.
The market of live streaming of video game activities is currently growing rapidly.
Known platforms are Tswitch and YouTube Gaming.
Tswitch had been bought in 2014 by the online dealer Amazon - for almost a billion dollars.
YouTube Gaming belongs to the Google-Mother Alphabet.
Here comes the Enforcement Trailer
Germany's Raser has to adjust to the next generation speedometers: In various federal states, including Hessen and Brandenburg, new lightning devices are being tested, which are intended to transmit speed probes particularly effectively.
The futuristic Enforcement Trailer of Vitronic from Wiesbaden, for example, can be used at accident priorities where it would be too dangerous for police to measure mobile.
For example, there is often no infrastructure necessary to ensure compliance with speed limits at motorway construction sites or to rehabilitating bridges with a temporary speed limit.
A permanent mobile structure can, however, be too dangerous or complicated.
The Enforcement Trailer is autark: its battery holds five days with continuous measurement operation, the case data are transmitted encrypted via a modem.
With laser measuring technology, all vehicles can also be recorded simultaneously across several tracks.
Variable speed limits as well as transit bans by time, lanes and vehicle class can also be monitored.
In the high-speed state you can move the trailer according to the manufacturer with any car with trailer coupling.
So that it is not simply stolen, it is lowered in the measuring mode, so that the wheels disappear in the armored and by the way also fireproof outer shell.
In addition, a built-in alarm system is intended to protect the blitzer from vandalism.
Since 2015, the trailer has been tested and used in various federal states according to Vitronic.
Foreign authorities are also flashing with the new technology: Recently France ordered 100 pieces, after an order of 150 pieces last year.
United Kingdom picks up silver in the 7's Rugby after Fiji Masterclass gets gold
The impressive performance of Great Britain at the 7-er Rugby came in the finale on Thursday evening to an abrupt stop at the last obstacle in the form of the Fijis when they were beaten with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji gave a master class in handling, side-stepping, backs, line run and raw strength to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat was sweetened by the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Great Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The clear defeat of the Boxes, 7-5 in the semifinal on the same day, could fall on them in the final.
But regardless of that, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in best shape in this form.
It could be a consolation for GB - but it probably won't - that at least one Briton will have a gold medal hanging around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's chief trainer Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon.
GB had a difficult path behind it.
Eight years ago, they lost every game under Ryan at the Adelaide Sevens.
Here they just lost one.
This slut is going to hurt, but progress is amazing.
Fiji started wonderful and left the attacks GBs out of fun.
It felt for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. as if you were running in driving buses. The World Series winners went up 5-5 when Osea Kolinisau raised in the corner.
With four minutes of play, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner that he transformed.
12-0 and GB has hardly touched the ball.
A prominent tackle of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Man Leone Nakarawa to reach a third gate, but it just stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua left a touchdown in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new one since the re-appetizer and there was still over a minute of play ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravovou boasted through further weak taplings of the GB team and stormed to the line to make a goal.
The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.
It's like Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB still learns about it.
That's it.
GB carried out fundamental changes at half-time and closed the fiijian gap...for all four minutes, which was good for the first half-time, until Joshua Tuisova passed through after a brilliant interplay of Fiji.
Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game had long been in favor of the South Sea insulators, whose fans sang, flags swirled and danced on the stand.
It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fiji.
Mata Viliame put the i-tumble with a further attempt in the last seconds.
The whistle sounded, the Fiji hugged and GB kicked to death in the lawn.
Back in the day, Fiji had defeated Japan in the semifinal with 20-5, and Britain pushed South Africa into a tight semifinal match from the race - Great Britain's transformation of the difference.
Kyle Brown brought the box forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive footing and reached a gate among the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late Tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by fight with the coach's cancer for rowing victory
There will be no more emotional gold than at these games, and that's what it means.
From the first rowing blow to the last, 220 hard skys that go into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional importance in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Although there were only the two sitting on the row, there were three voices in the boat. The echo of the coach Robin Williams, was omnipresent when they rowed to the second Olympic gold in the second without a tax wife in succession, the first women in the history of British sport who set such a scale.
Their domination was absolute, at least their 39th unbeatable commitment, which is also unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant athletes who slide across the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the kind of triumph to the full.
Behind every gold in the row is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental progress that makes the difference and it was no more helpful than the coach who did not know 30 months ago whether he would survive this day at all than was diagnosed with cancer.
As he said, he was risky.
I had bladder cancer, which can be operated, and they did.
If you don't, he'll spread everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes the outlook a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio was lucky that he could start his treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if under such circumstances it is even the right term.
I needed money, so I had to go better soon.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice.
That's how it starts.
rowing itself is already a challenge, but that makes it even bigger.
In the immediacy of the victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking more than usual, trying to deal with his own fears.
Stanning, who was a captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment in a mission in Afghanistan, said, "I was an emotional wreck this week. That might be something extreme, but it means so much."
It only repeats how much it means to me, how much I and Helen and Robin worked.
There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin we wouldn't be anyone, so a massive thank you to him. He's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have wanted a better person to train or a better coach.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years.
The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up.
Even in the last 500 meters when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to open up, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very caught right now.
Helen called, "Stay in the process, stay in the process."
It's really important not to get caught up.
We had a good start and at the same time we weren't bent on doing something great.
We didn't want fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, whatever we did.
The couple will take a break for a year before it will make decisions about its future.
Glover must appear next week at a wedding, her own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say that was my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
In London it took about six months to understand that I was an Olympic winner.
It was all so new to me and I was so stressed.
Here it took about four minutes.
That feels so much better," she said.
31 years of exemplary clarity
The managing director of the "Veitensteingruppe", Ruppert Göller, is retired.
The association is considered to be "bayer-wide exemplary".
A small Franconian drinking water network as a model for the large water producers.
That's what it was in the original tone some time ago in a contribution from Bavarian radio.
A little later, the water forum of the government of Unterfranken recognized the purpose association.
The work of the Veitenstein Group was considered "bayer-wide as an example".
Behind all is Rupert Göller, who has been a staff member for 31 years, of which 28 is a managing director.
Now he was retired at the age of 65.
The water pool of the Veitenstein Group, located in Kottendorf, Breitbrunn municipality, supports about 150000 cubic meters of water annually and provides 32 places and villages with about 5500 inhabitants.
The municipalities are the municipalities of Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the town of Baunach.
There are water supply contracts for other cities and municipalities.
The current president, Breitbrunn's mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), reminded us that Rupert Göller was recruited as a water station in 1985 and was already appointed Managing Director of the Zielverband in 1988.
"His duties have been very diverse and they ranged from water pipeline construction and maintenance work to office and organizational activities, budget creation, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency weekends," said the president.
As outstanding events, it called the commissioning and initiation of the new wells (1994), land purchases in the area of the new wells (1998) and compensation of farmers, the renovation of the high tanks (1999), the re-purchasing of a central computer control (2004) and the partial renewal of water pipelines.
There has been no standstill and there have been repeated innovations because water means life and drinking water is the most important food.
In her Laudatio she praised Göllers faithful, reliable and correct service over 31 years.
He has worked with a lot of heart blood for his water purpose association and he has lived the water purpose association as if it were his own company.
A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the Veitenstein Group's concept of success for nitrate reduction in front of the Water Forum of the district of Unterfranken.
He received a lot of recognition and praise for this.
Rupert Göller praised Alfonso Griebel, who had worked with him for 28 years.
He's the best water station and he was a faithful boy.
Together we were an unbeatable team.
As a highlight from his point of view, he described the well construction and the restructuring of the purpose association.
However, the biggest challenge and the most difficult use were the break at the high tank at Kirchlauter on 3 January.
Here at minus 17 degrees will have to work all night so that the villages could be supplied with water.
The supply of Neubrunn could only be maintained once, because the high tank from Pettstadt was filled with hoses.
The management of the drinking water association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who succeeds Rupert Göller.
Soprano Anna Netrebko is openly dealing with the autism of her son Tiago - and turns to other affected parents: "You must have the courage to talk about it."
"Medicine has made great progress," said the 44-year-old of the Italian newspaper "Corriere della Sera".
When the disease was recognized by her son, she believed that she had to die.
The now eight-year-old Tiago, however, has progressed well and is now learning privately in New York, where there are the best therapists.
"To give an example: if I ask him something that was two years ago when I sang at the Scala in Milan, he remembers nothing," said Netrebko.
But he's the happiest person on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebko's connection with the Bassbaritone Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Relationshipate in Bargteheide - Man shoots lifemate
A 35-year-old man shot at his partner on Friday about 10.45 a.m. in a multi-family house in Bargteheide (Kreis Stormarn) and injured her fatally.
"The man called us himself and said he killed his companion," said a police spokesperson.
The culprit is on the run, and after him is publicly arrested.
In the meantime, all over Germany, for Sven S. could be on the road by car.
The man is about 1.80 meters tall, muscular, brown-burned and has a smooth.
The police have now published a photo of him.
But it's a few years old.
Meanwhile, the man wears a smooth.
The man should not be addressed directly.
He could carry the gun with him, the police said.
Whoever sees Sven S. is supposed to call the 110.
The police are talking about a "relation state".
The victim was born in 1988, the perpetrator in 1981.
At first, the police in Lübeck did not want to give any information about the Tathergang or the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim, but she confirmed that a person had been killed.
"It's a murder crime."
"That's all we're saying at the moment," said a police spokesperson in Lübeck.
According to eyewitnesses, a special deployment command (SEK) was in the crime scene.
Steel - Light View for German Steel Industry
The crisis-stricken and energy-intensive German steel industry remains deprived of additional costs in millions.
Financial burdens that threatened the industry from eco-electric funding are from the table.
It remains in the process of liberation from the renewable energy levy on the existing plants for the so-called self-current production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister of Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "West German General Newspaper" (WAZ, Friday edition).
"I am really glad that after two years of tough negotiations we were finally able to achieve this."
The European Commission therefore initially planned to ask the steel manufacturers using gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption.
According to the German Industry Association, the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year.
Gabriel told WAZ that there was now a principle agreement with the EU Commission after talks with Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only when the generators are replaced in the steelworks will an EEG charge of 20 percent fall.
But they are not raised in the steel industry either.
The IG Metall welcomed the agreement of Germany with the EU Commission on own-power generation.
Thus, the status quota of the current scheme is largely defined.
Gabriel's successful efforts were of particular importance to the steel industry.
"With regard to our campaign 'Steel is the future' this is a first step."
"More must follow."
"Climate and employment targets should also be considered in the reform of emissions trading," said IG Metall-chef Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt.
The steel industry in Europe has suffered from overcapacity and a significant price pressure since the 2008 financial crisis.
Last year, the situation worsened when the world's largest producer country in China threw massive steel on the world market in view of the weakening domestic demand.
European manufacturers sue price dumping to Chinese steel companies.
During this spring, the situation has relaxed a little.
On the one hand, import duties imposed on imports of steel have shown an effect, on the other hand, economic prospects in China have been brightened.
It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.
The German industry primus Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.
Last but not least, prices would have stagnated.
The industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
Thyssenkrupp did not want to exclude closings of individual works.
In the German steel industry, around 86000 people were employed at the end of 2015.
In July, German steel manufacturers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.
With 3.4 million tons, they produced more than six percent less crude steel than in the previous month, as reported by the business association Stahl on Friday.
After a short increase in May, the quantity produced now fell the second month in a row.
Since the beginning of the year, production has been below the previous year's figure by two percent.
The association expects an increase in emissions in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation.
Community, mind, health: singing does good for seniors
The singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp all her life: as a young girl, she was in the school choir, in the teaching school, she took the subject music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.
"Singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.
After a sample, she feels balanced, cheerful, and generally alive, she says.
By the way, she does something good for her health and for her spirit.
Singen is a great hobby for seniors from a number of perspectives, says Erhard Hackler of the German Seniors League.
Most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of the music, describes Hackler.
Through regular co-existence, seniors can establish and maintain social contacts.
Because often social and family structures break up in old age, a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: "To agree and organize, to be able to rely on the others and learn from one another - a choir is a very special form of being together".
Singing can be strenuous in the positive sense, says Hackler.
In doing so, seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.
Those who regularly demand their lungs don't get out of the pustle as fast as they do in everyday life.
Even when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby.
Singen often has a very special effect on older people, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Labour Association of Senior Organizations.
In the older generations the common singing had a much higher importance, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure time, she explains.
Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people arouses many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.
Through song lyrics and especially melodies, self-diseased people are represented by long past events.
When singing, the head is also required a special performance, explains Lenz.
At the same time to focus on your own voice and on a predefined rhythm and adjust to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.
Especially older people who live alone practice not only to focus on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition experienced by singing in the choir, says Hackler.
An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.
The self-esteem also grows through singing in the choir.
To show myself: If I practice for a long time, I will grow better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens.
There are good reasons to start singing, so there is enough.
If you want to try a new hobby, don't hesitate - even if you think you have little talent, Lenz advises.
You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears when a tone goes next to it?
In search of the right offer, seniors have different possibilities, says Hackler.
If someone from the circle of acquaintances sings in a senior choir, you can just join.
Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the area.
Those who want to sing in an ecclesial choir can contact the church or the church president directly.
Many senior choirs can also be found over the Internet.
Those who do not have access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbors for help in the search for the Internet.
Those who want to sing should necessarily join a choir, advise Hackler.
Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - this applies to every age.
Cats react more sensitively than cats to the screams of the young animals
In Hanover, biologists have investigated the effect of calling cat babies on adult animals.
To their surprise, the mows did not leave the males cold - but in contrast to the females they always behaved the same way.
Female cats can detect the excretion of cat babies on the germination of the little ones.
They react by 10 percent faster to sounds of kittens that are in great need, as scientists from the University of Veterinary Medicine and the Hannover Medical University (MHH) have found out.
Although hangovers also respond to the calls of kittens - however always the same.
"Obviously, the acoustic differences between the mowing of less and very excited young animals are either imperceptible or irrelevant to the males," said the biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH.
She is the first author of the study to be published on this Friday in the journal "BMC Evolutionary Biology".
In a previous investigation, the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the kitten writing differed with the urgency of their need for help.
A total of nine adult cats and eight kittens from the MHH animal husbandry were observed.
They were played for one call of little ones who were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and siblings.
On the other hand, they were confronted with screams of more excited kittens, which were additionally raised.
The researchers consider their results to be meaningful despite the low sample.
"All females, even those who did not have their own young people, reacted differently to the screams," Konerding said.
They turned to the speaker faster when this call was played by the very excited kittens.
This ability may be inborn or developed with sexual maturity.
"A surprise was that the males even responded," said the biologist.
In the past, scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men to baby sounds several times in humans.
Also, some studies showed that women responded more sensitively to infants, whether they were mothers or not, the biologist Marina Scheumann reported.
Podolski gets Supercup with "Gala"
Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey.
A warrant was issued in Turkey against the former football star Hakan Sükür.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
An important football game takes place in Turkey for the first time after the coup experiment.
Before the duel of the archrivals between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolskis Galatasaray Istanbul around the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clear: "Business as usual" is announced.
Even when the state of emergency was imposed after the fall in July, the government demanded that the daily lives of normal citizens not be affected.
But this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is responsible for the coup test.
It does not stop in front of the football.
The prosecutor issued a warrant against the former Starkicker Hakan Sükür.
According to this, the Sükür, now living in America, is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
Sükür is said to be a follower of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is responsible for the coup test by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Although the state of emergency, initially imposed for 90 days, is still valid until October, in fact it has almost no impact on the lives of most Turks.
The nocturnal "democracy growth" in public places throughout the country has declared Erdogan to be finished on Wednesday.
The sport - like the whole country - is divided into followers and opponents of Erdogan.
Especially fans of the Besiktas working party are traditionally not among the friends of the president.
But what the vast majority of the Turks have in mind in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military pits.
Even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Galatasaray or Besiktas.
In the "Gala" Cup winners, it will come back to Lukas Podolski.
His sporting value was demonstrated by the Cologneer during the past season: With 17 goals and nine templates in all competitions, the 31-year-old finished his first season as the top scorer of his club.
In the final match against Fenerbahce, he scored the 1–0 victory hit.
The newspaper "Fanatik" cheered him: "He was the best on the square."
He finished the season in an excellent way and secured his team the cup.
Thanks to "Poldi" the disappointing season found a conciliatory conclusion for the record champion.
After the pre-round K.o in the Champions League, the "Löwen" were released early in the Europe League.
In the Süper Lig it was only to rank six.
The season was not good.
The cup was the only way to win something.
"We did that and that's the most important thing," said Podolski.
For Master Besiktas the game year was better.
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez, who laid the basis for the 14th title with 26 season hits as the Süper-Lig-Torschütenkönig.
This is also the reason that the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31-year-old.
In doing so, the Gomez, under contract with AC Florence and loaned to Besiktas only after the coup attempt, had announced that he would not return after his EM leave due to the political situation in the country.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he just has to say it," quoted the magazine "Kicker" Club Chief Fikret Orman.
However, if the storm had to be willing to give up on about one third of its annual salary estimated at EUR 7.5 million, Orman said: "We can't pay his salary at Florence."
Despite Doping: These athletes still have medal opportunities at Olympia in Rio
The 34-year-old Justin Gatlin was already blocked twice for dopings (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblower Julia Stepanowa is not allowed to start in Rio.
Other transmitted athletic probes can only laugh about it - they fight for medals in Rio.
The theme Doping continues to determine the headlines at the Rio Olympics.
The Russian swimmer Julija Jefimova, who had charged herself with her starting right shortly before the games after a doping lock, was mercilessly spitted out and bubbled at her start (100 meters chest).
It offered a bizarre scene: with a smile she was still proud of the hall and had provoked her appearance.
When it was established that they would not get gold, the audience broke out in a jubilant storm.
However, there are still many other athletes who, despite being doping past at the Rio Olympics, are starting.
Here's an overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100 m season/USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in athletics.
He was already detained twice for dopings (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since his ban, the 2004 Olympic winner and ex-world champion has been running even faster than before, he is the number one in the world for over 100 m in 9.80 seconds and is considered the biggest challenger of Usain Bolt.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100-m-season/Jamaika): The twice Olympic winner and seven-time world champion had to put off a six-month barrier in 2010 after showing the intake of the painkiller Oxycodon.
She had severe toothache after surgery, the 29-year-old defended herself.
Sandra Perkovic (Discus/Croatia): 2011 was the 2012 Olympic Champion, World Champion of 2013 and European Champion from 2010 to 2016 tested positively for the banned stimulant agent methylhexanamine.
Perkovic disputed the scientific intake and was detained for six months.
The four widest rolls this year go to the account of the great gold favorite.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400 m season/USA): The Beijing Olympiar and twice world champion over 400 m, had been tested positively in 2010 and blocked for 21 months.
A penis enlargement tool had been responsible, Merritt claimed.
This year the 30-year-old is over 200 and 400 m the fastest man in the world.
Ivan Tichon (Hammerwerp, Belarus): Probably hardly any athlete was recognized by so many medals afterwards.
Tichon lost his 2005 World Cup title nine years later after he was diagnosed with Testosterone doping.
The now 40-year-old also had to give up Olympic silver 2004 due to steroid dopings and the EM title 2006 because of testosterone abuse.
He returned to the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games due to a judgment of the International Sports Court (CAS).
==References====External links==
Liu Hong (20 km away, China): The world recordr and gold favorite was tested positively only in May, but was still allowed to start in Rio.
At the 29-year-old world champion, indications of the use of a banned food supplement were found, the barrier to the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA was mild and expired on 13 July.
Bombing terror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Several dead
The Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, said the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Thomas Schnöll, Friday morning.
She had suffered cutting wounds and had been treated in the hospital, but could have left them again.
She planned her home trip for the beginning of September.
Whether the further explosions on the holiday island of Phuket as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon are also affected by Austrian citizens, is not yet clear.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities, according to Schnöll.
In Hua Hin, located about 200 kilometres south of Bangkok's capital city, two bombs were first exploded on Thursday evening in an outing district.
According to police, a Thai woman had been killed and about 20 people injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutchs and three Italians.
On Friday morning, two explosives were raised again, and according to the authorities, another person was killed.
A bomb explosion was also reported by Phuket in the early morning.
At the detonation near the beach Patong, which is popular with holidaymakers, a taxi driver was injured after police reports.
In Surat Thani on the southeastern coast of the country then exploded another bomb that killed an urban employee.
According to the authorities, the detonation rate was aired in a flowerbed in front of the coast police territory.
Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-west coast as well as in Chumphon on the south-east coast claimed several injuries.
One assumes a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it was called.
"The bomb attacks carry the same manuscript," said army general Danai Kritmethavee Friday morning before journalists.
"We assume that this is a coordinated attack."
It would be too early to express itself on possible motives - but probably it was about the actions of Muslim rebels.
Thai media also wanted to identify a pattern typical of the bomb attacks of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
The Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islamic uprising or with international terrorism.
"This is only local sabotage that is limited to limited areas and provinces," said a speaker in Bangkok.
Instead, it is assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military junta.
In recent days, the authorities have received secret service notices of forthcoming attacks in the south of the country - but they have not been informed of the exact date and places.
Still unclear, which group is behind the attacks.
The police ordered their officials across the country to strengthen security around important government buildings as well as airports, railway stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.
In Thailand, there are smaller bomb attacks again and again, but they do not usually target tourists.
In Hua Hin lies a palace used for years by Thailand's king Bhumibol Adulyadej.
Following the bomb explosions now under way, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on its homepage recommends that the instructions of the Thai security authorities be followed.
High safety risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla, as well as Preah Vihear and surroundings.
After conflicts between security forces and Muslim sections of the population, it is not necessary to travel to these provinces.
Increased safety risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution prepared by the military junta.
This gives the military great influence even in the coming years.
Junta-chef and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the bombs had been an attempt to create chaos while the country was moving towards stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism.
The military unta, which had taken power in 2014 after a phase of bloody unrest, is in the best interests of itself to have led the kingdom back to stability and order.
However, the military has also failed to get hold of the Muslim rebel uprising in the extreme south of the country for years.
More than 6500 people were killed in the conflict.
About a year ago, 20 people were killed in Bangkok in an attack on a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists.
It was the bloodiest attack of the country's recent history.
The right "Identiary Movement" has been visited by the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection.
After several national offices, the Constitutional Ministers in the federal government also monitored the group.
"At the 'Identiary Movement' we see indications for efforts against the liberal democratic system," said Constitutional Protection Head Hans-Georg Maaßen of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Thus, immigrants of Islamic faith or of the Middle East are defamated in an extremist way.
That's why we're monitoring the movement.
The "Identitarian Movement" is a group of French roots, which has been active in Germany since 2012.
It turns against "multiculti-wahn", "uncontrolled mass immigration" and the "loss of one's own identity through alienation".
Constitutionalists in nine federal states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hessen, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - are already observing the "identities".
Maassen said that his authority had agreed closely with the national offices in the decision.
"Groups like the 'Identiary Movement' are trying to pick up their target group where it stands," said the head of the Constitutional Protection.
In general, extremists try to address them with youthful language, often with pop music.
It was Islamists as well as right-wing extremists.
That's not a fair commercial for your own thing.
The propaganda is supposed to touch people emotionally.
Young people are particularly vulnerable.
That's dangerous.
In recent years, there have been reports from several federal states on the contacts of the "identitarians" with AfD politicians.
Maassen said he had no idea.
For the protection of the Constitution, possible contacts of this kind would only be relevant from a certain point of view.
It depends on whether the respective party - in this case the AfD - changes its direction and becomes so extremist by certain persons who are extremist.
Therefore, it is crucial whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party.
This is not recognizable.
In view of the marked increase in right-wing crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shelters, Maaßen said that he was not yet talking about new right-wing terrorism.
But we have seen in recent years that there can be legal terrorist structures.
There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freital group.
It may well be that other legal terrorist groups or micro-groups are planning attacks against asylum seekers, refugees' homes or attacks from other far-right motives.
However, a German-wide or pan-European governance of legal terrorism is not recognizable.
The previous groups had been created at regional level or in social networks.
Concerned, Maassen expressed concern that many attacks on the account of people who had not previously appeared in the right scene were going on.
That's the worrying thing.
Many of the suspects in attacks on asylum shelters had not previously been known as criminal, politically motivated offenders or supporters of the right scene.
"Many people have thus committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right-wing extremists, who may have been politically indifferent, or who have chosen CDU, SPD or left, but who then radicalized themselves by far-right sentiment."
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte becomes the Internet hit
Not always do the Olympics or world records determine the headlines at the Olympic Games.
This shows the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habte at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro.
In the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swam so slowly that he could not be seen in the TV images at times.
He simply disappeared - no matter how far the cutout was selected.
In the social networks Habte became the viral Internet hit.
In fact, the 24-year-old finished his lead with a residue of 48 seconds and took the 59th place of 59 starters.
But it was rather his not exactly sporting figure that attracted the attention of the international media.
Why is the 24-year-old still participating in the Olympic Games?
The Ethiopian got a special start right from the international swimming association.
This is distributed to make swimming more known in under-represented countries.
Since most athletes are running in Ethopia, I just wanted to do something different.
Preparation is everything: Robel Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.
Soon the first nicknames made the round.
Some media called him "Robel der Wal".
The English Boulevard leaf "The Sun" with "Dad Bod" made fun of him, based on a "Wolstandsbauch".
His time, he only hit with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters freestyle, played no role there.
Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.
At the 2000 Sydney Olympics, the course of Eric Moussambani provided media attention.
Unforgettable was the appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea when he had to go on his own in a preliminary run over 100 meters of freestyle.
Moussambani was fired at the time.
The then 22-year-old learned to swim only eight months before Olympia and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.

Geretsried - The owner of a store at the New Square has been stolen.
According to the police, 67-year-old Geretsrieder had left her business on Monday at around 5.30 p.m. and had forgotten to close a window on the ground floor.
When she returned around 8.15 a.m. the next morning, about 250 euros disappeared from the cash desk.
Traces of the culprit could not be found.
There is also no video surveillance.
Trump does not see the threatening election defeat so closely
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at an election campaign in Florida.
If there is nothing to do with the election to the U.S. President, Donald Trump already has an alternative idea.
He's just going on a vacation.
If Donald Trump lost the U.S. presidential elections in November, he wouldn't mind: "At last it will either work, or I have a very, very nice, long holiday," said the Republican candidate in a telephone interview with the U.S. television station CNBC.
If it is not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that is all right, Trump said.
He called the US President Barack Obama and the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, the founder of the Islamic State (IS).
Within his party there was an increasing resistance at last.
Post-posting is increasing in trade with electric transporters
An electric delivery vehicle of the German Post in action.
The interest of other companies in the company is apparently great.
The Post plans to sell their electric vehicle StreetScooter, too.
The Group will soon start trading with the transporter.
The post intends to offer its electric transporters from next year also on the free car market.
"We want to get into the sale to third parties," said a post speaker on Friday.
The company has been testing for months whether to sell its self-developed StreetScooter, with which letters and packages are delivered, to other companies.
Post-Chairman Jürgen Gerdes had said that there were repeated demands, for example by craftsmen.
According to information from the news magazine "Der Spiegel", the Bonn Group is about to start mass production of the vehicles.
In the post-own production, the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift.
Gerdes had announced that the Group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and in the long term set up a complete change to the environmentally friendly vehicles.
"We will take a very, very robust step towards 2020," he said at the end of July.
I can imagine that we're changing the entire fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active on Germany's roads since 2014.
GfK leadership shall resign after disappointing business figures
The consumer research company GfK exchanges its head Matthias Hartmann.
The resignations came suddenly - but not quite surprising.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK made it clear that the chair of Chief Executive Officer Matthias Hartmann became all the more uncertain, the longer the successes he had promised were not.
Turbulence at the head of the Nürnberg market research company GfK: After again disappointing business figures and the resignation of the management, the worldwide number five of the industry is facing a new human start.
GfK Chief Executive Officer wants to leave the company at the end of the year.
The Chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board, Arno Mahlert, is already leaving the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September.
As early as September 1, the management board board member Gerhard Hausruckinger announced that the company had already taken over the management board.
He is to officially take over the function of a "Chairman" until a successor is found for Hartmann.
As a reason for the resignation, the company called "different views" on long-term business policy orientation.
Details didn't mean to mention a business speaker on Friday.
Those who will lead the market research company in the future are still unclear.
In investor circles, on Friday it was said that shareholders were at last disappointed by the outstanding successes of the restructuring that they had begun years ago.
Mr. Hartmann has been at the GfK Summit since 2011.
"The fruits of the restructuring are not yet visible after 5 years," it was said.
In view of the last bad GfK business figures, any shareholder will eventually become restless.
"If that were the case with BMW, the Quandts would do the same," it said.
After setbacks in the previous quarter, the company could not have stopped its loss journey even in the second quarter of 2016.
With 361.2 million euros, turnover was 6.1 percent below the level of the comparable quarter of the previous year.
With reference to the first half of the year, sales decreased by 3.4 percent by 721.2 million euros.
The profit in the second quarter has mainly affected the lower value of the company in view of its difficult economic situation.
The necessary corporate depreciation of 139 million euros in the Consumer Experience business unit provided the Group with a loss of 148.2 million euros.
In the second quarter of 2015, the GfK had gained a consolidated profit of 19.7 million.
Accidents - Bus slips into shrouds in graves: eight injured
On Thursday, eight people were injured in Krummhörn (Landkreis Aurich) in an accident involving 43 seniors as passengers.
Two of the inmates suffered serious injuries, reported the police.
The 66-year-old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisenach, according to her information, had to avoid an incoming truck, which was partly on the opposite road.
The bus came right from the street and slipped into a grave, as a spokesman for the Aurich/Wittmund police reported.
"Because of the location of the bus, people could not leave the bus independently," she said.
The fire brigade freed the inmates.
Six ambulances and an emergency car came to the accident site on Landesstraße 2.
The unscathed travellers were brought back by a regular bus to the Pewsum Krummhörner district.
There they should wait for a replacement bus from the travel company.
The investigators asked the truck driver and possible witnesses to report to the police.
As of 1 October 2016, the fees per cubic metre of wastewater for the waste water plant Neudorf/Reuth/Welchenkahl 3,44 euros instead of 2,10 euros; for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp 3,36 euros (previously 2.26 euros) and for Azendorf 3,64 euros (previously 2,18 euros).
At the plant in Azendorf, the waste water charge will increase again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures become necessary.
After an excess calculation, the waste water price in Azendorf will then be 4.37 euros per cubic meter.
As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, when the budget was approved by the Landratsamt Kulmbach, there were undercovers for these waste water plants.
The Kasendorf market is obliged, on the basis of legal basis, to operate the facilities cost-effectively.
As of 1 October 2016, the citizens, as well as the commercial and industrial companies from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to get deeper into the wallet.
The increases in fees are between 48 and 67 percent.
As administrative director Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the body, a recalculation of the fees for the waste water plants of the market community was necessary.
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- and undercovers should also be compensated for from the previous calculation period.
The serious increases in the fees were due to Schmidt’s fact that all three waste water plants were relatively small facilities with a very low wastewater attack, which was between 6800 and 12,000 cubic metres per year.
For example, due to the low distribution base, expenditure on necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.
In addition, waste water generated in all three plants has been slightly reduced.
Furthermore, during the previous calculation period, all three plants were affected to a considerable extent due to their age of rehabilitation and repair costs.
The plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the facilities for Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years old.
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced in the Azendorf waste water plant due to a damage.
At the Welchenkahl pump plant, the almost 20-year-old conveyor systems had to be overburdened from the ground up and the Lopp pond-clearing plant had to be dredging the first sewage pond after nearly 20 years of operation, the sewage sludge disposed of and an additional ventilation possibility installed in order to comply with the water law requirements in the future.
Schmidt: "These extraordinary expenses included the continued maintenance and maintenance costs to be taken into account in the new calculation period."
The same applies to electricity costs which were still significantly below the current level in the previous calculation in 2011/2012.
Steinhäuser made it clear that in the case of the small wastewater attack in the three plants, the costs for the operation and maintenance "slamble fully".
In addition to Schmidt, the market community has been spared from major entertainment costs in the wastewater plants over the past 20 years.
The situation for these plants would remain precarious, according to Steinhäuser, since the supply area of the Friesenbachtal waste water network could not be expanded by these plants because they are deficient facilities.
Bulgaria first recorded inflation in 8 months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% on a monthly basis in July.
This is the highest value (since June 2012) and the first over zero since October last year, when positive 0.2% were recorded.
The annual average inflation of the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared with the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was as measured by the CPI -0.8 %.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 was -0.2% compared to July 2015.
In July 2016, a price increase of the following consumer goods was observed compared to the previous month: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); leisure and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); various goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in the case of clothing and shoes (2.2%); furniture, household appliances and routine maintenance (0.5%); health (0.1%).
Prices remained as in the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco; flats, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communication; and education unchanged.
Snapchat criticised "Anime" effect as an Asian cartoon
Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races.
With its filter tool, Snapchat enables around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that is already bound by absurdity.
You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be paintings from a Roy Lichtenstein.
The filters are unspoiled, property-distorting tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All missteps come to the public.
Snapchat filters have in the past attracted criticism in which they have been accused that the Blackface app would promote or promote white skin as a beauty ideal.
This week, when some users suggested a filter that gave them slicing eyes, false teeth and stunned cheeks, some critics called it a racist cartoon of Asians - "yellow face".
They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a larger problem that the company had with diversity.
The news and the outrage were widely spread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced that it would have disabled the feature.
The company apologized: the filter was a homage to anime characters and not a cartoon of Asians.
But outsiders who experienced racism reminded the filter of hurting clichés.
Others strongly rejected the anime comparison.
In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student, wrote, whose tweets were widely spread over the photos, that the filter was "injurious and laden said to be unpleasant."
She added that "it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very gruesome Asian caricature and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow-sighted, but that the yellow face has been pulled into the devaluating extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company to cross this cultural wire.
American culture seems to be involved in an endless struggle for diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in our hands.
And Snapchat's great audience of young people – who are more diverse in race than their older counterparts – could rather expect sensitivity to be expected.
If one of Snapchat's filters creates an image that is offensive to a user, "so it's much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed than they used to be," said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account called on others to do the same.
In an essay for medium and in a telephone interview, she said that she believed that racial controversy reflected a lack of diversity in the recruitment practices at Snapchat.
Zhu criticized the mostly white, only male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"Either they don't have a variety of representations of people with different skin colors in their workforce, so they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors who work there but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say something about it."
Others share their opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has largely left unanswered.
The company does not publish any figures on the diversity of its workforce and indicates its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees, but according to a speaker, the company has recently recruited a staff officer who focuses on under-represented groups and on internal integration efforts.
Zhu said, for her part, that she would leave her Snapchat account closed and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to be able to say that this is not O.K.."
Military management fake ISIS intelligence information, determines Congress Committee
Military members of the United States Central Command changed intelligence to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when it allowed the actual state on the ground, reported a Congress investigative committee in a report on Thursday.
The provisional report, prepared by a task force of Republican members of the Armed Forces Committee, intelligence commissions and the Wehrbudget Committee, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments of American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.
The Central Command, Cencom in short, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"News service information, which was typically turned off by high-ranking Centcom commanders, regularly provided a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism than it had allowed the actual conditions on the ground and were consistently more positive than analyses of other intelligence services," a newspaper article quoted the report.
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when poor analyses are presented to our political leaders," said Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives.
The leadership errors in the Centcom range to the top of the organization.
The 10-page report shows in detail persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi armed forces.
Although there is no direct evidence that government leaders under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts were exposed to the pressure of their prelaws to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic state, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, opinions and statements before Congress were significantly more positive than the facts," the report noted.
For example, a Centcom member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossul could start in April or May 2015.
Mossul, second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigations, so much is clear." said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in an opinion.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the Central Command's leaders changed the intelligence reports to reduce the risk posed by ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans launched the Task Force after they were told that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.
The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed information as the investigations continue.
In addition, further investigations of the Centcom reports are under way by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Defence.
On Thursday, Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings, which were consistent with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
"In 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly limited process for drawing up intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," announced the senior Democrat in the committee, member of the Adam B. Schiff House of Representatives, in an opinion.
This process, Mr. Schiff says, "slowed the publication of intelligence reports," damaged the morale among analysts and "gave excessive room for divergent opinions."
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats indicated that they had not found any evidence of the White House's intervention with the Centcom analysts regarding a "determined political opinion".
The preliminary results of the Congress investigations were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast".
Last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon General Inspector General, who were recorded after Centcom analysts’ complaints.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon press officer, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on Congress reports while the General Inspector's investigations were still under way.
But he also stated that "experts sometimes have quite divergent opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence."
The investigations have implications beyond the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).
However, last year's accusations raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
The criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State reminds us of conflicts of more than ten years ago when a Centcom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a paper on how the government under George W. Bush, contrary to the recommendations of many analysts, had only a small crew in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting on the Islamic State.
Last year, Mr. Hooker's team, according to government authorities, noted that, contrary to government statements, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State would not have a significant impact on the terrorist group's financial situation, as these provisional refineries would have put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market.
However, this recognition was not published, the Times reported in September.
Centcom's former commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the Legislatives for his overly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at the Central Command.
The USA wins fourth match in women's field hockey, a showdown with Great Britain is ahead
One day after she had shot three goals over Japan during a 6-1 victory, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3-0.
Five goals in two games should actually be a memorable achievement, but Bam (27) said she couldn't remember having ever done that.
"I have no idea." she said.
I'm not one of the people who keep their gates in mind.
However, she knows this: The Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are in the same position in her group with the British in the first place, which after their 2-0 victory against Japan remains unbeatable.
United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter final, the game will decide which of the two will win first and second place within their group from six teams.
The first place will leave the strong Dutch women a little longer out of the way that the other group leads.
However the game may go on Saturday, the Americans have caused a surprising whirlwind by their success story, four years after they ended up in the last 12 places at the last London Games.
Bam was part of this team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and for the first time at the age of three she had a hockey bat in her hands (her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), and at the age of 16 she became a US national player, the youngest in the team's history.
She missed the Olympic Games in 2008 because she could not qualify for the cadre.
Then came the year 2012, in which everything went wrong for her and her team.
In the following year, Craig Parnham, an English coach of the national team, began to turn things to the better.
"A cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam.
We didn't have the workpensum in London we now have.
We've been able to tear the row all the way around.
On Thursday evening, Bam opened the Torreigen in the first half of the game with a backlash from the nearby area.
India had gone into the game without winning in the tournament, but the team showed up surprisingly tough and held the match level from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.
She performed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then pulled into the middle and aired the ball in the gate to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.
The Shutout was the first of the entire tournament for the U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who had to book a goal in each of the previous games.
She's got a run.
Just like Bam.
"We are in a good position," said Parnham, but how well will depend on the result of the next game on Saturday.
In the midst of the oar of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the Trampoline
Wherever you are, no matter how late it is, it's the Olympic Games.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inevitable, a fast-paced season run between competition and pursuit.
It is as if the Olympic torch itself was a burning staff, which is sent from the armbrush to the swimmer to the turner for triathlete.
You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor in the queue in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is at the Olympic Games for the first time and is a women's swarm with dimples, could have been among these well-known names that are sent to the Prime Time, built up by sponsors and well-being TV advertising if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even fighter.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic trampoline turns.
The Olympic flame does not light every event at the same time.
Further from the center, partly in the shade, are the sports that are not generally recognized: air guns shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We will always have the breast-swimming and may it reign for a long time.
But if I could modestly make arguments for my particular favorite, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000 when it was made in Sydney, it has been so sparsely perceived for the last 16 years that many of those I had asked did not know it was an Olympic sport at all.
This could also be regional ignorance.
Although the U.S. sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in trampoline jumping and had an athlete until 2012.
The Chinese and Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
Trampoline jumping has a certain outer charm, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unexplained ear for a clown school than it sounds for the Olympic Games.
At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an earth-bound enthusiast.
It has humorous potential - the cartoon-like tremor of its never-ending impact - as well as the Grazie des gymnastics and diving, the two sports that essentially unite it.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as "springboard."
Ascent winners jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to land a number of falling movements (driving, hedges and saltos) before they land on their feet.
They are evaluated according to official Olympic program according to execution, difficulty and "airtime".
Twenty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.
In their quest for gold, medal hopeers must continue, faster, up and over, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and forth, up and down on the playground.
They are not only hunting the finish line or the starting wall, but also another mocking goal in television transmission: the one of the world or the Olympic record.
The goal-oriented pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatical - and it is enough to even stir a viewer.
But it's also what I feel as a little tiring when I watch these games.
The trampoline offers a breathing break.
The vector of the trampoline jumper is above.
A forward movement is not the goal.
He or she jumps off, apparently heavy like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up.
Also here there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.
It is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be.
Women's qualification and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon, in the streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men's on Saturday, also at 13.00.
NBC will broadcast the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00.
In the middle of the Olympic Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in general tumult.
If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the angifting and objectification of male athletes - as the male US tournaments according to The Wall Street Journal recently suggest - then Mr. Dooley expects his new fan community to be airborne.
"A generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the USA
Violent Protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrations calling for political change in Ethiopia met with violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say that dozens of protesters were killed during the conflict with the police during gun changes.
Is Ethiopia crashing right now?
In the last ten years, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.
But in recent months, protests against the government have shaken the country and spread into more and more areas.
Last week thousands of people stormed on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.
According to human rights organisations, the government’s response was merciless.
Witnesses reported that police shot and killed on dozens of unarmed demonstrators.
Video in circulation about the protests probably from the last or the beginning of this year show security people beating young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a stand against a wall.
The head of the UN Human Rights Authority now requires an in-depth investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, project manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is estimated by the West.
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorist threats beyond the region, especially in Somalia. Few countries in Africa, if any, receive so much Western aid.
Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.
Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuting train in the capital Addis Ababa.
The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organizations have constantly led the government to suppress it - the opposition in the country was restricted, effectively silenced dissidents.
Many were sent to exile or prison, killed or driven into the desert.
But that could change.
"If you suppress people and have no other options except to protest, it breaks out," said Seyom Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia.
The whole youth protests.
One generation protests.
There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to grip on the power of the ruling coalition.
After a widely criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions rise along the border with Eritrea; a struggle for this delicate, controversial line took hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogade, who have been more or less defeated in recent years, could take advantage of turbulence and rearm themselves.
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness now explode after years of pre-heating under the surface.
The first seems harmless: smartphones.
Only in recent years have many Ethiopians been able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones became more frequent and the Internet services improved.
Even if the government is blocking access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially at protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they are staying.
Several young Ethiopians indicated that they were gathering together to protests.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
Since Eonen, the Amharas, who come from most of the Christian highlands of Ethopia, promulgated in politics and economy while exploiting the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and live in flatland areas.
But this too is changing.
"We are in the process of coordinating under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The largest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tiğ ethnic group, which account for about 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in the military, in the secret services, in trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was the Prime Minister of Ethiopia until his death from an unpublicized disease in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.
Analysts say that he was particularly adorned in experiencing early signs of dissatisfaction and using EUSRs to deal with opponents and to make them harmless.
"The current regime lacks this basic skill," said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected for relatively opaque reasons to take up Mr Meles' position.
Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of security services controlled by Tigray.
Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such a riot was in 2005, after thousands protested against elections that, according to the figures of analysts, were apparently pumped by the government and then stolen.
Many protesters were killed during the next Raccia, even though it was less than in recent months and this time of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new donor train, as well as for their measurable progress in the fight against poverty.
But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the internal disfavor of the Ethiopian government.
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, an amharic city, attacked Tiğ-led shops, and the hatred of Tigray is becoming increasingly common in social media.
Analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.
The U.S. government used Ethiopia as the basis for drone flights across neighboring Somalia, even though it recently reported that it had closed this base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile area.
"This," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin mooring."
Donald Trump explains his claim that Obama had founded ISIS was "Sarkasmus"
Donald J. Trump tried on Friday to scatter the last controversy that surrounds his campaign by stating that his repeated claim, President Obama and Hillary Clinton, would have been the "founders" of the Islamic terrorist group, had not been meant seriously.
This clarification raised new questions about the communication capabilities of the Republicans' presidential candidate, whether he was able to communicate clearly and understandably with the American public.
It also brings its competitors, who are trying to protect him during an eventful phase, into the peculiar position of having to explain statements that he could not have meant.
After making the indication at an election campaign event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump ruled back on Thursday's allegation and insisted on interviews that he really did not intend to suggest that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
But in an early morning Tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.
The Tweet was the opposite to the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews that he meant the accusation perfectly serious.
When conservative radio moderator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama was trying to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate didn't want to know about it.
The last storm of criticism is on Mr. Trump, while he has tried to direct the focus of his campaign because of falling survey values to the economic situation.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton gave speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.
Reporting on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he had found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already presented sarcasm for his defense.
At the end of July, he drew strong criticism when he said that the Russians were supposed to hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he said, "Of course, I meant this sarcastic."
This method allows Mr. Trump to move the linguistic boundaries in politics and then row back as needed.
"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans, how they arrive, and then, if necessary, to "clear" according to how the reaction fails." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert observing the language of both candidates.
But I also believe that he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.
Instead of depressing the tone for the presidential elections, Mr Trump has adopted an even more appalling tone, as his survey values have continued to decline.
A new survey by NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Friday, showed a leading lead in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally tries not to apologize for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misinterpreting his humor.
But while he is increasingly in the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's joke has brought his loyal competitors into the uncomfortable situation to stand to him, regardless of how provocative his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent advocates, made great efforts to defend the candidates today in a CNN interview of Thursday.
"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," said Mr. Giuliani, who was asked about the accuracy of Mr. Trump's statements as to whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called it a backbench, completely wrong and therefore it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Foreign Minister, the government allowed ISIS to spread by failing to bring the situation under aggressive control in the Middle East.
Before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and told them to ride around on each of his words and be prejudiced against him.
He mocked the "poor, miserable" television experts trying to understand him and said, "You can't!".
Some of the democrats ridiculed Mr. Trump's apologies as just another proof that he was not suitable for the presidential office.
Once out of the market price, Café returns to Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a dirty café in Williamsburg, where you could only pay cash that had no Wi-Fi but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the prices from his Bedford Avenue shop front were suppressed.
The Soap Cherie business, which replaced the verb in summer 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
Locals mourned it as the last loss in a moving city.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is a change, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is excluded and Verb is now a soap shop."
But if New York is a change, it's also a new invention.
A revived Verb Cafe opened in Greenpoint last November, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same employees and a similar simple atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing employee of the old café, who owns and manages the new café.
He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When a customer offered him to make money available for a new office, he was excited to do it, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot.
Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment.
He introduced new ingredients.
On the menu are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are yarns such as capers and sautés.
There are natural rice bowls.
The café no longer serves beer, for which there are fresh juices.
After nine months Rodriguez said he noticed a constant stream of old regular customers.
"Many old customers were also driven out by Williamsburg prizes," he said.
Recently on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, once lived in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly.
Even after she had moved to Greenpoint, she would take the road.
After the verb had closed, she gave up the coffee drink for a while, she said.
"I became aware that it was the coffee and the culture in the verb I liked," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, even if she ordered a blended chai tea on that day instead of her usual Iced coffee, which is another new addition.
Tom Rosenthal has been another long-standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003.
He went there before work and inevitably always ordered the same thing.
"I came in quarter after seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch, and they're preparing my everything bag with butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and include new ingredients in the menu.
Today Rosenthal still receives his usual order, but sometimes he changes his everything bowl with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said that he didn't want to make a grudge about the soap business taking over the old business space.
In fact, the owners of the Soap Cherie offered to produce a special soap for verb with the cold-brown coffee of the café as an ingredient.
"I think we're still going to deal with her offer," said Rodriguez.
And the traditional Polish inhabitants of Greenpoint have also accepted the café.
A new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said that he intends to exhibit it soon so that his new neighbors feel welcome.
The location also has other advantages.
A local juice store wants to fill and sell the cold-brown coffee in the bottles.
There is a chance that the café will expand to a neighboring building.
For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a common scholar and said that he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed.
When the new café opened, Whitt said that entering the site and ordering a new coffee felt like a return home.
"I had to smell that," he said.
The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a rich meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his rise to the President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt had a flaw for refined delicatessen of Fifth Avenue such as Pâte de foie grass and Maryland water turtle soup.
His menu on this day was a little more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, potato purée and a plum pudding as dessert.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat."
The couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coes' last book "Chop Suey" was about Chinese cuisine in the USA, while Ziegelman in her book "97 Orchard" tells about living in a residence on the Lower East side from the food perspective.
Her latest collaboration, "A decent meal", which will appear on Tuesday at the Harper publishing house, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, snorkelless snack in the Flatiron District, which has been in the business since the stock exchange crash in 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, eaten turkey with potato purée and vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered hackbread, the couple found this appropriate for a discussion about eating in the era of great depression.
"Rearable foods were very popular," Ziegelman said.
There was peanut bread, liver cheese and beans.
They were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap that extends the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve as dinner.
Coe bordered.
"It must have been in the stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American household, especially in rural areas, an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Teams of women bought for male field workers and it was served freshly baked pasta for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the first world war. "A Square Meal" records the ways the country was dealing with not being the slaring country anymore.
"It was a time when food became a central, tense topic for the Americans," Coe welcomed why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
The new budget diet was just as tense: mysterious food such as bread and cashrolls became basic foods, the cashroll as "a wonderful way to reuse food remains," Ziegelman noted, as cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dry fruit.
Meat, which has been the center of American cuisine for years, has become a rarely served luxury.
Unique mixtures were tried out, as a calorie-rich and nutritious satisfaction had priority over taste or even healthy kitchen mind.
During her research for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from this epoch, baked onions with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a popular addition to lunch," says Coe.
Ziegelmann continues: "It was surreal."
Peanut butter and baked onions do not fit together.
It was typical of many of the domestic recipes.
As never before, or since then, household economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - were driving the country’s eating habits in this way.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "household politicians" and to meet the challenge of turning pamps like creamy spaghetti into delicious meals with carrots.
"A Square Meal" is a festival of historical treats.
In particular, the reports on the government's response to the hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoovers Lass-mich-Küchen-Essen-Haltung, are tasty.
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farmhouse kitchen of his kitchen, he fed like the million-severe man of the world he became.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," said Coe.
He ate in an almost gold-plated dining room and wore a tuxedo.
He was a wonderful reality stranger.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not asked him to stand an example with his stomach.
As described in the book, the hire of a housekeeper with no interest in flavors by Mrs Roosevelt led the White House to produce the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most insolently prepared."
Many of the species from the era of great depression to deal with food were rejected as soon as the land got back on its feet.
The legacy lies in our continued focus on calories and food, said Ziegelman, as well as on how science has been applied to food.
When writing the book, the couple stated that they had better understood the eating habits of Ziegelman’s mother - in - law mother - in - law, for example, how she could not throw away food.
"She had a real fear of wasting food," said Coe.
Ziegelman remembered, "She actually made people sick."
There was the windbag incident.
After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg's, they and Coe made a dessert that they had prepared at home: the plum food that President Roosevelt ate at lunch.
"It's called Prune Whip," said Ziegelman, adding that it was a common trick to miss modest recipes a hot name.
There was no whipped cream, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Each one plunged a little reluctantly into the tough, brown glbber.
Amazingly, it didn't taste bad.
Coe got a supplement three times.
Like a can-do-budgeter, he said to his wife, "Some hacked walnuts would help."
Killed in bombing attack: He was the hero of Aleppo
He put his own life at risk to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to people in Syria.
He risked everything to save the lives of others.
Now the 30-year-old has even died in a vascular bomb attack by the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the "White Helmets", a civil protection group that, according to Bild-Zeitung, saved nearly 60,000 people.
2900 volunteers risk their own lives to draw people from broken homes and to provide first aid in the war area.
They are the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: a video of the civil protectionist showing him in an 11-hour rescue of a infant from the ruins of a house in 2014 was about the world.
It made the Syrian a shining symbol in the horror of war.
However, as heroes he never saw himself, according to the picture, said: "For me this is the real Jihad."
"When I die saving lives, I think God sees in me a martyr."
Shortly before Omar himself fell victim to an attack, he had spoken in a video about the last bombing attacks in Syria.
The helicopters dropped four barrel bombs over the Alzadia district, one was filled with chlorine gas.
A woman and two children died, seven people suffer from breathing distress.
"We now eliminate the toxic remains of the bomb, so that children do not play with it," the picture quotes his last words before he died.
The deadly bomb of the Assad regime should have met terrorists.
Greenlandhai: The oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old
Rare sight.
Greenland sharks usually come to the surface only in winter.
After an investigation on board the Sanna research ship, this shark was allowed to return to the sea.
He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km/h through the North Atlantic - to this day.
Greenland sharks only get young at the age of 150.
Often the Greenlandhai swims along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it reaches an average distance of just 1,220 meters.
Only when it comes to it, the five-metre-long animal accelerates to full 2.6 km/h - and at this maximum speed is half as fast as a seal.
However, this lifestyle, characterized by slowness, seems to be a patent recipe for a high age.
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues in the journal "Science" at least report a Greenland shark that could be 392 years old.
"Insanity", comments Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates.
Although the evolutionary biologist had long suspected that Greenland sharks would become stone old.
Only the evidence was missing.
Greenland sharks are hard to observe, and they eventually live mainly in the ice sea off the thinly populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.
Because they prefer water temperatures around six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in winter.
Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland sharks.
They measure their pace of time when they equipped six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitzbergen.
However, these sharks make prey: In the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.
They may hunt sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice sea and search for cadavers torving down from higher water layers.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues were now studying 28 Greenland sharks that took fishermen from Greenland or Svalbard between 2010 and 2013 as by-catch from the bottom of the North Atlantic.
The smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long, while the largest 502 centimetres were measured.
To determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens core of the shark with the carbon-14 method.
This centre of the eye lens arises even before the birth of sharks, the proteins contained therein are no longer renewed later.
The two smallest sharks had a striking amount of carbon-14 in the lens core.
Its birth should therefore be after the early 1960s when nuclear weapons attempts found greater amounts of this radioactive carbon sluggish into the atmosphere.
In contrast, the third smallest animal at 220 cm in length contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons experiments, so it is expected that in 2012 it celebrated its 50th birthday.
All larger Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14-mengens in their lens core, resulting from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, for a 493-centimetre long Greenland shark, the carbon 14-clock showed an age of 335, while the record shark with 502 centimetres is expected to be 392 years old.
The fact that Greenlandhai females only get young ones when they are longer than four meters was known.
Now the researchers of the length could assign an age.
Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres was probably at the threshold to sexual maturity and its age was determined at 156 years, Greenland sharks with the propagation are obviously at least one and a half centuries old.
This too is expected to be the world record for vertebrates.
The fact that such methuses live in icy waters is not a coincidence.
The previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale, in which a 120-year-old harpoon tip was attached to the neck, was also caught in Alaska.
Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on spa flames.
So they mature later - and age slower.
In addition, in order to keep warm in cold water, the animals often become particularly large.
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface through which the animal loses heat.
The heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much greater than with a gram of elephant.
Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.
"A smaller animal therefore lives more dangerously and should concentrate on having as many offspring as possible as possible early as possible," explains Evolution's biologist Scheuerlein.
A very large animal, on the other hand, should invest its resources in a long life.
Construction ground in a double pack
In the recent meeting, the municipal council focused on issues relating to construction.
With ease, the panel accepted the announcement from Mayor Robert Putz that "at last the marketing of the recently designated residential areas can begin".
The sale of land in the residential areas "Strasselweg" and "Schönau-West" (Binderstraße - Extension Section 1) is no longer in the way of the sale of land, plotting and development questions and applications.
The municipal council is convinced that the building areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schönau address young families and courageous seniors alike.
As it was said, building volunteers can immediately report to the town hall, and the municipal council is expected to advise in its September meeting.
In order also to meet requests for the establishment of further commercial enterprises, linked to job creation, the municipal council decided to amend the land use plan in sub-areas only in the spring of this year.
In the field of under-time workers, the industrial area already designated there is expanded by two plots towards state road 2112.
Frankfurt Benefits From Brexit
Thus, in competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg, the city on the Main has the best opportunities to attract relocated jobs and companies from London.
"It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Brexit Vottum," says Michael Voigtländer, Head of the Financial Markets and Real Estate Markets competence field of the IW.
According to the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether money houses may continue to operate from London from financial operations across the EU.
For the so-called EU passport, they have so far been authorised in the UK.
It's just using big US banks.
Several banks have already announced moving jobs.
The lobby association "Frankfurt Main Finance" expects 10,000 new jobs on the Main within five years.
For Frankfurt, says the IW, the headquarters of the European Central Bank (ECB), which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro area, as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Supervisory Board EIOPA and the ESRB Risk Board.
In Paris, although the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is headquartered, it is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB.
"The proximity to the central bank is important for banks, as they can communicate directly with the supervision," says IW professor Voigtländer.
Luxembourg is home to a large fund industry, but it is also worse off in infrastructure, as is Dublin.
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport.
The city also has easy-to-use commercial properties.
"In Paris it is not so easy to find free high-quality offices," Voigtländer says.
At the Seine, rents for first-class commercial properties are also 50 percent higher than on the Main.
In addition, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure, as well as less crime.
In a ranking of the business consultancy Mercer, the city is in place seven, Luxembourg in place 19, Dublin in place 33 and Paris in 37th place.
Although quality of life is a question of preference: "With its already strong position as a financial location for the European internal market, Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors," the IW follows.
London, however, will remain the most important financial centre in Europe, the economic researchers believe.
In London, according to figures of the Landesbank Helaba, around 4400 people worked in the banking industry at the end of 2015, and in Frankfurt there were 62500.
Gilead receives legal costs from Hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
One U.S. official decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbursement of legal costs incurred by the Hepatitis C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was released from a $200 million compensation for the violation of two Merck patents, which were related to the blockbuster medications Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead, after a US judge discovered a pattern of misbehaviour on the part of Merck, including mine and other unethical actions.
When the action was brought on Thursday, U.S. judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead is entitled to the cost incurred during the defense of the case.
Merck tries to match Gilead, which dominates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed property for laboratory work based on Sophosbuvir, the active ingredient in the medications of Gilead.
United States-backed troops say that they have regained full control of Manbi from the Islamic State
Supported by the USA, the full control of the northern city of Manbij has recovered near the Turkish border after the last ISIS fighters in the city have left them, said a speaker of the group on Friday.
The Democratic Forces of Syria (DKS) are coming through after the withdrawal of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves inside the city, currently the city.
They freed over 2,000 civilians who were held hostages by the fighters, told Sharfan Darwish of Manby's army council Reuters, allied with the DKS.
"The city is now under perfect control, but we are just doing cleaning," he told Reuters.
Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal taxes
Hillary Clinton published its 2015 tax declaration, which resulted in an income of USD 10.75 million for the presidential presidential candidate and her husband and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2%.
In 2015, Clinton's USD 1 million donated for charitable purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton generated almost USD 5.3 million in redundancies; the former Foreign Minister announced an income of USD 3 million from Simon & Schuster's book on her term of office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's candidate for the Vice-Presidentship, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, together with his wife Anne Holton, has published his tax statements for the last ten years.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards on financial transparency," said Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri in an opinion.
In a stark contrast to this, Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and withdrawals regarding his previous promises to publish his tax statements.
It is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations, although they are not obliged by law to do so.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have given a tax check by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal.
"You are on the train," wrote Clinton's campaign assistant Ian Sams on Twitter, regarding the publication of the presidential presidential candidate.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump's Special Advisor, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish something until the tax audits were completed.
Trump's critics, including the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, have already announced that his refusal raises questions regarding assets, his donations for charitable organizations, his business gestures and various other connections, especially with Russia.
Clinton has already addressed the subject and published a video on Friday in which high-ranking Republican Trump asks for his tax statement to be published.
On Thursday she also addressed the subject during a speech on the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in the last decades and to publish his tax statements." she said to the crowd.
Politico has reported that Trump paid no or very little tax for two years during the 1990s, and a New York Times economic journalist quoted on Friday a number of tax lawyers and tax advisors stating that this could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become a topic in the campaign.
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that people who earn more than USD 1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During an election campaign for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate is based here, called Trump to a meeting to exchange their tax returns.
Buffett said he was also subject to an IRS tax check and Trump had "anxiety" before the voters and not before the tax authorities.
Clinton's campaign has published tax returns until 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid on average an effective federal tax rate of about 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5%.
The 2015 Clinton tax declaration showed that these only accounted for USD 100 of their income as wages, unlike most of all Americans.
Its main investment was a low-cost index fund, from which Clinton's dividends and revenues of USD 109,000 taxed.

Condomes with chili powder, promote fireworks Tanzania's elephant protection
Protectors in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from going in people's inhabited settlements - they throw condoms on them filled with chili powder.
The method has proved to be effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had the idea years ago, has, together with the U.S. Nature Conservation, intensified its support by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania, using a nonviolent four-step method to protect their homes and crops without harming animals.
Previously, many spears used to defend themselves.
Friday is world elephant day dedicated to animal welfare.
"Since we have developed the toolkit, we have been able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities, and they are much more confident that they can keep the elephants from their fields without harming the elephants," said Honeyguide Damian Bell in a statement.
The first two steps include lighting the elephant with a torch and blowing into a horn.
If he's not scared, a so-called "Chili cloud" will be thrown.
Chili powder mixed with earth is packed together with a fireworks body into a condom whose end is turned to the line of ignition.
When it is lit, the condom bursts with a bang and sprays fine dust to chili powders into the air.
A touch is usually already out to chase the elephant.
One last possibility is a thrower that shoots a gold rain fireworks into the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
Town Council unanimously decides: No kiosk new building on St. Goarer Rheinufer
Normally, the St. Goarer accept investment projects by merchants with a kiss hand - the retail trade in the core city is considered to be clearly expandable.
However, the city council now unanimously rejected the request for the new construction of a sales ski box on the Rhine shores in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine Balmon.
"As a matter of principle, we welcome new traders, but this kiosk does not fit into this location in an exposed location on the Rhine shores," Michael Hubrath explained for the CDU fraction.
Jewish Director beats Berlin's hotel because Israeli preselection was removed after "Arab" call - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots unraveled a media uproar after betraying that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israel's pre-election, as according to one employee, Arab guests had "requested".
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentation "Shoah" released his trouble at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel's country preselection list.
However, the country was not listed between the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
In 2016, how is it possible in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and deleted?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinksi Bristol offers an opportunity to select Israel via its own call center.
Looking for an explanation, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he received there "shocked him", as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel staff said that the measure was "an intentional decision of the management of the Kempinski Hotels."
The reason behind it caused even more anger in the director.
"Most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre-election be deleted," Lanzmann's employee was quoted.
The Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a "great shame", reports the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
We were appalled and disturbed by this event.
It's really very embarrassing.
The fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is an even greater shame.
There's no need for an explanation.
We expect the hotel to "draw the right conclusions," said the official.
The incident triggered a fairly large response on the Internet, where people called it a scandal.
Some suggested to the Kempinski Hotel that it would have "rendered" the alleged calls of Arab guests.
"Sorry," said another contribution, pointing out that the hotel, located on the noble Kurfürstendamm, is near a synagogue.
The hotel quickly rejected all accusations of itself and called the incident a "accident" and "apologized" with Lanzmann, reports Der Spiegel.
"There was never a direct instruction", Israel did not include in the quick dial list," the Süddeutsche Zeitung quoted a speaker of the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the country preselection has now been added.
Police use tear gas & rubber shots against protesting Brazilian students
On Thursday, students met with the police on Thursday in the Brazilian city of São Paulo when they gathered to demonstrate against government reforms for the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber shots against the demonstrators.
The difficulties began when police officers tried to disperse the students, causing the police to use rubber shots and tear gas.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their dismay over the plans.
According to the proposals of the governor of the state of São Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, a little less than 100 public schools are closed, while 300,000 students are implemented to save money.
Some of the protestants were seen to spray graffitits against the provisional President Michel Temer on walls.
The recent protests took place a few days after demonstrators went to the streets in order to support the suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who had been expelled from office by a vote of the Senate.
Trade between Russia and Iran suddenly increases to 71% - RT Business
With the lifting of sanctions, according to the Russian ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, the trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran grew by 70.9% each year.
Since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, interest on the part of Russian companies in business in the country has grown strongly, the ambassador has informed.
Russian companies establish existing links with Iran, while new companies are willing to access the market.
Of course, further trade development is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," said Dzhagaryan.
He noted that trade sales between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9% in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $ 856 million.
In particular, Russian imports to Iran increased by 91.5 percent and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The trade upturn was achieved by supplies of machines, land vehicles and weapons," said the Ambassador.
For this year, Dzhagaryan assumes a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia.
Last year, the Russian foreign representation issued around 35,000 visas, mainly travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
Iran also reached the top 20 of the countries with regard to the number of tourists in Russia.
One could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year are being broken," he said.
At the same time, only relatively few Russians visit Iran, something the ambassador hopes it will change.
"I personally can recommend the visit of the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have received monuments of ancient Persian civilization in a good condition," he said.
Witnesses searched: Drink market in Waldbröl attacked
A robbery was committed on Thursday evening to the beverage market of Rewe XXL on the Waldbröler Gerberstraße.
With the help of a gun, three dark-dressed people who had disguised their faces demanded the release of cash from the employee of the beverage market and then fled first on foot and then probably with a silver-colored VW-golf.
The police don't report how much money was exploited.
The perpetrators are supposed to have been between 1.60 and 1.70 meters in size, that is, relatively small.
The beverage market is directly accessible from the park deck of the Rewe market and is poorly visible.
The perpetrators must have run in the direction of Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg and fled from the Schotterparkplatz, which is located opposite the park entrance, with the silver-coloured car, possibly towards B 256 (Schladernring).
Anyone who has made observations at the time of his action (as at 7.45 p.m.) that are related to the robbery is expected to report urgently to the police.
Nagold: Play and fun in summer
Eight beautiful and happy days the children and young people of the social pedagogical group/social group work of the Kinderschutzbund Nagold spent with their caregivers at their summer break in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
In the quiet recreation home Hardtwäldle, the lively group was quantified during the first week of school holidays.
Several full-day trips were on the program.
On the one hand, we went to boards with a visit to the petting zoo.
On the other hand, to Maulbronn, where there was a special children's tour in the world famous monastery.
The third trip led to Pforzheim.
In the Celtenmuseum in Hochdorf, the group learned much about the daily life and the food of the Celts.
On the hot days, the group at the Deep Lake in Maulbronn, which is invited to jump, swim and planks.
Culinary children and caretakers were spoiled with their self-prepared body food such as the acid spättel, the Seebronner Pfännle, Iselshauser-Bloff, the English-Breakfast and Tübingen Bolognese.
In workshops, battled, beautiful jewels were created from pearls and stones or made of wood a Roman mill game.
Other highlights of leisure were fishing in a nearby pond, the evenings on the fire and the final "Bunty Evening".
On the day of the trip home, the sun laughed and the children and young people returned home satisfied.
Haigerloch: Pilgrims to the gate of mercy
The ministrants from the soul care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were traveling on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.
Four stages were completed together.
In order to bridge the time to the next Rome pilgrimage of all ministrants in probably two years, the Oberverwaltungsrounde St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.
Several pilgrimage goals were examined and were finally decided upon for the bishop city of Freiburg, where this year on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy with the gate of mercy opened to this purpose at Freiburg Münster was offered a special target of pilgrims.
16 minis from Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and Heiligenzimmeren were on their way.
In the evening before, the parish priest Storost sent out the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrim crosses and gave the pilgrims the message.
From Horb there was a train ride to the starting point of Villingen, where there is also a Münster of Our Lady and so the pilgrimage path was taken from Münster.
The individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening by a short impulse with various prayers, songs and scriptures.
On the go, however, the minis at field crosses, chapels or churches always rested to sing a song from their own compiled pilgrim songbook.
The parish homes of the local parishes were available for the nights.
Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty as well as strengthening dinner and breakfast.
On the second day it was about Furtwangen to Gütenbach.
Days later, the stage after St. Peter, which was the most strenuous roadway, had to first descend about 500 metres in gay heat and then climb again.
The deserved reward was a common barbecue at the Badweiher in the evening.
After the morning pulse on the fourth pilgrimage day in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter, the final stage went to Freiburg.
The minis arrived at Freiburg's Münster in the afternoon in a visual light and happy way, and entered the gate of mercy.
With a small impulse, God was thanked here.
At the evening fair in Münster, the minis by cooperator Markus Obert arrived at the destination of the pilgrim.
After the service, the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.
The next day was time for the Breisgaumetropole.
In the afternoon it went by train back to Horb.
Finally, all participants agreed that the days were marked by spirituality and a strong community experience.
Schotte Callum Skinner storms home when British Gold wins for cycling
Scotland's Callum Skinner made his way to fame last night in the men's team sprint in the Velodrome in Rio, when the British team defended London's 2012 title.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor role that his countryman Sir Chris Hoy had made himself his own. Jungspund made the legend proud when he stormed home to win a victory from the favourites of New Zealand.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic gold medals.
They repeated the trick after taking only a modest sixth place in March at the London Railway World Championships despite Hoy's resignation.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.
They did this in good time as a hind.
Hoy's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
Skinner was the man they stayed with when they saw potential in the bulk that has now unfolded.
Hinds, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualification rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealands won in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel with gold.
Hindes was just back after his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner kept it.
A change of strategy made up a large part of the transformation, in which Hindes drove in a higher gear to slow him down and enable Kenny and, above all, Skinner to keep the pace.
Hoy watched from his position as BBC expert and noticed Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they rose to the Podest.
The 23-year-old skinner from Glasgow said, "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final round and defeated the world champions.
It was just incredible.
There is no better way to win this.
After the 2012 triumph at the side of Kennys and Hoys, Hindes admitted that he was deliberately on the track after a weak start.
He withdrew this statement later and there was no opposition from England's rivals.
There was no such problem this time in such an outstanding victory.
Hindes said, "It feels like London with the entire GB flags on the stand."
We've met as a team in the last three months.
We got away so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation that won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect successful five days in the Velodrome.
With the form Kennys it is in the field of the possibility that he repeats Hoys victory of three Olympic gold medals in one competition.
That would mean for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a seemingly holy date for British sport; on that day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a exploit of six gold medals and a silver medal.
That would be Hoy's.
Kenny will take part next in the Sprint, which starts today and will go over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I only enjoy this for the moment."
The team event is always best.
You can win it with your colleagues.
It feels a little lonely to win alone.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight."
It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-four-kilometre race.
They arrived at the finish in 3:51,942.
The world record, which won gold in London in 2012, was 3:51,659.
The first and final round (22.42) takes place today on the second day of the beaver, in which Wiggins will be in the focus with certainty.
He had fought with officers yesterday before the qualification when officials called him to measure his height.
In the corresponding women's competition, which will continue and end tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavia advanced in world record time in 4:13,260.
The GB team relies on its strong train bike team to dominate the mid-term period of the Olympic Games and to pick up a host of medals.
After a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute domination in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were dropped.
Dramas played in the background, according to the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April in the midst of sexism and mumbling accusations as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, if you look at the first night of the competition in Velodrome, it looks like the now legendary reputation of GB, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated again.
The future of Portland's melting industry due to the withdrawal of the energy contract
The future of Portland's aluminium melt in Victoria - as well as a hundred jobs of workers - is at stake, as the plant operator will terminate the energy supply contract and thus abolish all supply contracts, as reported by the supplier energy company.
This step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year not to grant any further subsidies for the operation of the plant.
A subsidy for 20 years expires in November.
Up to 2000 jobs in the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.
No less than 2000 jobs - both direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure.
In addition, domino effects could occur, as the melting industry consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the point Henry Melterei, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa's melting in Portland loses money and risks closing.
This step follows the years of speculation regarding the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminium smelting plant with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that it is assumed that three other owners will terminate their contracts.
The plant is owned by the majority of a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumna, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.
"AGL assumes that the plant will continue to be operated in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity from the melting industry," the company reported.
AGL continued to state that the contracts were so-called "security operations" that should have entered into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so that they will end in 2017.
"From this point of view, AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to the revenue in the financial year 17," said the electricity supplier.
All potential impact on revenue on AGL from the year 18 onwards are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong future markets for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL announced that it had already written off the value of the contracts in its annual conclusion of $187 million in "anticipation of termination".
Alcoa said that the decision to book the contracts, the "ability of Alcoas... to operate the melting or to ensure power supply to the melting industry" was not detrimental.
The US company said that in 2010 it had concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which should have entered into force since November this year, even if it still owes an explanation why it has resigned from the contract.
Analysts warn against the possible closure of Portland melting in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the bad economic conditions of the industry.
With reference to the statements of the analysts at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumes around 600 megawatts and Tomago around 900 megawatts of electricity each year.
Should both plants disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [power market].
And it wouldn't be good for us as a power generator," he said.
More than just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September edition of the Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of Kardashian-Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover the coveted September edition of the US Vogue.
Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and running on the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"In a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The revelation of the cover followed a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians similar?), written reality video showing the whole Kardashian-Jenner family (with the exception of the problems Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the most popular showbiz uncle and producer of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), as they forget the cover of their sister and that ends with a classic turn: they all planned a surprise party.
This represents the cliché-like act almost every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You thought we had forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartoon rabbit on a station at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris somehow had to let her other girls participate in this publicity.
In view of the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of the Kardashians has certainly begun.
Kendall's great sister Kim likes to have beaten her as far as the Vogue cover is concerned (they and her husband Kanye West were able to see it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for themselves.
The September issue is for Vogue the most sold edition of the year.
With an extent that resembles a tape rather than a fashion magazine, the edition attracts a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista were of the 832 pages of the Wälzer 615 pages advertising).
The revelation of his coverstar is so eagerly expected that in the last two years, images of the magazine have been transmitting before the official announcement.
Women already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years there have clearly been more "Celebrities, the Models" than "Models, the Celebrities" on the cover.
Oscar Prizewinner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga had the honor.
But even in the low chance that Ms. Jenner - described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the previous category, she is in good company.
These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or young people of today who know how to play a good Snapchat video (even if it all applies to Jenner).
They are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.
Beyondce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the publication of Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone likes Jenner's success.
With its reality TV story, Jenner's position in the fashion world was always a bit tense.
In June, the former Victoria's secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized her and called her "the mess of the moment."
These feelings got high again when the news came out with the appearance of Jenner on the Vogue Cover.
But riding around on the displeasure seems to pass the point.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vogue.
It is in the truest sense of the word a supermodel.
She's running for Marc Jacobs.
She's advertising for her founding of Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps.
She sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to the magazine LOVE.
And in her free time she is on reality TV. Probably only to see her sister Kourtney and her children.
Municipal law centres reject 160,000 people each year
More than 160,000 of the country's needs are rejected annually from the municipal law centres, while the industry is focusing on the effects of further cutbacks on already overburdened transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five persons - mostly older persons, immigrants, helpless workers, victims of violence and those who do not have the means for unjust declarations and the like - are rejected in their applications for free legal advice and legal assistance.
Legal services of the municipality, which are already over-used, are ready for further cuts.
As of June next year, these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds.
The director of the Community Law Centres of Queensland James Farrell said that the last survey of the National Association of Municipal Law Centres revealed that thousands of people are already rejected each year.
Farrell said that the situation would only get worse without a withdrawal of the Federal Government decision.
"Queensland's municipal law centers are chronically underfinanced, meaning that thousands of people are rejected from important services you need," he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with insurmountable and oppressive debts, families who go through separation, workers who have been unjustly dismissed - all these people have problems of a legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need.
As of June 2017, the Federal Government will cut funds by 30 percent, which means that thousands of more needy people from Queensland will be forced to deal with their legal problems without any help.
We urge the Federal Advocate General and the Federal Justice Minister and Senators of Queensland George Brandis to remove these cuts without delay, so that people can get the help they need in the face of legal problems.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise resources for legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of the municipal law centres and their customer communities and that the Palaszczuk government invests in this important work.
Donald Trump's election campaign charged after employees allegedly pulled weapon
New York: Donald Trump's campaign has been charged with alleged inactivity after you were informed that their North Carolina campaign leader had directed a firearm to an employee in February while they were on the move in February in a jeep.
The incident is described in an indictment file, which was filed by Vincent Bordini in the Landesgericht of Charlotte on Wednesday, a former software programmer for the campaign in this state.
Bordini claimed to have waited for months for the matter to be settled internally before realizing that "this wouldn't happen."
The campaign leader, Earl Philip," pulled a gun, put his right finger on the trigger, and rammed the run in Vincent's Kniekehle," stated Bordini in his charge.
After complaining about the local and regional campaign management, Bordini found that at least four more people had already had the same experience with Phillip, he reported in the indictment.
"Weapons don't have to be fired to cause damage," stated Bordini.
The charge comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate triggered a riot when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the "Second Amendment People" - gun owners and weapons friends - should take action if his rival Hillary Clinton is elected and judges are to be appointed.
Trump's campaign made it clear that the media had torn his words from the context and that he would not incite to violence.
Bordini's complaint requires compensation from the campaign for the violation of due diligence and Philip for body injury and permanent mental damage.
Trump's press spokesperson Hope Hicks could not be reached for an opinion.
Attempts to contact Philip also failed.
WCCB, a local news station in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer a member of the campaign.
No response was received from his consulting company, Innovative Consulting Services.
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has so far led a controversial campaign.
The trial is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin/Schwerin: Survey before country elections: SPD and CDU lose
The upcoming elections in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September) represent significant losses for the government parties SPD and CDU.
This resulted in representative surveys by the Opinion Research Institute INSA for the "Image" newspaper (Friday).
While the red and black government coalition could just further rule in the north, this is not possible according to the survey values in Berlin.
In both federal states, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would have a good chance to continue to appoint the head of government.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD dropped from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.
According to the survey, the party is only close to the CDU, which could return to 23 percent.
The third place is disputed between the left and the AfD.
The left came to 19 percent (previously 18.4 percent), the AfD would be represented for the first time in the country with 19 percent.
Despite slight losses, the greens are slowing down by 6 percent (previously 8.7%) into the heavy country day.
NPD and FDP would not be represented by 3 percent each in the Landtag.
According to the survey, the SPD would only be 23 percent in the Berlin Deputies Selection (election 2011: 28.3 percent).
The CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.4 percent.
It is still behind the greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but in front of the left with 15 percent (previously 11.7%).
The AfD would be represented in the House of Deputies for the first time with 14 percent.
With 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return, but the pirates would miss the entry in contrast to 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone
Email and internet in a loop: 20 years ago the Nokia communicator came to the market.
The successors dominate the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and bigger, so it was not well in the hand either.
On the contrary, it was pretty clumsy.
The built-in memory was initially eight megabytes, which would be enough today for about two high-resolution selfies.
An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" came into the shops exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, - and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, lovers can still buy the equipment on the Internet, but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet.
20 years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer trade fair Cebit in Hanover as a "office in the West pocket format".
In fact, the new mobile phone could be a lot for then standards: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, also by fax the communicator was to reach.
Even access to websites was possible via HTML browser, even if it was painfully slow.
A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the phone could be folded up like a laptop.
Then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen.
The price was pretty proud: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. 1400 Euro.
The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 Euro in 2015.
No one could in August 1996 suspect that the communicator would be the beginning of the smartphone era.
Since then, everything has been different.
The smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.
The Finnish mobile phone division experienced an unprecedented disaster, was finally sold and processed to Microsoft.
Today, the market is dominated by suppliers, all of whom came much later than Nokia.
Being online all the time, this is everyday for a lot of people today.
In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.
About 1.4 billion devices were sold, and Samsung and Apple alone account for 555 million.
The worldwide turnover of the equipment is around 400 billion euros.
In addition, the well-running business of the countless app providers and the telecommunications companies comes.
A whole industry has now developed around the smartphone.
The crucial breakthrough to the mass market only arrived in early 2007, then Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhone at the Mac World.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and an Internet communicator, everything by touch screen easy to operate.
Apple's victory move began, and today the iPhone is the Group's most important product.
Nokia, Motorola, and Blackberry, who dominated the market, had the good fortune.
They finally disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.
The saying now has Apple and Asian providers like Samsung.
The smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention.
On average, every German now looks at his cell phone 88 times a day.
"We all have to learn to put away the smartphone," said Janina Kull, in charge of personnel in the Siemens board.
Permanent accessibility is now regarded as a curse and blessing at the same time.
England needs to control the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring not only renewal and prosperity to our local communities and throughout London, but also throughout the country.
For me, this was the biggest attraction of Heathrow, just like we did in London in 2012, when we made a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.
And this will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for locals and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities, we will already create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment.
Just as they were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of enlargement is too great.
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will blame on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcoming, but Heathrow answers every question he asks.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many and not for individuals.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in scientific growth and to leave a legacy of skills and jobs both around the airport and throughout the UK.
We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from the T5 – which was elected the world's best airport terminal for five years – to the T2, which was built in the middle of the world's two most frequent runways.
Now they are ready to deliver a third runway, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment.
The 2012 London Games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.
It is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow while securing our future trade and creating a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in the "Katz and Mouse Game" with regard to ad blockage
For companies that make money with online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to avoid ad blocking, a "catch and mouse game" is the same.
On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad blocks on its desktop, Adblock Plus published a blog post in which it stated that users could update their filters in the program to block advertising again on the social network.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the coding regarding its advertisements to make it difficult to recognize ad blockings the recognition of which part of the page advertising is.
But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to bypass the new codes.
In a blog post, the spokesperson of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of round-by-side fight between the ad-blocking open source community and the surrounding world has been in progress since the invention of ad blockers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has joined the fight is a strong indication of how worrying ad-blockers have become for the industry.
According to a study conducted last year by Pagefair and Adobe, around 200 million people use display blockers; nearly four times as much 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via their mobile devices, mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of Facebook's advertising revenue.
The company has it on ad blockers on desktop PCs, as mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook's mobile app for the social network and Instagram, a speaker reported.
Advertising on Desktop PCs is a sufficient share of revenue, so Facebook seems to invest such a step to be worthwhile.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would update its "preference tool" to give people more control over their targeted advertising.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters would be worrying because they would also block content on the page that is not advertising.
"This is not a positive experience for users, so we are planning to address the problem," a speaker from Facebook told in an email message.
Ad-blockers are a dull tool, so instead we focused on developers tools like Ad Preferences to put more control in people's hands.
Passing woman on to the Swiss motorway in the event of suspected suicide
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police call on witnesses after a woman was overrun on a highway in the early morning hours on Thursday in a suspected suicide by several vehicles.
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.
A woman lay down in the dark "in an act of despair" on the road and were met by several cars, the police in Vaud explained.
It is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49 wanted to kill herself by several vehicles, including a truck.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been heard, but some have still not been identified, said the police who call on them and each witness of the incident to report.
An investigation procedure was opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, and Gilles Hofstetter informed the Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen if one of the drivers will be displayed.
Was a collision avoidable?
That's something the prosecutor has to decide," said Hofstetter.
Two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers are not held responsible.
In each of the two cases - where a person was running in the dark on the highway - it was decided that the drivers should not assume that a pedestrian is running on the highway in the middle of the night, as the newspaper said.
Last year, a police officer was acquitted of negligent killing after passing over and killing a man who was on the A1 near Payerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had drunk and had become unconscious on the street, the court heard.
The court found that the policeman -- who had responded to an emergency call -- was driving in a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a "perfect exceptional and unforeseen situation," the judge said.
Anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police under number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA Climate Model: Venus was once habitable
According to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably inhabitable once.
Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus could have had earth-like conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-tight atmosphere.
Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that the Venus might have had a thin, earthlike atmosphere and nevertheless slowly turned on.
The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.
The planet probably had more dry areas than the Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to house life and protect it from rapid evaporation.
The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.
"In the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exposes its day side of the sun for almost two months," said GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like a umbrella to shield the surface from much of the sun's heat.
The result is average temperatures, which are a bit cooler than the Earth's today.
The model produced a history of Venus similar to evolution previously suspected by planetary researchers.
Although it was once probably habitable, Venus -- over the course of several billion years -- was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned away from ultraviolet light.
When their hydrogen escaped, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect remained -- the Venus we know today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letter.
Patrick Roy resigns as coach of the Avalanche
Patrick Roy resigned as a coach and vice president of Hockey Operations of Colorado Avalanche on Thursday and claimed too little right of co-determination in the decision-making process of the team.
Alternative President/General Manager of Colorados Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately look for a new coach.
"In the last three years, I have fulfilled my duties as Chief Trainer and Vice President of Hockey Operations of Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," said Roy in an opinion.
Over the course of the summer, I have thought a lot about how I could improve this team to give it more depth, this needs it and bring it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the vision of the coach and Vice President of Hockey Operations must be perfectly aligned to that of the organization.
It must also have a right to co-determination in decisions affecting the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me about this decision today," said Sakic.
We all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future.
During his debut season, Roy won the Jack Adams Award at the Avalanches 2013-14 as the best coach in the league.
He led the club at 112 points and first in the Central Vision, but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the Minnesota Playoffs and missed the post-season in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches recorded a 39-39-4 mark in the 2015-16 season and fell behind the game for a second wild card spot in the Western Conference by five points.
Roy won four Stanley Cups as Hall of Fame Torwart -- two with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
NordeseeOil Workers start talks again, stop strike
The labour struggles concerning the remuneration for North Sea oil workers are suspended, while all the parties are on the table for a new round of talks, said negotiators.
Strikes against the oilfield service provider Wood Group were sporadically performed on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Good Group, as well as the Unite and RMT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to re-start the resolution process of the current dispute," says a joint statement.
We will hold a few full-day meetings in the next few weeks, which will start early next year to address the problems again.
The trade unions said that their last strike, the first one in over 25 years, was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group has reduced its rates to its North Sea contractors by around 9 percent this year due to negative market pressure.
The Company's rate reduction follows a 10-percent decrease for onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said that additional cuts give the company the space needed to get through the market downturn.
Shell has released thousands of people for its part and announced plans to give up its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries, as it rationalizes its business activities as a result of its mega-combination with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure as a result of the lower trip to the Rohelp, an economic situation which had been reinforced by the decision of the British in June to leave the European Union.
Scottish parliamentarian Dave Anderson met with workers' leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes that have been taking place in the North Sea for a generation.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
"In the North Sea and throughout the country, we need an economy that works for many and not only for few," he said in a statement.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion of expenditure on new projects in the North Sea is expected compared to an average of around $7 billion in the last five years.
Kepler measures rotation rate of stars in the cluster of plejades
The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalog of rotation rates among the stars of the cluster of stars of the Plejads.
The new data help astronomers to understand why stars rotate in clusters at different rates and in what context the rotation periods are with planetary formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.
The cluster of stars of the Plejades is 445 light years away from the earth.
Many stars in this star cluster, which arose about 125 million years ago, now reach the adult age.
They're making the fastest turns now.
At peak rotation rates, these mature stars emit large quantities of star winds.
As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a slowing effect on the stars.
When a star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sunspots.
The latest catalogue of rotation rates indicates that massiveer stars rotate slower than less massive stars.
Rebell compares the stars to dancers, with larger stars turning slow pirouettes than smaller ones.
"In the "Ballet" of the Plejades we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," said Rebell.
Since the cluster of stars of the Plejades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotational rates.
"The cluster of stars of the Plejades offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," said Rebell.
There is still much ahead of us about what we would like to learn more about how the how, when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and, so to speak, hang their "dance shoes".
Rebell and her colleagues have reported in detail in three newspaper reports on their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the Plejades, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
A controversial baseball star resigns
The tears ran faster at Alex Rodriguez than the US baseball star in best days from base to base.
After his emotional resignation, the 41-year-old professional will last time wear the jersey of his New York Yankees against Tampa Bay Rays on August 12.
"I love this game and this team."
"I say 'Goodbye' to both," said the 14-time All-Star-Game participant of the Major League Baseball (MLB).
In 2009, he won the World Series with the Yankees.
His signature under a ten-year contract has given him 27 million US dollars annually since 2007.
By the end of the contract on 31 December 2017, he will be acting as a consultant and youth coach - with full salary.
As a player it paid Rodriguez back with power for a long time.
With 696 homeruns, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("Runs") for Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004) and since 2005 Yankees he created some milestones.
With the Hall-of-Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two other baseball players have similar values in the most important statistics.
However, the 41-year-old is not expected to be included in the baseball hall.
Because so successful Rodriguez - nickname "A-Rod" - was on the field, so controversial is his appearance outside the square.
Already in 2009, the superstar admitted to have taken over banned steroids from 2001 to 2003.
In August 2013, he was detained for 211 games due to a development in the so-called biogenesis scandal.
Rodriguez is considered the main suspect to have received benefits for years through an anti-aging clinic in South Florida.
After a dispute, the lock was reduced to 162 meetings.
"The league could even have done me a favor for 2014 because I played through 20 years without a break," said Rodriguez at the time.
Also his farewell days do not run out of noise.
While many baseball legends get the big stage again in their last games, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bench.
"My job doesn't include a farewell tour."
"My job includes trying to win every game," Yankees-Coach Joe Girardi said.
After all, Rodriguez, who was married to the actress Cameron Diaz and who was told about the relationship with Popstar Madonna and the actress Kate Hudson, received sympathy from the fans of Yankee Archrival Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod", the followers sang at the 4:9 defeat against the Rodriguez team.
Olympic 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekova and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases
Catched: Due to a positive doping sample, weight lifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland in Rio should not start.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.
A catched athlete would have won almost a medal.
Before the seventh day of the competition, the first official doping cases became known the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-metre enemy runner Silwia Danekova from Bulgaria and the Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were tested and excluded in Brazil – just before the start of the critically eyed athletic competitions, these news come to the fore.
At Chen last Sunday, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide was already demonstrated, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.
On Friday afternoon, the International Sports Court CAS confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games.
On Sunday the 18-year-old had the fourth place in the finale over 100 m butterfly, only around 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.
On Friday Chen should have participated in the predecessors over 50 m freestyle.
Chen requested the opening of the B test and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
The national association takes the matter "very seriously and demands from Chen full cooperation in the investigations", Xinhua quoted from a message: "We will cooperate with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the judgment".
For the first time in history, the IOC is no longer the responsibility of the CAS for the sanctioning of athletes with positive cases.
Also on the night of Rio, the news about the positive sample at Danekowa went through, the 33-year-old went into the offensive himself.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," she said to the Bulgarian TV station BNT.
She was innocent, "the only explanation could be food supplements," explained the athlete.
According to the report, the prohibited substance is EPO.
Danekowa was temporarily suspended, according to BNT the B test should have already been positive.
Bulgaria's Prime Minister Bojko Borissow immediately spoke with criticism of the athlete.
"I don't understand why the athletes don't draw the right conclusions," he said, "We Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded."
For example, all weight lifters from the chronic doping-loaded nation are not allowed to participate in Rio.
On Friday the case "Adrian Zielinski" was also known, the London olympiaster in the class up to 85 kg was tested positively for the anabolic steroid Nandrolon as his brother Tomasz three days earlier.
Both dispute the intake, but both must not start in the class up to 94 kg.
Before the start of the athletics, the Danekowa case is a further heavy blow for the reputation of the entire sport.
The World Federation of IAAF had forbidden the complete Russian team except for an exception due to systematic dopings, also the runner nation Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio.
In swimming, the former crimes in China also caused violent conflicts between athletes.
The Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic winner Sun Yang harshly.
"Sun Yang pees purple."
"When I see the stage over 200 m freestyle, I want to hand over," Lacourt said on the French radio.
Sun was also at the heart of a discussion with the Australian Mack Horton.
"I don't have time and no respect for doping frauds," he said.
Sun had been tested positively for the Stimulan Trimetazidin in 2014, but had only to take a three-month lock.
Data Clause: So Perfide Killers Explode Her Redemption
Programmers of extortion malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful in doing so.
According to a recent survey by malware defense specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the companies surveyed have been at least once in the past 12 months, partly several times victims of an attack with extortion software.
In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were already targeting Ransomware blackmail.
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransomers required by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the attacked systems and data again.
The perpetrators specialize their extortion software according to the observations of malwarebytes on attacks in company networks.
If they are successful there, the possible ransom to be extortioned is significantly higher than for private users.
"We are currently observing a terrifyingly fast evolution of the malicious software," explains Malwarebytes chief Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world".
In 2008, most malware programs were still designed to send advertising.
Then the perpetrators discovered extortion software for themselves.
At first, private users were the target, but the change to company attacks has taken place very quickly in recent months.
Ransomware works for a simple pattern: Once active on a victim's computer, it is specifically looking for recently modified files such as Word, Excel or Database files as well as archives of images and videos.
These files encrypt the Ransomware and delete the originals permanently.
The software then presents the demands of the blackmailers.
In order to get the final encryption code to the files, the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency.
But where the personal photo database is at stake with private users, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without which production is stopped.
Accordingly, the damage is higher when a Ransomware strikes.
22 percent of the German companies concerned reported sales losses due to Ransomware, 13 percent even had to interrupt business completely, and in one case people were at risk of life.
In Germany, hospitals have been victims of attacks several times, whose patients may be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.
"We always say to the victims: Don't pay, you only promote the problem," explains Kleczynski.
But 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay get their data back.
It is difficult for managers to reject the claims of the perpetrators in the face of a standstill in operation.
The hackers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation.
In a recent study, F-Secure's security researchers have examined the user interfaces and contact with the blackmailers and come to the conclusion: The perpetrators are actually trying to build up a kind of customer service to take in more money.
They explain to their victims via chat how they can pay by bitcoin, set up free accessible support websites or decrypt for free example files.
And if private people are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros, companies will have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit amounts to get their data back unencrypted.
Given the potentially high and relatively riskless profits from the Ransomware extortion, hackers become more and more professional and share the work, safety expert Chester Wisniewski of the antivirus provider Sophos explains: "A single person can write a Ransomware within about a week."
However, it is more likely that these are three or four persons.
The programmers then sell their malicious software in the form of a software kit to the actual blackmailers.
The previous malware kits were created by buying the malware itself, advice and additional tools for a unique fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.
"The delivery includes a customization tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.
The blackmailers are then looking for more hackers to distribute the freshly purchased software to the victims.
We live in a service industry.
Therefore, one of the underground forums is bought by a criminal and commissioned another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
Payment is made per infected computer.
"The criminals usually commissioned spammers to spread," explains Wisniewski.
The risk of Ransomware is now known to many companies that better secure their data.
Over 50 percent of company IT managers in the malwarebytes survey trust to be able to defend Ransomware by using file backups and scanner software.
Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.
"If the encryption of data alone is no longer a sufficient threat to successful exploitation, the perpetrators instead threaten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski.
This means that the damage potential is much higher than before depending on the type of data.
In the future, the perpetrators could also introduce completely new goals on the Internet of Things.
At the hacker conference Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.
In the middle of winter, the release of such a blocked heating could be worth a ransom for so many victims.
If the perpetrators then block an entire production road in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.
One for all cases
HUNDA HR-V is flexible and everyday
In the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivan.
The HR-V, which was built on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be very flexible in everyday life.
Although the HR-V, which is only 1,60 m high, is rather small, the passengers have plenty of space in the first row as well as in the find, it does not work in any place.
The materials of the interior are well-processed and work pleasantly, only the cockpit top falls off.
The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in storage space.
Not only is there a trunk of 453 l available for raised and 1026 l for folded backrests, but there are the "Magic Seats".
This is less magical than it sounds: the back seat seats can be folded up like cinema chairs and thus offer storage space from floor to ceiling 1.24 m high.
The trunk can be well loaded, but the load height at 650 mm is slightly higher than in the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The tested 1.6-l diesel with 88 kW/120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.
However, he is expected to do his work a little bit more quietly.
The daily consumption of 4.7 l/100 km is pleasant.
There is another engine: a 1.5-l-Benziner with 96 kW/130 hp.
An all-wheel drive is not offered.
The driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamic and comfort.
However, the steering should be a little more direct.
The equipment does not leave any wishes in the tested top variant "Executive".
The safety systems include the city emergency brake assistant (works until Tempo 32), the collision warning system and the track stop assistant.
The collision warner sometimes irritates, because he rated many obstacles as "appropriate objects" when ranking.
The binocular assistant works very reliably.
And the intelligent tempo controller reacts to the traffic sign recognition and, if necessary, drops the speed.
The full connectivity, however, is only available for the top equipment: 7" touch screen, Navi, App integration and more.
Two USB and HDMI sockets are below the armrest and are therefore somewhat cumbersome to achieve.
The around 29000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.
If you don't want to invest so much, you'll get the petrol from 20000 euros, the diesel from 23000 euros.
The engines meet the Euro-6 exhaust standard.
With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.
Airline is not liable: fall on passenger bridge
An airline is not liable for the crash of a passenger on the passenger bridge.
Because liability is only imaginable in the event of risks typical of air transport, the Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf (Az.: 18 U 124/14) argued.
The complainant had broken a knee disk at the fall.
However, the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general life risk, according to the court.
The airline didn't have to pay the man any damages.
Illness case: When paid by the organiser
After their trip, sick holidaymakers will only get money back if the cause of the disease is undoubtedly found in the hotel.
However, this is only the case if more than 10 percent of guests prove to be the same symptoms.
In the case under negotiation, a family on the second day of their Turkish leave was suffering from diarrhoea and vomiting.
She spent almost the entire vacation in the room.
Their illness led the holidaymakers back to a faulty treatment plant that supposedly polluted the seawater.
The family felt that the trip was inadequate - and complained against the organizer.
In court, the complainants did not succeed.
Although the treatment plant was in fact defective.
However, the organiser did not learn about it until shortly before the complainant left.
He had to assume by then that the seawater was fine.
So he had not violated his information obligations, according to the judgment.
Especially in the samples of the water no contaminants were found.
The disease of several hotel guests - possibly by contagion with one another - belongs to the general risk of life.
Of 691 guests, only 38 were ill.
De Maizière said that after the acts of violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people were concerned about further attacks.
The state must react wisely and firmly at the same time to terrorist threats.
Certainly, our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division.
We will not be able to do this triumph to the terrorists.
If offenders need to leave the country faster, however, this increases security and also strengthens the support of the population for refugee policy.
De Maizière intends to implement the proposals until the 2017 Bundestag election.
He also announced a further increase in the personnel of the security forces, "in the middle of four-digit order over several years".
Promotion of sympathy for terrorism must again be punished.
Video surveillance is intended to improve the innovation of arms law in such a way that the purchase of weapons on the Internet is made more difficult.
The last much debated duty of silence for doctors should be observed according to the Maizière's words.
However, in his dialogue with the medical community, he wanted to look for solutions that could reduce the risk of the citizens, he said with regard to mental inconsistencies.
In order to counter the radicalisation of refugees, the Minister considers that better social care is needed.
Teachers should be better prepared to deal with traumatised people.
In order to persecute criminals in specific areas of the Internet (Darknet), de Maizière plans to use hidden investigators.
SPD chief Gabriel said: "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security."
It is important that the Minister of the Interior has clearly opposed actionism.
"That was an ear fig for the sharpmakers in the CDU/CSU," Gabriel told the Radio Media Group newspaper (Friday).
De Maizière had previously rejected calls from the Union following a Burka ban and the abolition of double nationality.
A general ban on full veiling is considered to be constitutionally problematic.
You can't forbid everything you refuse, and I'm refusing to wear the Burka.
You can talk about rules for example in road transport or for witnesses in court.
Green Chefin Simone Peter accused the Minister that he wanted to simulate action and ability to act with new anti-terrorism packages.
Left party leader Bernd Riexinger said: "Fleet sayings and a strengthening of the right of residence no longer bring security to people in this country."
Better traffic flow on the motorway
It is regularly located on the surrounding road - here a picture of November.
But this should change: the right turn is to be extended.
This is a good news for all the drivers who are in traffic on the surrounding road every night in a traffic jam when they drive over the motorway (A 43).
The Landesbetrieb Straßenbau (Landesbetrieb Straßenbau) will extend the right-wing lane between Hammer Straße and the downhill Weseler Straße by 700 meters on Tuesday and Wednesday (16/17 August).
Carers can then snap right off Hammer Street.
The big advantage is that the traffic will be split up at an early stage, which will improve the overall flow on the much-used section of the Bundesstraße 51.
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU fraction in the district's Münster-West representation.
The road narrowing on the feeder encroachs the drivers mainly between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m.
Workdays, the back store reaches to the bridge above the Albersloher Road and sometimes beyond.
The reason is the needlehole on the B 51 just before the exit Weseler Straße.
From here the traffic is directed only one-track over the motorway bridge.
The second track had to be rebuilt well in the end quarter of the year.
The reason: static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary load capacity to accommodate, in particular, heavy-duty traffic.
How long this bottleneck and the associated working-day traffic jam will last, the competent land holding cannot say.
However, years are to be expected: the bridge has an official period of use until the year 2034.
For the extension of the legal line, the state-owned company has deliberately chosen the less traffic time in the school holidays because it is likely to have disabilities.
On Tuesday and Wednesday traffic will be carried by the construction site.
Intercultural journey: cultural opportunities for schools
The international class of the forest school attended the play "The Invisible House".
The association Nima's and the Young Theatre are now planning a music project.
The association Nima's allows young people with migration and refugee backgrounds to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "Class International" of the Waldschule Kinderhaus has visited a presentation of the award-winning piece "The Invisible House" of the Young Theater Münster.
In the context of the "intercultural journey" initiated by the association of Nima's, 19 students between the ages of 11 and 15 visited the production in the Small House.
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which has set itself the goal of cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee backgrounds, offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project.
Most young people in the class came to Münster from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria between September 2015 and March 2016 and speak little German.
Thanks to the choreographies, the scene pictures and video animations, it was possible for them to follow the course of action anyway, according to the press release of the Young Theatre Münster.
The association Nima's, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Lingel, and the Young Theatre will work together during the coming season as part of a music theatre project.
From October to December, young people with and without the background of escape and migration between 14 and 20 years of age will be given the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing, dance, acting and music.
Offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theatre language communication are planned.
The project "Intercultural Travel" continues.
In view of the rising numbers of refugees, the association expects to participate with many classes.
Rain instead of star sniffing: hope for weather improvement
The weather has taken a line through the account of the star snoop-guckers in the south-west of Germany during the night to Friday - but there is still hope.
The night had been poorly suited for watching the sky's spectacle because of clouds and rain, said the chairman of the Observatory Welzheim, Hans-Ulrich Keller, on Friday morning.
Our hope is on the night of Saturday.
The weather is supposed to be good, then we'll definitely see a lot of star sniffs in the sky.
The starships are perseids, which at 216,000 kilometers per hour are among the fastest star sniffs.
They have their name because they seem to come from the constellation Perseus, which rises in the northeast.
Relaxing Night: Tips for Sleep Disorders
In the evening you walk around forever, at night you lie awake for hours, in the morning you can no longer think of sleeping well before the alarm clock.
That's all but relaxing.
After all, you are in good company with such problems: According to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel sleep often or permanently as not relaxing.
How do sleep problems or sleep disturbances seem?
There are several forms of sleep disorders, and they may be subject to various causes, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the board of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.
But what one understands locally is the insomnia, i.e. an insomnia disorder.
Many people feel that sleeping through is not satisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board of directors in the German Association of Family Doctors with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel.
What's behind sleep disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
There may be organic, psychological or behavioral factors, but also medications.
Not uncommon is the sleep disorder expression of another disease.
"Very early awakening is common especially in the event of depression," says Weeß.
And it may be that different factors have to do with each other.
For example, if you have a tape disc incident, you can lie down badly, wake up every two to three hours, and perhaps start grumbling about everyday problems and concerns, Weeß gives an example.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
When should you become a doctor with sleep disorders?
If you do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and are affected by the day, you should go to the doctor, Weeß advises.
The impairment may look quite different: One is depressed, tired, unsleeved, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical discomforts such as stomach or headache.
To relieve sleep disorder, it is important to find out its causes.
Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioral therapy or medications - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks.
There is little sleep medicine in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fitze, Head of the Interdisciplinary Sleep Medical Center of Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.
Therefore, weeß advises you first to contact your family doctor in case of sleep problems.
This can be explained by examinations as to whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who should go to the sleep lab, and what's going on?
For example, for examination in the sleep laboratory, physicians advise in snoring with respirators, in sick daily tiredness, in sleepers, or when one does not find the cause of a persomnia, Feitze explains.
You really don't have to prepare for the investigation.
You should spend the day normally.
"Please don't do lunch," says Fitze.
After wiring, you go to bed at its normal time.
In addition to the electrodes on the body, you wear a noseglasses, a chest strap and a feeler on the finger.
In addition, a camera on the ceiling records the sleeping person.
How can those affected get the problems under control?
There are quite a lot of parking screws where you can put on for a better sleep.
Weeß counts on: Regular bedtimes and uptimes, not too long in bed, not sleeping in the daytime, not watching TV to sleep, avoiding alcohol and not watching the clock at night - then you start to expect immediately, and that is absolutely not beneficial.
What the jungle camp has to do with missing medals swimming
The former German swimmer Markus Deibler has expressed himself via Facebook for the disappointing cut-off of the DSV team at Olympis.
In December 2014, he had won gold for the first time at the Doha Short Railway World Championships, while at the same time setting his first world record.
Now the former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has stood up to his critical ex-team colleagues via Facebook.
"In a country where an Olympic winner receives 200.000€ premium and a jungle king 150,000€ should no one wonder about missing medals," the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday.
The support system in swimming is bad, but the doping controls are very good.
We cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not look so closely at the topic of doping or even operate it.
"I am not saying that the controls should be discontinued here," he continued.
If he wanted to start a comeback, Deibler would have to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA).
That is the same way you should keep it with countries.
"Whoever cannot be controlled by independent WADA/FINA controllers for a certain period of time before World Cup/OS is not allowed to participate," demands the Elector-Hamburger, who now operates an ice cream parlor.
Airport: Band of luggage thieves arrested
Professional Diebe at Düsseldorf Airport
On Thursday, two women and two men aged 50 to 61 were arrested by the Düsseldorf police.
The suspects had committed several pocket and luggage thefts as gangs.
At around 2.30 p.m., civilian officials in the Düsseldorf airport recognized a gang known to the police from past theft crimes.
The two women and two men had committed several crimes since mid-July of this year, carrying out joint, labour and particularly professional activities.
The specialists of the Criminal Commissariat 34 can prove four acts to the thieves who had specifically entered Germany to commit crimes.
They had exploited more than 15,000 euros in total.
Altenbauten, a few linden trees, in between, a rest of the Koppstein pavement: The Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not work at first sight, but the police count it among the "Dangerous places" of the city.
If you walk along the road from east to west, you pass playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and a bio shop.
On the facade of a gray house someone sprayed "hospitably!"
Compared with a Lidl, which is to be destroyed soon, it is already being built: by 2017 a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments is to be built here.
However, articles about this "discreet district", as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, are preferably illustrated with burning cars in recent weeks.
Reason is the house with the number 94: Once it was occupied, the residents now have rental contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.
Since the beginning of the year, especially Berlin's interior senator Henkel had repeatedly expressed his support for a tough action by the police against the project, calling the area a "no-go zone" for police officers and the 94 as the starting point for autonomous violence.
After the ground floor rooms, the Kadterschmiede, had been cleared with 300 police officers on June 22, the police patrolled official statements for three weeks with 30 to 40 officials and three crew cars on the ground, locked parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94.
Meanwhile, on behalf of the unknown houseowners, construction workers renovated the rooms.
On 13 July a Berlin administrative court ruled that the premises had been illegal, and a day later police and construction workers withdrew under the jubilation of sympathizers and residents.
On this summer afternoon the street works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others entertain themselves in the form of late.
In the immediate vicinity of the house projects there is a primary school and kindergartens.
Left-wing violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in Kiez since 1999, and Jana*, who raises three children here, are particularly affected by the police presence.
With the inhabitants of the house projects, they share the concern for increasing rent and gentrification.
It doesn't sound like a Kiez who wanted to be a police officer in front of vandalizing left.
The grave that the Berlin interior senator and the police are opening between house-occupiers and their neighbors does not seem to exist.
Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional worker district, which today has a low average income and high poverty risk compared to the rest of the city.
Also house occupations and the housing projects that have been born from them have long been part of Kiez: in 1990 numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost all of Mainz's streets very close to Riga.
While the Mainzers had been cleared under a large police command in a real street battle, many of the projects were legalized in Riga and are still inhabited today by the people they had occupied 26 years ago.
At the same time, the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and voters from all over the world in recent years: with them residents from GDR times and former house-occupiers share their choice.
This is also noticeable in the rents, which have increased by almost 60 percent since 2009 in the case of new rentals.
Many of the new buildings in Riga are being attacked as symbols of this development: they are identified on cast-in discs or freshly painted facades that have been cast with paint bags.
No other road was mentioned this year so often along with the words "left-wing autonomous violence".
One reason why not all neighbors view this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: according to statistics, crimes such as body injury are almost exclusively directed against police officers.
Most of the crimes are material damage that tend to hit the new buildings and newly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rental house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years, there can be no question of uncertainty.
As far as violence is concerned, it is maligning: the people in 94 are their neighbors, who were certainly not.
Even the famous burning cars no longer exist directly in Rigaer.
For the architect, her street is not a criminal focus, on the contrary: "Here you help each other, live together on the street and get more of each other than elsewhere".
Neugebauer has deliberately moved to Rigaer Straße - and remained.
That's why it was so important for residents to get back their streets: from the police, politics and the media, all of which suddenly claimed the sovereignty of interpretation over the district in July.
But in the eyes of residents such as Neugebauer, the road is still taken away: through faceless new buildings in former building gaps that push the old inhabitants away.
"These are finally properties that are not interesting for many here - here more people who are not so well-reported," she says.
"I cannot approve of violence and destruction at all."
But what should you do if someone never listens?
There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the residents.
Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for those who are angry about color bombs: The house projects and the left scene were part of Kiez.
Anyone who moves should be aware of this - just like someone who moves into a pub district can complain badly about noise there.

Urbach: Annika Deuskle is a new refugee commissioner
Annika Deuscle is the contact in terms of integration and organizer.
She is also a local social worker.
Since July, Annika Deusgle has been the refugee commissioner for Urbach.
The Social Pedagogy supports the management team of Achim Grockenberger.
She sees herself as a contact person for all actors: refugees, working group refugee aid, administration, authorities and anyone else else.
Regine's client from the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuscle is now there, the egg-legging wool milk sauce, which has a problem above all.
Thus, some - less derisory than rather targeting the variety of desired areas of activity - had meant when the administration wanted to write out the post.
An administrative expert was sought with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, just an egg-legging wool milk sauce.
But administrative work is not her central area, says Annika Deuschel.
Above all, it is about organization, working with the local people and also behind the scenes as well as networking activity.
The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.
It has limited a 50 percent job to three years.
"It was high time," says Regine Kunden, "that Annika Deusgle supports honorary and principal actors.
There are big and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.
Soon new containers stand in the Wasenstraße
It has been a serious problem for some time now to find apartments for the refugees who have been recognized.
The municipalities are responsible for the connection accommodation.
They must house the refugees in their own or engaged homes.
The costs for the construction, rent or renovation of these accommodation must be borne by the local authorities themselves.
Responsibility changes from the Landratsamt to the municipality and job center.
Problem: There are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been very difficult for some time now.
De facto the administration does not find any private apartments.
It doesn't work so far, but you depend on private flats, says Deusgle.
Therefore, common dwellings need to be disciplined, as it is so beautiful.
So soon new containers will be installed on the Wasenstraße.
But only with apartments it is not done.
Perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deusgle agree.
In addition to a fixed stay, there are internships, training places, school places, one-euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who need to be found or set up.
"More places would be good," Regine Klant reports.
Many work in the farm or help housemasters, do non-profit work - and this motivated and very neatly, as Annika Deuschel reports.
It hopes that work for the community will lead to a positive outside effect.
This is "no employment therapy".
But activity doesn't mean just work.
The day needs a solid structure, say Deuschel and customer.
People need to develop a sense of belonging.
So it needs offers such as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.
Professional courses are rare.
So here, too, administration and honorary ones jump in.
It is central that the refugees feel that they are desirable and welcome in Germany.
The long duration of the procedures is a problem.
You have to explain to the refugees that it just takes time and they can bridge time meaningfully, for example with language courses.
Anyone who eventually develops the feeling that he can't help anyone in Urbach, should not work and be useless, he will never integrate himself.
The clear majority was motivated.
However, there are also cases of problem, says customer honestly, "people with nothing at all". Therefore, the work of Deusgle and the customer is always to motivate others.
All of this is already a mammoth task.
A difficult question: After the recent events, do the two fear radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?
"No," Regine customer clearly says, "what some might call naïve." But a residual risk could and would not exclude them.
But the helpers are already sensitized.
These incidents were also the subject of refugees.
They'd be afraid the suspects would call her into complete disrepute.
"They want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine Klant.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
So, on the spot and in the region, there is a need to keep an eye on activities.
They always have in the background that soon a new blast of refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.
Does Germany need a ceiling?
To answer this question clearly is to be seen in politics.
Actually, it's unfair to put them helpers on the spot.
"We haven't arrived in Urbach where we're looking for," says Annika Deuscle.
No new refugees, that would relax the situation.
Regine's customer also makes it clear that the Urbachers have already been burdened with integrating the former people in a reasonable way.
These are currently about 100 people, mostly young men.
But when people are in need, they need to be helped, both women agree.
The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.
Schorndorf: Intruder searched with helicopter
The police helicopter flew from different areas for about an hour - unsuccessful.
Two unknown men were violently invaded in an apartment on Friday morning around 8.50 a.m. in a multifamily house in Lindenweg.
The resident surprised the two and beat the unhaled into flight.
The two men were about 1.65 to 1.70 meters tall, probably masked, both were wearing bluejeans and black hoodie.
They fled to downtown.
The police used several strip crews as well as a police helicopter for the warrant.
The warrant went unsuccessfully.
Perhaps the unknown noticed before the deed near the apartment or during their flight.
Baden-Württemberg: Police investigate after Rocker attack on Imbiss
After an attack on a Ulm snack, the police investigates against six suspects from the rocking environment for severe land peace breaks.
In the case of housing searches, evidence and intoxication had been ensured, the police reported on Friday.
