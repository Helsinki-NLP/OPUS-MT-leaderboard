What is she supposed to do, the ČSSD? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague know neither Voldemort nor the "Confectionery".
The new councillors of the capital from the ČSSD ranks will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and in the city representation at all.
The newspaper Aktuálně.cz has sometimes "knocked" members of the new council from ČSSD, as they control the notoric snake, which has originated in recent years, in which today's coalition partners in Prague were on the row.
The coded vocabulary introduced by Prague's political elite in the lost era of Mayor Pavel Bém is one of the most famous actors, situations and causae.
Surprisingly, it turned out that the new councils are putting something in the dark with regard to these new terms.
At least they say so.
"Who's Voldemort?"
"No idea."
"I am more a newcomer to Prague's politics," replied Lukáš Kaucký, the new councillor for culture, to the test of the "paten-word treasure".
But the councillor Karel Březina - a political veteran - also responded in a similar way.
For example, on the term "golfhole".
"This is the only expression of those you present to me here, which I use every now and then."
"Otherwise, I don't think much of Slang."
From the vocabulary published by Aktuálně.cz in June this year before the ODS election congress, the editorial board picked out six terms, especially those that are notably linked to the Prague magistrate.
The Social Democrats should define the terms "voldemort", "largest Prague golf hole", "go to the confectionery", "star snacks", "treason of the capital" and "bleach".
Three Prague councillors agreed to the test, the fourth - Antonín Wenert, the future head of the Prague school system - promised first his participation in the conversation, but then did not even take the listener off.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the outset.
"I don't care about these things, and I don't judge how the bourgeois democrats talk to each other."
"For me, how we understand ourselves in the framework of our programmes is important," he said.
As already suggested, in the above mentioned headline, Lukáš Kaucký would not have realized that the influential entrepreneur and friend of the ex-surprising mayor Bém, Roman Janoušek is the talk.
The term "voldemort" doesn't say anything at all and the only term he correctly advised on the test was "the largest Prague golf hole".
"This is the tunnel blanka," says Kaucký, but added to safety: "But I know this more from the newspaper."
And kiddingly, "I'm going to have to take a language course."
The "Golfloch" is then described not only by Matador Karel Březina, but also by the councillor for environmental issues Lukáš Plachý as a tunnel Blanka.
Both Social Democrats, however, also know who the term Voldemort stands for, and Lukáš Plachý even knows where to find this figure and what it means to "go into the confectionery".
"I think that means going to some Prague gastronomy," Plachý is pretty close to the puzzle solution when you know that this is the seat of Janoušek's companies.
In agreement with Březina, however, he requires that he draw this knowledge out of the paper rather than that this vocabulary would be his own.
According to the test participants, there really does not seem to be a similar natural snake among the Social Democrats.
"I also asked my colleagues, but obviously there is no such thing with us."
"We call each other by name, we also use some keys or nicknames," says the chairman of the Prague ČSSD Petr Hulínský - of his partymates salopp called "Hulda".
"In school I was called Bříza (Birke), but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," Karel Březina tells us his nickname.
The newspaper Deník Aktuálně.cz has tried the name and see - he works.
Counsellor Weinert is kind to the party members of the "Opa" or less friendly of the "Old", the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to himself before the elections by machinations in the party sponsoring, is called by some colleagues "Igráček" (known Czech Lego figure).
Spitznames are the only ones that allow the Social Democrats to use their own language.
Hulínský doesn't like it when he is called "Hulda", but Deník Aktuálně.cz registered another nickname of Prague's chairman.
His nickname "Doctor of Rubber Kniff Rights" is said to have to do with the fact that Petr Hulínský has acquired his title Doctor of Law at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to stop the torture of "Hexen" and issue a brochure
Women who are stamped witches in Burkina Faso usually have some common social characteristics.
They belong rather to the older generation, they do not find work - for example, for health reasons, they are idle and do not have children.
When one of these women becomes a witch, she is strictly isolated so that she cannot become dangerous to the rest of the village.
"Men are very rarely affected by this fate."
"Even young and healthy women are spared because they help with their work and bear children," a religious nurse describes the situation in the capital city of the West African state of Burkina Faso in a special home for more than one hundred women who have been expelled from their communities.
The local government now decided to take action against this abnormal "social measure".
And for this reason, issued a brochure to prevent the "exacerbation of witches".
But the thing has a hook.
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," the newspaper "the Standard" pointed to the dilemma of written Enlightenment.
However, witchcraft is also commonplace in other African countries.
In Ghana, the neighboring country of Burkina Faso, 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová was tortured to death by three women and two men - they poured them with petroleum and just lit them.
Among other things, the BBC server reported about this incident.
The perpetrators claimed, however, that the matter would have been just a meeting of unhappy circumstances.
According to their version, oil is inflamed, which is used for ritual anointing.
And after the group tried to "evict an evil spirit" from the woman.
The isolation of "hexes" supports people here without regard to their education.
"The standard" quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "Freshers of human souls used to be a danger like today," he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso is at least trying to exaggerate the witch hunt, last year the Gambian President himself has mixed thoroughly with the President himself.
"President Yahya Jammeh, after his aunt's death, launched a monstrosity witch hunt, since these supposedly had a share of their death and would now try to kill the president himself through black magic."
"To this end, he called for the help of shamans from nearby Guinea who, accompanied by police officers, soldiers and the president's bodyguard, forcibly kidnapped women and men from Gambian villages and brought them to the president's farm in Kanilai," the organisation Amnesty International stated in its report.
On the farm, people who had been broken down were forced to drink an abstract of plants with hallucinogenic effects, but also caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of the arrested people did not survive the stay on the farm.
Only because of international pressure were the nearly a thousand prisoners released again.
A tenant of Bakala: He heats in the oven - nevertheless pays higher rent
An older man, who has been suspended, is leaving the client center of the company RPG Byty of the "Cohlebaron" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm a map with three new leases to three apartments: for his daughters' own and his son's dwellings, who is just fined.
All three were just raised in the context of the so-called "deregulation" the rent.
Instead of 3500 crowns of monthly rent, the son is expected to catch up next year for a 2-room apartment with kitchen of the second category 4100 crowns.
"And there isn't even hot water running in the apartment and you have to heat in a simple coal oven," he angrily taps with his finger on the new lease of the son, whose signature he has a mandate.
"But what - I signed," he says half voted and half resigned.
The Civil Society BytyOKD.cz, which called the new rental conditions "inaccurate and immoral", advises tenants simply not to sign the new contracts and wait until December 7, when they intend to publish an instruction on how to deal with such contracts.
But the man just turns away.
"One says this, the other says that," he makes a dark face.
The Region of Ostrava thus becomes the great "deregulation laboratory".
After the end of the year, this deregulation is in store for most of the rental houses in the Czech Republic, whose tenants have not yet paid marketable rents.
Aktuálně.cz therefore decided to visit this "labor" personally.
The RPG waiting room in Havířov is one of four in the region of Ostrava and already 9 o'clock in the morning full on this Tuesday.
Right next to the door are the bodyguards of a security agency and with it a call device.
"Miet 2011", says a special touchscreen button.
Just tapped and the device spits out a number plate.
Hardly have we deciphered the number "157" and it is already pooping on the large display at the ceiling of the waiting room.
Half a second later, you're in the row.
Sometime later, an older couple enter the waiting room to ask for the rent, but the storm in the waiting room apparently does not apply to the new rent.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair applications, insurance matters and the like.
From mid-November, in the region of Ostrava, the Kuverts with the new rental contracts will have most tenants of the total 44,000 apartments of the portfolio of the RPG in the letter boxes.
The RPG Byty proposes a rental increase of about 15 to 38 percent in the letter.
The special switch for the new rental in the client center has been open since November 18.
"The action runs a little over a week, that is, it's only the beginning," the ladies behind the switch hesitated after a moment when the "client" turned out to be a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakala's former miners' flats are a brilliant subject.
Before the elections, Parliament Vice-President Lubomír Zaorálek, from Ostrava, had taken up this topic quite loudly from the ČSSD, no wonder that today's newspapers are full of it.
"Twenty years I want a new floor from them."
"They couldn't even change toilet glasses," says the man mentioned earlier.
So far, according to the employees, pensioners are mainly on the switch to convince themselves whether they really receive the promised rental discount that they promise RPG if they sign the special offer in good time.
The benefit of a half reduced February rental is also to be paid to the other tenants who sign the new lease by 15 December.
So far, "deregulation switch" in Havířov is anything but overloaded with demand.
"From yesterday's 360 clients, only about 40 to 50 of the rents in 2011 were here," the officers estimate.
RPG offers individual rental agreements on its websites, as well as wall panels, where it appears necessary.
However, if the rental parties do not agree on the new rent, they will be determined by an independent court.
"This should not be a threat, but should be understood as an information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal approach," RPG explains on its websites.
"No one is going to court here," says one of the RPG Byty's staff and a man on the street in front of the client center at least partially right her.
"I have 13,000 (crown) pension, of which 5,000 remain for food, where should I take the money for a court dispute," he says.
Then the employees will be insecure.
"Sometimes see."
"Mr. Zaorálek tells them about the media that they should not sign and so wait people still," she says.
The regulated rent ends in the majority of the Czech Republic to New Year 2011 and RPG Byty according to the rent increase is an economic necessity.
"The existing amount of rents is not even sufficient for the maintenance of the housing fund," argues Pavel Klimeš, the director of the RPG Byty company's housing portfolio and - just the neglect of the housing fund criticised by the tenants is the main reason for the increase in rent, according to the landlords.
While RPG was able to invest four billion in the apartments in the years between 2005 and 2010, it is expected to be 5.2 billion in the four years from 2011 to 2014.
On the large-format LCD display on the ceiling opposite the upholstery chairs in the waiting room of Havířov, a few red illuminating information appears again and again.
"The rental increases in 2011 amount to 15% and less concern 31,200 apartments, that is, more than 90% of RPG's apartments."
"Always means no more than 7,50 CZK per square meter per month", read on the LCD monitor.
Only 400 apartments from the portfolio of RPG increase the rent by 38 percent.
"In these cases, the increase is extremely low rental prices of CZK 19.66 per square meter," argues RPG.
With 2600 apartments, the rent will remain at the same level next year.
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation does not drive the rents in the height, but is done gradually within four and eight years.
What is more - the company imposes another obligation: All revenue from the rental increase (see diagram) wants to put the company back into the apartments, especially in heat savings - in new windows and in thermal insulation.
But - priority should be given to those people who sign agreements on the increase in rent.
The architects saw - the office also belongs to a kindergarten
The office building Avriopoint in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
But who would expect a mini-child garden here, with everything that belongs to it: colorful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini-playing area on the outdoor terrace.
This kindergarten has been available to Arch.Design's staff for the past year.
The Arch.Design projecting and architecture office, from which a number of renowned Brno buildings come from ateliers, calculated from the first designs for the new Avriopoint building with the premises for its company mini-kinder garden.
In a wise perspective, because most of its 90 employees are in the Babyboom age and the company is due to the fact that the projectors return to their workplace as soon as possible.
Together with the possibility to work shortened, the Kindergarten is another bonus that Arch.Design has to offer to its employees in the concept of its social programme.
The architectural engineers are so much easier to put their demanding profession and child care into a hat.
The Mini Kindergarten is an original idea of Arch.Design's staff and with the support of the management, they managed to win funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for their project.
The Business Mini Kindergarten is financed by the operational programme Human Resources and Employment Policy from the resources of the European Social Fund and from the Czech Republic's State budget.
This funding (funding of CZK 2, 8 million) enabled the necessary facilities and equipment to be obtained and for the duration of 2 years qualified staff and for the operation.
After the use of the funding (2 years) the company Arch.Design is obliged to continue to operate the Mini Kindergarten for 3 more years at its own expense.
The preparation of this project took place for a whole year, with the Society Economy Rating providing effective assistance in the processing of applications.
The children care for fully qualified staff - a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, the kindergarten can visit children without old age restrictions, although most of them are over three years old.
And since this is a mini kindergarten, only 5 children may be present at the same time, but the day changes over several children.
The kindergarten business is flexibly adapted to the needs of parents, the children of all employees have the same rights in terms of the use of kindergarten - without regard to the company hierarchy and its respective position.
Although they are individual education and care, the programme content in the Mini Kindergarten is nevertheless comparable to the pre-school framework programme.
The children not only play here, but above all they are offered excellent instruction - from basic knowledge to pre-school education, as well as learning English.
The classroom is not only equipped with toys and creative games, but also with a computer that is available to the children.
What more - the presence of small children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive corporate environment.
The parents can take a look at the children at any time and thus the stress is avoided when the children are later picked up from a distant kindergarten.
The parents therefore use their working time more productively.
No wonder that there are natural and loyal employers-employee relationships.
Arch.Design has thus become one of the Czech companies that offer significant benefits in the recruitment of new employees, who are family friendly and strengthen their personal marketing through such programs.
A bone house also fascinates after 100 years. Check out the interiors of Gaudi
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs like the spine of a dinosaur, and the balconies are up-to-date fish mills.
This is the Casa Batlló of Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
The house with its organic forms was named "Knochenhaus" by the local inhabitants.
Organic shapes, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tiles and mosaics, the facades reminiscent of sheds and omnipresent soft lines, all these are typical features of the Art Nouveau of Antonio Gaudi.
The facade of the house plays with dreamy lines, tender colors and textures that remind of nature and living beings.
It is only in a closer look that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and thoughtful order.
During the night, the whole facade appears even more plastic, dramatic and the special illumination enhances the shine of the colors.
The same winding lines and devoured shapes also dominate the interior of the house.
Wave-shaped wood copies the window frames, rails, decorative elements of doors, even beech holes and bars.
The house Batlló in the Eixample district on the lively Passeig de Grácia No. 43 shopping street was built by the reconstruction of a house from 1877, which architect Emilio Sala Cortese carried out.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, originally insisted on the demolition of the old building and the construction of a completely new building, but ultimately he agreed to the idea of Gaudí for an unusual and also cheaper conversion.
However, the house Casa Batlló did not design Antoni Gaudí alone.
He worked with the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
The decorations for the representative home of the real-life owner and also the use of mosaics on the facade were created on its drawing board.
However, numerous other artists and artists also cooperated in the design of the facade.
The joint work on the drafts for Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful collaboration between Jujola and Gaudí.
Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudí's house Casa Milá in the Güell Park, where there are other works by Antoni Gaudí.
Shortly after its completion, the house was given by the local inhabitants of its organic forms because of the nicknames "Knochenhaus".
Others, in turn, called it the special window opening mechanism because of the "fine house".
It is also said that at the top of the building is the sword of St. George the Patron of Catalonia.
But other sculptoric elements also symbolize hidden religious motives.
Gaudí designed for the house a central heating system that was unique for the time being with ventilation channels and typical fireplaces.
Something bizarre already seems to be her 45 degree inclination.
In his work Gaudí consistently ignored all the construction regulations at the time and was by no means allowed by them.
Before the construction began, however, he obtained the corresponding building permit from the city, but the information he had provided about the planned reconstruction was so vague that the city fathers were so horrified at the completion two years later by the result that they demanded relief.
Among other things, the councillors also found that the construction with its pillars even intervened in the public sidewalk.
On the contrary, only fifteen days after the city district's call for changes, Josep Batlló made a request to approve the renting of the two highest floors of the house - and it was given to him without delay.
The houseowner himself moved into the lower floors.
In the second floor gallery there was a social salon, on the third floor there were the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment.
The ground floor was leased to a jewelry store.
The entire six-storey building runs through a staircase up to the roof terrace.
All right angles and straight lines were removed by the basic elements of the conversion and replaced by curved and curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with a modern concept for the mutual connection of rooms.
The social part can be completely combined by opening the salon doors and thus a larger society could easily chat without having to give up a certain intimacy in more confidential discussions.
The house received a rather unusual roof and two more floors by Gaudí's conversion in addition to a new facade.
Gaudí's play is also impressive with the light as well as the blue and white glazed tiles with which the courtyard is disguised and the light courts.
The play of these two colors gives all floors of the house a maximum amount of light.
He simply took advantage of the principle that white reflects the light better than dark colors that absorb sunlight on the contrary.
The house Casa Batlló, which was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2005, can visit anyone today.
On the first floor is the most spacious and magnificent apartment made available to the public.
The homeowners decided only in the year on this step and this on the occasion of the 150th birthday of the famous Creator.
When it was found that this was a rather eligible business, the visits were maintained, even they were extended to other common and attic rooms, including the roof terrace.
The price to visit the building monument, however, is not a cardboard stalk, it is 16.50 euros, students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist cards get 20 percent discount.
This amount exceeds the admission prices to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to get to know the real atmosphere of the house with its dragon towers, try to make friends with one of the householders and visit him at home.
The right mattress and the right bed rust? Women have different wishes than men
Not the most great bed frame, but the quality of the berth - i.e. mattress and rust make up the good bed.
However, these must complement themselves harmoniously in order to meet the wishes of the concrete user.
Many things play a role in the selection - the weight, the size, the state of health and, last but not least, the sex of the sleeper.
The interior in which mattress and rust are subordinated is equally important.
Typical example?
In a weekend house where heating is not regular, latex mattresses are not well suited, as they need much longer to "heat".
In addition, they are significantly heavier than common polyurethane mattresses.
And - they should be used regularly.
If they do not have enough venting canals in their core and are still on a solid plate, moisture stands out: therefore, it is not excluded that they form under their mold.
Of course, the choice also plays a role in what you are used to.
Those who have been abroad for a long time, where very high mattresses with soft layer are common, will be hard to get used to a low mattress with a hard surface.
"If all the hockey players who came back from the NHL complained that they can't sleep right here."
"For their worn shoulders, heels and hips, they simply need a soft layer of visco foam (Memory Foam - a shape memory polymer).
"I also recommend those people with diabetes who suffer from nervous system disorders, so that they can receive the "information" from the joints and the skin badly," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in upholstery furniture.
That's why years ago I got many hockey players, but also other customers these mattresses with Visco foam (Memory Foam).
"Today this is no longer a problem, as such mattresses offer, among other things, the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico."
And you don't necessarily have to be a famous hockey player to appreciate the advantages of the visco foam.
This "wonder" actually works very easily.
The foam optimises its hardness and shape according to the absorbed heat, in other words, it conforms to the warm body.
Nowhere does it press, at night one does not walk around like after a heavy fight.
You just sleep a lot better.
The viscoelastic foam also provides protection against decubitus (damage fire).
When choosing the mattress size you should still add the length of the soles, i.e. approx. 21 to 34 cm.
Man like woman, who is 180 cm tall, needs a bed of 210 to 220 cm long.
Each of the sleepers should be at least 90 cm wide, together with 180 cm.
For single beds, for example, 120 to 140 cm are installed.
The comfort half and also for any visitors.
Otherwise, the following rule applies to the ideal bed width: "If you are lying on the back, there should still be enough space for the slightly angled arms," advises Ing. Helena Prokopová, the master-in-chief of the upholstery and space equipment, which has been devoted for years to the problem of healthy sleep and ergonomics of furniture and also presents this topic at specialist schools.
With a double bed everyone needs his own rust and his own mattress, but watch out for the purchase so that the mattresses are also equally high.
Otherwise, nothing remains but to assemble the rust at different heights and that is not possible for any bed frame.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with spring skeleton 15 cm, of which at least three centimetres should be on the shape layer and the fine padding.
"You must not feel the feathers by hand or by sitting down," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a special rust type.
All-padded beds with mattress and underlay like cohesive Siamzwillings have nothing to look for in the bedroom.
These mattresses cannot be ventilated and the cover cannot be washed, which is already going and given today.
And since you lose between 0.2 to 0.75 litres of sweat in a single night, it is clear that the mattress slowly becomes a huge (and clogged sieve) after five to seven years.
This is also why professionals reject advertising slogans that promise mattresses a lifetime of up to 25 years, even lifelong warranty.
Every thing has her If and But.
And therefore, a practical advice from the dealers: For mattresses of 120 or 140 cm width, the hygiene of the washable, pullable covers should not be shy, but it is recommended to use a mattress protector that can easily be removed and washed.
Even if today's mattress covers are usually made with round-circuit closure, so that after opening you get two halves (very important for the washing process and the washing machine size!), the manipulation seems to be performed with larger mattresses, especially alone, often like the uneven fight between David and Goliath.
Do they have a fixed plate in bed instead of a rust?
Get out of it!
Or at most for a bed for unloved guests and for a single night.
Even so, they should prefer to use the plate with ventilation holes (if not already in it) and use mattresses with spring skeleton and 15 cm minimum height with so-called pocket spring core and fine upholstery.
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong to such a document.
Latex or sandwich mattresses (including combinations of latex and coconuts) are suitable for non-adjustable lattices with 14 to 18 springs, always paying up rusts with a larger number of lattices, i.e. 28 or more feathers, with Lordos support in the lumbar vertebral area and the possibility to regulate the lattice hardness.
To adjustable lamella rusts do not include mattresses with spring skeleton, as they do not respond to ergonomic adjustment.
In addition to adjusting the stiffness of the spring bars, special flexible shoulder modules are also offered.
This is a special fastening of the spring bars, which enables the spring bars to be pressed or even angled so that they enable the shoulder of the slender to fall.
One important thing for men with wide shoulders.
There are even mattress manufacturers who have started to use soft zones for the shoulder area in "men's mattresses".
Also the ladies are thought of - they are given these soft zones in the hip area.
For the most demanding customers, point elastic wing spring systems (lattoflex) or rusts with dot-lastic contact pads with so-called multitorsion suspension are intended.
The pressure is distributed to several points, which reduces the tension.
But if you use a bad (too big and full) pillow to the right mattress and rust, most of the advantages are lost again.
Here, too, a rule of thumb: the head cushion should support the head, its tips should only reach up to the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
Ideally, therefore, a 50 x 60 cm pillow appears, such as the scanners.
In the side position, the head cushion (together with the shoulder relief zone in the rust or soft zone in the mattress) should compensate for the shoulder height.
Something our modern mattresses have in common with the former straw bags (filled with hay).
Modern manufacturers use ever more frequent natural materials or at least their additions.
Even in mattresses, the new magic word is "bio".
Instead of oil raw materials, they use more and more natural oils for the production of polyurethane foams - for example, Rizinus and Soya oil.
Soy is probably used by all known manufacturers.
"Bio is called mattresses, which are their cores of materials of pure natural origin," explains Petr Vašíček of Tropico Plus.
However, natural substances are also used in the manufacture of mattresses - one of the first was Aloe Vera.
However, you can also treat microcapsules that spread fresh forest or lavender fragrance while sleeping.
Here, too, one makes a difference between man and woman.
While a "cooling" plant extract from birch leaves is used in men, so that the mattress cover can absorb the heat and cool the body, the covers for women have "heating" effect.
Extracts from red pepper shots stimulate blood circulation, so the weaker sex becomes pleasantly warm while sleeping.
And today's favorites?
mattresses made of cold foam (it has larger pores with destroyed cell structure and is therefore more breathable than commercial polyurethane and also much more flexible).
The combination of the various stiffnesses of cold foams and visco foams creates multi-zone mattresses that know exactly where the head, hips and heels are located.
However, for a high-quality mattress you have to catch 7,000 crowns and more.
However, health mattresses are usually subject to lower VAT, since they are considered as medical aids.
The first Czech company to benefit from this advantage was Gumotex.
You can see that saving on the mattress and rust is not so easy.
There are occasionally special offers from manufacturers and dealers that offer two mattresses at the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers the mattress Duofreeze with targeted visco foam memory for 11.990 CZK.
The second one is given free of charge.
It was the material Tempur that introduced the era of viscoelastic foams with open cell structure and high density at almost cosmic speed.
No wonder they were developed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overloads at the start-ups.
Tempur becomes soft with heat, in a cool environment it solidifies again.
Thus it adapts perfectly to the human body and distributes the body pressure in an optimal way.
It is therefore not only ideal for preventing fire, but generally increases sleep comfort.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only in mattresses, but also in other health products, such as special foot pads, which are intended to facilitate the legs and the vessels.
For example, domestic manufacturers use foams Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want human surveillance devices to have the kids under control
The fear of their own children is growing and so more and more parents are considering monitoring them via GPS.
The system, which was originally invented to fend for cars, can be used as well as people, which would also be helpful in such cases, as it was recently when the nine-year-old Anička Janatková disappeared.
The device is currently about the size of a cigarette box, but soon it will not be larger than a watch.
Many people have put the case of missing Anička in fear and terror, and so they look forward to means and ways to protect their children better.
Also for the price of an impairment of their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not about around pioneers, but about an effective means of reducing the likelihood of tragedy," says Petr Pilin from Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS location devices on the Czech market.
"I admit that the abuse of such devices can occur in individual cases, for example if you put it in someone's pocket without him knowing about it, but we had no such case yet."
"Most customers really buy it for security reasons," Pilin adds.
In his opinion, however, the child should always know the purpose of the "chat" and how to use it in the event of an emergency.
However, child psychologist Dana Bočková points out that if a child does not like to wear such a thing, he simply gets rid of it.
"Even very small children show great creativity when it comes to deliberately losing certain things if they do not want to be controlled."
"At first, the mobile phones raised great expectations from parents, but they can be switched off just as easily as these new surveillance devices," says Ms. Bočková.
In your opinion, it is also controversial whether such an institution actually helps in the event of an attack.
"In the case of planned kidnappings, the kidnapper practically always controls whether the child has any electronics with which it could be located."
"Today it's the cell phone."
"If such surveillance devices were to be more widely used, they would also be looking for them, as their sale would surely be accompanied by massive advertising."
"In these cases, the criminals of the police are always one step ahead," says the psychologist.
However, it acknowledges that similar devices can be quite helpful in a sudden attack by a pedophile.
According to the company RC Monitoring, which offers localization services for both automobiles and persons, the existence of such a device can also help if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can be adjusted in such a way that it reports the respective position at certain intervals."
"Even if it would be destroyed immediately, at least the last position of the data subject is available."
"In the case of more expensive devices, even an angle knife is integrated, i.e. if you fall down and remain motionless, the device immediately sends a warning stating the position," says Mr Čech.
In his opinion, similar services could also provide intelligent mobile phones with navigation, one only needs to play a special software.
The problem of the current placement devices is that it is either about equipment in stringed wood box sizes, the trailers resemble or about smaller phones.
There's always a danger of losing them.
According to Mr. Pilin of the Macro Weil, it is therefore possible to test in the present-day devices that look like normal digital clocks.
"This has the advantage that the possible attacker does not at all have to recognize that it is a surveillance or positioning device.
"Or he only notices after some time what the police give a time lead," he adds.
No matter which direction the development goes - to bracelets or pendants, the same technology is always used as in the vehicle location.
So to combine the positioning function with the GPS system (just like the Navi in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many cords that you can wrap the whole of the Czech Republic but only two years
The Czech army has bought 445 kilometers of ignition cords, and it has been ignited with detonators.
In the previous year, the Ministry of Defence had already delivered 224 kilometres of Zündschnur to the army camps.
It is already reassuring to know that the armed forces have provided for 225 years.
The problem is only the durability of the ignition cords - two but at most four years.
The army bought the ignition cord from the stock company STV Group, a.s. for runaway 40 million crowns.
In his explanatory statement for the purchase of this huge amount of ignition cord, the General Staff MF DNES replied that the soldiers would consume the 60 kilometres of ignition cord every year.
According to the research carried out by army pyrotechnics, which MF DNES referred to it, this statement indicates that the entire army must carry out an extremely intensive pyrotechnic training every year, from all the generals and officers of the Army Command, to the secretaries.
Minister of Defense Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek.
This is the only way to justify the considerable annual consumption of 60 kilometres of ignition cords.
By the way, this length corresponds to 25,000 detonations.
But that would also be the case for more than ten years.
However, if the old rule of experts still applies that for the training of each new professional soldier, two meters of ignition cord is sufficient, then the army has created a soothing stock for the 225 years already mentioned - also from the point of view of the increased need for pioneer and special units.
In doing so, soldiers of the Rapid Action Brigade have recently complained to the Minister of Defense Vondra that they almost no longer have cartridges for handguns, so that shooting exercises of the missing means are severely restricted.
Not to mention the lack of underwear.
"I'm not going in either, why they're buying from us such quantities of ignition cords."
But that's finally their decision, they'll know what they need."
"For us, the army is a good customer we want to meet as a dealer," says STV Group's sales manager Jan Děcký.
Jan Pejšek, the spokesman of the Ministry of Defense, founded the purchase of hundreds of miles of ignition cord by that the army would have covered itself with this "munition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký of the STV Group only speaks of a four-year service life of the ignition cords and police and army pyrotechnics only two years.
"In the event of perfect storage, the four years mentioned above are probably possible," admits one of them, but he wants to remain unnamed, so as not to be accused of criticizing the army as a soldier.
After expiry of the period of use, any ammunition must be thoroughly tested whether it is still reliable and not endangering the lives of the soldiers.
However, these tests are not for nothing but cost more money.
Another argument of the Ministry of Defence is the quantity discount for the 445 kilometers of ignition cord.
"They cost us sixty percent less than last year's delivery of 244 kilometres," Spokesman Pejšek tells us the position of the buyers of the Ministry of Defence.
Only for comparison: The annual consumption of pyrotechnics from the police, the ammunition of the Second World War or the Soviet Brother's Army, has hardly exceeded 1,500 metres for a few years.
And the police always order only those quantities of this ammunition that they can consume before the end of the useful life.
Even because of the safety of the pyro technicians, the possibility of flexible purchases of more modern and therefore also reliable ignition cords is kept open.
The Ministry of Defence has huge problems with the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Treaty when the two hundred thousand-member Czechoslovakian People's Army prepared for its campaign to the Rhine.
According to the pyro technicians who spoke to MF DNES, the Czech armed forces expect the same problem in a few years in the liquidation of hundreds of kilometers of old ignition cords, which they have bought so "favorably" today.
To this day I have found the contacts I have won thanks to the competition
The winning ranking in the "Small Entrepreneurs of the Year" competition helped Lukáš Pytloun to sell the franchise of his hotel.
Last year's winner of the competition "Small Entrepreneurs of the Year" was Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
The story of his success seems like a film scene.
Lukáš Pytloun liked to travel.
Only abroad did he realize that Liberec lacks good accommodation at reasonable prices.
From the savings of his vacation abroad and with the help of a bank loan he obtained a house with five apartments.
Remembering that he was a college student in the sixth semester at that time, this was certainly a courageous undertaking.
"The price-quality ratio was annoyed at that time and so I tried to do something about it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
He rented the first reconstructed apartment to foreign workers.
He immediately reinvested the entire profit into the house, which he then converted step by step to the pension with 54 beds.
Since then, he has been able to open four pensions, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds in Liberec in just seven years.
The most comfortable of them was the 4-star hotel "Pytloun Design Hotel".
This year another first-class hotel was added.
"We have signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, which we have sold our franchise concept and other interested parties to the franchise of the Pytloun hotels have already reported," says the entrepreneur number one of last year.
"The large share of this license sale for the operation of hotels was just the victory in the competition "Entrepreneurs of the Year", Mr. Pytloun adds with recognition.
The victory brought him greater awareness, even popularity in Liberec and the surrounding area.
"People recognized me on the street, often they congratulated me even afterwards, and I have to say that did really well," he remembers.
I really recommend all those who want to do something to participate in this competition.
You don't have to win at the same time, any visualisation is good.
He says that he still benefits from the contacts and acquaintances to which he would not have come at all.
"I have regular business relationships with some people I have met thanks to the competition."
In his opinion, the fame associated with the success also depends a little on each of his employees.
And that's where he's on the seventy.
"I note with them greater loyalty and pride that they are part of something that is granted general recognition."
I really don't see this as just personal success, no, that's the result of the good work of all of us."
"My name is just something in the foreground," says Lukáš Pytloun modestly.
I wish my successors a quieter year when we had it in Farmet
Victory was quickly replaced by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to its determination, Farmet has the worst behind itself.
The prize for the first place in the competition Vodafone Company of the year last year was awarded by Karel Žćárský, the company owner of Farmet.
At the time, the jury praised the efforts he made to stamp out a company from the small tool building in Česká Skalice, which makes hundreds of millions of revenues.
"I can say that this appreciation not only encouraged me but also all my employees and strengthened our self-confidence in the fight against competition," says the previous year's winner.
At the beginning of the company history of Farmet was the effort to do something useful.
And when the state offered a small workshop for rent to his father Karel Žćárský as compensation for the property seized by the Communists, he did not hesitate for long, left his career in the company where he was employed until then, and founded a company with a few comrades of his father for the production of plastic tubs.
A short time later, they began to concentrate on vegetable oil presses.
Within 18 years they have risen to the largest manufacturer of automatic presses throughout Central Europe.
But only through its success in the above-mentioned competition and its mediaization has it also entered the consciousness of non-professional publicity.
"Not only did our customers now see the Farmet brand significantly more intensively, but our foreign partners also began to cooperate with a company that has achieved the greatest possible success in their country," says Karel ŽŁárský.
The last year at Farmet, however, was not only in the sign of victory euphoria.
The assessment was based on the company’s economic results in 2008 and part of 2009.
And just 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of tool building products.
The crisis, which then hit even less the citizens, but above all companies, reached its peak - many companies were forced to stop their investment projects and restrict the purchase of new facilities and technologies.
"We couldn't escape this situation either, of course."
"The sales fell by 40 percent, we had to restrict production and even resort to redundancies," explains Karel Žćárský
A viable company sometimes has to take such unpopular measures.
However, it succeeded in getting the situation under control and keeping the company in the black figures, even with less profits than before the crisis.
In one case, the company was not willing to cancel - investment in research and development.
"From the grant we built a research and training centre, we strengthened our presentation at international trade fairs and won main prizes at domestic exhibitions," says Žćárský.
Everything proves that we have overcome the crisis.
The revenues are growing again and with them the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a lot of joy in victory - but in a quieter atmosphere," Karel Žćárský says.
A poll that clears up with unwise rules
The poll on "Absurdity of the Year" is part of the competition for entrepreneurs for the fourth time.
Some senseless regulations have already succeeded in getting out of the world.
To the dubious winner of the next year's opinion poll "Absurdity of the Year", the obligation to create documents on authorities available online.
Thus, more than a third of not quite four thousand voting entrepreneurs decided.
Thus, the social security administration demanded a paper extract from the trade register, even if the official could have called him up by two clicks.
Thanks to the opinion poll, this is changing.
"The Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer require extracts from the trade register in the case of checks by social security payers," said ČSSZ spokesperson Jana Buraňová.
The purpose and purpose of the opinion poll "Absurdity of the Year" is to examine all regulations and orders, to fulfil the business in the Czech Republic, and to remove the unwise.
This year, for the fourth time, this is part of an entrepreneurial competition organised by the Czech Economic Newspaper (HN) and is enjoying growing popularity in the public.
If last year's three thousand people took part in the vote, it was four thousand this year.
No wonder, because there are still a lot of legal obligations that only serve to hinder business activity.
"As far as the number of income tax forms is concerned, for example, we have a leading position in the world," says Karel Havlíček of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Commerce of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of entrepreneurship has been the declared objective of all governments in recent years.
However, compared to the world, the situation in the Czech Republic has hardly improved.
According to data from the World Bank, the Czech Republic has 74th place in terms of terms of business, compared to the previous year, with a position of eight worse.
The competition Absurdity of the year was first announced in the year and takes place every year in the same scenario.
Anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April to the end of the editorial period of the competition at the end of September.
The web address www.companyroku.cz is used for registration. The organizer of the competition then selects seven candidates for the "anti-preis" and lets the public vote over the Internet on the websites www.firmerroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It wins the absurdity that most votes get.
More than a hundred, more precisely 105 senseless regulations and orders have already been notified for this year's opinion.
The tips come not only from entrepreneurs, but also from professional associations and journalists.
Among the nominated "finalists" of the competition, for example, are also provisions for maintenance vehicles for motorways and highways to pay tolls or for entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets to be provided every two years.
The list of this year's "Seven" is published on the competition pages.
The call for competition at the beginning of November at the Wenceslasplatz in Prague is part of a happening, in which personalities of political and public life regularly participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, the director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Commerce of the Czech Republic, and Petr Kužel, the president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, were at the height of the competition with the party.
"Where the State throws entrepreneurs into a bit of a bit of a bit of a real economic upswing, so my goal is to lift at least thirty paragraphs every year that still unnecessarily make business more difficult for entrepreneurs," said Martin Kocourek, Minister for Industry and Trade.
Efforts to create senseless orders from the world are effective.
In 2007, people were most obliged to report to the office of commerce at the place of its permanent establishment three days in advance to want to go to an exhibition or Kirmes with an exhibition stand.
This obligation has been repealed by an amendment to the Commercial Act.
The obligation to report the second largest number of votes in 2007 - the duty to report to the employment office of employees up to 30 days - was abolished by the law on them so-called "Green Card".
And - all good things are three:
To the absurdity of 2009, the regulation imposed on physiotherapists to have a mirror, a refrigerator and two personal scales in the speech room.
This regulation has been reduced by the Ministry of Health this year in some way - the fridge duty has been removed.
A new category recognizes socially responsible companies
Assessment criteria are humanitarian, environmental, educational or sports projects
A novelty in this year's fifth year of the competition of the Economic Newspaper (HN) is the category "Responsible Company of the Year 2010".
The basic idea of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair undertakings.
"We want to support such companies that are aware of the consequences of their business activities on the environment and support socially responsible initiatives," says Patrik Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile company Vodafon, who is the broadcaster and guarantee of this competition, as well as the competition "Rebell of the Year".
For this year's first year of this particular subcategory of the main competition Vodafon Company of the year, companies have registered for which success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is extremely inspiring and offers enough fabric for an independent article.
Although they differ diametrically in the subject matter of their activity, their efforts still have a common denominator - support and consideration.
This concerns, for example, disabled people, because of personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Czech Republic, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera appeared, which promotes the creation of non-formal sports teams among their employees, who then participate in numerous tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main sponsor of a foundation fund for disabled children for seventeen years.
A paper factory from Poděbrady is also exemplary in caring for its health disabled workers, who make up 70 percent of their workforce, for which it was honoured with the title "Responsible Company of the Middle Bohemia region" and in the competition Vodafone Company of the year it held third place within this region.
In the Olomouc region, the accounting firm MiRyz Soft won, among other things, a fluid and also reduced working time on average to 35 hours a week and without a proportionate wage reduction.
At the title ceremony, the jury also honoured the fact that the company mainly buys from Czech manufacturers, supports citizens' initiatives in their surroundings and works according to environmentally friendly principles.
"We strive to recycle as much as possible in order to minimise the impact of our entrepreneurial activity and administration on the environment," explains her CEO Miluše Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the region of Ústí nad Labem, in turn, is situated in the health of its employees and therefore it has acquired ergonomic armchairs and keyboards for all notebooks, and it also supports domestic work for its employees and uses catering services offered by a home-protected workshop.
"In addition, we support the "People in Emergency" Foundation, which provides concrete assistance to the local Roma community," says Ondřej Suchý, the company's representative.
Not least, the activity of the cleaning company "Praní a čištění" from the Karlovy Vary region, which contributes to their pension insurance in the form of extra bonuses.
"We provide our employees with contributions to food, work, increase their qualifications and holidays," says Josef Strapáč of the construction company Czasch from Bruntál, the winner in the Moravian-Silesian region.
The category of responsible company of the year was automatically notified to all district finalists of the competition Vodafon Company of the year, who answered the questions of the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it to the organiser by 15 August at the latest.
Wrong or incompletely completed answers in the questionnaire were excluded from the evaluation by the organiser.
"If the representatives of the competing companies left the questions unanswered, they were excluded from the competition "Responsible Company of the Year", but in the main competition Vodafone Company of the year they were therefore not disqualified."
"A separate registration only for this competition is not possible, as it is merely a subcategory of the main competition company of the year," explains Karel Goldman of the organizing agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Soil Fund - Police arrests on a public tender
In the building of the Soil Fund in Pilsen, the anticorruption police have been arrested in recent days.
The local media entrepreneur and real estate dealer Luboš G. was handcuffed by the detectives.
It was alleged that it had attempted to manipulate a public competition that was currently taking place in order to ensure that the land offered in the competition was owned by a specific interested party.
This one is said to have paid Luboš G. half a million for it.
"At this point, I can only confirm that the police are persecuting a person because of the crime of fraud in public competition," said Antonie Zelená, the head of the Pilsner Procuratorate of the newspaper "Právo", unable to provide further details of the ongoing investigations.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old entrepreneur was released from the police again.
In what way he could manipulate public competition, one can only speculate about this in view of the limited official information.
The speaker of the Lubomír Černá Ground Fund pointed to the question of Právo that the police had actually taken arrests in the Pilsner subsidiary of the Land Fund and this during a public competition.
"It was about a client and not about one of our employees," she stated.
According to the public competition, Ms Černá had the correct designation "Requirement to offer claims for transfer of land under the Land Act" and would take place in cases where several applicants show interest in the property offered.
"These persons shall offer a higher value of their rights of refund to be paid by the transfer than the declared value of the property."
"In line with the claims offered, the order of potential buyers is determined, then the Land Fund transfers the property to the person with the highest bid," explains the speaker of the Fund.
Luboš G. was obviously available to information who had applied for the invitation and since he himself was a legitimate person because he had bought a number of refund claims, he offered a real estate interest that he would withdraw from the competition.
Obviously against a fat severance.
That would also be a sufficient explanation of why he had such a large amount of money in his arrest.
Luboš G. had already had too good contacts with the Pilsner Soil Fund in the past.
He also played a role in the causa of the former head of the Land Fund Václav Sankota, which was prosecuted for issuing land in replacement refunds, which had already been subject to site decisions on construction projects.
At that time, for example, Luboš G. from the Land Fund also acquired land intended for the construction of public roads, more precisely where the construction of the access magistrate to the Borské pole commercial area was planned.
Later, he exchanged these very cheaply with the magistrate for a house directly in the historic center of the city, which far exceeded the value of the property.
At the time, the town hall had to give up a heavy heart in order not to endanger the construction project by blocking the plots.
Household housing costs rise by a few hundred monthly
Households must expect not only higher costs for all types of energy from January onwards, but also higher water and wastewater charges, and for district heating and some places also rents.
As of January, families will have to withdraw several hundred crowns per month more from the wallet than before.
Electricity becomes up to 4.6 percent more expensive, gas by 2 percent and more, in some cities you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supplies, and some places also cost off district heating supplies.
The electricity alone costs the housing households a few hundred crowns more each year.
Strong electricity prices have been lowered by all the main suppliers, thus the clear promotion of electricity generation from renewable sources, especially from photovoltaic plants.
Gas is only getting relatively expensive, but this is exactly when people have to heat the most and have the highest consumption.
Here too, a few hundred crowns can be expected more per year.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive throughout the Czech Republic, prices for district heating vary from city to city.
In particular, larger places plan price increases.
For example, households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové have to pay up to 50 crowns per month for district heating from January onwards, more than 1000 crowns per year pay families in Liberec.
The population of Prague, in turn, threatens 9 percent higher water and wastewater charges and this in case the city increases the infrastructure rental.
If the rent doesn't change, it's only 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague continues to be among the lowest in comparison to the whole of the Czech Republic.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and wastewater charges are expected to rise by 7.4 percent.
Huge rental price increases can be expected, for example, in 140,000 rental apartments where the so-called rental regulation will be removed from January.
For example, the housing company CPI Byty, which owns 2500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, plans to increase rents by a hundred percent from January onwards.
If you do not agree to this rental increase, the company wants legal interests.
The regulated rents still paid in nearly 300,000 apartments are expected to increase by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech children get drunk with Fernet and rum beer is out - it just looks too slow
Fernet, Rum and Vodka, except for a good whisky, which was stolen from the house bar by the father.
These are the drinks, after which drunken Czech teenagers under fifteen must be treated most frequently.
No exception are children who have to sleep their hangovers in the hospital repeatedly.
This is reflected in the experience of doctors who are confronted with similar cases in the reception of the children's departments of clinics.
"Bier or wine are completely out of fashion, because it just takes too long to get drunk."
"Today's trend is clearly hard alcohol," said Právo Luděk Pelikán, head of the Children's Department in the Central Bohemian Hospital Hořovice.
"Whisky, if it manages to get the father a bottle out of the house bar, and if not, at least Fernet or Vodka.
"Wodka has the advantage of mixing it with Juice, he doesn't smell so strong," explains the chief doctor.
The speaker of the Faculty Hospital Motol Eva Jurinova gives him the right.
"The most common thing is Fernet or Rum."
"This is today's alcohol trend, especially at primary schools."
"It was also about Slibowitz, which is taken from home," said Ms. Jurinová.
According to chief physician Pelikán, thirteen or fourteen-year-old drinkers in the hospital room have long been no exception.
In front of the hospital in Hořovice, on which he has been working since this year, he worked for ten years in the Paediatric Department of the Motol Hospital, where the ambulances delivered drunken students from nearby and far away.
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times."
"She started her career at the age of 12 when she was first supplied with 3.5 promille of alcohol in the blood and in combination with "extase" for the first time," the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was in the exhibition grounds in Holešovice at some dance party."
"The interesting thing was that her mother didn't seem strange at all that her daughter didn't come home for 48 hours," the chief doctor wondered.
Especially the lack of interest of parents or their incredible tolerance when starting with their own offspring is considered one of the main causes of the growing alcoholism of children.
According to experts, it is not a matter of real dependence in the true sense of the word.
"Alcoholism is a long-term chronic dependence on alcohol and all related phenomena, and that is not the case with these children."
For those who enjoy alcohol repeatedly, a negative family-social background is usually characteristic," explains chief physician Pelikán.
According to Ms. Jurinova, the spokesperson of the Motol Hospital, about forty drunk children were admitted to the local department for child and youth medicine until mid-November.
However, only cases of severe alcohol poisoning requiring hospitalisation are included in the statistics.
Drunk children who are brought home after outpatient treatment by the parents or, where appropriate, by the police, are not registered.
In addition to the cases where children only drink such a bottle of schnapps in the school bench, there are three seasonal amplitudes, according to Mr. Pelikán, which is a hundred percent left: Walpurgisnacht, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"The latter for two reasons - either for grief because of bad testimony or for joy on holidays."
"On Walpurgisnacht, I have also experienced seven drunken children in the recording at once," emphasizes Dr. Pelikán.
Paradoxically, a drunken child who spends the night under medical supervision is better off than a child who only has to fight with an unpleasant hangover the next day.
The headache the morning after that, caused by dehydration and the lack of glucose, can be eliminated in the hospital with a fluid-spent infusion with glucose and nutrients missing from the organism.
"They are clearly better off, because after the "herorous" experience in the evening, they wake up with good mood, without hurting somewhere."
"They're just a little confused about where they are," Dr. Pelikán admits, sometimes spoiling the patient's good mood by counting the cost of treatment.
Because the transportation with the van and the night in an acute bed are good and will be happy to get to a few thousands crowns.
"I used it as a means of education here and again, when I directly told the children at the visit, what their drunkenness cost, and that it can happen that they have to work all holiday to earn the money for a single fete," said Dr. Pelikán.
In his opinion, however, the health insurance companies do not resort to regret procedures to charge the costs necessary for the recovery of the drunken children from the parents.
Two training aircraft L-159 for the first time in foreign hand - in Spain
Two lightweight fighter aircraft L-159 out of a total of five, which the Czech Ministry of Defense has exchanged against the Casa C-295M transport aircraft, flew on Tuesday to the Spanish city of Seville, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is located.
It's the first time this type of machine is owned by a foreign army.
They have only been shown at maneuvers or flight shows abroad.
This is the flightable two-seater version L-159T1 operated by the Czech army.
The remaining three aircraft are one-seat L-159.
These are still preserved in the Aero Vodochody, the mediator of this business - the company Omnipol - took over last week.
According to Jan Pejšek, the spokesman of the Ministry of Defense, when she takes out the aircraft physically from Vodochody, it is not yet known.
The L-159 single-seater L-159 fighter aircraft were separated from long-term stored aircraft without further deposits and investments from the Ministry's department.
"The double-seat L-159T1 was exchanged in current condition and appearance," said Pejšek of the newspaper Právo.
He added that the army would not have to get out without two-seat fighters, as the Ministry of Defense signed a 200 million contract with Aero Vodochody in May 2009 for the conversion of four superfluous L-159 to the two-seat version.
A new plane took over the army in July, the second wants to take over by the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, EADS has committed itself to putting the fighter aircraft into the equipment of one of the NATO countries.
"The contract clearly states that the EADS company is a buyer of L-159 aircraft and that it is intended to train pilots of NATO countries.
"It is therefore a matter of the customer in how he realizes the matter," Pejšek pointed out.
The Economic Newspaper (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish government has no interest in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 against a transport aircraft Casa and the purchase of additional aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns had been approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
At the time, the Ministry of Defence had not signed a tender procedure for the purchase, but had addressed EADS directly.
At the time, the Office of Defence argued that this exchange would support the future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army purchased Aero 72 machines, of which only 24 were used, and the rest wanted to sell them.
By the way, the purchase of the Casa aircraft should also have a judicial follow-up.
The European Commission sued the Czech Ministry of Defence at the European Court of Justice for the reason that it should have chosen the aircraft on the basis of an all-European tender and not by a single manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three aircraft Casa, the last to land at Kbely Airport within fourteen days.
A longer index finger than ring finger means a lower risk of developing cancer
Men whose index finger is longer than the ring finger are obviously exposed to a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study published on Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer.
This is supposed to be related to the mirror of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the fingers can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer, especially in men up to sixty," said the co-author of the study, Ros Eeles, professor at the Cancer Research Institute at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help determine which men should necessarily undergo a prostate cancer test, especially if there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family health stress, added Mrs Eeles.
In the period 1994-2009, she and her colleagues in Britain persecuted more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer, but also 3000 healthy men.
With more than half of the participants in the study, the pointing finger was shorter than the ring finger on the right hand.
For these men, prostate cancer was the same as for 19 percent of those men whose ring and index fingers were equal in length.
However, in men whose index finger was longer than the ring finger, this risk decreased by 33 percent, in men up to 60, even by 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers mentioned, which form in the prenatal age, clearly reflects the different mirrors of sex hormones to which the child was exposed in the womb.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer index finger.
Previous research has shown that the testosterone in particular accelerates the growth of prostate cancer.
Václav Pačes, a leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, said ČTK that this study was known to him in a fleet, yet he did not consider the relationship between the finger length and the cancer risk to be "completely proven".
Czech Republic in the snow - D1 and D5 are locked
Like most of Europe, the Czech Republic is also under a snow cover on Thursday morning.
On the streets and walkways there is mostly fixed snow, the winter workers were often all night on the axis.
The D5 motorway between km 89 and 90 in the direction of Rozvadov is blocked by some accidents of trucks and cars and the D1 at Brno "stands" towards Prague.
This was said by Novinky.CZ of the Dispatchers of the Central Auto-Moto Club (ÚAMK).
One truck crashed at km 91, two trucks collided with miles of 93, and there are injuries in this accident.
There are also a few cars in the street tomb.
There are also problems at kilometres 185 of the D1 motorway towards Prague.
Here, too, two trucks have come together.
The riders should leave immediately behind Brno at km 190 or drive over Brno and drive at Kývalka at km 182.
There are miles of congestion.
Also on the D11 an accident happened and this happened at the time of access to Prague.
In Prague itself there is a several-centimetre thick snow cover and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
Car colonies form for example in the city line Prosek, also the street Štěrboholská is completely hidden.
The safest transport is definitely the metro.
The trams run with delays, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and Friedenplatz.
At 8 o'clock in the morning, the Prague crisis staff meet.
There are also problems with the railway and on the airfield.
The Czech state railway had to cancel seven high-speed trains due to snow associations.
There are problems, for example, on the Prague - Kralupy or Prague - Beroun route.
Travellers should be informed about the current situation.
Ruzyně Airport has been closed since Wednesday at 11 a.m. until 5 a.m.
Most roads in southern Moravia can only be driven with increased caution.
Around Vyškov, three side roads are completely unpassable, in the area of Brno there are some snow associations and in the surrounding area of Blansko you are forced to use snow milling on some higher roads.
One of the most affected areas is Výškov.
There are still three streets completely blocked: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
Here too you will have to use snow milling.
When they can be driven again, it can't be estimated until now.
In the Hodonín region, caution is recommended in the White Carpathians area.
On the streets, which can only be spread with inert scatters for nature conservation reasons, lies up to five centimetres thick snow cover, led ČTK.
In the Czech Republic, from two to ten centimetres of new snow fell, most in northern Bohemia - at a rate of up to 18 centimetres.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, up to 15 centimetres of new snow fell.
In the Czech Republic, however, it is slow to stop snowing.
American soldiers have a new "intelligent weapon".
The American troops have used a new "intelligent" weapon in Afghanistan for the first time, known only under its code name XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon will affect the conflict there with the Taliban and shift the balance of power in their favor.
The new weapon is something like a super-accurate cannon.
Their projectiles are directed by laser with a reliability of only a few meters to the goal.
The special calibres of 25 mm, designed for this rifle and containing highly explosive explosive explosives, work practically like small grenades.
The shots can be programmed in such a way that they can explode not only at the target, but at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
That is, you can use them against an enemy hiding behind a barrier - a wall or in a pit.
From above it is usually not protected, so the murderous steel splitter rain from above can easily put it out of battle.
According to Richard Audett, who took part in the development of the XM-25, the new battle rifle is the first infantry weapon to use "intelligent" technologies.
"The soldier basically proceeds this way: he sees the target and sends out a laser beam that determines the distance, so he wins an exact visual point after which he corrects the angle of increase, then he only needs to press off.
"Let's say you measured 543 meters."
"When you push down, the weapon loads up and shoots the shot at the distance 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters.
400 jobs are being relocated
Fujitsu relocates its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will move their workplace from the former office building at the Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Astro Park.
The Japanese company Fujitsu relocates its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the industry giant specialising in computers and maintenance announced on Wednesday, 400 women and men will move their workplace from the former office building at the Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park in July next year, which is a large office complex on Lyoner Straße in the Frankfurt district Niederrad.
A speaker from Fujitsu explained that in the medium term there should be additional 100 jobs in the Group, which have so far been distributed across the region.
The rental offer was extremely attractive, and the large-scale offices in the Astro Park were more likely to cope with the workings of the employees.
Even in Bad Homburg Fujitsu had only been a tenant.
The responsible managing director Bernd Wagner said, "With Frankfurt-Lowerrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure."
The excellent access to the airport is particularly important for a global company such as Fujitsu.
The recent move of an important company within the region brought joy to the winners and disappointment among the losers yesterday.
The Frankfurt economic director Markus Frank (CDU) said that this was once again a "global player".
It's a "great local confession."
Fujitsu passed to the city that the settlement was an important impulse for Niederrad.
Bad Homburger Mayor Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regretted Fujitsu's decision.
The city was informed early by the management of the intention.
"Of course, we have offered our help to the company," said Korwisi.
However, friendly contacts could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property at the Marienbader Platz.
Finally, economic reasons would have given the result.
Now it is about preventing a long void in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building will be cooperative."
The house used by Fujitsu so far at the Town Hall Square and the neighboring "Small Vertical" were among the most controversial construction projects of the Kurstadt ten years ago with the remaining buildings at Marienbader Platz.
As a joint project between the city and a private project developer, a new city entrance was created between the station and the town hall, which caused criticism both because of the massive construction of the previously partly used as a parking lot and the height of the buildings.
In 2001 the investment consulting and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, started Amadeus, and the then connected computer manufacturer Fujitsu the houses.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were purchased in 2006 by the Frankfurter Immobilien- Chancen-Group together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and sold one year later to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
Fujitsu's home to Tokyo is the third largest IT provider in the world.
It provides companies, for example, computers and servers and also provides the necessary service.
The branch in the Rhine-Main area is one of the largest in Germany, but Fujitsu has far more employees in Munich.
From Bad Homburg the subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions in Frankfurt-Lowerrad moves in, the other subsidiaries at this location are said to be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this purpose, 7000 square meters were rented in the Astro Park office building.
In the twenty-year-old complex - the name is based on its star-shaped layout - the central association of electrical engineering and electronics has its seat.
Amazon Locks Server - Threats Against Assange
Wikileaks is increasingly in distress.
The Internet service provider Amazon has banned the disclosure platform from its servers.
There may be political pressure behind this after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomats.
Wikileaks founder Assange is said to be staying in England.
In the United States, Wikileaks' revelation platform is becoming more and more under fire.
The Internet activists lost access to their previous American server and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
The prominent American senator Joe Lieberman called in other countries and companies to the boycott of Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol's Ensign Lists, is expected to stop in the UK after a newspaper report.
"Wikileaks banished from Amazon server."
"Free speech in the Land of the Free", the revelation activists informed Twitter on Wednesday (local time) via the short-term news service.
Shortly before, the Internet company Amazon had banned the Wikileaks documents from its servers.
The Internet activists had resorted to the Amazon Web Service (AWS) when publishing the secret diplomatic depes in order to cope with the high number of access to the documents.
Via Twitter Wikileaks continued: "Excellent - our dollars are now spent to employ people in Europe."
If Amazon had such a problem with freedom of speech, "they would stop selling books."
Amazon had stopped using its servers by Wikileaks after employees of Senator Joe Lieberman had started research, the TV station CNN reported in appeal to the Liebermans office.
The chairman of the Senate Committee on Home Affairs threatened Amazon with a boycott, reported the British "Guardian".
"I would have liked Amazon to take this measure earlier in view of the previous publications of classified information by Wikileaks," said the Senator.
Lieberman called for the platform to prevent use of servers in other countries as well.
"Wikileaks' illegal, immeasurable and reckless action is putting our national security at risk and endangering life around the globe," said the Partyless Senator.
"No responsible company - whether American or foreign - should help Wikileaks in his efforts to spread stolen material."
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is being sought for rape by the authorities in Sweden, is on Interpol's search list.
According to a report by the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian in Great Britain stops, the exact location is Scotland Yard.
The Internet activist has always described the investigations in Sweden as the intrigue of his opponents.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that there were threats.
"There were even calls after a murder of Julian Assange."
That's why Assange is right to fear for his safety, said Hrafnsson.
The Wikileaks founder will therefore keep himself hidden.
Hrafnsson obviously responded to statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, had demanded that the person responsible for the Wikileaks revelations be charged and executed for betrayal.
In Canada, an advisor from head of government Stephen Harper - obviously ironic - said on television, Assange should be "killed" and Obama could "use a drone".
Between the White House and Assange there was a hit exchange.
The spokesperson of U.S. President Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it "abominable and absurd" that Assange had demanded the resignation of Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton, if she is responsible for recently known espionage requests to diplomats.
"I'm not quite sure why we're taking care of the opinion of a guy with a website," Gibbs says.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more significant than its website."
The US Government is now fully monitoring the protection of its databases.
As a Special Representative, the Vice-Director of the Centre for Anti-Terrorism Measures, Russell Travers, had been appointed, the White House was informed.
Travers is responsible for developing "necessary structural reforms" that, after the disclosure of the Embassy reports by Wikileaks, would have become necessary.
The White House also wants to see the ways in which the entire government exchange and protect information.
The American government also announced its intention to ensure the safety of dissidents and activists should be put at risk by the Wikileaks publication.
"We have done everything we can to get in touch with them," said foreign official Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if that becomes necessary."
Ice University
Ice confectioners are being prepared for better seasons at Gelato University in Bologna.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest entrance and visitors from all over the world.
Where's the whole ice cream coming from?
From the Gelataio and the Gelataio.
The gelatier, somewhat ancient in German of the ice confectioner, produces the cream according to all the rules of Italian ice-making art.
The Gelataio brings the ice cream out of the fridge with a spatula, removes it into the waffle and then sells it.
To know this, you don't have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But if you want to know more about ice, you don't pass the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The Ice University established the manufacturer of ice machines in 2003 so that the ice cream from its machines can meet the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest entrance and visitors from all over the world.
However, there are also special courses for chocolates and internships in the in-house ice cream parlor.
Some dream of a new career in the Midlife crisis, others just dare on the smooth ice of their vague longings.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, art teacher from California, loves the slow-food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the industrial Ice Cream country.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and wants to do something of his own after years of nervous job.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream parlour in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil wants to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars - and Canadian housewife Julia comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro gelatier Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
The decisive thing is not only good taste, but also silky suppleness and good consistency.
Luciano, however, does not forget the creamling of the national and even southern superstructure during his training: "Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then there is a lot of romance."
The first step in making seems quite simple.
Luciano tips the basic ingredients milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixing device, which heats everything to 85 degrees with an electronic program and then immediately cools to four degrees.
Then he turns on a cock on the machine, and comes out a pasteurized white base cream, basis for all dairy ice varieties.
Immediately, the lecturer is stumped with questions: Can you produce ice cream only with natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can you let go of your own experimentation desire?
Luciano warns against being led astray by the spirit of time.
Those who talk about ice cream "only from natural ingredients" may have used stabilizers - mostly a natural product, such as guarbar flour from the guar bean.
Of course, you can also make ice without a stabilizer, only then it must be sold within one day, otherwise it falls into itself, and the customer bites on loud ice grains.
Certain variations on the base mass are allowed.
Exciting it with the aromas.
For the taste in the ice Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients you buy in the fruit department or in the sweets of the supermarket.
There are also powders and pastes.
"The suppliers will all try to turn on dozens of aromatized additives."
"But you should just experiment."
Either with the fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or just with the ice cream from the white base mass, which becomes a yellow cream with eggs and with cocoa powder as the basis for all possible chocolate seductions.
Now the students are allowed to attend the ice machines.
Luciano makes it produce four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut ice - with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural additives.
The same experiment is also subject to fruit ice varieties.
More flavourings, more fruit-puree - tasteful that is not necessarily better.
Hazelnut ice cream does not necessarily taste nutritious when it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular Kiwi ice cream manufactures the working group that uses more fruits, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only a balanced mixture highlights the taste of a gelato correctly, says Luciano.
Ice cream production is a calculation task: if peach puree is used with a lot of sugar, the sugar content must be reduced in the basic recipe.
An extra portion of sugar is needed for lemon ice.
Luciano draws out a device with which he determines the sugar content of the fruit varieties (winzers measure the oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, tables facilitate computing.
Making ice doesn't require as much physical use as it used to be.
Not only the device helps for the automatic production of the base mass.
There is also a device where the finished ice mixture is cremally beaten and cooled at minus temperatures.
Despite all automation, small pans do not fail.
The Brazilian Gustavo and his coursemates chatter with fruit purée from top to bottom when the oversized bar mixer gets out of control.
"In every course," Maestro Luciano says, "it's just a matter of time until such a thing happens."
Controllers in the dungeon
The European Food Authority, Efsa, has been undermined by the industry experimenting with gene plants.
This accusation is now formulated by the Expert Group Testbiotech, which sees itself as an independent institute for the impact assessment of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we've documented it well," said Testbiotech chief Christoph Then on Wednesday in Munich.
The head of the Efsa Group of Experts for Genetically Modified Plants, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa expert have been under contract with the lobbyist association Ilsi for years.
This is paid by companies such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has worked significantly on the Efsa test regulations for gene plants and is thus in a clear conflict of interest, criticises Then.
The Efsa regulations are replaced by position papers of the Ilsi and thus cheat the handwriting of the industry, which is actually to be controlled by the authority in the Italian Parma.
It is already the second time that Testbiotech has a conflict of interest.
Thus, a high-ranking Efsa manager was recently without any conditions or transitional period to the Swiss agricultural group Syngenta - and thus changed the pages.
The Central German Broadcasting Office (MDR) had recently revealed human resources links between controlling EU authorities and industrial lobby, which has made the Federal Environment Agency and EU Parliamentary Members hearing.
However, the Efsa cannot recognize any conflict of interest.
One goes back to all serious data, including those of the industry, as long as they are of high professional quality, it is stated in an opinion.
The experts working for Efsa are not required to have no contacts with the industry.
But you'd have to reveal them.
Kuiper gives up his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the USA.
This describes itself as a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics, including for risk assessment of biotechnology without lobbying.
In the case, independent experts such as Then criticize that genetically modified plants are currently approved in animals without any feeding attempt and that the response of gene plants to environmental influences is not tested.
"We want to know, for example, what genetically modified maize does on the field," says Then.
Current practice is to test only isolated proteins, but not the whole gene plant, which does not deliver reliable results.
"If you don't look for the risks, how to find them then?" Then asks indictment.
That's what Angelika Hilbeck sees.
The scientist has been researching genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Zurich University of Technology.
The industry is now increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in Europe, as in the US.
Therefore, there are hardly any more researchers who are not interconnected with companies.
For companies, critical studies would not normally be published.
"Industry controls security research," says Hilbeck.
The trail of the stones
Uli Gsell has also gotten some, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday evening he stood as a train station in Stuttgart, the tuba on his back.
It was demo.
It snowed.
The story is known: In September, the excavators were moved and had begun to break a large piece of the north wing.
The Stuttgarter Welt was no longer the same: Zig thousands demonstrated against S21, the milliards' downfall of the station.
When it came to the construction stop, much of the wing was in ruins.
Broken in 6000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a soft rough stone, installed between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in East Fildern, 43 years old.
He's secured himself a few of the chunks.
"These stones are relics."
"You mustn't disappear."
He shrieks: "A cheaper and poor stone, simple and earth-like."
When he saw one, he smelled like a cigarette.
He doesn't know what he's gonna do with the chunks yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
The trail of the Stuttgart Stones leads into a forest near Tübingen to a former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone kingdom.
The 44-year-old deals with old stones.
He's bought all of those who attacked the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame, they would be ground into gravel or disappear into the dump," he says in his office, a wooden box that was once a watchhouse.
He was insulted and threatened when, in September, he said that he had bought the remains of the north wing from the demolition operator.
But he talked to the S-21 opponents for days.
And he told them that he could not do anything for the demolition.
And if it happens, then it would be the most reasonable thing if the stones were to continue using.
About 200 S-21 opponents then took one of the 80-kilometer quadrs on average, piece price of 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a reminder, but also in the hope of being able to return him in the event of a reconstruction.
500 tons had bought Rongen, 25 large truck charges.
About half is still stored in the forest, the rest is long sold.
Garden owners, landscape gardeners, house builders.
They had come from everywhere and had towed away what trunks and trailers could wear.
The Stuttgart stones of the start have long turned into "mauerle" or into restrictions of herbal beds.
"In fact, this stone is nothing special," Rongen says.
"Wouldn't be the political component."
He climbs into his off-road cars, makes a tour of his 20-hectare empire.
He studied law and graduated, later biology, then he was interested in computers and eventually became stone merchants.
And stone lovers.
40,000 tons of stones are stored.
From all over Germany, he carts his treasures together.
He says he's the largest old stone dealer in the Republic.
He's slowing down.
In the snow there are artificially fenced sandstones.
"They once belonged to the Dresden Marienbrücke," he says.
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, it warms.
"My favorite stone."
It's going up the way through the forest.
He points to a pile of red sandstone, formerly part of Karlsruhe station.
Keep going.
"Beautiful Travertin."
At one time the quadrilaterals were part of the gallery of the Stuttgart Neckarstadion.
All over the snow Stones and stories, Cannstatter Travertin from the Stuttgart Police Presidium, reddish granite from the Cathedral of Sankt Blasia, Tuff from the Heilbronn Hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how the stones used to be ground by hand and moved with simple bottles and ox carts, he becomes quite awesome.
"It would be a scandal if you were to scrape something like that."
He has not become rich, not stony at all.
But 14 people are busy with the stone dealer today, as well as in the forest, Steinmetze, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glass blower and a gardener have settled.
"We're working hard, but it's satisfying," says the residual consumer.
Soon he'll have to go to Cologne.
There are also stones to save there.
Talent Fight for High-Potentials
There's a lot of urge on the buffet.
16 students are pressing for salmon, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the Autobauer Volkswagen invited the mechanical and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of ideas competition, they are supposed to get to know Volkswagen together with VW developers about the car of the future - and by the way.
In the competition for the smartest minds, many companies are now going to the near fight and, like VW, rely on cooperations with the universities.
Their mission: to recruit the most talented graduates in the audiences as early as possible before they come to the labour market and are recruited by others.
And because the universities do not publish statements about the achievements of their students, one tries to find and bind the exceptional talents in practical projects.
On the second day of the workshop at TU Braunschweig, the car group is throwing the talents.
A young lady from the staff department distributes ballpoint pens, rubber messages and maps with VW logo.
She tells the hopeful young talent of internship programs and student jobs and shows them ways into the group.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig manages the project with VW.
He sees the advantages for both sides: "The students come into contact with the industry and gather experiences."
"VW can get to know students at the same time, look at interesting candidates and think about who would be in question as an employee."
Such cooperations, say Celle, are not unusual.
It is new that students are so offensively burdened.
"Otherwise, the focus was more on the technical project," says Selle.
The fight for the fresh graduates will probably get even harder.
In many sectors, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large number of applicants.
But they must be priced and particularly high-qualified workers.
Especially graduates from the engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Association of German Engineers VDI, more than 40,000 engineering posts remained unoccupied in October.
And the so-called engineering gap will grow even bigger according to VDI forecasts.
For the audit and consulting company KPMG, Roman Dykta goes on the talent hunt.
He organizes extensive recruiting events such as the KPMG Race, a kind of modern schnitzelhund, in which participants have to find their way through GPS coordinates.
Eight promising students want to send the company across the USA next year.
By the way, participants can view KPMG branches and get to know the company.
Those who are allowed to join will decide in advance in two selection rounds.
Only the Crème de la Crème of many candidates flies to the USA.
According to Dykta, the guns are getting bigger and bigger in honing and stabbing around the high potentials at the universities.
"We want to get out of the crowd with the race."
"Only a simple sailing session was too little for us."
For talent hunter Dykta, the bill seems to go.
"We still have contact with all participants of a similar action in the past year."
"Some are just ahead of their degree and want to apply with us soon," he says.
In addition to the direct bohlen on campus, especially small and medium-sized companies are also quite classic at professional fairs on the Pirsch.
"We are trying to reach graduates at trade fairs."
"Somehow on Intersolar," reports Sitha Stübe, Head of Staff at Solar Technology Manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonn company employs around 1500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows about young people's problems.
35 posts are currently being advertised on the company website.
"It's very difficult to occupy empty positions right now."
"That costs a lot of time and money," she says.
Another way is to contact the university professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"The professors indicate that we can do internships or write his diploma thesis."
Expensive promotions are not announced by the solar specialist.
For this purpose, the company tries to promote itself with other advantages: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and easy communication.
"A large group often cannot offer this," says staff manager Stübe.
Money doesn't play the main role in finding a job anymore.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good climbing opportunities are other key factors.
In a study by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld took 55th place among the 100 best employers in Germany.
The Institute creates an annual toplist of German employers.
For this, employees question how satisfied they are with their work and their job environment and look at the framework conditions for the employees.
Staff Manager Stübe is also hoping to receive benefits from the placement of job seekers.
"I think applicants are looking especially at external evaluations about a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build up a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
He advises his customers to be more authentic.
And that means, according to warriors, especially internal measures.
"The best way to make yourself attractive as an employer is through its own employees," he says.
In the sector jargon, the internal employee branding means employers' branding within their own workforce.
"Satisfied staff are the best ambassadors."
If you treat your people well and identify them with the company, they would advertise all by themselves to friends and acquaintances for their employer.
"This is like a game with bands," says Kriegler.
Obama stops new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling in the coming years off the coast of the U.S. state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico.
A corresponding ban has been imposed by the government in Washington - and thus its previous plans have been permanently revoked.
New drilling is also prohibited off the Atlantic coast.
This was reported by Mr Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
The trigger for the strict ban to apply for at least the next five years is the explosion of the drilling platform "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Before the disaster that killed eleven workers and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, at the pressure of opposition and industry, had signaled his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The proponents want to reduce the dependence of the US on oil supplies from abroad.
Whoever bears the responsibility for the devastating oil plague in the Gulf has not been fully clarified to this day.
The criticism focuses on the British energy group BP, which is faced with billions of demands.
A committee of inquiry on behalf of Obama is to present its results during December.
In October, Minister of the Interior, Ken Salazar, removed the drill stop that had been suspended after the explosion.
Following this, various oil companies had immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With more stringent controls and more stringent security regulations, Obama and Salazar want to exclude a new catastrophe.
At present, the competent control authority, which has been called into question after numerous accusations of corruption, is being fundamentally reformed.
In parallel, Obama has announced that it will close random tax loops for the oil and gas companies.
The industry is now publicly warning that the level of support in the Gulf would be significantly lower than in the past by means of stricter regulation.
"The government's plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industry," says the result of a current industry survey by the consultant BDO - even before the ban on drilling on Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance also complains of industry uncertainty: "No one knows what regulation will do exactly."
Investments in new funding projects would be delayed except for further growth.
Ogoniland is burned down
The water in the rivers is oil-brown, it smells like at the gas station: billions of gallons of drained crude oil have destroyed nature in the Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live on theft, corruption and illegal oil cooking.
Celestine Akpobari means well.
"Don't lie down," the eco-activist calms the journalists: "You'll get enough oil mud in front of the lens today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has followed the attempt to light a boy wading up to the chest in the water with the glands surrounding him: In the rainbow-colored water shine the scene seems almost pretty.
It can't be seen that brown crude oil swabs float under the surface.
In the past, she had immeasurably collected shrimp here, says Esther Badom on the shores of the Bodo Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the slow flowing waters are completely dead.
Five years ago, a brushed pipeline poured tons of crude oil into the huge wetland.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo now have to row for six hours to get into fishy waters: Ogoniland, located in the heart of the Niger Delta, is considered to be one of the worst ruined regions in the world.
On the journey through the mangrove swamps that flow through the river, the entire extent of the destruction becomes apparent.
Instead of light water, the motor boat brown brown warms up, who dives his hand into the water, pulls out oily fingers.
The roots of the mangrove trees rise like black lacrits from the ground, saddening palm trees to hang their bets.
Bird swarms, as they are usual in wetlands, are forgivable: As soon as the outsider silences, the former paradise spreads in the likes of a gas station.
"What is happening here is ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari Dark: "We live in constant danger to health."
The war comparison is appropriate.
The settlement area of Ogoni is a battlefield that has been fought for decades: more than 60 years ago, the first exploiters from Europe invaded here, in the 1980s with the later-executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa organized the first resistance, here the Shell Group had to stop its production in 1993 because it became too dangerous for its oil workers.
Today, the company is banned from returning to Ogoniland: While more than two million barrels of black gold are pumped out of the entire Delta region of the three-fold size of Switzerland with over 5,000 wells and 7,000 kilometers of pipelines a day, the oil fields in Ogoniland are broken, the company is too unstable.
Every few hundred meters steel frames like bizarre sculptures from the water: "Christbümchen" the heads of the holes are much too tenderly called.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them corroded to the mark.
Again and again, such a drill head breaks apart, says Akpobari, then a constant stream of crude oil runs into the water.
More than two billion liters have been flown into the Delta's ecosystem in 50 years, according to expert estimates: year after year, the amount of oil, as it entered the sea 21 years ago at the harry of the supertanker "Exxon Valdez" before Alaska - one of the largest environmental disasters in the history of humanity.
Whoever is responsible for the ongoing eco-GAU is disputed about it.
During the shell group sabotage and organized oil theft accounts for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists see crushing drill heads and lick pipelines as main contaminants.
Shell introduces significantly lower safety standards in Nigeria than usual in the world, and US scientist Richard Steiner introduced 2008 to the Group: the rate of defects on the lines alone is "a lot higher than elsewhere".
In a place that from a distance looks like an abandoned oil-smeared workshop under the open sky, the mangroves appear: they are fragmented and oil-smeared to the neck.
Under one of the many barrels that are partly connected to tubes, partly randomly scattered on the site, a fire flashes: an illegal little refinery.
In the barrel, the crude oil is heated over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the head of the group.
First, petrol penetrates through the pipes into the pick-up pot, later dripping out at the end of the line kerosene and finally diesel.
So Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of diesel of 300 litres daily: "That brings us 34,000 naira" - about 22 dollars.
Delta residents use the chronic fuel scarcity in the largest oil state in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
With just under 40 euros per litre of ridiculously low diesel prices, the illegal cooks can still be interrupted: for their raw material they get for nothing.
It comes from "Bunkers", which tap the pipeline network across Ogoniland: According to experts throughout Niger, at least 16 million litres of crude oil are lost every day.
However, only a disappearing small part of the provisionally stored raw material is illegally refined: the lion's share of organized criminal networks, including politicians and high-ranking military, are being filled in tankers and are ruining it on the world market.
The debate whether the environmental disaster is more due to the movements of the population or to the lax production mode is considered purely academic by the activist Akpobari.
"If the oil companies had not been perceived as invaders and had not destroyed the fishermen's livelihood so thoroughly, there would have been neither sabotage nor theft and illegal refineries."
In the meantime, however, Ogoni's relationship with Shell has been destroyed in such a way that only a deduction of the Group would be called into question: "Maybe other nationalities like the Chinese are more likely than better."
Michael's getting nervous.
"The highest time you're disappearing," says the muscular oilman.
"Every minute the soldiers can come."
If the illegal oil negotiators are caught by the special unit of the armed forces, they are not threatened with arrests, but they are likely to be a painful lubrication.
Like all Nigerians, the soldiers mainly from the state order also want to benefit from the raw material.
"This damn stuff has brought our country to the dog in every way," says Akpobari.
Investigators discover dangerous construction errors in A380 engines
The A380 seems to have a major security problem.
Researchers have discovered a possible fault of construction in the investigation of an emergency machine, which could lead to a "catastropical engine failure".
The Qantas airline now wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the Qantas-Airbus, which had not landed at the beginning of November, apparently had much more luck than they had known: The Australian Air Safety Authority has identified a major safety problem in its investigations in the engines of some A380 machines - and is now warning of a possible construction error.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: in the case of an oil hose compound, it could cause fatigue cracks and leaks, it was stated in an opinion published by the ATSB Authority on Thursday.
This could have led to "a catastrophic engine failure".
The engines produced by Rolls-Royce in 20 A380 aircraft were affected.
Among them is the Qantas-Airbus, which had to land in Singapore on 4 November.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
She filed a complaint to an Australian Federal Court in Sydney, which allows him to take further legal action against the company.
Qantas Chief Alan Joyce said his airline would claim damages for the incident at the beginning of November.
When the engine was burned, parts were dissolved and the carrying surfaces damaged.
Rolls-Royce made an oil fire the cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines have to be replaced worldwide.
The Australian investigators announced that they would carry out further safety tests on the superjumbos equipped with the engines concerned.
The safety recommendation was the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB spokesperson Martin Dolan.
The security problem has been considered to be sufficiently important to inform all concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas machine, the airline had kept its A380 fleet on the ground for weeks.
Singapore Airlines left about three of its eleven A380 temporarily on the ground.
The Lufthansa replaced the engine in an A380 as a precautionary measure.
The double-story plane is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
Landwide snowfall causes traffic chaos
Germany in white: snow has fallen almost all over the country overnight.
On many roads there are chaos, trains, and flights.
At least three people were killed in car accidents.
Winter freezes Germany: At icy temperatures almost the whole Republic is snowed on Thursday at night - which leads to traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and in the east there are partly 15 centimetres thick snow blankets.
On several motorways and many roads traffic is severely restricted.
At the A7 near Flensburg, the winter service was in continuous use, but was not finished with the snow that was constantly re-increasing.
In addition, violent boeons swept across the Baltic coast.
The Federal Office for Maritime Shipping and Hydrography (BSH) awaits on the Baltic Sea coast of Schleswig-Holstein from the morning on storm floods with water levels of 1.2 meters above the normal level.
In Saxony the snow associations on the motorways and federal roads led to considerable problems.
Therefore, according to the meteomedia weather center, the alarm level in Saxon Switzerland was said to be violet - the highest level at all.
In part, 30 centimetres of new snow fell there, fresh and strong winds caused renunciation.
There several trucks and cars stayed there during the night.
Also in Saxony-Anhalt, the police authorities reported major disturbances on the streets.
On the A2, snow and wind led to steady traffic and congestion.
The snowfalls affected A4 and A9 in Thuringia.
According to Deutsche Bahn, significant disturbances occur in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and in the north of Bavaria.
Snow on the tracks, overturned trees on the rails or destroyed overheads and tracks are the main problems.
In Saxony, long-distance transport from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In the Thuringian Saalfeld, an ICE had to stop his journey to Munich.
The 165 passengers were supplied by firemen and rescue agents with wool blankets, food and drinks on the train.
Snow winds swept over the streets.
At large German airports, the snow winds lead to numerous flight failures.
Some cancellations have already been reported in Munich, according to a speaker of the flight information centre.
According to a Fraport speaker, 40 flights have already been cancelled in Frankfurt am Main.
The winter service is in continuous use.
Although only a few stranded passengers are at the airport, there are still nearly 400 beds ready for them.
On many roads accidents already occurred on Wednesday evening.
In the evening, a truck driver was killed by a train on a railway crossing in Ostholstein.
The driver was easily injured.
Near Nuremberg there was a similar accident due to snow-covered roads: here too a truck was caught on a railway crossing because the vehicle remained stuck.
The driver died.
Four passengers were injured on the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore blocked until the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after she had crossed her car at Aschaffenburg on a smooth road.
However, the meteorologists have a good news: Although the snow will still be loose and powdery, it will be voracious with light boars.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea is hit by swift and stormy winds.
However, it remains very cold - anywhere up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for their twin towers
The Deutsche Bank wants to separate itself from its landmark: According to a newspaper report, the Moneyhouse is looking for buyers for the two office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
Up to 500 million euros could bring in the property.
Just now Deutsche Bank made its Group headquarters pretty: The twin towers in the Frankfurter Bankenviertel have been modernized; the bankers have now been allowed to return to their old workplace.
But now the financial group apparently wants to recover the costs for renovation - and is looking for a buyer for the two high houses, as the "Financial Times Germany" writes, calling on a speaker.
The speaker did not mention reasons for the proposed sale.
"We are always testing whether it is more sensible to own or sell property ourselves and then rent back," he said.
With this, Germany's largest credit institution is returning its headquarters after a short period of time.
The Bank had only taken over the double towers for 272 million euros in mid-2007 from the investors of an in-house fund and subsequently rehabilitated them in a difficult manner.
The energy conversion consumed the data after around 200 million euros.
A sale would probably bring the bank a lot of money.
According to industry experts the value of the newspaper’s towers, which have now been renamed Greentowers, is estimated to be around 500 million euros.
Whether the buildings are sold again to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor is currently open, said the speaker.
Thousands mourn for dead buddy
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand have thought of the spilled miners who have been declared dead after several explosions in a mine.
Still the bodies could not be bailed out because the security situation in the accident shaft is still precarious.
About two weeks ago, a violent explosion had occurred in the Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 miners aged between 17 and 62 were shed underground.
A sin had been released into the accident shaft, but had not discovered any trace of survivors.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and further subsequent explosions, no rescue forces could descend for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and experts assumed that there was no chance of survival for the buddy.
So far, the bodies could not be bailed out.
Now relatives and friends remembered the dead with a commemoration.
Tens of thousands of people had gathered on the New Zealand South Island during a radiant sunshine in Greymouth.
They'll be silent for two minutes.
29 tables were set up in honor of those who were thrown away, with helmets, lamps and the names of the buddies.
Images and personal items, including garments and surfboards, also found their place here.
In front of the country's government buildings, the flags blew half masts.
New Zealand had hoped that the miners would come back to the surface "from the depths of the earth," said New Zealand Prime Minister John Key to the participants in the commemorative celebration.
"But they never came home."
He could not conclude with the death of his son as long as he had not seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was thrown into the pit.
In addition to the Prime Minister and members of the victims, several foreign diplomats participated in the commemorative celebration.
At the first explosion on 19 November, miners of British and South African origin had also been shed.
Rescuers began to extinguish a fire inside the coal mine on the south island of New Zealand.
Once the explosive gases have been pushed out, it will begin to cool down the glowing temperatures inside the mine, said police president Gary Knowles to journalists.
Hell, warrior!
Does Splatter fit into the art cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn reopens old genre boundaries with his fighter-epos "Walhalla Rising".
What audience might the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought of when he shot "Walhalla Rising"?
A prisoner Viking warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his torments and with almost superhuman forces changes his opponents in a row - sounds ideal for young male viewers in search of bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to use rational killing methods and even tears his enemies out of the living body when he has bad mood.
On the other hand, Einauge, as he is actually called, doesn't say a word about the whole film, and the other figures can at most be torn to one or two sentences or some painful death cries.
Otherwise it is silent and engulfed in the creepy beautiful hills of Scotland, which the Viking world of about a thousand years ago offers the backdrop.
Ideal for adult cinematists with interest in existentialism and very quiet camera rides.
Well, if a movie has several target groups, only if they exclude each other.
Director Winding Refn has been considered a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino since his wild and styled drug dealer trilogy "Pusher", but refuses to make his works accessible to the Arthouse with a little more humor to the mainstream or a little less brutality.
Most art cinema friends should be deterred from the surrounding brain mass and the prints.
The action fans die at the latest from boredom when an eye breaks up with a force of violent Christian missionaries via ship to Jerusalem for freely interpretable reasons and holds an eternity in flea and fog before the team apparently arrives in America and continues to keep silent there.
So no wonder that "Walhalla Rising" did not find any cinema rental in Germany and has now only appeared on DVD.
This is particularly a pity because of the magnificent pictures, but also because behind the pretentious to bloodthroat facade a sometimes exciting piece of cinema that has earned some attention.
In this film it is not about dialogues or a rigorous action, it is all atmosphere, a film-worded fever dream.
And from that there is no escape for the viewer.
Refn hardly gives him a moment of relaxation and with his icy pictures and the dark trance-like soundtrack, he slowly gnaws his throat, but above all with the inconceivable hatred that beats him from the hearts of the figures.
Only a little blond boy, who is loyal to the eye, preserves such a thing as innocence, all the others are driven by anger.
On the most common of the one-eyeed hero whose motives are never explained, but who eventually becomes a warrior for enemies and temporarily allies from hell, possibly the ambassador of the Devil himself.
He means corruption, but perhaps only for those who are already corrupt.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired to anger, excitement and amazement.
An experience.
Ridiculous Earthworks
The IAEA Atomic Energy Authority has new indications of a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
However, the country is forced to comment on this - nor does it allow controls.
By midnight from 5th to 6th September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter planes attack a mysterious, cube-shaped building in Syria.
It is located on the banks of the Euphrates; the next larger city, 30 kilometres away, is Dair as-Saur.
Its name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) when it comes to the reactor that Syria has supposedly built in the quadrilateral with the help of North Korea, hidden in a valley that goes off the electricity.
According to a briefing by the US foreign intelligence service CIA of late April 2008, the reactor, which was also used under the name of the nearby village of el-Kibar, would have been well suited to produce plutonium from which nuclear weapons could be built.
For other purposes, on the other hand, the technique from the fifties is hardly sufficient.
The CIA presented a video presentation with blurry satellite images.
By computer animation, she faded into what components of the reactor should have been before destruction, which was a reduced copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear center.
In addition, she presented photographs showing the building from nearby or even the interior.
The reactor had been standing shortly before commissioning, it was said, but had not yet been equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, is hardly more known than at the time, yes, the puzzles have become bigger over time.
The former US President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA was quite sure before the attack that Syria was building a reactor in el-Kibar, but hardly saw any evidence that there was "an active nuclear weapons programme" in the country.
Some intelligence workers in Europe prefer to be more careful and speak only of an "adult reactor", even if they consider the CIA presentation "pussible".
They lack hard evidence, as do the IAEA.
When asked how safe it was to have a reactor in front of it, a high UN diplomat in the summer answered only lapidar, the IAEA had "enough material to ask questions".
Although the Syrians quickly turned aside the gunshot of the alleged "unused military building" and planned the site thoroughly.
However, in June 2008, an IAEA team under the former chief inspector Olli Heinone in el-Kibar found traces of uranium produced by humans.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite images from commercial providers via a Member State from the time immediately after the attack, which is expected to be more meaningful than those presented by the CIA.
However, these recordings are not available on the market because the unknown client - perhaps Israel - bought them exclusively.
Therefore, the IAEA cannot verify its authenticity independently.
Syria has always meant never running a secret nuclear program or building a reactor.
The uranium stems from the Israeli weapons, Damascus declared.
However, after analysis of the particles, the IAEA rejected this as unlikely.
Damascus has since refused to discuss it - as has the satellite images.
In addition, it prohibits control staff from second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the ruins of the broken building.
But Israel too is silently silent.
"We will never comment on this," recently Prime Minister Ehud Olmert confirmed the official position at the time of the attack.
Thus, since June 2008, the investigation of the case has been carried out without results and "is increasingly developing into a serious problem of credibility for the authority", as a high Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna admits - after all, there is a serious breach of the nuclear defence treaty in the area the IAEA is waiting for.
As a key to progress in the investigation, the IAEA clearly sees three other facilities that are "in functional connection" with the suspected reactor - and unlike these still exist.
The inspectors have so far not revealed what installations it is or what function they have or what it suspects.
According to the information provided by the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they are referred to internally by the IAEA as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, in turn derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) has identified these places and found a building complex at Masyaf on satellite images, most likely one of the suspect objects.
It may be located in or directly next to a military base - precisely with this justification, Syria refuses access to the three places.
In Vienna it is said that the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA would be sent by the USA in order to find out military facilities.
Because the nuclears had become aware of the facilities through a tip of the U.S. intelligence services.
The IAEA has information, including satellite photos, that material has been transported to and from the Euphrates between the three places and the quadrilateral.
A high Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the plants could be "related to fuel production".
However, there is "no indication of sensitive activities", i.e. uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is operated with uranium which is not enriched.
But where the uranium should have come from and where the plutonium should later be separated for the bomb, on these central questions there are always plausible assumptions.
It is also unclear whether debris that could store valuable traces has been stored in the three places.
As if the hundreds of truck loads had disappeared from the ground, no one wants information about where the bullet has stayed.
The salt mine al-Tibni, located just a few kilometres from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, which Syria examined in 1998 for its suitability as a storage site for radioactive waste, is considered unlikely to be the IAEA.
The former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley recently linked her to the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the renowned magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
However, recordings from the orbit show that Syria did earthwork in the three suspicious places and removed large containers after the IAEA had requested access.
This can be a coincidence, but it has hardly helped to eliminate the suspicion.
In addition, it is said in diplomatic circles that the IAEA has spent several months developing a plan for inspections there that should allow Syria to preserve any military secrets - only the effort shows how great the interest of inspectors is.
Indian, Damascus also turned this proposal down.
If Western diplomats in Vienna had objected a year ago that the reactor had been destroyed, therefore the matter had no urgency, about US ambassador Glyn Davies has been playing so-called special inspections for a few months, one of the sharpest means the Vienna nuclear authority has to carry out controls.
Although IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option for which I am open in the future", he still hesitates.
There is a high risk in this way: on the one hand, a majority in the Board of Governors of the IAEA need to do so, and some of the 35 countries represented there are anything but seeking an escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat points out, "What if they find nothing at all in the end?"
Love in Wartimes
Since Angelina Jolie started working on her nameless debut in summer, there has been trouble.
The script herself has written a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
Much more you don't know about it - but that's enough for unrest.
The rumor keeps the woman, a Muslim, falling in love with her Serbian rapist during the Yugoslavia War.
Bosnian women's associations immediately protested, and some of the shooting days planned in Sarajevo were transferred to Hungary in the short term.
In the meantime, the film has been shot in Hungary and in post production, but it is still being protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic from the organization of female victims of war wrote about the UN refugee relief work UNHCR to Jolie and demanded a meeting with the actress, has now reported a Bosnian newspaper - Jolie is himself ambassador to the UN refugee relief work.
She is not a diplomat - she offered women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, but they refused.
The meeting had to take place in Bosnia, says Hasecic.
There had been no love stories in rape camps, and Jolie's attitude towards the victims told her enough about the script.
According to the UN refugee relief agency, her organization has recommended that Jolie be released as an ambassador, reports the Guardian.
But what exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which was given its script to read, has, after some time, granted a shooting permit for Sarajevo - it is not quite clear why Jolie did not come anyway.
The young author himself says that she does not pursue any political intentions with her film, has worked hard into the Yugoslavia conflict, wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all the parties involved.
At the content, however, it remains vague.
A second synopsis of the film on the net, which then sounds quite different: The lovers knew about it before war broke out and met again when she, a Bosnian Muslim, was dragged into a Serbian camp in which he worked as a guard.
What sounds significantly different from the "rape victims" variant.
That Jolies film actually starts before the war - so much is safe.
The pressure on them, Jolie says, is "unfair and based on misinformation".
Now you can only get the hackers of Hollywood peace: by placing the script, as so many before, illegally on the net.
Nothing like gone here.
That evening, it's going to be a good time for the Irish.
No trace of grief.
For this, the home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA too much.
The fans jol with joy at cracking loud music, they pound with their feet.
The Bailey Pub in Southern Cork trembles because the players throw table tennis balls over a three-meter distance in beer cups - and meet.
"Bierpong" calls itself the bizarre spectacle, to win there are 500 euros victory premium plus tickets to Las Vegas for the World Beer Pong Championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy; this shrill drinking game and the restraining computer scientist, that doesn't really fit together.
And yet the 26-year-old is trying to amuse himself to distract himself from the drilling question of what the future will bring.
His plan is not to have fun in Las Vegas, he will hold application talks in New Zealand in January.
"I have a mellow feeling," he says.
"It's so far away from home and yet I don't have a job there."
After all, his girlfriend is waiting for him in Auckland - "she had ruck, pulling her wishful job as an event manager, maybe a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Because of bad prospects at home, two of Tanner's three siblings have already sought their happiness abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a job as IT consultant in London.
The boys go: It looks like the dancers on the island in many families.
100,000 Irish will probably leave the country in the near future, say experts from the Economic and Social Research Institute ESRI in Dublin.
By 2015, they even count on 200,000 migrants.
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants a severe loss.
If the forecasts are true, there will be a wave of migration comparable to that under which Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of the upswing, which brought great prosperity to the Irish, Tristesse is now again spreading.
The economic crisis is particularly uncertain for the young, well-trained Irish, for which it has only been uphill.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone was needed, there was money in abundance.
In the meantime, however, three out of ten women and men are under thirty without work.
In the Irish Times there are many letters of readers from young immigrants who complain: "Everything is going down the stream in Ireland."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers - but who can, goes away and our country is losing a whole generation."
"The latter, please, makes the light out."
Jura-Student Leanne Caulfield, President of the Irish Student Union, sees a bleak future, because the government is only an eye-catching company and does not offer the young people any more prospects for the future.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they have no strategy for creating new jobs," says the 20-year-old.
She observes how her fellow students hang from an unpaid internship to the next.
Her greatest concern, she says, is to have to emigrate in four years.
"This thought is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon are trying to occupy the subject positively.
McLarnon organises the WorkingAbroadExpo, a trade fair that offers a comprehensive service on work abroad.
"For professionals, work abroad is a great opportunity to take the first steps on the career leader," says the manager.
On his website photos show surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a galley service, but also brings freedom and fun.
How it feels to build something else, Seán O'Donovan has known for half a year.
Because there was nothing to do for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues on construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen, they are just moving up a fashion house.
In January, we will continue to Hanover or Berlin, to the next project.
In the meantime, O'Donovan rarely sees his home, because he makes extra layers to be able to pay off the credit for his house at home.
"The situation is already a bit crazy," he says, when he first steps over the threshold of his house after a long time.
"I earn money in Germany for a house in Ireland, in which I am almost never again."
He laughs a little bit and goes through cooled rooms.
The small house is located in a fine residential area with well-kept gardens, in the entrances parking large, expensive cars.
Together with a sister, O'Donovan bought the house for 380,000 euros for four years ago - 100 percent financed credit.
"There were crazy times, there was simple money without many questions," he says.
Is he afraid the credit could go wrong?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, pours hot tea and says, "I don't have children that I have to feed through and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch."
The structural engineer doesn't like the lamentation he often hears at the time.
"No one has to starve - our situation is by far not as dramatic as in earlier times here on the island," he says.
"Working abroad for a while, that's not the worst thing that can happen - maybe this will make us feel like Irish."
He laughs and tells of his father who went to England in the last major economic crisis.
"After seven years he was back and life continued in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Leave the future open and just look at how things are going with life elsewhere.
A few years of work in London he has already been behind him and why should it not work well in New Zealand for him and his girlfriend?
One thing is still there, however, that concerns him properly in these days: the celebration for his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He fears it could end up in a social welfare party.
"Not too many emotions," he says, drinking a big swallow of his beer.
"Well, that sounds scary."
"Let's call it a way party, very easy, with some friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The Democratic Routine
The democratic movement in Latin America is becoming stronger, as is the support of private companies.
Crime is a greater problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, the influence of Brazil is greater than that of the United States.
These results were the Latinobarómetro survey conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist.
This survey has been conducted regularly since 1995 and thus shows the exchange of views in this region.
Two facts are particularly evident in this year's September and October survey.
First of all, the good mood in Latin America
Secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its most important institutions.
In many countries on the South American Pacific coast, the democratic movement has increased sharply (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has grown by about 6% annually since 2002, the number of democracy advocates has increased from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
This trend can also be seen in Mexico, where the economy has been recovering since last year's severe collapse.
However, only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries in the region, are convinced democrats, which lowers the regional average (see Chart 2).
About 44% of the respondents explained that they were satisfied with the democratic practice of their country, as many as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (diagram 3).
About 34% trust the Congress of their country and 45% trust its government. Both values correspond to those of the last year, but show a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% and 24% respectively).
A decade ago, Latin America's economic crises undermine the efforts to achieve more democracy.
This also continued during the world economic crisis, possibly because the countries of Latin America experienced only a short period of recession and recovered quickly.
Furthermore, the poor were picked up by a stronger social network.
(According to reports by the UN Economic Commission for Latin America this week, the poverty rate in Latin America rose only slightly and fell by 32% this year again.)
However, there are strong differences of mood from country to country (see diagram 4).
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of divorced President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread thought of progress.
This is less so in Mexico and Central America, where recession was more noticeable and violent crimes increased.
Only for the second time since the start of the survey have many respondents in Latin America seen a greater problem in their country than in unemployment (see Chart 5).
Approximately 31% say that either they themselves or a family member last year were victims of a crime. However, compared to 38% last year, the values fell and thus reached the lowest level since 1995.
Increasing economic performance is reflected in the stronger support of the private and market economies: approximately 71% of respondents stated that the private sector is essential for development, 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
About 58% explained that only the market economy can make progress in their country, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela have maintained this view (and 80% are for a private sector), although their left-wing president, Hugo Chávez, nationally states many private companies.
According to 19% of respondents (18% last year) Brazil has the largest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% last year).
The respondents in Mexico and most countries of Central America, on the other hand, see the most influential country in the United States, taking over this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua of Venezuela.
A suffrage
No one had expected the elections on 28 November to be perfect in Haiti.
But the facts far exceeded the fears of the electorate who hastened to help the affected country.
Overcrowded constituencies, multiple votes, constituencies in the Rinnstein, destroyed constituencies and intimidation were only part of the problems.
Electoral venues opened with hours of delay.
Many Haitians, many of whom had become homeless by the January earthquake, wandered around looking for a choice.
Finally, some gave up completely.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some suspected top-ranking riders, demanded the withdrawal of election results due to alleged fraud.
There have been some violent protests throughout the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the head of the UN mission in Haiti, described the choice "as quite good in many matters".
According to a careful statement by observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community "these irregularities, however serious they may be, do not necessarily invalidate the process".
In other words, the show goes on.
The Electoral Authority, which is said to be obliged to the unpopular separatist President René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, will announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected election is scheduled for January.
There is still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, the rap musician Michel Martelly and the former First Lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial indifference.
If Jude Célestin, who gets little or no consent from the electorate, is declared the winner of the election, this could lead to problems.
Due to the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of the earthquake victims are still living in tents, a small vote was feared.
On the election day, many Haitians were prevented by a lack of organisation from voting.
About 250,000 cards required to vote were not yet distributed shortly before the election.
It's a lot at stake.
The donor countries consider a legitimate, recognised government to be an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
The Haitians themselves are of the same opinion.
Home in the middle
In the weeks following your husband’s sudden death, Argentina’s president, Cristina Fernández, learned a wave of sympathy that drove her popularity rate by 20 points to over 50%. That’s the highest value since her election in 2007.
However, whether you can help to re-elect this next year depends on whether the clearly mourning Cristina Fernández is more compromiseable than her late husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The signs for this are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who also guided economic policy after the election of his wife, often drew up budget plans that did not fully take into account tax revenue, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the President-in-Office to issue the extra revenue according to his own discretion.
On paper, the Fernández government lost the majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition is divided, and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on October 27 led to further squabbles.
Some regime critics from the ranks of ruling Peronists stood behind Cristina Fernández.
But after chaotic meetings (with which one parliamentarian beat another in the face and others accused the government of bribery) the Congress failed to adopt the budget for 2011.
"I will not discuss this," the President said.
The 2010 budget will now also be valid for the next year, which will allow the President to spend more money on his own initiative.
The economy is running hot: it is likely to grow by up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently 11.1%, but numerous private estimates - and wage demands from the trade unions - represent almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took office in 2003, when Argentina was shaken by economic crises, explained growth and poverty reduction as his main objectives, not inflation reduction.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, harassed the private sector, and cleaned the National Institute for Statistics and Population Counting INDEC, which subsequently beautifuld official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández now take a more moderate course?
She called on the private sector and the trade union leaders to talk.
According to official statements, wage increases will be limited to 18% next year.
The high world market prices for Argentina's agricultural products have boosted the economy.
Inflation, however, undermined growth by a large devaluation in 2002.
For this reason, Cristina Fernández may want to join the rest of the world again in financial terms.
At the beginning of this year, the government reached an agreement with investment holders who had rejected the country’s earlier re-indebtedness in 2001.
Now, Fernández seems to be pushing an agreement with the lenders from the Paris Club to whom she owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners had always rejected an IMF review, as is usual elsewhere.
But last month, the Minister of Economic Affairs Amado Boudou announced that the fund will provide "technical support" when creating a new national consumer price index. It looks like this is the first step towards cleaning the INDEC.
It is not known whether Fernández will be politically active even after the end of her term of office without the support of her husband.
If so, it needs the support of the middle class, which is largely enough of Kirchnerism.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy that was brought to her will be abated.
If she wants to win another choice, she has to decide whether she is silent and silent in taking many political decisions from her husband.
Weak applause for China
Taiwan’s voters are slowly approaching a closer connection to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of its great brother beyond the seas?
On 27 November, more than 7.5 million voters were elected, 70% of all electors, to elect mayors and councillors in the five districts, and this is considered to be a broad assessment by President Ma Ying-jeou.
Through the construction of groundbreaking business relations, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma is itself a symbol of relations with the mainland. His policy has changed the relationship with the Chinese mother country for the first time since 1949.
Ma passed the test, but it's very short.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) has three of the five mayors, it received no majority of votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progress Party (DPP), which supports a greater independence of Taiwan, received almost 50% of the votes, the KMT received 45%.
In a presidential election, this would have meant problems for Ma.
Since his election two years ago, his party's vote has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even joined the city councils together with the KMT.
During the election, there were the usual events in Taiwan, such as truck convoys with tie makers, flag-swivelling mass movements and only sparsely dressed dancers.
There was even the mandatory, mysterious murder attempt.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan and honorary chairman of the KMT gave a speech on a KMT candidate on the eve of the election,
When a man shot him from the crowd in the face. Lien was wounded and an surrounding audience was killed.
It is not clear whether the shooter wanted to kill Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
Regardless of that, the Tsai Ing-wen, the DPP leader, has affected the election and put the DPP in a bad light, which the KMT has given more votes.
Perhaps China was the biggest winner of the campaign.
Remarkably, relations with the mainland have not been addressed.
Instead, the candidates discussed plans for social housing and job creation.
The Taiwanese love their actual independence and reject China's military threat.
For this reason, the KMT does not like to highlight its relations with the Beijing government.
This time, however, the DPP also prevents the anti-Chinese feelings from provoking too much.
She responded to the new awareness that Taiwan’s economy cannot survive without China.
On the other hand, I would like to confirm that the majority of Taiwanese support its China policy.
The Beijing government will continue to pursue its strategy of attracting Taiwan back to the Community with economic incentives.
China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment security and medical cooperation.
Certainly, it also wants political integration, but the most important first.
It would rather wait until after the 2012 presidential elections.
The DPP has now reinvented itself.
Two years ago she was severely weakened: former party leader Chen Shui-bian was in prison for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he vehemently advocated absolute independence.
But under Tai's rule, a new generation of moderate politicians developed and the DPP struggles for the voices of the professionals and the youth.
Tsai found great approval as the DPP's presidential candidate, such as Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Her party is now doing everything to show that she too is able to establish close relations with Beijing.
Tsai plans an idea forge as a point of contact between the DPP and China. However, this requires prejudicial discussions.
Tsai publicly stated that her party offered a "trustworthy alternative" to Mas' pre-speed approach to China.
Chen seems very upset about this change.
From his cell, he said that DPP candidates would have done better to insist on Taiwan's independence.
He even asked the Pragmatist Su to give up the presidential candidate.
Even without Chen's interference, the DPP makes it difficult to choose its potential candidates.
The KMT will have to undergo its own self-analysis.
Mas values are bad, despite rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to lead their election without him.
The main reasons for his unpopularness seem to be unemployment and the ever-increasing gap between the poor and the rich.
According to a KMT speaker, he will redesign his cabinet as well as the local facilities.
The strong appearance of the DPP suggests that Taiwan only supports a limited re-approachment.
At the same time, most Taiwanese people see economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there is already no return."
Grammy nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was surprisingly awarded in the category Newcomer of the year
If you appear on the request of a president, people will notice.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to perform at the 2009 Nobel Prize Ceremony. Now the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer was above all nominated for this year’s Grammy in the Newcomer category of the year.
In view of the fact that Spalding has already been a celebrated star in the jazz scene since her album "Esperanza" in 2008, the nomination appears a bit unusual. However, it corresponds to the Grammy rules, according to which an artist may have released at most three albums before the release of the album with which he became familiar in the general public.
Her ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", is certainly a step forward. And with her swinging voice and a good feeling for pop, funk and Latin music, one can quietly compare Spalding with Norah Jones 2003, whose great success in 2003 as a jazz performer in this category of nomination Spaldings comes closest.
The album "History" of Vijay Iyer Trios was also nominated in the category of instrumental albums. This favorite of the critics experienced a huge success.
The competitors Iyers include Moody 4B of the experienced saxophone player James Moody and "Positotly" of keyboardist John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a predatory favorite from New Orleans and a frequent guest in HBO's "Treme", was awarded in the category of contemporary jazz, where albums by Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber are usually found.
The Secret Societ of wild Stampunk musician Darcy James Argue was given due attention in the category of large group. Thus, he opposes the Billy Childs Emsemble with his chamber jazz and adventurous Dave Holland and his octet, whose life ablum "Pathways" is a good example of a bassist as a democratic bandleader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in classic categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd Grammy Award contain a colorful mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The list of Michael Daugherty's "Deux Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra with five voices, and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestral work, with three voices.
Among the nominees with links to Southern California is the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt with his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles". This piece was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonics and premiered at Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The composer Avner Dorman, based in L.A., was also nominated for his Mandolin concerto.
Classical nominations are divided into 13 categories, from orchestra, opera, choir to solo recordings.
In the category of classic producers, five artists were nominated this year - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the nominated classical albums are Bruckner's Symphony No. 3 and 4 of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" played by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey's "Dreamhouse" by Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" by various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" by Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Choir.
In the opera category, Berg's "Lulu by the orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse's "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho's "L'Amour de Loin" by the German Symphony Orchestra Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin's "The Enchanted Wanderer" by the orchestra and choir of Mariinsky Theater; and Arthur Sullivan's "Ivanhoe" by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
As composers, Pärt was nominated for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" for a Grammy.
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 was premiered and recorded on January 4 in Disney Hall by the L.A. Philharmonic under the direction of Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The 30-minute piece bears the title "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Chodorkovsky, who is in prison in Russia.
Dorman's "Mondolinenkonzert" received a nomination in the category Instrumentalsolo with orchestra.
The composer from L.A. stated that he had written the 15-minute piece specifically for the mandolin artist Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New-Yorker Metropolis Ensemble.
"I used sounds from the Middle East and numerous North African sounds and rhythms," said Dorman in a telephone interview.
The conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category Orchestra performance for a recording of Strawinski's works with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his direction.
The pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, organist Paul Jacobs, violinist Julia Fischer and Harfinist Sarah Schuster Ericsson were nominated as instrumental soloists.
This year, only women were nominated as vocal soloists, including Anne Sofie of Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonova, Vivica uchex and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category Classic Crossover, the soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song".
Mosque in Temecula wins the approval of the Planning Committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula found the unanimous commitment of the local planning committee after a five-hour, often heated public hearing.
Critics challenged the project to promote both terrorism and traffic congestion.
However, according to a statement from the Commission on Wednesday evening, the new religious centre will comply with local regulations and become an aesthetic eye-catcher.
"The project is supported by many good people - by Christians, Jews, Bahais, and many others," said Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic Centre of Temecula Valley on Thursday morning.
"As an American, it makes me proud."
"It shows that justice reigns."
"There are only a few opponents," he added.
"They're just very loud."
"In this valley wonderful people live."
The meeting began at 18:00 and the discussions for and against the construction of the center lasted almost until midnight, with the votes on both sides being fairly evenly distributed according to Press Enterprise.
The debate was continued on the newspaper's website.
"There is no America anymore," said a comment.
"It is another planet of monkeys, and the statue of freedom is dead in the sand."
"America is at the end."
Planed Islamic centers have also led to protests in other parts of the country, e.g. near Ground Zero, the scene of the terrorist attacks on the City of New York on 11 September 2001.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud called Harmush to be nonviolent.
His community with about 135 families has lived peacefully in Riverside County for years. But they wished for a larger and better place than the warehouse they rented together with a manufacturer for water filter facilities.
The new, approximately 2,300 m2 mosque in Mediterranean style is expected to have two minarettes and become about 13m high.
It is to be built on the approximately 17,500 m2 plot on Nicolas Road near Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still object to the project at the city council.
Arsenic-resistant microbes could allow new life forms on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a foreign species of bacteria, which can, among other things, live on arsenic, opens up new opportunities for new forms of life on earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists have discovered this unusual bacterium here on earth, in their view it is a sign that a life is possible even without the elements considered vital to life.
"This organism has two possibilities."
"He needs phosphorus or arsenic to grow."
"This makes it something very special, although it's almost a kind of 'foreign' life form," said Paul C.W. Davies of Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which appears on Thursday in the online issue of Science magazine.
To date, six main elements have been considered vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But as the scientists found out, the bacterium in the Mono Lake California is growing even further when it replaces phosphorus with arsenic.
"You can still wonder what else is possible," said Ariel D. Anbar, co-author of Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in the search for extraterrestrial life, as scientists must recognize life and its forms, according to Anbar.
The study deals with microbes found on Earth.
The announcement of a press conference, in which no details of the discovery were announced, gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could act from the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that in other planetary systems organisms can start biochemical processes with the help of other elements and that the 'standard elements' we believe are absolutely vital are not necessarily specified," said Charles Cockell, professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute of the Open University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel was not part of the research team.
"This work is a novel because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures, one element can be replaced by another," Cockell added.
This discovery was not accidental.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon from the NASA Astrobiological Institute, which led the study, chose the Mono Lake due to its high arsenic content.
As arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, it assumed that microbes exposed to both might be able to replace one element with the other.
"The toxicity of arsenic is mainly due to the fact that it is chemically similar to phosphorus."
"This makes it difficult for organisms to distinguish one element from another."
"But the difference is so great that arsenic works differently than phosphorus. It comes into our biochemical system where it almost lubricates everything," explains Anbar.
The researchers suspended the bacterium GFAJ-1 from increasing arsenic concentration. It adapted and grew.
Although the microbe grows better in phosphorus, it can also survive in arsenic, shows that an arsenic-based lifeform can occur naturally, either on earth or on another planet or moon, on which arsenic occurs more frequently.
According to Jamie S. Foster, professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic is not new, but so far there was no working example.
Arsen was more common in the early earth years, she says, so science has assumed that early life forms used it.
"This is a reason for the assumption that life can also have developed differently than in the early days of the earth," says Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Health Authorities.
Other stolen exhibition dogs found in Compton
The remaining two of the four exhibition dogs stolen in front of a Bellflower motel were found from Thursday, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff.
The four exhibition dogs - two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared on Tuesday, when unknowns stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express Van, where the animals were housed in front of a Bellflower Motel 6 at night, according to the authorities statements.
Two of the dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon, and the last two on Wednesday evening, explains Steve Whitmore, a speaker of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is: the dogs are well up," says Whitmore.
"You're in good condition."
"They were returned to their legitimate owners."
Whitmore did not detail the location of the dogs, nor the circumstances that led to their discovery.
"The investigations are still under way."
"We don't want to say anymore," explains Whitmore.
"We're following a few tracks."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available for information on Thursday.
They took their two dogs in a district animal shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
Representatives of the Sheriff found the van and the two dogs in different places in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a three-year-old male, and Didi, a ten-month-old bitch, were, according to the authority statement, intact.
But the Corgis Bunny and Peter, who wanted to introduce Rickard and Peek to the competition this week on behalf of their Japanese owners, remained missing until Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were on this weekend because of the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach in the city because Trace was to participate in the competition.
As Peek told the Times on Wednesday, the other dogs should participate in other competitions on the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show.
South California is a stop on the almost one month tour of the couple from dog show to dog show.
On Monday evening, Peek and Rickard checked in the motel.
They often stay in Motels and park their van in front of their room window.
They took three more dogs - a boxing cub, a Parson Russell Terrier and a Brittany - into their motel room.
The thick Akitas and Corgis stayed in the van because it was cooler there.
They left the window wide open so that the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car stolen on Tuesday at 6:00.
Peek promised anyone who could make a reference to the Corgis a finder's wage. Microchips were implanted for identification to the animals.
On Thursday it was not yet determined whether a finder's wage is paid.
The lion roars again after the judicial approval of the MGM restructuring
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got green light for a new start.
On Thursday, a New York concurrency judge officially blessed the "preparing" glauber plan to eliminate the debt of $5 billion and pave the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company for new movies and television shows.
According to Thursday’s statements, the plan meets the requirements of US bankruptcy law, so that the restart of MGM under the direction of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass’s entertainment, is no longer in the way. Barber and Birnbaum will present the slightly speculated studio as the main manager.
The number of employees is reduced from over 400 to about 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 actually will not enter into force until JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned $500 million bond to finance the new MGM productions.
At the moment, a consortium of the investment bank, which itself brings in $75 million, heads the company. The funding is expected to stand by mid-December.
The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 with the order to the investment bank Moelis & Co, the management of the company that fought with interest payments of $300 million/year to help solve their financial problems.
In August, the managing director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and restructuring expert, who became known for his work with Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis & Cooper's efforts to solve MGM's financial concerns and to pay out the more than 140 fans of the studio lasted longer than expected.
After months of discussions, the parties decided at the end of 2009 to offer the company for sale.
But the auction attracted only a few bidders and no one wanted to pay the $2 billion required by the creditors.
In the spring of this year, everything began from the beginning when the MGM team started the restructuring plan, which after months of debate and internal disputes was finally signed by the creditors at the end of October.
If MGM has officially survived the bankruptcy in the next few weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a bonus of several million dollars for their work.
The share for Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, is $9.5 million.
Cooper, who was paid $375,000 a month for the management of the company, received a $4 million success bonus.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM. This year, the studio released only one film and created a year plan with seven or eight films to be released in the early 2012 cinemas.
They also plan two films after "Der Klein Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio needs a separate bond between $265 million and $275 million for its financial share in these two films, which are to be created under the direction of Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who has financed approximately 18% of the MGM loan, tried a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, whose largest shareholder he is.
However, the last negotiations between the two companies did not result.
Tech Toys balances your gift budget
This year’s favorite among the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both players can tear a considerable hole into your gift budget.
An iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for $99, while the price for a Kinect game corresponds to about 10 classic jump ropes or about 48 doses of Play-Doh.
But you can save your gift budget.
Recently I visited three electronic toys at $80 three national toy dealers - a whale mart, a toy "R" Us and a BJ's Wholesale Club.
I immediately realized that Moore's law had entered into force. This year, the technology toys are more powerful and cost a little less than last year.
And although fewer new toys appear with its own website, on the best known of this kind, Webkinz and Club Penguin, you will find a wider offer.
There are more and more button cell-powered toys on the market, and many contain rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(If not stated otherwise, all prices of Toys "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for children from 3 years of age) are plush figures, the size of guinea pigs that sing a note when you press their belly.
Once press corresponds to a note, by multiple pressing you can play a song.
Several sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony.
Attention: Once you have started pressing, you can no longer stop.
For a combination of singing and dancing, the Dance Star Mickey (Fisher Price $60, for children from 2) is the best choice.
Based on the Elmo live technology developed last year, the animatronic doll offers interplays such as 'Simon says', and thanks to the new hinge feet with wheel blockage it dominates the Moon walk.
Children who test the device use Mickey as a dance teacher. However, their parents complain about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of 80s, remember Alphie, one of the first computerized learning toys.
Now he's back (Hasbro/Playschool, $40, for children from 3), with a whole bunch of question cards, with which a car ride can become a lesson, with a better knower with autocorrection function as a teacher.
If you do not want to trust your smartphone, there are three independent alternatives here.
MobiGo from VTech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most user-friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard. However, the games included are not as instructive as those on the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12), which is equipped with a new brighter screen after Leapster's first major revision of the Leapster series.
None of the versions are compatible with older cassettes.
iXL from Fisher-Price ($90 for children from 3 to 7) uses a system similar to iTunes for the games and eBooks, and thanks to the SD card drive, family photos can also be viewed on it.
Finally, there is Scrabble Flash ($30 from Hasbro, for children from 8). The five blocks are not larger than a match box and have their own LED screen.
The game is about putting together the blocks before the time runs out. It is great for an improvised book-stab competition.
More and more toys have some kind of online connection.
If you go alone after the offer in the toy shops, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important.
To give your child an online animal at Club Penguin, you can buy a Disney Club Penguin 2 Mix 'N Match Figure Package ($5 for children from 6 to 12) containing a coin with a secret code.
When you enter the code online, your child will receive enough credits for two more parts at the Club Penguin Store.
They can be roller shoes or a puffle stuff.
The latest head cell-powered micromachine, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children from 5) is no greater than the head of your toothbrush.
The beetle moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs in any direction.
It's fun to send him through a clumsy garden.
And he's got a lot to do with it.
Ours fell from the kitchen table and even survived for some time in the mouth of our dog.
Police operations in China are becoming softer
Like a training officer, Tang Shenbin went over an urban square, checked his nervous subordinates and gave orders with military authority and damped voice.
He wanted his female members of the Chengguan - China's robust guards of urban order, feared and despised for their arbitrary razzia and their dependence on violence - to impress the audience.
"Just stand!"
"Look straight ahead!"
"Show them," he whispered to them, "how pretty girls are!"
Four girls, hardly growing up to the teen's age, with white gloves and identical olive green jackets and pants stood tight.
Four pairs of black pumps were in straight order.
Four neat hats sat perfectly on the hair held with blue-white striped loops.
"They look average for me," says Mr. Tang.
"Models are pretty."
Several governments have already tried to polish the image of China's city inspectors.
In a city, all new applicants must have a university degree.
The province of Guangdong introduced a brilliant blue uniform instead of the greyish green.
Wuhan in Central China replaced violence by understars: in 2009, according to 50 officials, they surrounded an improperly positioned snack truck and stared at the operator until he packed up after half an hour and left the place.
Xindu, a district of Chengdu with 680.000 inhabitants, wants to change the image fundamentally.
Since 2003, 13 women have been strengthening the urban police strips. They have been selected special due to their appearance, their good figure and their youth.
They're supposed to give the groovy police a softer, feminine aspect.
But unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson would hardly succeed in improving the bad picture the Chinese have of these city orders.
Right, the critics say.
Unlike the police, these officials may enforce the urban laws only with the help of fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely show a different picture.
In January 2008, officials in the province of Hubei beat an audience to death when he filmed it with his cell phone as they beat down a protest against a garbage dump.
Last year, a training manual of Beijing officials was stolen and published on the Internet, describing how criminals can be beaten without bloodshed.
This year a Shanghai watermelon dealer suffered brain injuries after a handful of five officials.
A video game, which is running out of violence, which can be downloaded from the Internet, shows officials trained in China in an attack on street dealers.
"Chengguan scares the government," the National Newspaper China Daily last year, after further controversy regarding tactics.
The newspaper demanded a "real thorough cleaning".
Skeptics are clearly insufficient in the current approach.
When the district sought eight female recruits by ad in October, an editorial in the Beijing Evening News asked whether the women had real tasks or should only serve as an optical distraction.
Probably both.
According to ad, women aged 18 to 22 were sought with good figure and "harmonic facial features".
They should be above average - over 1.5m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
The employment relationship ends with the 26th year.
According to the officials, the activity for women over 25 is too strenuous.
"The most important thing is her image," announced an unnamed district official at the practically government website Rednet.com.
" Whether the candidates get the job depends first on their external appearance, such as size, weight, facial features, etc."
Then the temperament and the "inner qualities" come.
"Woman Chengguan are like flower vases," he said, adding, "but beyond that, they still have other duties."
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Director of the District's City Administration, does not wish to concur with this description,
But admitted that in China there are no standards of size for both sexes.
The same applies to uniform facial features.
Whether this is equated with a good look is controversial in China.
But people with disabilities or physical disorders do not need to apply.
"Unfortunately, we cannot use lambs or bucklids here," says Mr. Zheng.
"Your image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who patrolled on the Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old, has apple pastries and a well-shaped mouth.
She did not feel as a sexist that such great value was placed on her appearance.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asks with ironic gaze.
Her colleague with the dimples, 21-year-old Xu Yang, commented, "We have the task of representing the image of the city."
According to their data, they do not regret the short attitude as they have more ambitious career plans than simply to push dealers through the streets to prevent them from doing business.
Every morning the stretch deals with about twelve road dealers who try to sell as many breads and tofu dishes as possible on foot or on a bicycle before they are chased.
"Mr. Wang, please get out of here."
"We have told you this so often!" explains Frl. Xu to a dealer who had fled on foot and had temporarily left his noodle kitchen attached to a bicycle car in the lurch.
According to the officials, the activity is more monotonous than strenuous.
"It's the same thing almost every day," explains Huang Jing, 20, who studies sales in leisure.
"All routine."
One reason for this is that the female officials are not allowed to confiscate the goods of the dealers, such as their male colleagues.
They can only threaten offenders to report them to their male superior.
This is intended to protect them from public animosities that officials in China are often exposed to.
This year, hundreds of residents of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, ransacked after the rumors, Chengguan officials had killed a merchant.
More than a dozen police officers and Chenguan officials were injured during the night incident, 14 government vehicles were overthrown or set on fire.
Xindu has been spared from such violence.
But unrest is not to be ruled out.
Just two blocks away from the quiet Baonguang Square, where the female officials patrolled this morning, over 50 people gathered at a street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle that was repaired against the regulations on the sidewalk instead of in a workshop.
The owner shouted Zeter and Mordio.
After 15 minutes of hesitation, the officials with a gruesome face walked the way to their vehicles and continued with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a male strip coordinator, stayed behind, turning his white name tag around to remain anonymous.
Like their colleagues, the coordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supportive role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
"Sometimes we go verbal."
"Sometimes but also physically," explains Mr. Li soberly.

Procurator will not sue Senator Ensign
Prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice have acquitted Senator John Ensign of allegations raised against him after his affair with a former constituency assistant and his attempt to provide her husband with a lobbying activity, the lawyers of the Senator announced on Wednesday.
This decision brings an end to the most serious legal accusation against Senator Ensign, the Republican from Nevada. To the scandal that gave headlines throughout the country and left his career a damper, he was considered as a possible presidential candidate of the Republican for 2012.
As Senator Ensign's office announced, he was "highly pleased" about the judgment after the one-year investigation.
However, the Senate's Ethics Committee could impose another discipline.
According to Ensign's lawyers, they were informed by the Ministry of Justice that the investigations against Senator Ensign had been stopped and that no further charges were made in this case.
The Ministry of Justice did not want to comment on the case.
The judgment was a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice. In your opinion, there was sufficient evidence that Ensign had disregarded the lobbying ban.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents, which were first published in October 2009 in the New York Times, gave rise to the suspicion that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his electors, helped with lucrative orders to buy his silence about an affair with Hampton's wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton worked as treasurer during an election campaign Ensigns.
Ensign contacted some political friends to get Hampton to work. According to the documents and interrogations he took over for them after the hire of Hampton's lobbying.
Since Hampton was still in Ensign's election team recently, he was not allowed to do lobbying for his former employer or the entire Senate for a year.
According to Ethics experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, who had been closely friends before the affair, was against the so-called ban on rotational lobbying.
According to the published indices, "it seems that it is all about an agreement and the violation of the turn-door statues," says Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer specializing in the defense of clients who are in the government's visor.
While the Ministry of Justice officially refused to announce the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other Ethic lawyers said that the ministry seemed very cautious in taking political charges after a number of defeats that were pursued by the media with great interest, including the decision last year to drop the charge against former Senator Ted Stevens for misbehavior's misbehaviour.
Public prosecutors "are obviously horrendous," said Melanie Sloan, president of the Association "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington" (an organisation whose aim is to combat corruption in the US Parliament and Governments), a group of lawyers who brought various charges against Mr. Ensign to court.
"This basically means that senior government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, Chief Defender of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he had received a phone call from a prosecutor on Monday and another the next day he was told that the Ministry would not raise complaints against his client.
Mr. Ensign's defenses had cooperated with the prosecutors to convince them that the Senator, as his office repeated in a statement on Wednesday, "acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to explain more precisely the legal arguments he had put before the prosecutors.
"I don't think I'm going into the discussion details between the Ministry of Justice and me. Only so much is said: We believe we have made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Electoral Commission decided to terminate the investigations for a separate complaint by the Ethics Group, after which a payment of $96,000 of Mr. Ensign's parents had violated the Hamptons' Federal Electoral Act.
The Electoral Commission said that there had not been enough evidence that the money was something other than a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada, which for a long time supported the Senator, was one of the companies where Mr. Hampton found work with Mr. Ensign.
An e-mail of December 2008 shows that, after Mr. Hampton continued as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensing's Chief of Staff, John Lopez, had an interview with Mr. Hampton, in which he told him that he was "knocking" at the Ministry of the Interior for one thing.
Mr. Ensign was also appointed for lunch with Mr. Hampton and another customer from Nevada, Allegiant Air, and asked the Minister of Transport to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after he had hired Mr. Hampton for lobbying.
Last year, for the first time, information about this affair came to the public, Mr. Ensign apologized to his voters and gave up his position in the Senate, where he had stood fourth in the rank of Republicans.
After he had not noticed for many months, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was pursuing a third term in the Senate.
In the announcement that Mr. Ensign is no longer the goal of police investigation, his press spokesman, Jennifer Cooper, said the Senator hopes that the Ethics Commission will follow the example of the Ministry of Justice very quickly and put its investigations in place.
"Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his hard work in the service of people in Nevada," she said.
Cheshire's call calls on Twitter
Half a dozen of them were tipping away in the constituencies in the courtroom.
In the minute they sent their reports about cruel witnesses via Twitter.
At the end, the defense said, there were more than 140,000 Twitter reports about the process of rape and beds-chained children in a house that was going up in flames.
On Thursday, Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of killing three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, will find an official end when the judge's ruling on the death sentence that the jury has pronounced falls.
But Mr. Haye's lawyers have already filed applications with the court, presented the reasons for an appeal, and are going to deal with the courts for years.
One of the most provocative reasons is that due to the intensive reporting of the process - even by the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters - a "circus atmosphere" and a so widespread, immediate penetration of touchy details has come, so that the jury was inadmissably influenced by public indignation.
This opposition could cause the appellation courts to deal with the question of whether the new technologies will require new rules in the courtroom.
"As I have experienced it during this process, I believe that it is really a danger if the introduction of new technologies into the courtroom influences the right of each individual to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Haye's main defender.
Last week, the chairman, Jon C. Blue of the Supreme Court, briefly rejected the applications by decision, when he said that the New Media would be "carefully controlled" and that there would be no evidence that the jury had been driven by passions.
But that was certainly not the last word on this matter.
For decades, court rulings have found that reporting on famous and notorious cases raises doubts about the fairness of a trial.
In its historic decision of 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States annulled the judgment against Dr. Sam Sheppard, an osteopath from Cleveland who was supposed to have killed his wife, and said in his decision that there would have been a "carneval atmosphere in the courtroom" because of the new media.
Some people believe that the TV series and the feature film "On the Escape" are based on this crime.
Some lawyers say that court rulings, which Mr. Haye's convictions consider half a century later, could follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the communication routes from the courtroom that were still unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a good reason to be alarmed about the influence of the new media in processes that are being persecuted by a broad public," said John J. Donohue III, professor at Stanford Law School, who examined the death penalty in Connecticut. According to his report, it is arbitrarily imposed.
Professor Donohue said that some appellation courts might be fascinated by the idea that limiting immediate communication from the courtroom could make the processes fairer.
The Twitter issue is only one of many who explain Mr. Hayes' lawyers to discuss for years and thus delay a conviction.
The defenders also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes might have been pre-condemned when Judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them cruel crime scene photographs during the jurors' selection.
Some of the jurors have said that photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and their tutor, Hayley, 17 years old, and Michaela, 11 years old, they would have filled with aversion.
The defenders say that they would also call into question the constitutionality of the death penalty Constitution, and argue that the judge falsely exchanged a juror who had been a critic of the prosecutor's office, and that he might have exerted undue pressure on the judgment when he made the unusual decision to release the jury over the weekend.
The jurors were not isolated.
But their arguments about the influence of detailed reporting on the process may be of greatest interest.
In a judgment challenge they filed last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed by the candidates during the election campaign for the governor's office and for the American Senate.
They argued that the new media had continuously rekindled the flames of emotions about the case.
"A daily urge of the media, cameras, and reporters outside the courtroom," the lawyers wrote, "hasn't been experienced before in New Haven and perhaps even throughout the country."
Their focus on Twitter reporting is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that these direct messages are more elaborate than reports that are more slowly refunded is a technical anti-terrorist view that impoverishes reporting on future processes.
However, some lawyers said that appellation courts were often confronted with the argument that social and technical changes required adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayer's lawyers reinforce this claim.
In her opposition, she referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966 in which Dr. Sheppard’s conviction was lifted on the basis of the report and made it clear that the New Media required new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can courtesy combine the separation?
After a campaign of insults and negativity this week little courtesy broke out in Washington.
Is it the omen of a real two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion before you quickly return to the struggle of the parties in the capital?
The meeting between President Obama and Congress leaders on Tuesday did not break into the big questions to be addressed during the so-called "lame duck session", the meeting at the end of a period of government in which no more decisions were made.
After all that one hears, it was not a polite discussion between two different sides or a respect for their shared responsibility, but rather an empty episode of a party point collection.
The public meeting of the President's Deficit Commission on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months creates mutual respect that conceals the ideological divide that continues to separate members.
This is hardly enough to claim that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Both sides are now in a test phase - in which one demands from the other sign of cooperation and compromise, while one tries to weigh the boundaries of public opinion and the patience of voters after a renewed party warfare.
Therefore, the meeting on Tuesday itself and its assessment by the participants was limited to a minimum of claims or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep to expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that has prevailed over the past two years.
Whether it's taxes, donations, health or expectations, the two sides are miles away from each other.
Finally, the November election of Washington voted mildly for at least a short time.
"No question, the tone has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush government, who is now working for the "Ethics and Public Policy Center".
"This is inevitable after elections.
Elections arouse partial passions that die again.
And that's a good thing."
In some questions, especially in those on the agenda of the "lame duck session", Republicans and democrats have hardly any choice but to find a solution."
Bush's tax cuts end at the end of the year, and no one supports this.
Both sides want to find a way to get some or all, whether temporarily or permanently.
Similarly, a compromise can be expected with regard to the increased unemployment benefits, although only because the Republicans cannot afford to believe that the preferred tax reductions for the rich, while refusing to support unemployed workers.
After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House, optimism has increased that one can agree on these questions during the "lame duck session" and at the same time ratify the New START contract.
But William Glaston des Brookings Institution warns that successful cooperation on urgent issues of lame duck session must not necessarily lead to lasting cooperation between the parties if the new 112th Congress is convened in January.
Instead, he says, a phase of nonconformity is more likely, perhaps even inevitable.
"After the things that have to be done are done, this short-term psychology will turn into confrontation," he said.
Wehner is also skeptical - and this scepticism is shared by many - the courtesy leads to true cooperation.
"I see a lot of what is happening from today until 2012, as a precursor, or shadow boxing, for the main event of 2012," he said.
The reasons for this have much to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the tea party voters who were serving their education.
However concerned the Republican leaders may be that they are playing too high a poker game, they know that they must try to keep their promises to reduce government expenditure and put the health reform out of power.
These party lines are already evident in the first reactions to the recommendations of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, which include tax reform and the raising of some taxes and the increase in retirement age and the reduction of public expenditure.
The Vice-Presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken over one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, have insisted so much on putting the deficit issue on the public agenda that they can no longer be ignored.
But they need 14 out of 18 votes within the Commission to make their plan an official recommendation and they are struggling very much to get close to that number.
The largest resistance can be found in the elected representatives of the body, as there is little room or little sympathy for compromise on financial issues, at least today.
Galston predicts two phases in the struggle between the White House and the Republicans in Congress.
The first battle will take place next year in the form of party conflicts when Republicans challenge Obama with regard to the state budget, taxes and the health system, later followed by a phase of greater two-party cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
Public opinion.
It is proven that, despite the partyism of the current election, the majority of Americans still wish the two parties to work together.
If confrontation leads to a dead end, as it happened in 1995, both parties must take care to ensure the public response.
Whoever is condemned to lose will have to change the course and seek the compromise.
This may indeed be an optimistic view.
Today, partyism and polarization are larger than in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be a greater ideological divide between Obama and the Congress Republicans than at the time between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 as a pure foreplay for a far-reaching election in 2012.
In this way, the courtesy shown this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
However, on both sides it will take much more effort to find a common denominator in the questions that continue to separate the two from each other.
Transmissible US document portrays Moscow as a port of corruption
The control of the city lies in the hands of the "Cleptocracy" and it passes on part of the bribery money and the protection money it collects to the Kremlin. Thus, in February the American Embassy in Russia reported in a memo.
Both the police and the state security service extort high protection funds so that they can keep their expensive standard of living in Moscow, it is said.
They collect money not only from legitimate transactions, but also from organized criminal gangs.
Each shift of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called "vertical authority" - takes its share of the money that the head travels up.
The memo sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle was published on Tuesday by WikiLeaks on his homepage.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still Moscow's mayor, and it accuses him of corruption.
He was fired in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but there is hardly any evidence that in the meantime had been cleaned up.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a well-known construction company, have repeatedly rejected corruption accusations over years, and he has won numerous slanders against such accusations.
In September he explained to a Russian television station when he was asked for a documentary that suggested he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's dirty, it's dirty."
> An incredibly large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt, and this has been the result of surveys.
But it is unusual that, as in the Ambassador's report, individuals are called, and it is not heard that this is done by a diplomat of a foreign country.
"The direct connection of the government of Moscow with crime has led some to call it "disturbed" and to the conclusion that the government acts more like a clappocrate than a government," says the memo.
"Criminal elements enjoy a "kryshna" (a term from the world of criminals / the Mafia, which literally means "roof" or protection), which extends over the police, state security (FSB), the Service Supervisory Authority (MVD) and the Office of the prosecutor as well as through the entire Moscow government bureaucracy.
Experts have discovered a three-layer structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov is at the top of the list."
"FSB, MVD and the militia are on the second level."
"Lastly, the ordinary criminals and the criminal inspectors follow at the lowest level."
"This is an incompetent system in which criminal groups in some areas close a gap because the city does not offer any help."
The report goes on to say that FSB collects money from the largest companies and arrests the police small businessmen.
One source, it is said, "explained that Moscow's business owners understand that it is best to get protection from the MVD and FSB (and not from organized crime) because they have not only more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by the law."
"For this reason, the protection by criminal gangs is no longer as sought after as before."
The memo notes that, while collecting the money is comprehensive, the protection itself is not very modest; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who don't pay find their business very quickly closed - due to some pretext.
Medvedev has talked several times about combating corruption, but at the same time has noted that he has made little progress.
The memo of the message contains descriptions of men who go to the Kremlin with suitcases that were probably full of money.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev has to rely on the bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, director of Indem, a Moscow expert commission, recently in an interview.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"It is no part of the political class because a political class in Russia no longer exists."
Without politicians, without opposition, without a separation of violence, he says, corruption is inevitable.
Countrywide, estimates that corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country ranks as 154 of a recent study on the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organisation Transparency International (nationals are listed as "most corrupt" to "most corrupt".
The revelation of the memo of the American Embassy, which happened in the late evening of Moscow, will certainly trigger failures within the Russian government, although, as Luzhkov can be accused of Moscow's mistakes, it can also be a possibility for the Kremlin to claim to solve the problems.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks documents could be a fake and responded angryly to the revelation that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth is that it is about our interaction, which is an important factor of internal policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we would not have expected this to happen with such arrogance, with such pressure and in such an unethical way, you know."
Khmer Rouge Veterans Forced to Confront With the Past
In a weakly illuminated, concrete classroom with dirty and burning walls, the director of the Anlong Veng High School reminds the man who built him of the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everybody here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and he took care of his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Because of his brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule known as "the butcher", the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge-Hochburg in north-west Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges, developed the infrastructure, and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge's capitulation to the government, longtime followers are challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed victims to face public confrontation with the people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a schoolbook that for the first time told children of former soldiers the story of Khmer Rouge.
And in July, a joint tribunal of the UN and Cambodia for the first time sentenced a former member of the Khmer Rouge when it sentenced the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng Chamber of Torture, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments, fear grew under the Khmer Rouge Veteran Alnlong Vengs, making efforts to reconcile and reintegration into Cambodia's society difficult.
"There is still rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Cheng Youk, head of Cambodia's documentation centre, an independent organization that is exploring the regime.
"For them, life was glorious under the Khmer Rouge, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"It divides families."
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, it was estimated that 1.7 million people were executed or that they died of illness, rework or hunger.
When the Vietnamese invaded and the Pol Pot-Ied government crashed in 1979, the regime's remains and its military fled to Cambodia's border with Thailand.
Here, until December 1998, when the last movement capitulated, they spread unrest.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from their base in the west of the mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta Mok approached the next generation in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, when a peace agreement supported by the UN led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to cross to the government, leading to the capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural death in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had not given in, was arrested by government forces at the Danger Rek Mountains in 1999.
He died in the prison of Phnom Penh in 2006, where he was waiting for his trial.
When their patrons no longer protected them, most of the former Khmer Rouge fighters fled to the crushing poverty of rural Cambodia and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Although some of the Khmer Rouge's elite officials kept their local government posts because they laid down their weapons, the simple soldiers remained poor, untrained farmers.
"These people have benefited very little from the capitulation," said Sok Leang from the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng
"They are anchored in the utopian agricultural ideology of the regime."
"They grew up without any professional knowledge."
Sor Lim, 55 years old, who had joined the Rhmer Rouge in 1974, fought in the jungle for Anlang Veng before he settled down in 1998 to live a life as a poor rice farmer.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok gave everyone something to eat."
"But now life is difficult because we have to take care of ourselves."
The current Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also awakened concerns here.
Early next year, the court will try to bring Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife and Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister, to court.
The order of the court is to condemn the old leaders and those who are primarily responsible for the atrocities, but it is not said whether it will pursue further acts beyond these four cases.
This has contributed little to mitigating the fears in Anlong Veng.
Current media speculation has concentrated on Im Chaem, 64 years old, who had been district chief in Manteay Meanchey Province during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she had told representatives of Cambodia's documentation centre that she had led the construction of the Trapeang Thma Damms, a project in which thousands of forced workers were likely to die.
On a hot evening, in the Chaem from work on the fields, they returned to their wooden house on a dirty street outside of Anlong Veng.
When the sun cast long shadows on the withered grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss their past at the Khmer Rouge.
Should the court invite them, she would refuse to go, she said.
"Cambodia lives in peace and stability," she said.
"If there were no more persecutions, war would be here."
Prime Minister Their Sen, who fled the Khmer Rouge in 1878, also repeatedly warned that the situation would become uncertain, the court would sue more suspects, although experts and historians discuss this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia needs to do to be able to go forward, Chhang Youk said from the documentation center.
"Reconciling with Khmer times means bringing together the broken pieces," he said.
"It's our duty to put these broken parts together, so that we can understand how everything is."
The Centre created the first government approved schoolbook on the Khmer Rouge, the 75-page "History of Democratic Cambodia".
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an annex to the history book for the High School of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages across the Khmer Rouge.
As often in Cambodia, the young people in Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's connections to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19 years old, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said that the new schoolbook helps students to understand an important part of their history.
But his parents responded skeptically when he brought the book home to read it.
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the court," he said.
"They are suspicious because they are not sure how many people are condemned by the court."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, said Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the schoolbook and the court gradually gain influence," he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful attraction here.
At the top of the Dangrek Bergen leads to a rectangle of black soot covered with a rusty sheet roof, covered by shrubs covered with plastic garbage.
Pol Pot's body had been burned here after his death in 1998 on a tire pile.
Nuom Sothea, 31 years old, a mobile salesman on the roadside, said she didn't know much about the man who had been burned here.
"But he has a strong spirit and many people here go to him to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sotheas' birthday and later that day she wanted to go to Pol Pot's last resting place, where she's going to put a bush of mature bananas - hoping he'll bring her luck.
Belarus agrees to continue to collect weapons-enabled uranium
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear materials worldwide, the Belarus government announced on Wednesday that it will no longer be collected high-enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement following a meeting of Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the security summit.
For years the US government had tried to convince Belarus not to collect high-enriched uranium and seemed to have reached an obstacle last spring.
But officially the US government told Washington Post that in the last two months two secret agreements have been concluded with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of weapons-enabled uranium from a Belarusian research institute.
This prepared the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material - according to an official employee who remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the theme, about 500 pounds.
The agreement seems to be one of the most important results of Obama's April 47 Nations Nuclear Safety Summit, which had excluded Belarus.
And it was obviously good enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really excited about the fact that they want a seat in the Nuclear Safety Summit (from 2012).
"This proves to me that it works," said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a group to promote nuclear safety.
Clinton called the agreement "a very important, important step" of Belarus.
Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague to secure everything precarious nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries to get rid of their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the government of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's Nuclear Safety Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko declared that the nation will never give up its uranium.
"How do high-enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is fundamentally capable of weapons, and less enriched uranium," said Lukashenko back then.
"This is our raw material, and we're not going to make any dirty bombs out of it, and we're not gonna sell it to anyone."
"We use it exclusively for research purposes, that's all."
Belarus nevertheless approached the US a few months ago when it showed interest in the meeting of an agreement.
The first attempt to remove the Uranium of Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the material was lightly irradiated, say officially.
It was loaded into a special train for more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal, say officially.
The second call was decided on Monday and was carried out by plane according to the official.
The U.S. government pays $14 million for these efforts, with much of the money flowing into Belarusian research with weakly enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was extremely carefully coordinated and coordinated to build confidence", which led to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Ministry of Energy, who is working on the global reduction of risk.
The James Martin Center for Non-Exhaustive Studies estimates that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of weapons-related uranium this year and hundreds of pounds of high-enriched uranium.
Belarus intends to terminate its camp until 2012.
The relations between Belarus and the United States were tense for years, primarily because of Lukashenko's harsh disregard for human rights.
But the statement from Wednesday suggests a possible approach.
"Welcoming the progress of these global security issues, the United States of America and Belarus announce that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue in improving bilateral relations and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she explains.
No objections from the Spanish Government to CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objections to the CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaida prisoners via Spanish territory to Guantánamo, as evidenced by a telegram of the U.S. ambassador in Madrid.
This reflects the documents revealed by Wikileaks and forwarded to the daily newspaper "El País" (by cable). It is added that the former deputy government chief María Teresa Fernández de la Vega demanded that the Spanish government be informed "to prove that foreign aircraft flying over Spain are adequately monitored."
In June 2006, following the publication of a report by the Council of Europe accusing the aid to human rights-regarding practices in a dozen countries, including Spain, the former North American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega discussed.
The Deputy Government Minister admitted that the Council's report "has taken Zapatero aloof" and reaffirmed that Spain has nothing to hide on this issue.
"De la Vega underlined that Spain had no objection to the intelligence flights over Spanish territory."
"You just want to be informed", not to be "unpreparedly surprised", Aguirre reports by cable.
The former Foreign Minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, also pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish government "does not want to pay great attention to this matter, although the government has little influence, as they lie in the hands of the judges."
The prosecutor Vicente González, for his part, gave the embassy in January 2007 to understand that he would not block the judicial initiative to request the declassification of the documents of the Spanish Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Minister of Defence on CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any obsessive or sensitive information," said the Ambassador after a discussion with the prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the US was more concerned about "the apparent coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and the German prosecutors" than about the declassified information of the CNI and the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to manage discreetly between governments," laments Aguirre.
At a lunch in March 2007, in which the U.S. Ambassador and Spanish Minister of the Interior Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba took part, the latter commented that "although the Spanish judges were very keen on their independence and doing what they thought appropriate", he gave his employees instructions to "floated rhetorical comments to avoid the tension."
The Ambassador also expressed his concern at the action taken by the PP in this matter.
"Despite its general pro-American attitude, our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt it, from a note that the government of Zapatero's actions, which could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, will have tolerated or deliberately ignored capital, even if these revelations could have a negative impact on the government of the USA," he emphasizes.
The child murderer confesses that she complained on the Internet about the "mortem" of motherhood.
The young woman spoke of the child when she was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror in the Galician way"
Monica Juanatey Fernández is on the Internet "Muki".
Under this nickname, she keeps in touch with a cousin and at least one friend. Both come from Noia, a village in the province of La Coruña, in which she was born.
The notifications are from 2008.
In order to understand these, you need to know their love life, which the daily ABC reconstructs on the basis of testimony from their family members.
The 30-year-old Galic woman started a relationship with Iván Túñez, an industrialist in 1998.
She held a year.
Shortly after she broke up her relationship, it became known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his former never let him perform a DNA analysis.
Soon after that, she started a different relationship.
The elect was Alberto, a young man from Lousam, a neighboring community.
She lived with him for a long time.
César lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearic Islands to look around on the labour market, the little one stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But from the content of their messages it can be concluded that their love relationship broke and they separated.
In March 2008 she is alone on Menorca and writes: "Alberto is very strange and angry because I came here to work."
"When I told him that, he found it good, but now, of course, he realizes what it means to be alone with the boy all day and not to be free, to do and to let what he wants."
Later, she mentions a message she just received on the phone: "I want you to come back this month or give me an address to which I can send you the boy."
She complains, "If he doesn't like me leaving the boy with my mother, I'll pick him up when I get back."
In May she says of returning to her village: "This week I'm going there, but I'm only going to stay there until 19. Because I have to introduce myself to a job on 20. If I don't want to lose it."
She says she'll take her first-born when everything goes well.
"He will be with the one he has to be with, that is, with me. Never in life will I leave him with anyone except my mother," a dubious intention, considering their bad relationship.
There is another mail in July.
When she writes these, it is assumed that the boy who came to the island on the 1st of the month and was allegedly murdered on the 10th is dead.
"On the one hand, César is satisfied, on the other hand not."
"On the one hand, he's with me and the place he likes a bit, but on the other hand, he has to go to school every day."
She's talking about a move to Mallorca.
"There he (the boy) will attend a summer course, so I have less expenses for the nanny."
On 17th: Memories and Actions.
"A giant kiss of César asking me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he sent me some videos on the e-mail.
On the 30th: "The boy is fine. He goes to a summer course to learn Catalan."
There's one from Víctor, her current partner: "He's putting money in front of me."
On the Internet, in Anime and Mangabelogs, there are messages from it.
She even had her own blog in MySpace, which is now locked, and in which she called herself "Muki, the jailer".
"Terror a la gallega (heading) ".
The last man who lived with her, a sworn hunter, explains to have a bit of conscience because he feels guilty.
He can't believe everything happened because she didn't tell him she was a single mother.
Mónica was transferred from the Centre for Prisoners to Menorca in Palma Province Prison yesterday.
The defenseman, Carlos Maceda, said that she could not remember the course of the case, "and she had not intended to harm the little one."
Before, however, she had been able to drown César in the bathtub and store his body in a suitcase.
Defense and prosecution requested a psychiatric opinion.
Partido Popular won 4 seats in Congress and PSC lost 9
With the results of November 28, PP could play a key role in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase in votes and MEPs in the last regional elections, the PP is already looking at the parliamentary elections - preferring or not. Its expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes this party has reached in these elections is usually twice as high as the number of elections in Catalonia.
For example, the Catalan People's Party received 610,473 votes in the 2008 parliamentary elections, while this figure in the 2006 regional elections was only 316.222.
On last Sunday, the PPC achieved 384,091 votes.
If this rising trend - the result of the redirection of the PSC's voting share and the binding of the PP's electorate - should continue, PP analysts predict that in the parliamentary elections the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 Congressmen, while CiU would also win four (now 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 MEPs (of 25).
These calculations demonstrate the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the People's Party, the ERC would lose a Member - at present it has three - while ICV could hold its MP or win one.
However, should the electoral calendar be maintained, the next date with the municipal elections will fall in May 2011. Even then, the People’s Party (PP) can be the tongue on the balance to put an end to socialist domination, in four provincial capitals and with their majority in Barcelona City Council, one of the city’s biggest budget administrations: EUR 661 million for 2011.
Both the Nationalists and the People's Party agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, in which the Socialists will not achieve a majority nor will they be able to resort to their traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
According to the Republican Debakel, it is not a doubt that this party will lose its representation in the Barcelona Municipal Council, where it will have to reach 5% of the votes.
The PP, on the other hand, recorded an increase in its vote share in the four provincial capitals and could become a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced to be able to play the main role in Tarragona’s transformation. There they had ruled in front of the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, together with PP.
En Lérida is the PP only 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, Angel Ros, has good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election campaign they met several times.
Also in other important places, such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus, the People's Party has seen a significant increase.
Currently the PP is represented in 34 city administrations of Catalonia and aims to create lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell got Al Qaida thousands of passports
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three more in Thailand
The seven Pakistani police officers arrested by the Barcelona Police Police Department and Nigerians formed the jihadist cell controlled by Thailand, the different Al Qaida groups, including the "Moment for the Liberation of Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and "Laschkar e-Taiba" (Let) - the latter was the author of the attacks in Bombay, who claimed 106 deaths in 2008 - with passports.
The Spanish Minister of the Interior attaches a great importance to these investigations, which goes so far as to ensure that with the "Operation Kampai" the counterfeiting apparatus Al Qaidas has been "weaked" worldwide and "so their ability to act".
The researchers assume that in the two years in which the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they were faked and then sent to the groups from which the criminal galaxy Al Qaida is composed, so that their "champions" could completely exceed the borders of European and other Western countries.
The discovered cell is not the only one in the jihadist network that was active in Europe. Therefore, other European police units have also participated in research in addition to the Thai investigation agencies. It is not excluded that in the EU area, similar attacks will occur in the next few days, such as those carried out in Barcelona last Tuesday.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad, and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested) another operation was carried out in Thailand, where the Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt as well as the Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumung were arrested.
They had led from Bangkok the cell established in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of which had been destroyed in 2009 - stole in particular tourist passports according to the requirements of the so-called "International Islamic Front".
This means that the documents were issued on the names of men aged 25 to 45 and had to be valid for several years; they were not allowed to display a visa stamp.
In the course of investigations, it is underlined that until now no links have been established between the people arrested in Catalonia and the attack in Bombay, although the author of this attack, "Laschkar e-Taiba", was one of the recipient groups of passports stolen in Spain and subsequently faked in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be recalled that several thousand dollars had been sent from a money transfer company several days before the Catalonia attack, which were "invested" in the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones, which were later used by the members of the "command" that put an end to the lives of 106 people.
The police seized an extensive documentation.
PP calls on Mas to postpone the tax agreement
The chairman of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, yesterday took the opportunity to present personally Artur Mas' conditions in support of his accession as Prime Minister of the Generalitat, which are not different from those already present during the election campaign and can be combined with the primacy of economic recovery and the neglect of regionalist independence adventures, such as a financial compensation agreement proposed by the regionalist leader at the height of his mandate.
The President of the Catalan People's Party was sure to address Artur Mas, who gave her the 18 delegates she had won last Sunday - a figure that is more than enough to feel indispensable, because the candidate of the bourgeois-regionalist party CiU is dependent on at least one of the opposition parties to vote when he takes office.
The future alliances that the regionalists intend to take in the upcoming parliamentary elections in Congress depend on a possible duck with the PP. However, the talks that Mas is currently holding with the other party leaders are focused on Catalonia.
With regard to the PPC's party chairpersons, it calls for "all discourses concerning the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia" and for an agreement on the financial compensation between the State and the Autonomous Region - similar to the Basque Country - and which the head of the CiU Party even intends to make a referendum.
Both political leaders believe that they want to make the built-up political apparatus of regional administration slimmer and abolish the inheritance and gift tax.
The details of the negotiations on Mas' start-up are on the part of the PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced a hard opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV). Today he will meet Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The nursing home confirms that the deaths are not due to "missing measures"
The owners of the Old Home in Olot do not rule out the killing of their caretaker over eleven older people
Yesterday, those responsible for the La Caritat nursing home in Olot (Gerona) gave a press conference in which they highlighted the damage the criminal acts of Joan Vila Dilmé - the caregiver who had killed at least eleven old people for whom he was responsible - had caused the institution.
The head of the Altenpflegeheim, Joan Sala, accompanied by his lawyer Joan Cañada, appeared in court and announced that "La Caritat wants to accuse the responsible person (for the deaths)", but "the law and our liability force us to accept the process and the civil liability".
The institution must not only take a loss of social reputation because it did not determine the criminal actions of the caregiver in due time, but now also pay a high amount of compensation, which is calculated by the legal representatives of the family members of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that he has since continued to murder.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the old care home - since he suspected that no doctor had personally examined the deceased but the formalities due to their age and disease were handled by telephone.
The head of La Caritat denied this point all around and stated that "exceptional measures could not have been the reason for the incidents."
La Caritat's lawyer added that "in the dispute there were no indications of negligent actions by a person other than the accused."
The one who was already baptized as a "death angel" was 11 murders before yesterday and declared that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and murdered the second old lady a month and a half later.
In this case, he killed with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime in which he had administered a mixture of various tranquilizers.
The head of La Caritat stated that the access of staff to the medications is difficult to control.
The insulin syringes and the sedative cocktail used the caregiver in six out of nine crimes committed to free the patients from their suffering with death.
But the results of the laboratory tests will show whether Vila lies and actually chose a less cruel death for his first victims or whether he burned them from the inside by giving them bleaching, as he had done in confession to three women he murdered between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat one doesn’t give the caregiver’s statements any faith, not even as regards the number of known murders that could be much more. This attitude is justified by the fact that Vila made very different statements in court and that it makes no sense to suddenly change his course after eight successful murders.
They say they made themselves available to justice for this reason and to clarify the scope of these incidents.
European Central Bank Threats (ECB)
The investors responded sharply yesterday to the threat of the ECB President Trichet, who warned, "the markets should not underestimate our reaction capacity."
The euro periphery risk increases dramatically and the shares of European banks by more than 5%.
However, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB can be deceived and that the euro has barely given way to points that cause concern.
Yesterday's events are typical of an illiquid market, which, to the extent that it collapses again, however, as a result of the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will by no means lose his fear.
Today, a month ago, the European Central Bank invited us to reverse our liquidity measures, which require the ECB to withdraw for the fourth time in two years tomorrow, and probably several more times in the future.
The Bundesbank called for the closure of the plan for the purchase of sovereign debt, as they were ineffective, as well as the abolition of all exceptional temporary liquidity measures. Only a week of unlimited access should be maintained.
After the crisis in Ireland, we expect the current liquidity measures to be extended "at least until March" and the quarterly calls for tenders with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity by at least June.
We also expect the program to continue to purchase bonds and issue a strengthening signal.
If the expectations created are not met, the excellent response of yesterday's markets will be thrown back and if stubborn insistence on taking back our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
Just as at the ECB meeting in May, where the Bank reaffirmed that it would not consider buying government bonds and that the markets would collapse, this story could repeat tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May she showed her teeth and on Wednesday she said she had already bought a lot with which she provoked a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday, the auction of one year's state titles in Portugal was quite weak.
The government wealth management spent only 500 million to 5.28%, compared with 750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, the interest rates in Portugal fell by 30 basis points throughout the curve, reflecting a change in the perception of the markets according to the words of Trichets.
In Ireland, the figures of the debt hole were published by Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The sum is estimated to be about 10,000 million in the short term and possibly another 15 000 in the future, and there are time by February to obtain private capital or these banks are nationalized.
Although Ireland has completely lost its credibility after not recognizing the problem of stress tests in July, the figures in the rescue plan are acceptable and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, on Tuesday the government will have to receive parliamentary approval of its new budget, and as it still does not have sufficient support, Ireland will continue to be a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has made its discourse more moderate in terms of the Heads of State or Government summits on December 14th, where political unity is required to show that we are playing the same score together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries the ninth symphony of Beethoven.
The Spanish President presented yesterday the plan of action to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous regions, such as financial institutions, reduction of government deficits, liberalisation, privatisation and job creation measures. Measures that sound in the ears of investors like Vivaldi's Four Seasons.
The double effect of Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock exchange has increased by 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges.
Compared to February, the response of the government and the Spanish central bank was quick and convincing, and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today, there is a significant auction of a three-year government bond that will benefit from the trichet effect. Therefore, we rely on strong demand, which will eliminate all doubts about our re-indebtedness.
For Spain, applying for an aid plan would be self-sacrifice.
We would receive liquidity that we do not need. The Treasury has 40 billion euros available, three times as much as in March. Interest rates are extremely expensive and access to markets would be closed without notice.
Nevertheless, our strategy should be in line with Caesar's wife's motto: "Now not only does his being count but also his appearance."
Only courage, we can do that!
The Chairman of the Board of Management of Eulen, at the request of his children, challenges the meeting of Vega Sicilia
The storm in the open conflict of the Álvarez family, owner of the Eulen and El Enebro companies, does not fade away.
David Álvarez, founder of the corporate group, will challenge the meeting of El Enebro, which will take place at the request of five of his seven children on the 16th, since he considers them "absolutely void". His children will try to receive a majority to control the administrative bodies of the company - owner of the winery Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his children Jesús David and María José prepare the legal measures for a new chapter of justice in their dispute over the control of part of the group.
The founder of the largest holding company services does not appear to be willing to submit in his dispute for the control of the institutions of El Enebro.
He was expelled from the Board of Directors by five of his seven children, who were appointed members of the Board of Directors at the Shareholders' Meeting of 18 January of this year, which is already registered in the Commercial Register.
The meeting of El Enebro, convened by the judge of the Madrid Commercial Court No. 2 for the 16th, has triggered a new thunderstorm in the Álvarez family's lap.
The judge's appeal to hold the assembly is the only legal way to ensure that the meeting is convened.
The final strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is designed by David Álvarez as a "desperate means of the applicants - his five children - to be recognized by means of legal scrupulousness, fraudulent machinations, and legal abuse, as official spokespersons explain the annulled assembly of 18 January".
This argument is the basis for the challenge of the assembly in retrospect to declare it "absolutely void".
The same protagonists, enveloping in discreet silence, tried unsuccessfully to convene a meeting in June.
At El Enebro - asset company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, in addition to other assets - David Álvarez's seven children control 100 percent of the capital.
On the other hand, according to family protocols, the founder of the service group demands the right to use over 51% of the capital.
This is the actual background of the case on which the judge in the hearing has to decide on the appeal proceedings for which no date has yet been set.
Red Bull wins in the F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens
The cars are improved with a software in real time.
Since Red Bull entered the Formula 1 world in 2004, its history in this distinguished universe has been shaped by the speed of surprises and successes.
At the beginning, no one paid attention to the newcomer and despite his steep ascent during the last season, all of them placed on the victory of the Ferrari of Fernando Alonso at the end of November.
Without wanting to reduce the abilities of the German pilot and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the power of Renault's engine, the "secret weapon" that the Multi Siemens Red Bull put in his hands, and thus created a winning team, has become a legend.
In reality, it is a powerful software for the simulation of processes launched by the German company in 2007 for purposes not related to car racing.
This computer program, known as PLM, has been used for the development of assembly chains in factories around the world, energy plants and high-precision instruments.
A faithful reproduction or simulation of a product or process is intended before it is actually built in order to avoid errors and unnecessary costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon's cameras, Sukhoi's aircraft and Nissan's most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the Siemens Industrial Department, explains that with the use of this software in Formula 1 factory Red Bull "in a few hours, almost in real time" the changes and improvements that can be found on the races and during the tests can be designed and executed.
Russwurm explains that in 1992 on average ten technicians worked in the racing stables, which were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements in one season.
In Red Bull's team today, 180 highly qualified young people are employed. With powerful computer systems, they perform analyses and all possible changes to the racing car.
The Siemens Manager stated that the PLM software was able to analyze and improve all components of the Red Bull racing cars, except the engine for which Renault alone is responsible.
The materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are changed.
The changes can be transferred from the virtual reality of the simulator within less than 24 hours thanks to advanced production facilities and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limit set by this crazy technical perfectionism is the 40 million dollars that a Formula 1 team may spend for its race in a season.
Red Bull has built up its high-tech factory for the development and manufacture of his racing cars in a 50-kilometre location from London.
These are two buildings where visits - especially by journalists - are strongly restricted.
All that's happening there is Top Secret.
The workforce comprises 580 people, including the two pilots, the world champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bull's true Formula 1 hero is undoubtedly the newest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the enormous technological resources that the energy-drink manufacturer places in the services of his participation on the racetracks are other protagonists, whose support is invaluable and whose awareness is equal to zero.
Steve Nevey, the plant's technologist, emphasises that five years ago it was possible to say that R & D progress in the field of racing cars contributed 50 percent to the victory and that the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today, the share values have changed; the technology accounts for 85 percent of the success, while the pilot's contribution is estimated at 15 percent.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by computer, because they are "non-predictable gladiators".
HP will open twenty own stores in two years with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened his first exclusive shop in collaboration with his partner Ront Reyes yesterday in Barcelona.
It is the first network of sales of between 80 and 100 square meters, consisting of 20 shops, which the Multi intends to open in Spain over the next two years.
The company agreed to this initiative with the existing 16 sales areas in the multi-brand operation, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The deputy chairman of HP España, Helena Herrero, mentioned as an example the converted shop at Gran Vía in Barcelona, property of Pont Reyes, with which HP has been working for thirty years.
The North American Group intends to set up 200 sales outlets in Europe by 2010, including 20 offices in Spain.
The first one was inaugurated last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third business.
Herrera did not want to betray the upcoming openings, but did not rule out Madrid being the next target.
The vice-chairman, who is also the head of HP Personal Systems, assured that the philosophy of shop opening is always the same. She relies on a local distributor with experience and industry knowledge.
The North American group advises them and takes over the exclusive shop equipment (with interactive products to touch) and in Europe all stores will look the same.
HP is also responsible for training the shop staff.
Helena Herrero said that it was not a franchising system and stressed that the exclusive sales outlet network was intended to "optimise the customer service and advice of small and micro-enterprises in the purchase and after that, even the packaging."
The shop in Barcelona has a pioneer pilot program that solves the technical problems of HP devices with warranty.
An online service connects to the technical headquarters in Maastricht (Holland).
"This way we can solve problems in ten minutes, which sometimes take up to two days."
"This system has been developed especially for small and micro-enterprises and private customers, since the large companies already have their service contracts for technical customer service," said Helena Herroro yesterday.
Sabadell wants his rivals to 'clauen' a million customers in three years' time
The Executive Board member of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 will be a hard year for the banks, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the debt war.
Nevertheless, it foresees a break in interest rates which banks are trying to compensate for with increases in fees and the prices for loans.
Sabadell expects to catch a million private customers in three years - an still too existing subject.
Sabadell has found the way to exploit the next three years and thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new three-year indicative plan in 2011.
The aim is not only to survive without using the public assistance from the FROB, but also to increase the market share by a million private customers - 700 000 if one withdraws the customers who will lose the bank - which is the great challenge that this bank faces, because it has so far devoted more attention to its business customers than to its private customers.
This year it has added 250 000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Their market share for private customers is 3.5 percent, while business customers account for more than 10 percent.
Another principle of the business plan 2011-2013 is the increase in productivity, i.e. austerity, cost reduction. The challenges faced by the Bank will be presented together with the annual financial statements report.
Few banks dare to set and publish targets in these difficult times, as the financial crisis has confused all the banks' plans worldwide.
Sabadell will complete this year's policy plan on Optima four years ago, initially designed for three years, but as a result of the market situation it was extended by one financial year.
The customers who will leave the savings banks are the bank's main goal.
During a breakfast organized by APIE, Guardiola stressed that 2011 would be a "silence" year "with great reach".
The manager assumes that Spain only came out of the crisis "slow".
In addition, it would be "very difficult" to create "work" in two or three years - essential for the survival of the banks.
Even if it assumes that the war for liabilities - which punishes interest margins - will be overturned, the risk surcharges, banks and savings banks will have to pay for their emissions to obtain liquidity, as a compensation for dwindling profit margins, will already be applied to the price of loans.
"The issues of liquidity and financing are structural and they will put pressure on loans."
"We didn't turn the cock off, but the interest rate differentials are very high," said Guardiola.
On Thursday, Banesto issued an order to its branch network to limit the allocation of long-term loans and to increase interest differentials (cf. Cinco Días of 22 and 27 November).
The manager also agreed that the banks were currently pursuing the stategie, "to increase the fees", but "within a competitive framework".
Sabadell's outline is based on organic growth, even though the group, as always, does not exclude corporate business.
Not in vain he assures that in Spain "greater companies are necessary."
"In the coming year, everything will change," he assures.
He stressed that the need for capital was currently "a huge increase" and did not exclude some Spanish financial institutions from slipping in red figures.
He believes that the FROB can replace the money market in the case of captita stocks.
After ensuring that Sabadell can also survive a temporary closure of the markets, he counters the argument of some bankers who are already predicting a new liquidity crisis.
He emphasises that there is nothing to do with it, but unlike the incidents in June, one can achieve short-term funding through repo transactions and thus catch the crisis.
CECA excludes a second fusion wave of savings banks
The Director-General of CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday's possibility of a wave of mergers between the savings banks and stressed the speed with which the industry is being restructured.
When the concentration process of the Spanish savings banks began, several savings banks did not participate in the first phase. They held the second round.
On the other hand, the Director-General of the Spanish Sparkassenverband (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured that this second round would not take place.
"I believe that most of the mergers have been completed, and the involvement of Cajasol in the Banca Cívica group cannot be considered a second round, rather it was adaptations."
"Most of it is completed. It may be that we have thirteen or fourteen instead of seventeen, but all the important processes are already completed. They were controlled by Banco de España, who strongly supported all processes."
In a breakfast organized by the Aragonian Management and Management Association (ADEA), Olavarrieta stated that the concentration process "was carried out as soon as possible and that we must be satisfied with the timely process set in earlier times, not now, in the framework of the business plans with Banco de España," he stressed.
"The transition from 45 savings banks with an average of 28 000 million assets to 17 each with 75 500 million is a historically incomparable process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 percent and is now much larger, which we have fulfilled the Basel Agreement," he pointed out.
Olavarrieta said, "There were a number of undisputed opinions about the slowness of the process, the insidiousness and insanity," because "Banco de España exhorts us to close in time before the end of the year."
The Director-General of CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday assured that Spain had one of the most rigorous financing systems in Europe and "perhaps" in the world and added that those who doubted this "without deeper knowledge".
The manager noted that in the current economic economy, we must not worry about the situation of the financial institutions and the savings banks that have experienced a "very important" concentration process that will be carried out "as soon as possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish banks had passed the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the red line of Germany
Berlin has opted for the maintenance of the euro, but at the same time has established conditions for the whole European Union.
The tensions in the markets have triggered a double response from the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has presented new adaptation measures, starting with tax reductions for small and medium-sized enterprises, the regulation of temporary businesses or the abolition of the EUR 426 support for unemployed people who do not receive unemployment benefit, up to the privatisation of 49 percent of AENA, the management of Barajas and El Prat airports, and 30 percent of the state lottery.
On the other hand, with the help of former President Felipe González, the Deputy Governmentary, Elena Salgado, supports the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as responsible, who has conjured out the current crisis.
How can these processes be understood?
It is presumptuous that Merkel's position is not a mistake in their public relations.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefinition of the euro.
Germany is taking on a fundamental new perspective on the design of our future, which coincides with the maintenance of the old traditions of a large part of its partners.
In view of the resistance in Europe, we are beginning to speculate in Germany about three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first: a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south would have to leave the euro area.
The second: The reintroduction of the Deutsche Mark - although it sounds more like science fiction at the moment -, supported by a large majority of public opinion, about 50 percent of the population.
The third: a transformation of the euro according to German proposals. This means: more macroeconomic control; strict budgetary management; punishment of countries that violate the requirements; possibly the adjustment of payments by some countries as well as the extension of the costs of potential adjustment measures to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been showing itself for some time. Therefore, there are no excuses now.
First in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission created incentives for deficits and the German Government removed a constitutional reform from the sleeve in order to prevent this from happening from 2016.
This was the first sign of the disparity between what Germany considered necessary (severe tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign was the Central European country when Merkel painfully pushed out the decision to save Greece.
That was strongly criticized at the time, but the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and the published opinion were absolutely against a rescue from Greece.
Finally, in the last few days of October, Merkel is emerging with a clear position, calling for a reform of the European Union's agreements in order to enable a country's salvation and, at the same time, to require private lenders to bear part of the costs.
This position was interpreted as anti-European, as it pushed forward the Irish crisis and all the following.
But its proposal, although a little bit sweet, has been adopted, and in the next few months we will be participating in the reform of the European Union, which will enable these measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that does not intend to exceed it.
It tells everyone that, even if we now have to take unpopular measures, the old functioning of the euro will no longer be possible from this date.
2013 will be the birth of a new currency area in which the incompatible countries will be severely punished, forced to declare themselves incompetent and in this case the private sector will have to take part of the costs.
Germany shows us that we need to take a hard growth rate, with high savings and investment rates, a measure of consumption, an improvement in productivity and competitiveness as well as positive external balances.
The other alternative, which is based on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments, just as Spain was quoted in booming times, will simply not be accepted.
The offer is clear.
And we'd do badly not understand.
It is not just about reducing the government deficit to 3% by 2013.
The demands are much harder.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions is to cheat on ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulences will go into more peace.
And that we will use the opportunities offered to us by spring 2013.
It seems that Zapatero understood this as well, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the major companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures yesterday) points out that despite the criticism of Merkel, the hypothesis of creating order in his own home has set out its way.
But the red line drawn from Germany is there, and it does not look like something would change.
Among the options considered, it is not possible to exclude the euro area that has been fully stashed with few serious countries.
In this case, Germany could still tell us that it warned us.
Sports and regulatory environment
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show ingenuity, but not the will to avoid a penalty.
The exclusion of the game of 23 November against the Ajax in the Champions League (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) from the game led to a lot of ink being shed on whether it was an unsporting act or not and whether both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is commonly known, the two players lost time a few minutes before playing (their team had already clearly won) and played several fouls so that the referee showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and as the Real Madrid would lead his group, the two players will fulfill the prescribed penalty at the next match against the Auxerre and thus enter the next game without any cards.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee punished the coach of the club, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten rules that are followed in this sport.
Part of the debate on the case presented is that a team of the football club Real Madrid (who pretends to be nobleness and honor in his hymn and on other occasions punished his players for similar incidents) played the main role in this, and on the dramatization by Mourinho, who added an episode more to his long history as a theatrical and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate is about whether it does not expressly contradict the principles of sport prohibited by the statutes, i.e. whether these actions constitute a circumvention of rules. In fact, this approach adheres to the statutes of sports, but seems to circumvent its meaning.
In this matter, the damage caused to the sports spirit should be examined.
The sports spirit defends the physical integrity of the opponents, an aspect which was not threatened by these actions, for it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid the unwarranted players taking an unjustified advantage of the counter-team.
The paradox of the action of the players of the Real Madrid is that it does not correspond to what we normally understand as a misplay or a circumvention, because the circumvention of the rule was not secretly executed to avoid a sanction, but it should be as striking as possible so that it is punished by the arbitrator.
The players waited and accepted the penalty joyfully.
Another question is what kind of advantage did the offenders draw from the intentional fouls.
It should be stressed here that the rival was not put in a more unfavorable position or gained advantages for the game played, because the obvious result of this action was that the own team had to continue playing with fewer players.
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club does not have these players then.
The advantage is obviously that players start the next game phase of the Champions League without any cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But it is a long-term, up to a certain degree uncertain advantage, as the team could eventually leave. Furthermore, the players receive a penalty with this procedure and move into the second card cycle in which they leave for card accumulation with a card less than in the first cycle.
It is not so clear whether it is really an advantage.
In the end, such actions are not directed against the spirit of sport, which also includes strategic decisions in order to benefit from the rules as much as possible.
In this case, the players did not want to avoid any penalty (that would actually be a clear case of regularity), they rather wanted to choose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without avoiding or fleeing a punishment.
Although the line between inventiveness and the regulatory environment is blurred, I believe that this matter is a clear case of inventive step.
I have the impression that the polemics arose as a result of two factors: because it was about two self-exclusions and because of the nature of the provoked rule transfer.
The damage caused by these actions to the principles of sport is less ethical than rather aesthetic.
Offeroffensive for customer catch for group Christmas dinner in Barcelona
This year the dictatorship of the calendar drops an avalanche of reservations to the days of 16 and 17 December.
The celebrations paid by employees themselves spread. They do not want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the Turrón and the Christmas lottery, group dinners are also available in the pre-Christmas season, which serve the gastronomy and leisure business of Barcelona’s oxygen. However, as a result of the economic crisis, they trigger a price offensive to catch the customer segment that represents the great mass: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros for lunch or dinner, the surveyed entrepreneurs and associations confirm.
To make accounting even more complicated, the calendar (silvester falls on a Friday) dropped all orders in the week of December 13, with the result of an avalanche of reservations from dinner on two top days (the 16th and 17th) and almost no orders in the week before.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies have discontinued group dinners for budget reasons.
In order not to have to give up this tradition, many workers pay it out of their own pocket.
Whatever the economic situation, lowest prices are required, confirmed by the chairman of the Barcelona restaurant body, Gaietà Farràs.
To date, the representative of the umbrella association dares not predict what the holidays will look like this month.
"People think about it for 'seven times before they make a reservation."
"They want to go out, but they pay great attention to the prices," he emphasizes.
The business will go well with those who "offer quality at good prices with a good service", he adds, and reminds us that customers are saving in times of crisis, which is why prices are most requested by 25 euros.
In a survey in various central restaurants, it turns out that the evening of December 17 will lead the providers to collapse.
The Soteras group says that this Friday’s demand for less than 30 euros would be booming, and the group has adapted its menus with full offers between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation.
With another leading group, Andilana, which has 16 restaurants in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to preferred reservations, even from the beginning of November.
"We have made it possible to maintain the previous year's prices with menus for every taste of 19,95 to 30 euros," he explains.
At AN Grop, which manages El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 locals, optimism is not lost after the second quarter of the year has again flourished and good prospects for the Christmas business, though concentrated on a few days.
Sources of the group of companies stress that the 18th day will also be an overactive day with groups of friends celebrating Christmas.
A Christmas menu for 30 euros or more has been added to the six group menus. One has the impression that customers are willing to spend 10 percent more than in the previous year and in return wish for more details, such as Cava.
In some companies too, green sprouts can be seen, which is why the employees are invited again. This gives the impression that the group lunches are back on the rise.
From the Roofverband Fecasarm (with mergers such as the Barn, Restaurant and Leisure Association of Barcelona), the deputy chairman, Enric Gomà, trusts to see the end of the tunnel and notes that the reservations as a whole are quite "living", although the customers "beat out a maximum".
However, the fun of celebrating has not gone back, no matter who pays.
The Pakistani nuclear programme is a source of great concern in the USA
Islamabad manufactures nuclear weapons "more quickly than any other country".
Revelations of Wikileaks confirm relations between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the North American Embassy in Pakistan and the US Department revealed by the Wikileaks Internet portal confirms the enormous concern of the Pakistani nuclear programme Washington.
On the margins of the clarifying and juicy details that the documents on the content of the talks and the way of thinking of accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad reveal that cooperation between both countries is not strengthened in terms of atomic security, but rather is "absorbed" and that the unstable Asian country produces more nuclear weapons "to a faster rhythm than any other country".
In particular, the peculiarity of the Pakistani nuclear program - that the weapons are not assembled, but that their parts are stored to make their destruction difficult in the event of a possible attack - prepare Washington sleepless nights.
The Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, presents the following risks in a report prior to the visit of former Head of the National Security Council, James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear installations to the area attacked by the Taliban, the probable scatter of the nuclear material and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear material."
The large number of persons implied in the nuclear arsenals and missile programs is no longer considered only by the US, but also by Russia as an extravagant and reason to exercise caution.
"Pakistan needs to recruit strictly believing personnel to monitor nuclear installations; due to the low level of education and culture, extremist organizations have more opportunities to report people working on nuclear or missile programmes," said the expert Yuri Korolev from the Russian Foreign Ministry in a meeting with his North American counterparts.
New to the documentation revealed by Julian Assange's Internet portal is that cooperation between the USA and Pakistan in terms of nuclear distribution is decreasing and the increased pace in which Pakistan produces nuclear weapons.
In May, an office of the Embassy, which describes communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", explains: "There is often no transparency; we do not receive any answers to aid offers or they are rejected."
In another communication, Peter Lavoy, official of the State Intelligence Service for South Asia, confirms that "in spite of the economic disaster Pakistan produces nuclear weapons as quickly as no other country."
Ambassador Patterson asks Washington, during a visit by the chief army chief, General Ashfaq Kayani, to "clarify" the responsible person, that "Pakistan's army has to cease its silent oversupply of terrorist groups."
On the hunt for Wikileak's boss
Obama appoints a highly responsible person for the anti-terrorism struggle to prevent new revelations.
Interpol issued a red warning about the persecution and detection of Assange.
Everything related to Wikileaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth in which the facts are difficult to explain.
Yesterday, Interpol issued a "red warning" on the "discovery and persecution" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional order for arrest.
Furthermore, it is not new, it dates back to 20 November.
It has nothing to do with the last revelation of more than four million diplomatic documents from the US, but with the accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian must face in Sweden.
Furthermore, the lawyer of Wikileak's founder Mark Stephens assures "the police knew where and how to contact Mr. Assange."
As early as the 20th, the International Police Office, based in Lyon, France, issued the order at the request of Sweden, but it was not announced until yesterday after receipt of the authority by the Swedish authorities.
The 188 Interpol countries are required to identify and find Assange, "to arrest and extradite him for the time being."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red warning, according to the Organization's statement, many member countries consider the red warning as a free letter for an arrestment - which must be carried out by the national police - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as it is the case of Sweden and England, where Assange is likely to be present.
Assange's attorney, who had published a letter yesterday informing them that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks was willing to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities by video conference.
They also recall that Assange applied for the exit from Sweden and was granted the corresponding authorisation by the prosecutor, who was compared with the legendary Lavarentiy Pavlovich Beria, Chief of Safety of Stalin.
"This is like a hunt, not like a legal persecution," is charged in the letter.
While the world is looking for him - and his mother from Australia controls her son's innocence - Assange is staying in an unknown place, but not silent.
On Monday, he gave an interview to the head of Time magazine via Skype from an undetermined location. During the conversation, he requested the resignation of the State Secretary of the USA, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be proved that it was responsible for the arrangement of North American diplomats who pioneered UN and thus violated international agreements signed by the USA, it would have to resign," he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, who called the application for withdrawal a "unseemly and absurd".
"I'm not sure why we should pay attention to the opinion of a type with a website," he explained to CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a high-level leader in the anti-terrorism struggle, Rusell Travers, to prevent new document revelations.
The attempt of the speaker of the President Barack Obama to pay less attention to Assange is contrary to the opinions expressed by conservative politicians and commentators in these days.
The Congressman Peter King, who will chair the National Security Committee of the House of Deputies from January, has invited the State Department to investigate the possibility of putting Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations, "to seize their funds and to pursue anyone who supports them or makes a contribution."
Tom Flanagan, advisor to Canadian President Stephen Harper, had gone even further, and he had to withdraw his statement that Assange had to be "killed".
"Obama would have to turn him into a target and use an unmanned plane or something."
Whoever did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist Minister, former Governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever it was who sent information to the government, he is guilty of betrayal and everything that is not execution is a mild punishment," he explained to Fox.
Puigcercós seeks with an eye wink to the Carod Near Peace in the ERC
The Republican leader allows the party to take a secret vote on its survival in office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralist government and the end of the principle of assembly.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe to get out of the way for the 70th time an internal riot in the ranks of after the loss of 11 MEPs and half of the voteless ERC.
The party president is aware that his resignation threat is not enough for the close-up of former party leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira. But he also knows that the influence of this sector is today as weak as its mentor itself and will not give him the same headbreak as other former currents.
Therefore, the leader of Esquerra tries to win the new critics with an eye wink, which would secure his position up to the next municipal elections.
For the beginning, yesterday announced that the more than 200 regional council members of ERC could make a secret statement about their remaining in the office.
With constituencies, not with raised hands.
If the Carodists wanted to miss the President's sentence, they could do so without having to fear repression.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid both the impression of division and the impression of submission among his person.
In several interviews he confirmed that he would feel at least half of the votes plus one not confirmed, and he added no percentages, a result "in Bulgarian style" would not be good either.
The Carod nearby demands more than just the party to make its office available to the President. An insufficient gesture, as Puigcercós controls the highest organ of Congresses.
But since they do not have a sufficient majority to force withdrawals, they will agree with the Board of Directors a strategy from now until May.
They expect to be able to take part in the preparation of the document on strategic reorientation that the management will present to the Council on 18th December.
Her intention is to guarantee Puigcercós. In return, he is to promise to present the Congress in the autumn of 2011, which the party's head already considers to be a fact.
The party president of the ERC believes that the "polyphony" is damaging to stability and he strives once and for all to enable the organization to wash their dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article signed by the acting conseller Josep Huguet in his blog is symptomatic.
In view of the fact that Puigcercós is an ideologist, the owner of Innovació considered it a fact that the party president was supported "in exchange for different goals".
He made up five, two of which are in the foreground.
First of all, the "restructuring" of the Executive Board so that it represents at least 90 percent of the party members, that is, the inclusion of new faces from Carod's environment.
The second could be the big news.
Huguet proposes that ERC should finally give up the principle of general assembly as an operation.
This will bring about a reform of the statutes which will allow Congresses to hold with elected delegates.
From the end of the assembly model - an exception to the Spanish party system - Puigcercós' team, which already fought for it at the last two congresses, is like possessed.
In fact, at the 2008 trembling assembly, the party leadership was commissioned to review the principle of general assembly at a congress to deal with the reform of the Statute.
This appointment is still pending, as information gle of the internal rest of the last few years has not been advisable in dealing with this matter.
Now, without the critical sectors on the laurel, the time may have come for this matter to take up and end forever.

China maintains its greenhouse gas reduction targets
At COP16, the representative of China stated that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon traces and it would maintain its offer to reduce 40 to 45 percent of its greenhouse gases by 2020.
China keeps its offer to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, assures Su Wei, the representative of this country at COP16.
During his first public appearance at the 16th United Nations Climate Summit (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon footprints and convert his industry.
He explained that in the last four years, his country has invested 245 million dollars in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
On the other hand, he stated that China would not change its goals, but would work together with the international community on this matter.
He explained that the Chinese climate change strategy is subdivided into four aspects: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programmes.
In all aspects, progress has been made, including the adoption of a new energy law last year, which includes the objectives of reducing emissions of gases.
On the other hand, he pointed out that in China the authorities of the federal states had cooperated with those of the central state and the municipalities in order to achieve the energy saving, effective use of energy and reduction of emissions.
In addition, he explained, some multi-year plans have already been launched or completed, both those financed by the Chinese government and those received from other countries.
For example, he referred to the programme for the effective use of energy, which has been introduced over the last five years and has received United Nations (UNO), government and private investment.
There is also a project at the province level on climate change, another to exchange traditional light bulbs with energy-saving bulbs and another one to weaken and adapt, he said.
Martin Krol, scientific government adviser on climate change in this country, confirmed that China’s efforts would be far greater than generally accepted.
He pointed out that the per capita emission of greenhouse gases in China amounts to six tonnes per person, while in the United States it is 100 tonnes. China is responsible for a nine percent overall environmental pollution contribution.
Similarly, it makes unprecedented progress in the field of energy use. Energy efficiency has been increased by 20 percent over the last five years and is expected to take place by 2020, he said.
Legal exclusion Espinos: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN stated that the former panist party president had the right to turn to the National Committee of Orders and to ask what the right to him would be.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espino Barriento was on the right and that the former party president of the PAN had the right to turn to the National Committee of Orders and to demand what the right granted him.
In an interview held before Gabino Cué Monteagudos as Governor of the State, he stated that Espino's exclusion was a decision taken at local level.
"It is an independent decision of the Ordinance Commission in Sonora."
"Mr Espino has the right, in his case, to refer to the Comisión de Orden del Consejo Nacional on the grounds of appeal, so that a decision is taken by a competent body," he added.
On the other hand, he explained that it was not time to think about 2012 and that an alliance to the presidential candidates had never sat at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Acción Nacional emerged from the internal vote on 4 and 5 December in which his successor was elected.
"The (an alliance in 2012) is an issue that was never on the negotiating table, at least not until now. It was a proposal for the municipal election, it was successful and fulfilled its purpose," he said.
The panist leader explained that the PAN looks back at 71 years of dialogue, so "the internal competition does not frighten us; on the contrary, "we enjoy it and it strengthens us," he said.
He said that the Council would undoubtedly choose the best chairman, which Acción Nacional needs for the next three years. Therefore, he gave the staff over "to those whom the Council would determine."
I would be proud to hand over the office of the party president to each of the five."
He predicted that the Party's upswing in the last elections of July 4 would be reflected in the next elections, although "it is not time to think of 2012."
"Now it's about supporting Governor Gabino Cué in his role."
In this context, he pointed out that the three governments that emerged from alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa would carry the flag and be observed throughout the country. Therefore, "many hopes and longings are placed in it and I am sure Gabino is up to date."
When he was questioned about the critique of PRI at President Felipe Calderón for his discosure in the framework of his four-year government, César Nava called on the adherents of PRI to reflect on the six-year period of former President Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón, they should start defending them, they should finally get out of the closet," he confirmed.
He believes that the owner of the Federal Government could make expressions like those he could make in his discourse in the Auditorio Nacional, because in this country there would be no mouth ban and even less a censorship.
Obama is committed to the law for undocumented students in Twitter
"If you are for the adoption of the Dream Act, call your senators and press for the adoption of this law," the president of the United States twittered on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today supported national mobilization to support the Dream Act - law on legalising undocumented students with a message on his personal blog on the social network Twitter.
"If you are for the adoption of the Dream Act, call your senators and press for the adoption of this law," Obama twittered.
Its short notice contains a cyber link to a more comprehensive document that calls on the public to come into contact with their senators, as the vote of the law is imminent.
"With your voice we are waiting for, the time has come to listen to you," he emphasizes.
The news was spread after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block all votes for each law, except the extension of tax reductions from the time of Bush and the financing of the government would be extended.
Such a blockade, announced on a letter signed by the 42 Republican Senators, could affect the coordination of the Dream Act law and other projects such as the ratification of the new START agreement with Russia against the spread of nuclear weapons.
About the blockade of the Republicans of the Dream Act Act and other projects, President-in-Office Robert Gibbs said he trusted that once the tax issue has been resolved, a timetable could be set for the other projects.
"I think we still have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that the tax issue must be settled before the end of the year..."
"I believe that we can reach an agreement on this at any time and then we can plan the course of the rest," he said.
The chairman of the democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that "he would request the vote at the end of the debate" so that the Dream Act - law, with which the initiative for the legalisation of undocumented students could be voted in the Senate from next Thursday, although the next week would be more likely.
The version of the Dream Act, or the law of the American dream, would legalize about 800,000 young people who had immigrated to the United States when they were not yet sixteen years old, during the last five years in that country, and who have been enrolled in a higher educational institution or in the army.
But the advocates of the law need sixty votes to adopt the initiative, which is why they depend on the voices of a handful of Republicans. Currently, the organisations of the advocates of this project organize an intensive influence on the adoption of the law.
The Democrats, of which the majority support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson from Nebraska, said he would vote against it and only one Republican, Richard Lugar from Indiana, announced his support of the law.
Therefore, the defenders of the Dream Act must get several Republicans to their side if other democrats decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most advertised Republicans are the Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Senator George Lemieux from Florida, who took over the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they declared that they no longer support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who spoke out for the law, John McCain, has not yet defined his attitude.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, the analysts agree that the Dream Act in the Senate is facing the biggest obstacles.
Put your finger in the wound with literature
The second round of 'The lust for the language' was a walk in which the participants made themselves strong for the narrative
"I understand that with the sex in the language, but... The finger in the wound? What is expected of me?", the writer Luisa Valenzuela, who was to open the second round of 'Los places de la lengua', asked a cycle that celebrated Spanish literature and on this occasion used the subtitles of her question (at another event, the Round Table was dedicated to sex in the language, she explained).
The finger in the wound... "brings us in trouble," spitted the Argentinean writer sweetly to the audience, who mainly consisted of young people who met at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to attend this round table moderated by Marisol Shutz, where Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero took part.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, and then described the Shultz as a great story. Luisa tells in the first person and is the protagonist who is looking for what a "wound" is and goes from doctor to doctor, of whom she does not receive an answer, but notes to the guide of her story.
She leaves the infectious person convinced: "Patience is not my strength, perhaps it is my wound."
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the traumatologist who took her breath in the middle of the gang, and who explains to her that wound is not a scientific term, the psychoanalyst unearths the mystery: "The wound is really open, the symbolic is the scar."
The main character of the narrative sighs and concludes that "it only learned from the wound that it is really open and does not exist", but it is convinced that the desire for language and its traps is mixed.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a delightful story that he called 'Lob of Invention', and in which the finger in the wound is not mentioned, but discovered.
With allusions to magic realism, he tells of a famous sorcerer who touched the clouds, brought back far-traveled men, or restored the virtue lost by a girl. The story made a turnaround and reported on America, the great novel that was not missing from his own chroniclers from the beginning, and he quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticized the abundance of the stories told by the conquerors.
"Cervantes, who invited us all (the writers), mocked the false witness who appeared in the stories as true, but in other ways the story of America would never have been told - with imagination, who even got rid of shame."
However, he emphasizes, "it is the crazy and liars who best imagine things," and there reality and lies approach each other, where one no longer knows which side belongs to the narrative, where fictitious literature reaches the summit.
He actually calls it the 'Tradition Cervantes'.
"From him we have inherited to be what is told."
When Mayra Montero was in the row, the writer commented and praised the diversity of interpretations to which the FIL's invitation to the Round Table 'The Finger in the Wound' had contributed.
The Cuban and Puerto Rican have devoted their contribution to the great wound of social violence that befalls her country - like all of Latin America - as a result of the fights against drug trafficking.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a silent, not intentional commitment," she explained, after emphasizing that literature is communication and commitment that builds up between the author and the readers as in a "chemical reaction".
The evening the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose contribution was also "this finger of the dedicated writer in the wound of the writer" hevorhob.
He noted that in a fast-moving world the intellectual habits and control of consciousness on dogmatisms will also run out, and forget that "after every confirmation there is a little no and behind every denial a small yes."
"To be in possession of our thoughts and reality, we must nuance: And nuance often means putting our fingers in the wound and harassing those who feel much more comfortable when they think in the form of cartoons, in black and white, in prefabricated ideas without nuances, and also harassing the powerful who prefer to divide the world into black and white he noticed and invited a sense of writing again.
Romano fights for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks back at three defeats in final games, he has experienced Aufs and Abs in his career, but he played decisive games three times.
In the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the end of the game there are also two different styles, set by their respective trainers, and their encounters are reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back at three defeats in final matches, he has experienced Aufs and Abs in his career, but he has had decisive games three times, and so far he has kept himself well, which is why this opportunity is of particular importance to him.
The Argentinian played with the medal for the second champion, he was a step behind the winners, and surprisingly he played with the same team of consecutive finals.
The Santist Strategy reached the first final game as a coach in the 'Torneo Apertura 2002', when del Morelia had the reins in his hand, with which he experienced a great defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, at the 'Clausura 2003' he reached the decisive duel, which he also lost 3-1 against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010' in which they played against Los Diablos, Rubén had to strike a setback again, as the game with 2-2 against Los Choriceros went out undecided after 210 minutes of play, but at the Elfmeter he came with 3-1 forward and got two ways to insert his title, but ultimately three of his players missed the eleven steps and the game turned to a 4-3.
Rubén had already lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival. Therefore, he does not want to be persecuted again by the accident and freed from the evil spell in order to be able to celebrate a title for the first time, although he confirms that the most important thing for him is the game itself.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break statistics, that's for a club, for my affection I give, and that's why the title will come to me, but what happened before is the most important thing," said the taxpayer when he was asked about the lost final games.
The last final game was still in his memory, he assured, learned a lot from it: "The only lesson we can draw from it is that until the referee doesn't blow the end, we can't celebrate, we're on the line, the players are also prepared, because the last time we were already prepared to leave with two 11 meters, and I think that this is a teaching until the game is finished, there is no reason to celebrate."
Knowing that this series could be decided by elfmeter shooting does not disturb him, for he trusts his players: "You never want to arrive at the Elfmeter shooting, you want to finish in the regular playing time, but sometimes there is no alternative and you have to be prepared for it, in the previous tour we were prepared, but unfortunately fate prepared us a bad game, sometimes due to nervousness or the fierce desire to hold the title already in our hands, which left us something for this final game, and we hope that it won't happen this time."
It is in Romanso power to be no longer just second champion and for the first time to taste the fame that the titles bring with it.
The US amends the rules for obtaining a visa
The persons must present themselves before they talk at the consulate to the service departments for visa applications; costs will be reduced.
From 10 January 2011, the procedures for applying for a visa will be changed in the US Embassy and in the consulates.
In the new procedure, most applicants must present themselves to the visa application services (ASC, the initial letters in English) prior to their consultation with the Consulate.
The staff of the ASC shall record the biometric data of the applicant, which shall be reviewed by the Consulate before the interview.
The new procedure has certain advantages for the aspirations, including:
The total cost of processing the visa is reduced, as it is no longer necessary to pay separately the appointment, processing of the visa application and the transport service with which the document is handed out.
The applicant shall make only one payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the equivalent of 140 dollars for a tourist visa, 150 dollars for visas with application (including visas for temporary workers) and 390 dollars for hands and investors.
Those who just want to extend their visas don't have to talk in the consulate, they only have to imagine themselves at the next ASC, where they present their documents and their fingerprints.
As the biometric data are collected in the ASC, applicants who need a second appointment for the consulate will remain there less time than before.
Those who apply for the visa in the consulates of Ciudad Chihuahua, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer have to pay the service charge of 26 dollars.
Further information on the new visa application procedure can be found on the following website: http://mexico.usembassy.gov/bolets/sp101201_Visas-FAQ.html
NASA announces the discovery of extraterrestrial life
The North American Space Agency called a press conference to present tomorrow a fund that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The National Aerospace Authority (NASA) of the United States announces tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The find will be presented tomorrow at 13.00 a.m. at a press conference at NASA headquarters in Washington by astrobiology experts. It is a science that examines the origin, development, distribution and the future of life in the universe.
When the press conference was convened, NASA assured that it would present "a supervisory fund for the search for extraterrestrial life", which triggered speculation among experts from other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that it could exist human-like creatures in hostile environments that have been thought to be uninhabitable so far. It was the hypothesis that they could transform into intelligent living beings - like humans - if their living conditions improved.
It seems to be a microbe found on the basis of the Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California. It lives there in an environment that has been thought too toxic for all possible forms of life, because the lake is highly arsenic.
In some way, the microbie uses the arsenic as a survival resource. Taking this ability into account, the chances of similar life on other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere may increase.
If these organisms metabolize arsenic, according to astrobiologists, it has been shown that "there is actually another form of life, a second form of life that differs from the one known to us."
The Space Agency will announce the actual reach of its fund tomorrow, Thursday, at the press conference.
The conference is attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who examines the possibility of life on Mars, and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who studies Titan (the largest moon of Saturn) under the question of whether his chemical composition is similar to that of the Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón form an opposition block
With the reform of the Organ Law on Congress, the two-party system is introduced, they complain.
The 60th legislative period had just begun, and an opposition block was already installed, led by PRD representatives, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who imagined himself to be independent. The four questioned the following: the introduction of the 'two-party system' into the chamber.
Before the introduction of the 60th legislative period, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and Patrón Montalvo opposed the reform of the organ law as they would be excluded.
With this reform, they repeated, a 'two-party system' would be introduced, because now there would be two people, the same number as parties controlling the Congress.
These four delegates, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the Bureau, led by the Panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca in his capacity as vice-chairman.
Corvera Quevedo stated that the parties with these reforms had institutionally introduced their political bridging.
He explained that in the next few days they would talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme. In doing so, they assumed their political will and if they did not have it, they would be wrong again by both parties, which would put an end to the opposition coalition.
"Up until here I (the opposition coalition), that is what I see, because we are excluded from all decisions, which do not even take into account the opinion of the others."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia stated that there were similarities with PRD, PT and Patrón and that therefore a pluralist group would be formed.
It cannot be allowed, he continued that after being monopolistic, the Congress should now be "duopolistic".
"It's not the spirit of law reform that Congress should have an eternal two-party system."
"For the beginning, this group begins with five Members and they talk to other colleagues to make them more," said the Convergencia member.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of PT, in allusion to PAN and PRI, argued that the Congress had currently turned into a 'beer' for two.
"Before that, it was only one party, now they split it up for two."
Patrón Montalvo asked to respect the Members and to assign their place to the negotiating tables.
"The five who are currently seen as being divided into different groups have decided to unite to take our place at the negotiating table, because of the reform that the others have undertaken and agreed to, and we do not agree to this reform."
200 000 peso more for "the supplier"
Mazatlán City Administration pays another check to the controversial owner of the electrical material company.
Another check over just over 200 000 peso in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuleos was issued by the city administration.
This means that the sum paid to the owner of the electrical material company in the second half of the year is 1 200 000 pesos.
According to the page for greater transparency of the city administration, this check, issued at 200.144.56 peso with number 9258447, was issued last 16 November with the purpose of " account of open invoices".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had already sent in advance that more money would go from the community to this delivery agent. It is observed by the Auditoría Superior del Estado because it sells at overprices.
What has not been mentioned is the total amount still to be owed to it and consequently the number of checks still to be issued in favor of Camacho Palazueros.
"There was nothing purchased from her, just the debts are paid, just like the other suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "shown again" in the last quarter of the year: September 24th, October 15th, October 19th, October 29th and November 16th.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal, as required by law, if a company is called into question by the ASE in order to prevent other administrations from requesting their services, the treasurer assured that their services would not be used again.
After the Noroeste newspaper had published on 25 July the audit of the checks issued by the city administration to its suppliers, it became known that the municipality had already paid over 10 million pesos with 42 cheques to Camacho Palazueleos from March 2008 to 9 July 2010 during the three-year term of office of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez.
Businesses with Jumapam also took place where they collected checks worth over 3 million peso.
Tourist places need to be improved
Tourist companies regret the accident of foreign tourists due to the poor condition of Glorietta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist into the invasion of Glorietta Sánchez Taboada, the tourism industry of Mazatlán asked the authorities to pay particular attention to the areas in poor condition and to the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, chairman of the Zona Dorada Trade Union Association, recalled that on different occasions it was required to maintain the destination and transform the bad conditions found by tourists into new employment opportunities or routes.
He said that the bad condition of the roads and walkways had a negative effect, as the tourists would be able to wander and see the disorder, and then they would turn their backs on the nearby shops.
"Politics don't know what it means to have to close a business one day and they don't think about how much money you lose, because otherwise they wouldn't do the construction work in this way slowly and without plans."
The hotel owner José Ramón Manguard Sánchez said that the fall of the tourist would have drawn attention to the lack of prevention and the ongoing maintenance work on the part of the city.
"The community must assume its responsibility and avoid this happening again. How to do this? Now, by a preventive maintenance instead of improving everything afterwards," he said.
"We are waiting longing to have a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area, it has to be maintained, we residents also have a right to a clean habitat. The city administration must change its strategy to keep the city in good condition."
"There are other places that also look unattended and unfinished," he said, "e.g. el Escudo y el Venadito by Mazatlán."
"Today we need more than just advertising to attract tourists. A good product has to be offered, a city that cleans its beaches and streets, and keeps the tourist attractions constantly in the fire," he added.
"These arrangements have not been given enough attention and this kind of incidents are merely what is obvious to all: a maintenance is urgently needed."
Raúl Llera Martínez, Under-Secretary of Promoción Turística, expressed the importance of saving the tourist resorts of Mazatlán, because they would not be used properly and made a bad picture.
He mentioned a number of places that would have to be brought to the front with the city. To design the city clean, neat and attractive for tourism should be priority.
"Happyly, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites that need to be cleaned and cleaned at first, in order to make them attractive to tourism and to bring them to the inventory we advertise for this destination.
IP calls for results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of the CCE, suggested that Members should take on the great responsibility to give an example of a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
Mazatlán's business sector calls for a worthy Parliament, free of consultation between the parties and the government, for Sinaloa is troubled and faces great problems.
Yesterday, the 60th Parliament was inaugurated. It consists of seven political forces, 19 representatives of the PRI, 13 of PAN, three of Partido Nueva Alianza, two of PRD, one of PT, one of Convergencia and one of PVEM's.
The new members of the State Congress are expected to do a clean job, to feel committed to society and to the various social groups dependent on responsible parliamentary work, and not to repeat the same patterns of partyism and paternalism.
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of the CCE Entrepreneurship Coordination Council, suggested that the new representatives should take on the great responsibility to give a model for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
"We hope that Members will really exercise their right to act free of agreement between the parties, for it is customary for them to make agreements with which they represent their own interests, thereby transforming into carnival comparses of the rulers and the leaders of the parliamentary groups."
He said that they should demonstrate their commitment to building the necessary bridges to support the current government.
"We take care that they carry out a trustworthy work and work for society and its groups above all, for it was the inhabitants of Sinaloa who expressed their trust in the last elections."
José Ramón Manguard Sánchez, Chairman of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, believes that one of the major challenges facing the 40 representatives is the drive and joint work for the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is extremely complicated.
"The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, create investment incentives and infrastructure measures, which in some way will promote job creation."
With regard to the tourism sector, he called on the new Members to give the necessary priority to the Ministry of Tourism in order to promote the public budget.
"I have understood that it is the Ministry with the second fewth means, which is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings foreign exchange and investment into the country and is in direct competition with the agro-industrial industry."
The tourist projects must be allocated funds, state security must be supported and the alcohol law, which has not been recast during previous legislative periods, must be updated.
Holy King Seeked
Dolls, cars, bicycles and other toys desire the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
On the next three-king day, it will be difficult for parents to fulfill these wishes, for the household is no more than 12 people and a goat goat.
Nevertheless, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not give up the hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar will give them the toys and the garments that they look forward to.
The family inhabits a modest house in the settlement of Salvador Allende. They live by hand in the mouth, for the father has no fixed work.
"Sometimes hard times have been told because my husband has no job, but we sell mandarins and potatoes... I'm going to the streets with the goors for sale in the afternoon," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Four-year-old Adelaida would like a doll or a bicycle, while her three-year-old sister Isabel wants a Barbie doll.
Ten-year-old José Alfredo wants to have a 'Monster Car' for some time and for his eight-month-old brother Jesús, Cayetana proposes clothing in size for one-year-olds.
" (José Alfredo) told me, 'I would have liked this monster', but I answered him, 'Let's wait, boy', because it was very expensive," Cayetana lamented.
For the older children who were in school, clothing and shoes would be ideal.
Eleven-year-old María Guadalupe has the size 12; ten-year-old Isaías has the size 10, while the eight-year-old Miguel size 8 has.
The 14-year-old José Juan lacks tennis shoes. A pair of sizes 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you would like to help realize the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family, you can participate in the campaign 'Holy King is being sought' by donating a toy or cash in the reception hall of the Noroeste newspaper.
14 suspected drug dealers arrested
On Wednesday, a production and sales network of cannabis around 10 house searches were carried out in the Estrie administrative region.
Fourteen persons were arrested and several charges will be brought against them.
The house searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, in places that were supposed to be primarily used for the manufacture of drugs.
"Approximately 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, cash and equipment that served production have been confiscated," stated Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for the Quebec Security Police.
A total of eleven men and three women were arrested, two of them from Sherbrooke, who are considered the main wires of the drug ring.
The arrested persons should have appeared in Sherbrooke already hours after their arrest in front of the judicial building.
They could be accused, among other things, of accusing the production of cannabis, its assets for sale, the plot, and the service of crime.
These house searches had taken place as a result of a lengthy investigation that took place for over a year.
"The information received from public authorities has enabled us to carry out these arrests," M. Ruel explained.
Around 70 police officers from the Estria Regional Investigation Unit of the Quebec Security Police Department, Sherbrooke Police Department and Memphis Police Department had participated in this police operation.
Secret immigration could be pursued without problems
The draft bill of the Conservatives, which according to the government is intended to address the problem of ships loaded with foreign immigrants, will, of course, be stifled after the three opposition parties have announced on Wednesday that they cannot support the proposal.
"I strongly oppose this Charter."
"I hold with a party that has laid hold on your feet," said Michael Ignativf, head of the Liberals, after the weekly Caucus meeting in front of the assembled Members.
The Liberals claimed that the draft law, which allows any person identified as a person for the transport of illegal immigrants to be detained for up to a year, infringes the Canadian Constitution of Law and Freedom, as proposed.
Gilles Duceppe, head of the Bloc Québécois, also indicated that he could not support the draft law because he was opposed to the wrong target group.
"We are opposed and it seems that all the opposition parties are opposed, so we will wait for what the government is doing," said M. Duceppe.
The criticism of Olivia Chow's immigration question, NDP, has rejected the critics who demand that their party did not behave firmly enough toward the secret immigrants.
"The Neo-democrates agree to take action against the blind passengers, and this is what we are trying to enforce by means of another draft law, C-35," said Chow.
We therefore do not support the Conservatives' bill because it seeks to blame the refugees and keeps children trapped for at least one year," Chow said.
The immigration minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties of playing with politics and ignoring the will of the Canadians.
"The Canadians strongly inform the honourable Member that they do not tolerate this kind of secret immigration, these criminal acts affecting Canada and treating the country as a pedestrian."
"You expect Canada to take tough action," said Minister Kenneys.
"The government has not announced any vote of confidence in its draft law that could have led the country to elections that the government would have rejected.
However, a conservative said to the QMI agency that the government would convene a vote so that every opposing Member would immediately declare himself to his electorate.
The new unit finds no unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a new standing unit for the fight against corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the formation of a public investigation committee on this issue.
Robert Dutil, Minister of Public Security, claims that this idea did not come from yesterday: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this subject last January.
Since 1870, the metropolis has had a standing unit against corruption.
Nevertheless, the announcement of Wednesday has more than one surprise.
It must be said that this measure was not least discussed at the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Quebec Police Service on 29 October last year despite the presence of Robert Dutils.
It was also not missing that Stéphane Bergeron, critic and member of the Parti Québécois, qualified this announcement in public security as "a rabbit enchanted from the hat" and "a solution that is properly crafted at a table end".
On the other hand, Minister Dutil had turned to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the future unity that is in question.
"You will see the result when we announce it," he confirmed.
"One is aware of this problem."
According to Réjean Parent, President of the CSQ, nothing can replace the conduct of a public survey.
"The more M. Charest insists on trying to prevent the formation of this investigation committee, the more people like you and I think he has something to hide," he said.
"The only means to be able to form an investigation committee is the resignation of Jean Charest," said Yves Boisvert, lecturer of ethics and policy systems at the ENA (State University for the Training of High Administrative Officers).
In order to get out of this deadlock, he proposes to Quebec that financial audit checks be given a special mandate to enable them to carry out investigations on corruption and secret agreements.
"One should be able to extend the mandate of auditing," he decided.
He also believes that Quebec could grant auditing the same power as Commissioners, which would also allow you to commit people to the statement.
The creation of a standing unit is not the only project in the drawers of the Charest government.
Quebec will also demand Ottawa to amend the criminal law in order to be better placed on this kind of crime.
This demand comes from the Chief State Prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law is not clear in this way of prosecution.
Vic Toews, Minister of State for Public Security, confirmed that his colleague, Rob Nicholson, was currently dealing with certain innovations concerning this dossier.
During the 2001 Operation Printemps, which concerned the groups of motorcycle police, 131 persons had been arrested, although the criminal law had not been novelized.
Ottawa has therefore enforced the law against gangsterism.
Rivers under strict supervision
Several rivers remain under strict surveillance due to the high rainfall that has occurred in some regions of the province since Tuesday.
In Shawinigan, in the Maurice administrative region, an earth slide occurred on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses were preventively evacuated.
In the evening another land slide took place in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the Lanaudiere administrative region.
A road has collapsed.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, severe rainfalls ranged from 40 to 70 millilitres in several regions.
Between 20 and 40 further millimeters of rainfall were expected here in accordance with the regions until Thursday evening.
The areas north of the river and the valley of the Outaouais region were most affected.
A total of up to 100 millimeters of rain showers had fallen here.
Since the snowmelting that has already accumulated in certain sub-areas is still to be added to these rainfalls, the crossing of several watercourses is feared.
On Wednesday evenings, warnings were issued by the Quebec Security Service on the flood alarm concerning the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in the Lanaudiere region.
The rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentine Mountains and the Chêne in Lotbinière become the object of flood surveillance and remain under observation.
In the Lanaudière region, the violent rainfall has caused the transition of some lakes to Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare as well as to Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, an elliptical bridge was torn away due to the heavy rainfall.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais, the crossing of certain lakes has caused the closure of several roads, especially in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The security service remains in alert and monitors the situation precisely, says Security Councillor Annik Bouchard.
On Wednesday, the Quebec High Water Center issued warnings of the strong rise of several rivers, in particular of Maskinongé, Assomtion, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partially reproved
The Quebec radio moderator Stéphane Dupont has suffered a partial setback in front of the Canadian Radio Standards Supervisory Board (CCNR) because of his controversial comments on social welfare and Haitians as well as due to his unusual speech on radio.
While the CCNR represents the opinion that M. Dupont and his CHOI 98,1 FM team would have the right to express their own views, certain comments would have "inaccurate information on the social welfare and unauthorised negative representations of the Haitians, as well as such unhappiness, which is not appropriate for the day-to-day broadcasts."
The Supervisory Board had also concluded that a debate on suicide involving the dissemination of the names of two persons who committed suicide was in breach of the Radio Transmission Code.
The CCNR had received several complaints concerning the comments made during the 2008 and 2010 broadcasts.
The first order was made as a result of a complaint from the "Front Communin des personnes assistées sociales du Québec".
The Activist Organisation had complained that the amounts mentioned in the consignment were inaccurate.
The moderators should provide solid information rather than misleading information.
Regarding suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont thought that suicide was an expression of cowardice.
The majority of the Supervisory Board members had concluded that the transmitted message was that suicide should not be considered a solution to life crises.
"The majority of the Supervisory Board takes into account that the consequences of the "Dupont le midi" broadcast would have been sensitive in a family-friendly and appropriate way."
Therefore, he was not betrothed to his person.
The last dispute concerned the statements relating to the Haiti earthquake.
In this regard, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had delivered a media-active dispute that caused a lot of reactions.
The CHOI moderator had declared that he did not donate to Haiti's help, as one did not know with certainty whether the needy would actually receive the donations.
The Supervisory Board considers that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect represents an unwarranted negative representation of the Haitians.
"I have already cancelled my three-day suspension sentence in this case."
"My file has been virgin for a year and a half," said the moderator.
In all decisions, the Supervisory Board recommends the dissemination of an unhappinessed expression.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM had acted "in addition to its obligations".
The consequences for the broadcaster, who, among other things, had to report his decisions once during the main transmission period within a period of three days, are minor.
A King of the Kung Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, Montreal Algerian origin, has taken a very special course.
The athlete, who shines in "Sanda" (full contact Kung-Fu), in the kickbox and in the Thai box, now rises in the search for new challenges on the Tatami and in the boxing rings of the world.
"I started martial arts such as Kung-Fu and Kickboxen 12 years ago in Algeria," said Zemmal, who has been in the metropolis since 2008 to further develop among the professionals.
I personally seek the battle everywhere, because for those who don't like the ground fight, as the mixed martial arts present it, competitions in North America are rare."
Recently, he worked as a security official and at the company UPS had given his rivals bad news, in which he won two gold medals from the World Karate and the Kickboxing Association (WKA) in the world championship held in Edinburgh, Scotland, between 23 and 30 October.
"I won the victory in the categories of full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing," he said.
"At present I'm preparing for the World Cup in San Shou in China."
"There were those fighters from every category who had been placed among the first four in the last World Championship."
"I brought baby in Toronto Bronze in 2009."
"In 2005 I became an Achter in Vietnam."
"In 2007, I finished the tournament in China in fifth place, while I became third in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"It's worth mentioning that I've made progress in every competition."
"With this rhythm I will become first this time or next year!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are disciplines from China in which fists and footsteps as well as flooring are permitted.
The two battles usually take place on a platform, more rarely in a boxing ring.
The most renowned boxing fighter, resulting from this type of martial arts, is the American Vietnamese origin Cung Le, which is probably known in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal kept only one event back in his career, he would certainly call his presence at the Super Tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of the Kung-Fu.
"This competition is the highest ranking and most prestigious in China," the sympathetic pound guy explained.
"It's a bit like the equivalent to the Lumpinee Stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand).
"That was a great experience."
In the semifinals of his category (80kg) he won his first fight before losing in the finals.
"The one who defeated me was a real professional," he analyzed.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg).
"The winners of the semifinals meet each other in the finals of their category."
"Then the winners of each category offer themselves the forehead to crown a single champion, the King of the Kung Fu."
450 million in contracts without tender
Hydro-Québec has mutually agreed to grant project planning companies 450 million dollars in contracts for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydropower project.
In the middle of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium consisting of the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupse SM and Axor, which has received the most important share, namely that of the project management, to a sum of 295 million dollars without tendering.
This consortium, called "Energie gérance", was formed in 2004 as a accompanying publication of the decision of Hydro-Québec, the private sector's responsibility to hand over this important hydroelectric project to a sum of 5 billion dollars.
At the beginning of 2005, the Énergie gérance consortium received the lucrative contract without any public tender.
For the Parti Québécois, recourse to business consortia is a serious ethical problem that raises the risk of competition and increases prices.
"This is a new way of playing a carded game, and it disincentives competition."
"This means that instead of taking off-card games, they are now carried out in an open form in a secret way," said Sylvain Simard, Member of the PQ, at the press conference yesterday.
In the early morning, Simard had raised the question before the National Assembly, for it seems difficult to understand how the public interest can be used in this way.
Minister of Resources Nathalie Normaneau had responded in the afternoon by vehemently advocating that this contract would have been a discounted game.
"I remain true to my line," she weathered by strengthening that the PQ had been "unreasonably" and it "misses her hardness."
She said it was "be the minimum" that the PQ apologized.
The model of the consortium is common practice worldwide.
It is usually such a temporary alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their expertise regarding a bid for a complex project.
The "Eastmain" project has a high level of complexity as regards its work size.
The construction process is under way and is expected to be established by 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without a competition being able to take place; negotiations had already been held.
In addition, even in relatively simple projects, the model of the consortium in Quebec is no longer an exception.
As the newspaper "Le Devoir" noted last week, the model of the consortium used in the field of civil engineering and consulting is the subject of government investigations.
A short flight of the Quebec business register allows to name more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to be of continuous duration.
In this way, for example, Dessau works in partnership with the majority of its core competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or Roche and Tecsult.
Any link, and of which there are several dozens, leads back to one and the same legal person, namely to Dessau.
Regarding the consortium "Energie gérance", Minister Normaneau stressed that "the territory of Baie James is subject to a special labour force dynamics and that Hydro-Québec has been taking this fact into account in a special way since the 1970s".
Réal Laporte, the great employer of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has made a statement that the nasal on the fact that the project management contract has been approved after agreement.
"If you make a tender and there are only a few applicants, your prices will be fast."
"So you have two options: either you take the people who are on this march and tell you: you will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price."
"However, the idea is that not the price is crucial, but the expertise of the persons," Laporte confirmed.
This contract, approved by the Consortium "Énergie gérance", is part of a long list of contracts over 50,000 dollars received by the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were either approved by the Hydro-Québec or the SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
According to the review, the newspaper "Le Devoir" had more than 100 engineering and consulting contracts, which were approved by companies or their branches, including, in particular, resource laboratories, between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had acquired 22 contracts in itself, Génivar had received 16 Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without taking part in "Energie gérance".
All these contracts have been negotiated.
In total, they amounted to $449 783 344, including the contract with "Énergie gérance" over $295 131 564.
Sylvain Simard had announced that the four companies that form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) were probably known to the "Parti libéral du Québec".
Minister Normaneau had made it sound that the PQ was equally connected to the companies she "financed" before she specified that it was rather their managers.
Barometer Conscious Consumption - The "green" label is not trusting
Green, but uncirclingly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has little confidence in the main players of sustainable growth, but also in the trademarks or eco-labelling that are intended to control his choice.
Shame, although it bathes in a media-active universe, where information in favour of a more responsible consumption is only so: the barometer of responsible consumption has to complain of a lack of credible information, an inadequacy that is evident as a brake on his commitment, as the first reading showed, which was held yesterday.
Although they have advanced the consumption of the so-called socially acceptable products in 2010, Quebecers still seem to have little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two thirds of Quebec's population admits that it does not believe the environmental commitment of companies as much as the green advertising of businesses, so the measuring instrument developed by the responsible consumer centre of the University of Sherbrooke reveals.
Another finding is that half of consumers doubt the trustworthiness of the official certificates, which are supposedly attached to fair products, but also the credibility of the products and brands that declare themselves to be environmentally conscious, says the barometer.
Under the same pattern, politicians' discourse on this issue is taken seriously by only 14.6% of the Quebec population.
However, information on responsible consumption seems to be important to stimulate this consumption segment, which is currently being revived by almost one third of Quebec's consumers.
Indeed, emptiness and dubiousness of information dampened the zeal of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the barometer after the higher price of the products.
In addition, one third of Quebecers are suspicious of the declared performance of green products and services that they are trying to lay down.
According to another communication, more than half of consumers had changed their habits in 2010 and mainly changed the brand of one or more products in order to express their conviction.
According to Barometer, they also preferred 61% purchases from dealers of their districts and favoured the purchase of food grown in their region.
Greener and more responsible - the index of environmentally conscious consumption had reached a 64 of the maximum value of 100 this year - the homo consumer of Quebec loves to present himself as a king of recycling, trying to reduce its traces left in the environment by taking care of animal welfare.
However, the social and ecological consciousness seems to be halting its car, according to the barometer: just 28% of Quebecers have indicated that they have used public transport in 2010 or preferred the car headquarters to demonstrate their ecological interest.
Stepping and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of the participants in this comprehensive behavioural survey, which feeds the clichés.
State bonds for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Quebec Government, which was invited by Société Angus and the company Parallèle to participate financially in the acquisition of the cinema complex eXcentris, agrees with a cooperation, but only in the form of a competitive bond.
The developer company Angus and the company Parallèle, which had hoped for a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to take over the Daniel Langlois-owned cinema complex eXcentris on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent, in order to re-acquire it, apparently do not receive what they asked for.
Although the government has accepted its involvement in this matter, on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Quebec Government offers a bond less than the initially hoped-for amount that could create an existing solution on favourable conditions, at least in the opinion of the sources which are removable from the government's rumour kitchen.
A first action plan and a request for 12.8 million had already been rejected from Quebec last spring, and the request has been re-corrected by summation.
A proposal along with an action plan has already been sent by the president of the "Société de développement des entreprises culturelles" (SODEC), François Macerola, to Minister St-Pierre, who directs the eXcentris file.
Several days ago, he had sent her a final report.
However, the counter-proposal of the cabinet was sent to the SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallèle and Angus now have time to respond to it by 31 December.
In any case, the premise of the state donation really seems to have been pushed aside.
Let us remember that the Quebec owners' community of cinemas and cinema complexes had leaned against a direct state investment to support the acquisition of eXcentris by presenting the argument that the Minister of Culture had no financial support for real estate projects there , which he had not also given to other cinemas.
However, several other market participants in the segment, in contrast, complained of substantial, economic assistance.
After the self-financed construction of the cinema for more than ten years, cinematographer Daniel Langlois had presented the author's cinema in the rooms of his cinema complex, which could justify the exception from the state fund.
The lack of cinemas showing independent films is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew how to keep his clients at the bar.
The Société Angus and the company Parallèle, with Christian Yaccarini at the top, are in charge of a privately funded campaign, of which they hope for a sum of $700 000 to boost the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one canvas has continued to show films in eXcentris, namely Le Parallèle.
The goal of the future acquirers is to reopen the three cinemas on 27 February next year with the demonstration of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des dieux".
Christian Yaccarini, however, has not called up the newspaper "Le Devoir" and one ignores what he and his group think of the down-corrected proposals they have made.
Secret of complex shaken Canada ventilated
The new American diplomats, spread by WikiLeaks, reveal the mystery of what the United Nations considers to be the inferiority of the Canadians to the Americans, but with the same blow they reveal the feeling of superiority over Canada.
As a result, the American diplomats are amazed that the Canadian electorate does not have Canadian-American relations in mind, and they believe that President Obama's visit would have helped the conservative government to implement its 2009 budget!
The four new messages between the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were publicly distributed yesterday, offer even more spicy details than the mere substantial content one has to mess with.
A connection dated 22 September 2008, i.e. in the period during which the federal election camp was in full swing, reports on the point from which the United Nations no longer participates in the operations discussed by its political leaders.
To the great amazement of David Wilkins, the American ambassador in Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins offers various explanations of this situation.
"The Canadian political leaders may be much more likely to talk about internal issues of everyday life than to push the United States to the black Peter in this election (as in 1988 in the free trade campaign), he describes.
The United Nations, it concludes, is thus "the proverbial Goliath of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to speak of it".
The ambassador understands this "hear-sucking silence" all the less, as the two countries have intense political and economic relations.
"Logically," he evaluates, "it should be the ability of a candidate, a party, and much more of a party leader to lead such an essential relationship which the elector has as a key factor in the process of urning."
The other expression of this sense of importance reads in the notice sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, Managing Directors in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your journey will help to ensure the continued existence of the government in the vote of confidence over the federal budget at the beginning of February, in which Canada will announce its first deficit after more than a decade, which has arisen due to a recovery programme of between 30 and 40 billion dollars," says Breese.
Nowhere had he mentioned that the government had had to postpone the parliamentary session before Christmas in order to prevent Parliament from falling off the coalition and the so-called continuation of the opposition parties would have an impact on the quality of the proposed recovery programme.
Another communication, dated and written by Ambassador Wilkins in January 2008, provides Washington with the increasingly negative picture that the CBC's dramatic series are spreading from the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about broadcasts such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which you can observe little subtle allusions to Maher Arar, the "no-fly list" or even distractions for the purpose of hearings carried out by CIA muscle prots.
Another communication goes on to explain how Hillary Clinten asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner at her first bilateral meeting to see if Europe was willing to take up certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner should have answered the question with yes, but on the basis of an individual case-by-case decision.
At the end of the meeting, he said, "he handed out a paper to the Secretary of State in terms of Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary of State has promised to re-examine the file."
Finally, let's note that the minds of WikiLeak's website heat up.
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper very close advisor, had explained about CBC that the responsible for this massive leak should be "killed".
He was here referring to Mike Huckabee from the United States.
Worldwide Illumination Renewal Plan
Yesterday in Cancun, the UN proposed a plan to renew the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries in order to achieve a reduction in greenhouse gas (FCC) which corresponds to almost one third of the additional reduction that needs to be achieved in order to stabilise the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its position in the steps of the concrete major projects that the UN hopes to implement in Cancun in order to compensate for the absence of mandatory reduction commitments from the industrialized countries.
According to the plan put forward yesterday, the main problem would be avoided in the form of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of the FCFCs delivered to the earth due to the lighting, if the white glowing pears, which still represent a monopoly of 50 to 70% on the market, would be replaced by fluorescent or better, by light diodes (LED).
The lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This corresponds to an equivalent of 70% of the exhaust gases of the global fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, the major emissions emitters such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed themselves to voluntary reduction plans that should reduce global emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, 5 Gt should be deducted from this balance sheet in order to stabilise the increase in climate by 2 degrees Celsius from today to 2020 in order to prevent it from becoming out of control.
In the white glowing pears, 95% of the energy escapes in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce the light.
With the compact light bulbs the energy consumption is reduced by 75%, with the new LED light bulbs this energy requirement is reduced by two times.
The compact light bulbs hold on average between 6,000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED light bulbs, such as those that the manufacturer Philips has launched this week - this company has participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a white glowing pear, which gives an indication of the savings potential of the exchange plan to be applied in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that these completely new light bulbs provide very little heat, they can also work with a rule resistance.
And they contain no mercury.
Several specialists have pointed out that compact light bulbs have reserves, because they contain mercury and therefore have to be disposed of as special waste, which is not always possible in the developing countries, except for producers, provide an acceptance site.
However, according to the report, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the compact light bulb, but rather the coal-fired power plants that emit much more mercury to produce the electricity wasted by the white-ambered pears.
In the United States alone, these coal-fired plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury annually.
The report sets out in detail the profits that each country would generate through this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save a billion dollars annually in the purchase of electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, which means an equivalent of 3.5 coal-fired power plants, which would cost Indonesia 2.5 billion.
Côte d'Ivoire expects the announcement of the results of the elections
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called for the "indescribable" publication of the results of the presidential election of the Ivory Coast immediately after its expiry.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need for the independent electoral commission to maintain its work and to announce the preliminary results without further delay," said a UN Chief Press Officer.
"It invites all the parties and institutions of the Ivory Coast to demonstrate their responsibilities and to include any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite the pressure exerted by certain foreign governments, the electoral commission had passed the deadline, which was set on Wednesday at midnight, three days after the Sunday election, without publishing the results.
About forty minutes before the end of the period, the President of the CEI had confirmed on television that the Commission would "continue working" to announce the results.
On Wednesday many calls from all over the world have become loud, but the CEI can finally call out the name of the winner of the second round of elections under Laurent Gbagbo and his opponents Alassane Ouattara.
The Gbagbo camp, however, expects to be cancelled by the Constitutional Council by the Ex-Rebel Camp of Forces nouvelles (FN) during the coup failed in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, head of the Côte d'Ivoire presidential campaign, had confirmed that the maneuvers practised by the FN to intimidate voters in the north of the country had deterred the president's supporters from going to election.
The whole election could be cancelled if the actions brought by Gbagbo were taken by the Constitutional Council.
However, Gbagbo's competitors now believe that the highest court of the country is not neutral, since it is guided by Paul Yao N'Dré, a politically closely linked to Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, man of the north, who disputes any connection to the ex rebels, has considered the delay in proclaiming the results of the elections to be "unacceptable" and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, even if he has not gone so far as to claim the victory.
His Alliance Party confirmed that Gbagbo would block the publication of the results, knowing that he had lost; and file a complaint before the Constitutional Court after the election commission had been prevented from publishing the results was illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections on Sunday was held for the crowning of the unification and reconciliation process of a country that had been divided into two parts for years.
On Wednesday, the United Nations warned the Ivory Coast politicians that it could be held responsible for these in the event of any outrages.
Laurent Gbagbo had brought the first round of elections on 31 October with 38% of the votes against the 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who enjoyed the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round) as a top candidate.
Unemployment rate in France remained stable in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France, as defined by the International Labour Office (IAA), is stable 9.3% in the metropolis (including the overseas departments at 9.7%), shows the provisional seasonally adjusted data published on Thursday by the Federal Statistical Office of the Insee.
The unemployment rate in the metropolis is 2.631 million.
The data for the second quarter were 9.3% of the working population in the metropolis and 9.7%, involving the Departments of the overseas Sea.
Over the year, the unemployment rate rose by 0.1 percentage points.
In the third quarter, 3.4 million persons in employment in the French metropolis were not employed, but wished to find a job, including whether they were operational every two weeks or not or whether they were seeking work or not.
The situation of young people on the labour market has continued to deteriorate with an increase in the unemployment rate of 24.2% in the metropolis (+ 0.9 percentage points within three months, +0.5 percentage points over the year) and 25% with the involvement of the overseas regions.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed according to the IAA.
Seniors have seen a slight increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropolis (+0.2 percentage points over three months and over the year), i.e. 482,000 of over 50 years of age, 6.6% involving the overseas departments.
Only the 25-49 year olds could have benefited from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 percentage point over three months, +0.1 percentage points over one year) and 8.8% in France as a whole.
After a discussion of its calculation procedures, the Insee Statistical Office has not published the monthly unemployment figures since 2006.
Eurostat, the Statistical Office of the European Union, on the other hand, continues in this method and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% in France for October (including the overseas departments) compared with 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini charged and arrested
Against Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a disposal company and brother of the President of the General Council of the Bouches-du-Rhône region (PS), an investigation procedure was initiated and, in the course of an investigation procedure, he was sent to the Luynes prison in Aix-en-Provence, on public and suspicious markets.
Alexandre Guérini was accused of neglecting social property, misappropriation of general goods, holocaust, co-indebtedness in corruption, illicit bribery and possession of weapons, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is ready to fight and is prepared to express himself on all the questions that the prosecutor will ask him instead of spreading his brains."
"It's easy to put a number of criminal charges on him, another thing is to prove them," his lawyer Florence Rault of the AFP (Agence France Press) explained before consulting his client.
Mr. Guérini, brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first man of the PS (Parti Socialiste) in the department, had taken note of his justification for the judge before his hearing by means of his lawyers.
A member of Guérinis, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and detained on Wednesday evening.
According to lawyer Lucien Simon, her client had never done anything else than keep his deposit to lead.
With regard to the business field of competence or the destination of the associated funds, he would never have known, Simon said.
In this affair, Daniel Pinna, former Director General of the Aubagne Public Service, was also sued on Wednesday for neglect and complicity, but under the obligation to stay away from the protagonists of these acts under judicial supervision.
"My client was able to provide explanations on the facts that were accused of him."
"The lead prosecutor has taken into account not to rob him of his freedom, says his lawyer Yann Arnoux.
Four other persons had been charged and released from prison on Wednesday the night of Tuesday, including two of them under legal supervision, according to Deputy Chief State Advocate Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy manager of the waste management company Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is prosecuted for "unauthorised influence and passive bribery".
Two government officials from the Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier agglomeration room were also arrested, one under the title "Intervention and misappropriation of general goods by a public service officer", the other because of "co-operation in the misappropriation of public funds".
The companion of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was also accused of "healing and neglecting of social property".
Among the people who were confronted by Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently detained because of a similar affair of fraud in the public sphere that had affected Corsica.
The guards suspect his company to have contributed to washing money from "high" criminal circles.
The investigation against X for suspected fraud in the award of public contracts, particularly in the waste management sector, is conducted in April 2009 as a result of anonymous letters in the files of several open investigation procedures.
It should be noted that the investigation focuses in particular on the conditions of the award and the operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which also relates to waste from the Aubagne area as well as to certain cities in the Marseilles urban catchment area (MPM).
Affaire Clotilde Reiss: The Elysée Palace exaggerates its interlocutory function for Syria
Within more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher who was held in Iran for "Spionage", breathed the French public, put diplomacy in alert and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All of this under the attention of the diplomats of the United States.
The American documents received by WikiLeaks and searched by the newspaper "Le Monde" reveal some background to this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée had explained its strategy to the Americans, which went so far as to give these advice on dealing with their own crisis of "gestures" in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They point out how the French authorities have tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young French woman did not have the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian prisoner held in France and sought by the American Justice on the basis of trade in material in favour of the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they put the way in which the French Bureau has tried to manipulate the media for the purpose of making it credible the idea that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad had played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss, in a glaring light.
In truth, he had done nothing in this regard.
A diplomat telegram, edited in Paris on 12 August 2009, is entitled "Iran: French Commentaries on the Way to Deal With hostages".
François Richier, Elysée consultant on strategic issues, was accompanied by Patrice Paoli, director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East with American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explained the French method.
They advised the Americans to make every effort to bring back their own nationals who were held violently in Iran.
"Might noise," they said, "articulates loud and clear and without omission" the words "basic human rights", "innocentness", "so-called release" in the media.
This is necessary in order to embarrass the Iranian regime, which is very sensitive to its image.
"Do this all the more, especially as the Iranians ask you not to do so."
Because "silence solves nothing", past the discussion attempts about inconspicuous ways, the Iranians are "masters in elusive maneuvers".
Mr Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is a "common Iranian tactic": "Issue for political extortion".
He announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which was due on August 16th, on the day she fled to the French Embassy) "needs the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (230,000 euros deposit).
And he makes it known, the Elysée anticipates further hostages, a phenomenon that "will sharpen itself".
The Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of the approximately 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clothilde Reiss was released from prison 12 days ago, but is still being held in Iran.
An information was circulated: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition the United States is demanding because of illegal trade in sensitive electronic material to Iran, has been released from prison after a judge's decision in Paris.
The American Embassy, like many other observers, raises questions about this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which pursues the illegal Iranian networks of acquisition of the nuclear material, the release of Majid Khakavand represents a bad news.
Did France buy a cow trade ?
The liberation of Iran against the French woman?
On 4 September, on the occasion of another discussion with Kathleen Allegrone, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only "fully surprised by the judge's decision", but also tried to resist it.
"There has been a strong exchange between the French Bureau and the French Minister of Justice" (currently Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the judicial decision," he explains.
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand continues to be under "severe" supervision of the French intelligence service.
The Elysée consultant picks up a telephone number, then informs the American diplomat, the Iranian "was currently involved in the buildings led by the Iranian Embassy in Paris".
During the custody of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée does not spare its efforts to believe by means of announcements and by media organized "flight attempts", the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays a "important" and "influenced middle role".
The Americans do not observe this activity without irony and notice that manipulation bears fruit, as several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009, conjures up "the media flash of the French authorities".
What is the basis for so much "thanks" to Mr. Assad is the message of Paris.
"Despite their declarations of praise, the French authorities secretly admit that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians actually did."
The document then deals with the reasons for the Elysée's failure to do so.
The intensive communication efforts "are aimed at confirming Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria", he analyses.
A policy launched in 2008 "by numerous critics in France and abroad as premature and undeserved".
"The Syrian role building up" Paris tries to "reduce Syria to see what acclaim can be achieved by playing a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to "sow discord between Syria and Iran".
The American Embassy knows this from a good source.
On August 11th, François Richier entrusted her with "of course we don't know if the Syrians have done anything."
"But we thanked them despite everything."
"This should at least cause confusion among the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy welcomes her to the Elysée.
In a communiqué he thanks the President of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the release of our countryman".
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government will adopt a law called "the Aschenbrödel", which prohibits young people from playing online games after midnight, by blocking them access, according to government officials.
A draft law to call on online game operators to prevent young people under 16 years of age from accessing these games after midnight is presented to Parliament in December, representing cultus and family ministers.
"Many children play these games all night long and then have difficulties learning in school and also in living a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said Jo Rin, Minister-General of Agence France Press, with this draft law.
The online games will then be available once again from 6 a.m.
The producer companies would have been able to prepare for the implementation of the law for one year, as he specified.
The government is also considering asking manufacturers to cut down the daily time limit for access to these games for those young people whose parents ask for it, the controller added.
He will also provide free programs to those who wish to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries, and newspapers regularly report various events associated with intensive Internet use.
The country is also undisputed champion in online gaming competitions worldwide.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals against 58 other nations in the World Cyber Games.
World Championship 2018-2022: FIFA appoints the host country
On Thursday, in a bright excitement due to the suspicion of corruption, the FIFA Executive Committee appoints the World Championships 2018 and 2022, a highly political election in which the ranking for influence and lobbying threatens to push the technical criteria into the background.
However, one thing is certain: the 2018 edition of FIFA's kingly discipline will take place in Europe, its traditional stronghold (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, the Netherlands-Belgium).
The issue of 2022 will then be somewhat more exotic; the International Football Association hopes to be able to win new territories (Katar, Australia) for itself after the premiere on the African continent in 2010, or to continue to pursue its branch in the United States or in Fernost (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities belonging to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch Heads of Government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) shows the degree of economic and political commitment of a World Championship.
So the power behind the scenes is threatening to stop until the last minute.
Hard other than to set up a hierarchy of the candidates.
According to the FIFA Evaluation Report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) files offer better arguments than those of their competitors.
But these considerations will not be so important for the 22 members of the executive committee at the time of election.
The Sunday Times, which was at the beginning of the revelations with the suspension of two members of the Exekutifcommitee (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could equally have ruined the chances for their own country, the cradle of football, which was only once the world championship, namely 1966.
On Monday, the BBC had given the floor again by sending out a documentary report, which shot three influential members of the Committee, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Reason enough to annoy FIFA and embarrass the English responsible, who had conducted an intensive lobbying with David Cameron in the last few weeks.
The head of government hopes for a new edition of the chess move that his predecessor Tony Blair had achieved in 2005 for London to organise the 2012 Olympic Games.
Would this intense commitment be sufficient to restore the image of England before the committee?
Nothing is less safe, because the duo Spain Portugal is not lacking in any of its already finished stadiums, its expertise (WM 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, EM 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the economic and financial sides of the two countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English as well as the doubts about the solitude of Spain and Portugal increase Russia's chances of becoming a weighty outsider despite its shortcomings in the dossier (Stadia, Hotels, Transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided to urge "an unfair competition in the preparation of the vote" by the members of the Committee of the European Parliament to make a clear statement on the views of the English press.
"You throw them with dirt, you try to compromise them," Putin weathered.
For 2022, the United States, strengthened by the experience of 1994, seems to be the logical favorites.
First economic world power, headquarters of FIFA's main sponsors, the country seems to have a long list of advantages to Japan and South Korea, which have separately created a very beautiful project.
But these new candidates seem premature for two countries that had co-organized the competitions in 2002.
Another threat: the approval of the 2026 World Cup for China, which the Asian chances will drop to 2022, was hotly anticipated by FIFA.
With Australia and Qatar, which had drawn all the registers with the expectation of futuristic stadiums, FIFA is pursuing its expansion towards new areas, but these two countries are more at risk than certainty.
Australia, as well as Japan and South Korea, may suffer from the weakness of television rights, which has been accepted by European countries (due to the shift in time), the sensitive nerve of FIFA.
Second mandate: openness
The Gaulle had really backed up.
Midrand had made him believe that he was stunning.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than this.
A mandate in the Elysée calls for the next one.
The current head of state will be ergo candidate in 2012.
But the openness is not good at the side of the mystery attached to the presidential function.
So you have to pretend to be in doubt.
On the one hand, as well as on the other.
In 2006, the followers of Jacques Chiracs stated that a third mandate was not excluded without believing in it.
On November 15, Nicolas Sarkozy assured in serious tone to make his decision "at some point in the autumn of 2011".
The fact that on Tuesday evening in the Elysée in front of the UMP Parliamentarians that he would let the perspective of "two mandates" sound had thus spread a little feverishness.
Was that the official announcement of his candidate?
Far from it.
The President merely recalled that the 2008 Constitutional Change limited the number of five-year term periods to just two.
He made a statement, no announcement.
It is not the first time that he mentions the presidential election on the occasion of such meetings in a humorous tone.
"You have seven and a half years with me, or at best," he told them in July 2009.
To a new in May 2010: "Don't believe I don't think about the next phase."
His words of yesterday make him no longer a candidate than the day before; nor less.
Should they make comments, then for a double reason.
The acceleration of the race for the candidate with the PS on one side.
However, it is not the start of the competition with Ségolène Royal, which Nicolas Sarkozy is trying to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidate in 2012, which urge many members of the PS more early than accepted to fight.
The bad surveys on the other side.
For the first time, the voters of the right would prefer a candidate of François Fillon of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to the BVA-L'Express survey).
"We have a candidate, and there are no discussions about it with the UMP," responded immediately and carefully to the Prime Minister's environment.
"If he were a defeat as possible, he wouldn't be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe in being able to win," says Alain Juppé, who found himself with the openness.
Euro: The ECB is forced to maintain its purchases of government papers
The last meeting of the ECB's Central Bank Council last year should provide an opportunity to identify ways of coming out of the crisis, or at least to announce the arrangement of a large number of unconventional monetary policy measures to be concluded at the end of the year.
The crisis of European sovereign debt requires that the Central Bank in Frankfurt can certainly not afford to make use of today's, more than tense, situation on the European bond markets in order not to cause their deterioration.
The political costs would be far too high.
Yesterday, at a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde welcomed the active role taken by the ECB in solving Europe's public debt.
It has not dared to say whether it considers that the Central Bank could do more, for example by boosting its programme of purchases of government bonds.
"I reserve my considerations for my European trading partners..."
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, on the occasion of his hearing in Brussels by the Economic and Monetary Committee of the European Parliament, had not shown himself very well in relation to his projects, but rather had been satisfied to point out that the programme of purchases of government papers on the secondary market would "continue" and that at the meeting on Thursday we would "see how the decisions are taking".
Only certainty: The ECB will leave its central interest rate unchanged at 1%, the historically lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the bond purchases of the Treasury were doubled by the ECB last week to about EUR 1.35 billion.
And according to the indiscretions of some traders, yesterday it is said to have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese government papers.
Overall, the Eurosystem’s central banks have made purchases of 67 billion euros since May 2010.
There is no doubt among the dealers that the anticipation of a follow-up to the purchase price is not questionable (see page 29).
The economists do not expect any more remarkable changes in their course.
If the borrowing operations of more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the latter will still be able to make the full reserves of money in a generous manner over a period of one week up to three months.
The people's administrators are already insisting that this measure will be extended for a few months.
"I cannot imagine that the ECB will substantially amend its programme."
"Otherwise, she would take the risk of provoking new tensions in the short term," says Michael Schubert, Volkswirt of Commerzbank.
"A progressive exit for the course of the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely to me," anticipates Norbert Brams, Volkswirt at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In the area of its intervention in the debt market, "the ECB should maintain such a volume of purchases of bonds that revive the yielding market," adds Norbert Brams.
Given the relevance of the exposed position of European banks in the markets of sovereign debt in the euro area, the central bank has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It must, at all costs, replace the lack of investors on the market and act in such a way as to prevent the rapid enthusiasm over the returns paid to the weakest countries," testified an important bond holder yesterday.
For if the interest rates set at the altitude of the flight, the States would be even more prevented from reducing or even stabilizing their debt.
This is the price to protect the euro.
The Berlusconi Government is covering in Italy
After an alarming beginning of the week for Italy, yesterday the situation has relaxed a little with the decline in corner interest rates to 10 years.
A return to the deceitful silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister of Economic Affairs, regional chairman Giulio Tremonti had qualified the situation as "undecidable" and had heard him expect an "unpredictable" weekend, which the person immediately demented.
In any case, on Tuesday, with the German interest rates, the sheer would have reached its record of 210 basis points, and the prices of the contracts to cover the risk of bankruptcy had increased to 263 points, which caused a certain headlessness in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi had pointed out to his Council of Ministers that Spain's discrepancy at German interest rates was 400 basis points.
However, his right hand, Gianni Letta, had expressed itself as "heavy worried" about the "market turbulence" and a possible risk of infection from the direction of Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the eurozone, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, Volkswirt at the Hudson Institute.
In the clear text, that is to say, his problem is the absence of economic growth and the resulting, dizzy tax receipts that put the state at risk of being unable to meet its financing needs.
The latest Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
In the future, Italian growth of 1.1% is expected in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... although the budget budget at the Senate for Examination is expected to be 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the EU Commission calculates, the budget deficit will still account for 4.3% of GDP next year (in contrast to the 3.8% predicted by governments) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Therefore, the uproar for a new household collective, which could be used after the holidays to a sum of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, new savings measures must be taken," says economist Olli Rehn.
At the hour, Italy receives the support of international institutions.
"The foundations of Italy's economy are in order and its accounts are regulated, which we have been repeating for a long time," assures Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustees of the International Monetary Fund, who is entrusted with Italy at the IMF.
"At the moment, there are no problems, neither in the short term nor in the long term, as Italy, despite its high indebtedness (119.2% of GDP in 2011, A.d.R.), demands lower stabilisation progress than from other countries," observes Pier Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD Chief Volkswirt.
The question of political unrest remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a distrust request from the Chamber of Deputies, as a result of which the previous elections could be organised at the end of March.
It is therefore a little favourable period for a decision to be taken in relation to a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about expanding anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde pointed it out at a press conference in Paris yesterday: "I think it was proved on Sunday afternoon as well as in the evening: Europeans keep together clearly, are ready and committed to defend their currency and their currency area".
Although completely relative - the deduction made yesterday at the interest rates of the European government bonds was water on the mills of governments and the ECB.
However, the beginning of normalization cannot yet be mentioned.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's had announced that it could reduce Portugal's debt note, which is probably the most effective target of the speculators nowadays.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political perceptibility, which is particularly dependent on the banking systems," says Exane BNP Paribas's economists.
Above all, especially since "political time is much slower than that of markets".
The European countries, which are well aware of both this gap and the danger it poses, are intensifying the discussions to strengthen the anti-crisis measures already in place.
Informal deliberations between the most directly concerned finance ministers and in the wider sense with their counterparts of the G20 are going well.
And this also with regard to Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
The plan includes the loss of unconventional measures to strengthen the back of the eurozone countries on the crossroads of the markets (see below).
As far as the EU Stability Funds are concerned, their Executive Director Klaus Regling started his Asia Tour on Tuesday in Singapore to inform investors in Farnost about developments in the crisis in Europe.
If the goal of his visit is not explicit fundraising, he certainly prepares the terrain for this.
The first advertising expenditure on the EU Stability Fund is scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an official American representative of the Reuters agency had entrusted the United States with a possible increase in the fund mobilised by the additional direct commitment of the IMF.
Portugal and Spain, the countries in the first series, are in the process of adopting structural reforms, particularly in the field of labour market organisation.
Reforms which are intended to add to the savings measures, but which are expected to show effects in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid are taking a different path from that of Greece and Ireland.
Both the one and the other are at all costs to avoid asking for international assistance before setting up their own budget corrections and deciding on essential structural reforms that will bring them back to their confidence in the long term.
European investors, in turn, are talking about the options available to accelerate the normalisation process of government bond markets.
Axel Weber, who was on his way through Paris on 24 November, had the first idea that if the 750 billions of euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to get back into its own pocket.
Barclays Capital’s economists, with regard to the market of European sovereign debt in the very foreground, judge that an extension of around 100 billion euros would be sufficient, “preferably” in the form of a direct liquidity injection.
This funding exists: the European mechanism of taught financial stabilisation, currently EUR 60 billion.
An advisory board that has every chance of being carefully examined in European capitals.
Above all, if market conditions are rising.
Snow and Smoothness: 24 departments in Orange Alarm Level
The snow epidemics continue to cause traffic difficulties, particularly in Brittany's secondary transport networks, and threaten to affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in alarm level Orange due to the threatening risk of snow and gluten.
The regions of Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have been added to the 20 departments already in emergency stage Orange; 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, then later at night.
According to Météo France, the intense snowshowers tang the north of the Gironde as well as the Charentes, it snows easily on the et Ile-de-France.
Snow blankets from 2 to 5 cm are expected in the affected departments, ranging from 7 to 10 cm, as well as 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the region of Paris.
The regions concerned are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The snowfalls are considerable enough to create traffic barriers and to affect certain economic activities, says Météo France.
In the region of Côtes d'Armor several regional roads are blocked for heavy traffic of over 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac transport axes.
The traffic situation of the secondary transport networks in Brittany is very difficult, according to the transport police who do not recommend using their own vehicle only in the event of an emergency, and the use of some TER buses has been removed throughout the day.
In the Picardy the school traffic was lifted for Thursday.
No specific restrictive measures were foreseen for heavy transport on Wednesday evening.
The prefecture "instructs the drivers to the highest degree of caution on the roads and to adjust their driving behaviour accordingly."
On Thursday, the Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) called on the airlines to delete 25% of their Paris airport Roissy and 10% of the flights starting from Orly due to the expected strong snowfalls.
The DGAB recommends that passengers contact their airline.
Gatwick Airports in the south of London and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Métro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate on the modernisation of the transport industry on the Ile-de-France is in full swing, it rains billions.
At least in the discussions.
In particular, the 23 billion for the Grand Paris Metro are to be remembered, which is to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
In order to initiate the construction of the SGP, the State has launched a capital donation of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum that the SGP would then allow to grant on the markets a part of the financial sum to its double.
Today, we have finally come to the top of the scale.
The 2010 supplementary budget, this morning by the National Assembly's Financial Commission, includes the measures envisaged to raise the first part of these funds.
These are two measures: the creation of a special tax for closure and higher taxation of offices in Ile-de-France.
The former, according to Article 15 of the draft law, goes "with the exception of the public-law institution Société du Grand Paris".
This is estimated at: "The product of this tax amounts to 117 million euros per year".
The second is a reorganisation of the existing corporate tax system: "to modernise it in order to increase the product resulting from it and to overreact this increase of the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that bring?
A mystery.
This sum is not counted in the text.
Of the 4 billion you're far away.
"It is said that the tax resources are added to the EUR 4 billion of the capital donation, which is imposed by the state and the Société du Grand Paris is gradually being done for the project," the explanatory statement states.
With the SGP, this system is not at all offensive.
"Since the moment you book revenue (the two taxes, i.e. R.), you can cover the projection over three years and then only draw from the 4 billion," it is explained.
"This is recorded in the budget and gradually subtracted."
The SGP suggests that 2013 will start to record the 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, the 4 promised billions of which can still be sought for a long time, is in danger of creating a rather moving, parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
Vengeful hackers and eerie spies
The Affaire WikiLeaks has a double meaning.
On one hand it has turned out to be an obvious scandal, a scandal that is merely a scandal in the sense of hypocrisy that governs relations between the states, the citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at international level and gives a foretaste to the future dominated by regression.
But let's go in a row.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that any file created by a secret service (an x-any nation) is composed exclusively of newspaper sections.
The "extraordinary", American revelations about the sexual habits of Berlusconi throw nothing more than what one has read for months anyway in every x-voluntary journal (except those whose owner is Berlusconi), and the frighteningly caricatured profile Gaddafis has been offering cabaret artists fabric for a long time for their sketch.
The rule that the secret dossiers may only consist of already known news is essential for the dynamics of the intelligence services, and not only this century.
When you go to a library dedicated to esotherical publications, you will realize that every work (about the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templer or the Rosenkreuzler) repeats exactly what has already been written in previous works.
This is not only because the author does not want to publish occult texts (but that he did not know where to find news about the non-existent), but because those who devote themselves to occultism believe in nothing but what they already know and confirm what they have already learned.
This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown.
The secret files, too.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited mind) is also the head of the intelligence service (otherwise he could be whatever, for example editor at Libération), who only sees as true what he acknowledges.
The top secret information about Berlusconi, which the American Embassy in Rome had sent to the State Department, was the same as the one that Newsweek had already published the week before.
So why was such a lifting made around the revelations of these dossiers?
On one hand, they say what each person who is educated already knows, namely that the messages - at least since the end of World War II and since then also the Heads of Government can call each other or take an airplane to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of some small representation tasks, have turned into espionage centers.
Every viewer of investigation films knows this very well, and it does not happen out of hypocrisy that one does so to ignore this.
Nevertheless, the fact of publicly repeating it violates the task of hypocrisy and serves to put American diplomacy in a bad light.
Second, the idea that an x-voluntary hacker can grasp the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world is the considerable blow against the prestige of the State Department.
In addition, the scandal brings less victims than the "shrinks" into distress.
But let us devote ourselves to the profound nature of what has happened.
Once, at Orwell's time, one could bundle all power like a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy could have proved to be perfectly correct since then, where every movement can be controlled thanks to the phone, any transaction done, the visited hotel, the chosen highway and so on; the citizen would become the total victim of the eye of power.
But if you look at what is happening today, that even the secret crypts of power can no longer escape the control of a hacker, the control process ceases to be one-sided and becomes circular.
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - chosen as the revenge of the citizen - can experience the secrets of power.
But how can a power no longer be able to keep its own secrets?
It is true, Georg Simmel has already said that a real mystery is an empty mystery (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge of the character Berlusconis or Merkel is basically a secret from mystery, as it reveals the public sphere; but in the style of WikiLeaks reveal that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets, means to rob them of any power.
WikiLeaks did neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wrong, but Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this disease that has been added to such powerful power?
It is obvious that in the future the States will no longer place any reserved information online - that would be equivalent to a slope attached to the street corner.
But it is just as obvious that with the latest technologies it is appropriate to hope to keep confidential reports on phone secret.
Nothing is easier than to find out if and when a head of state has moved on a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How could private and only certain relationships be maintained in the future?
I know that at the moment my prediction sounds like science fiction and romantic, but I see it necessary to introduce myself to the government agents, secretly moving on uncontrollable march routes, wearing their messages nowhere else than in mere memory, and in addition, hiding the few written information they have received in the shoe heel.
The information would be stored in a single copy in closed drawers: basically, the espionage attempt at Watergate had less success than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is moving forward like a cancer these days, that is, backward.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communication, the Internet reconstructs a telegraph with (phone) wire.
The (analogous) videocassettes had enabled the film researchers to explore a film volume for tape by being able to play from the back to the front and vent all the secrets of assembly, while the (numerical) CDs nowadays allow nothing but to jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. in macro portions.
The high-speed trains run from Rome to Milan within three hours, while this requires three and a half hours by plane including the changeover.
It is therefore not unusual that politics and communication technology come back on car and horse.
One last observation.
In earlier times, the press tried to understand what was forge secrets between the messages.
At present, it is the messages that demand confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France is speaking about its financial promises
One year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to examine compliance with the fast-term financing promises (also referred to as "Fast Start" or early financing) implemented by the developing countries.
And the gross French ladyships have already been exposed.
With the Copenhagen Treaty, developing countries have committed themselves to providing 30 billion dollars between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has promised EUR 7.2 billion over three years, France EUR 1.26 billion (i.e. 420 million per year).
On the occasion of the opening of COP16, the EU has drawn all the registers to convince its partners of the fact that it is committed to the fast-start financing: detailed response report from its Member States, press conference, major by-events, brochure distribution.
The operation transparency is remarkable and graded for its true value: the developing countries and civil society would like to see it if all developed countries did the same at the same level of precision.
In 2010, the EU announced that it had released EUR 2.2 billion, bringing it on the right path to respect for its commitment of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look into the detail, things are a little more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Treaty, this money should be "new and additional" in order to ensure that an additional commitment has been made without being at the disadvantage of public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the EU Commission had proposed harmonisation, certain member states, including France, blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the benchmark that he considers best.
For example, the EU Commission has chosen as a benchmark for those in 2009: international financing will be maintained and will provide 150 million for over three years of funding "Fast Start".
Other countries have chosen similar targets, either in terms of year or terms at the level of public development aid.
In return, France considered that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 was "new and additional".
In other words, there are no indicative values for expenditure in the previous year or at the global level of public development aid.
In concrete terms, the total amount of French support for developing countries can remain stable (or decrease) - France states that it will comply with its commitment to "new and additional" financing.
Another crucial element is the breakdown of donations and loans.
There is no rule on this, and everyone chooses their calculation mode.
Some, such as France, are 1 € borrowed as equivalent with 1 € donated.
Obviously, this is difficult to understand: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often linked to the emission reduction projects based on the most effective technology) can be justified, it is deceptive to present the euro, which is taken up as equivalent for a donated euro... Moreover, only the cost of the loan to the investor country should be counted as a commitment (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has nothing else in mind than the following: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by making 91.5% loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% donate) 36.1 million euros (see also the EU document to convince itself of it.
France is the only EU country using loans to a large extent.
Germany demands 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands and Slovakia (including Slovakia) pay 100% of their commitments.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union spends 1€ to meet its commitments, France is giving just 10 cents and understands a similar commitment.
Nice hocus pocus!
All in all, France operates in its fast-start financing with a double dizziness: partly with a further development of the action over time and partly with the reality of financial use.
France succeeds in allowing it to believe that 420 million "new and additional" millions have spent in line with its promises, saving 36.1 million euros.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (as it seems likely that it was Bercy who carried out the arbitration) could have a double negative effect; once EU-internal (why are the other member states continuing to lend if it is enough?) and then in the negotiations, as the developing countries are not completely deceived...
The early financing chapter only raises a small question over a relatively short period of time compared to the overall discussion on the climate.
But it could be the drop too much in the immense machinery of the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
In any case, it is essential to learn his lesson from this first year of early financing.
First of all, France could announce a change in its method of booking for the years 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of respect for its obligations and the balancing of justice with the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France could bring forward the discussions on the subject of long-term financing (a different, crucial and currently discussed topic): it is not possible to escape the question of "reliability" or the nature of its loans.
France could change its position in order to be just as progressive as it is in other matters.
So the hope is based on the new Minister for the Environment Kosciusko-Morizet, which will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprising announcement about the almost start of France and its vision of "preciseability" and the use of loans would naturally increase the international basis of trust, which is necessary for further discussions.
Alert - pesticides taken by children
A child of 10 years takes over the day 81 different chemicals, according to a study published this Wednesday by the Association Générations Futures (former movement for the protection of rights and respect for future generations).
The association, which explains that its results "in view of the low number of samples analysed do not represent statistically significant value, but rather illustrate the character of the treated problem", had bought the usually within four food consumed by a approximately ten-year-old child to meals, plus a snack in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris between July and September.
These typical meals - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit parts, three milk products and 1.5 litres of water per day - have been studied as well as wetting laboratories in search of chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The plate balance is diminutive: 81 chemical substances, including 42 potentially or probably carcinogenic, and five classified as safe carcinogens, as well as 37 substances with endocrine disruptors, according to studies by several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Even if the legal limits for each chemical, individual-induced substance are not exceeded in the approximate whole of the cases, this survey is very well taken from the fact that the reality in which the consumer may be exposed to cancer-inducing substances or substances with endocrinin-disorder factors is worrying," the association notes.
Even at breakfast alone, butter and tea with milk already contain more than ten of the potentially carcinogenic residues and three of them certainly prove to be carcinogens, as well as more than twenty residues that can affect the hormone system.
The apple imported from Brazil, which is intended as an interim meal for the study, shows traces of six chemical substances, including a fungicide prohibited in France.
The same applies to the green beans from Kenya, including in lunch, where the study found traces of an insecticide which is strictly prohibited in the EU.
In addition, the hack steak, the tuna from the cans, even the baguette and the gum of pesticides and other chemical substances were sprinkled.
In the tap water, the analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
During dinner, the salmon steak with 34 determined chemical residues was the "most rich", and even the plastic plate used to warm up the meal in the microwave was not unladen.
The final risk of this "pollutant cocktail" for the consumer "is probably undervalued", says the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV) has in turn proposed "in view of the urgency of the situation" to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides in order to stop the "increasing civil disease".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) identified 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables, which are consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
