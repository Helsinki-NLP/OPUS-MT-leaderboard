A Republican strategy to counter Obama's re-election
The leaders of the Republicans justify their policy with the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter to be a myth, confirming that the US election fraud is rarer than the number of people killed by lightning.
By the way, in 10 years in the United States, Republican lawyers have recorded only 300 cases of electoral fraud.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on electoral participation.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the US democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the US states are responsible for the conduct of the elections in the individual states.
In this sense, since 2009, the majority of American governments have announced new laws that make it difficult for registration or urning.
After the November 2010 elections, this phenomenon has gained in importance, with 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states being registered.
As a result, 180 draft laws were introduced in 2011 alone, restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to present a photo identification and proof of US citizenship.
In addition, these laws also shorten the periods for early voting, declare the right invalid to register as voters on the electoral day, and decree citizens the right to vote for which a court act exists.
Before the 2006 elections, no U.S. State required voters to present a photo ID card.
Indiana was the first state to raise such a claim.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of the Act of Indiana.
The Republican authorities hastened to extend this practice to other countries.
Over the past two years, they have promoted laws in 34 states to force voters to present a photo ID card.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, US citizens do not have a universal card such as the health insurance card.
Indeed, 11% of US citizens, i.e. 21 million eligible persons do not have a photo identification issued by a government authority of their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such an ID card.
However, more than a hundred dollars are often to be paid to obtain the necessary ID card.
Of the new restrictions, young people, minorities and low-income people are disproportionately affected.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people with a income of less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over 65 years and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years do not have the necessary photo identification.
This is still enough.
Students who are considered voters, who are increasingly voting for democratic candidates, are not allowed to use their photo ID issued by their institution in several countries.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting associations who choose more strongly for the Republican side to use the tickets issued by these associations for elections.
Before 2004, no state for the election required proof of citizenship.
Arizona was the first state to introduce such a claim.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove their US citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting hispanic votes.
Because it is obvious that two of three Hispanic voters prefer the democratic party.
In addition, in 2011, Republican legislators promoted eight federal states to abolish the registration of voters on the electoral day.
In addition, you have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters who wish to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the campaign to register voters during the 2004 general elections contributed to the registration of approximately 10 million citizens.
Because the measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the share of registration of new voters in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.
In addition, the Republican legislators have passed laws in five other states aimed at shortening the period for early voting.
For example, in the 2008 general elections in Florida, 33% of the voters who voted in advance were African Americans, although they represent only 13% of the voters of the state.
The same applies to the Hispanic population.
The latter accounted for only 11% of the voters, but 24% of the citizens who voted in advance.
In contrast, the whites, which represented 76% of the voters, represented only 46% of the voters who were elected in advance.
Of course, the democratic legislators and their followers have strongly opposed the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
Several draft laws were blocked by the vetos of democratic governors.
The United States Advocate General has intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws requiring the presentation of a photo identification.
However, the new rules introduced in 2012 will undoubtedly make the exercise of the right to vote more difficult.
The democratic critics advocate the political nature of the passed laws and see in them as a clear goal the influence of the results in the countries issuing the 2012 issue.
A report by the Brennan Center of 2011 shows that those states that have passed these laws make up 171 of the 270 votes required in the electoral body to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these amendments to the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on electoral participation.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the US democratic system.
Prostatic cancer early detection: should the test be done or not?
In fact, the PPE test sometimes shows incorrect results, with false negative or false positive results, which lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to greater hesitation of the men already undecided for conducting early detection tests.
Should the test be done or not?
We've got the opinion of two specialists.
The studies carried out in the USA have had numerous interference factors between the control groups, making it difficult to interpret these data and to make clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, concluded that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without early detection.
This study has also shown that in 12 years of follow-up, the probability of metastasis formation is 30 to 40% higher if no early detection has been performed.
That is why I recommend the test from the age of 50 or 40 years, if you have a direct relative who has already been infected with prostate cancer.
There is also a higher risk for men of African-American origin.
The most important thing is to make the right decision as soon as a cancer has been detected.
There are cancers that are aggressive and others that are indolent.
The patient needs to understand the extent of the risk of his cancer by showing him the possible options in which prostate cancers can remain untreated if he does not affect the quality of life in the long term, and in these cases he chooses to actively monitor the disease.
Today, there is no treatment for many men who have recognized cancer, since their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to their lives.
They are proposed to be actively monitored and offered treatment if the disease progresses.
One determines with increasing accuracy the criteria for a decision who should be treated and who should not.
That is why I recommend that the test be carried out.
The most important thing, however, is to talk to his doctor to determine if he should be performed or not.
In cooperation with the international society of urology, Movember has developed an instrument with which it is possible to assess the advantages and disadvantages of the PSA test.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no cure for preventing cancer.
Despite progress in research, adopting a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering from it.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if all eat well and move sufficiently.
"If there were no more smokers, this value would increase to at least 50%," says André Beaulieu, spokesperson of the Canadian cancer society.
However, it is assumed that about 10% of cancers are caused by inheritance.
Several also remain completely unexplained.
For the Canadian cancer society, the fight against tobacco dependence remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of the cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several other cancers.
It strongly damages the health of people.
"Today there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," regrets the speaker André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after leaving the cigarette, the risk of dying cancer is reduced by half.
Weight
According to the Canadian cancer society, obesity and obesity also promote the outbreak of the disease.
They seem to increase the risk of breast, intestine, gastrointestinal, esophagus, pancreas and uterine cancer.
"The research shows that regular physical activity throughout the life protects against gastrointestinal cancer," he adds.
The Diet
The organisation also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too large a quantity, it increases the risk of developing an infestation cancer.
Wheat products should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting may lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage the body cells and lead to the development of cancer," he explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have investigated the relationship between vitamin additives and cancer.
However, their investigations are currently not coherent.
According to the Canadian cancer society, vitamin E studies are contradictory.
While one study found out the reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another was more likely to increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been clearly shown.
In addition, Mr Beaulieu stresses the importance of talking to his doctor about his concerns and his family predisposition.
"The conduct of an early detection test does not lead to cancer."
The Higgs Boson Analyzes
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson caused a certain sensation last summer, and this for good reason.
In fact, it is believed that this Boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
Finally, it is the last particle whose existence was predicted by the standard model - our best or "at least false" explanation of nature and the behavior of matter - but was not yet observed empirically.
But for the physicists it is not yet completely certain that it is really the Higgs.
We know without doubt that we have a real new particle, and that it is very similar to the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, this seems to be confirmed by new data presented this week at a large physics congress in Kyoto, but there is still a lack of data to be absolutely safe about it.
Nevertheless, let's assume that this is actually the Higgs, since there seems to be only a small risk of being deceived, and let's look at what it is all about.
There is a necessarily indispensable law in this world, which means that two objects cannot be present in the same place at the same time.
It is not possible to violate this rule - and don't try it too hard, as you are going to hurt yourself.
Because even if particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that such a law applies to it: the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time when they are in the same "quantity state", with this "state" largely consisting of some of their characteristics.
From this the physicists divide the particles into two categories.
In a corner are the good citizens, who are called Fermione, who are similar to the Pauli principle.
And in the other, the Bosons, an evil band of anarchists who are not holy - certainly not this principle, which means that they may indeed be in the same place at the same time.
These Bosons are divided into two groups according to the website The Particle Adventure from the Berkeley laboratories (which by the way is absolutely amazing): the Mesons we are not treated here and the "force particles" through which the great forces of nature spread and with which the Higgs Boson would be somehow related.
But it must be stressed here that these bosons are not all exotic creatures as one might think.
If you are able to read this chronicle, then only thanks to a bosoon of extraordinary banality: the photon or the "light particle", which is the "bod" of electromagnetic force.
If a particle accelerates with an electric charge or changes the direction, the electromagnetic field is "disturbed" at this place, like a pebble that was thrown into a pond.
This "disorder" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon and thus one of the bosons "carriers of power".
Stable Field
The same applies to the Higgs Boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, must be "disturbed" so that this Boson shows itself.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen has to achieve very high energies, a little comparable to a frozen pond whose surface could only be shattered by a very large rock.
Therefore, a huge particle accelerator such as the CERN is required - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a range of 27 km! - to achieve such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again helpful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, there are not all particles and not all the materials that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but others do not - for example, a sheet of paper would never keep itself on the refrigerator.
And likewise, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do have a mass, while the others (as well as the photon) do not have any mass.
For what can all these research now be "good," asks Mrs. Plamondon?
For science, they are used to review the standard model (SM), and they also enable physicists to investigate in detail all deviations between the observations and the predictions of the SM.
There are, by the way, numerous physicists who hope that such deviations will be found, as the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and stop some holes of the model.
One has to say that the latter still has great shortcomings, as it does not explain gravity (ups!) and dark matter, which forms about 80% of the matter of the universe (renewed ups!).
However, no such deviations have been found at CERN.
Effects
The impact of these research on the general population is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there is no such thing.
By the way: in the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in the Bell labs did not suspect that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the deceased physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, in which the laser was invented in the 1960s, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed) in 1962 - has already said that the laser was considered at the beginning rather as a "laboratory play".
Imagine...
In addition, applications can also come from all the instruments surrounding research.
For example, Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969 during his work in optics.
Although it was not the original purpose, today this sensor serves as an "eye" to all digital cameras worldwide and has presented him with the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily change our lives, but it means that you can never really know it...
Palliative care - the best way to die...
Quebec has recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life with its Committee on "Death in Dignity".
The debate must be resumed shortly, although a draft law is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this important subject area.
Le Devoir has tried to take a closer look at this.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that devoured him had left him a period of two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I made seven years," he said half-heartedly, lying in his bed in the house for palliative care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he had arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, you can't be prepared for it," he says.
The disease does its work: an immeasurable weakness prevents him from going to the toilet alone and even eating himself.
Sitting at the table in front of a delicious lunch, he wants to resign to help himself with food.
He even manages to smile and talk to the strangers who are busy around him, bring him his medications, and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is to heal my diarrhea, as this is humiliating," he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
"In the course of our life, we learn that a man is pinging in the standing," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist in the home of Victor-Gadbois.
Returning to childhood is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
"It depends on the ability of the person," he notes.
In the view of several people working in palliative care, major events take place in the midst of these steps.
The patients who are forced into the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois all suffer from cancer.
You have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, the doctors and nurses who take care of them no longer deal with so-called "healing" care.
For Mrs. A., 89 years, the worst fear is to die "consciously and by suffocation".
But because of the illness, I really met my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I have no more wishes in life," she says before she accepts that she is put on a mask that helps her breathe.
In the next few days, she still expects a last visit from her son, who comes from Italy.
In the home Victor-Gadbois is offered with a group of voluntary personal care and assistance in food intake.
The palliative care is then used if there are no other possibilities.
To make dying more pleasant.
In Quebec a bed for palliative care comes to 11,700 inhabitants.
That's very little if you take into account that one day we'll all die.
Here life will continue under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
Depending on the wish, the dying person is granted oral care with Brandy or Pepsi.
Diabetics no longer need to control their blood sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served Mr. X a beer that died during the night.
This morning his son will drink the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help family and patients alike," reports Care Director Nathalie Savard.
In the home Victor-Gadbois is not a day like the other.
In addition to an old man of 93 years who enjoys the last family meeting in the yard and is well supported by his pillows, while one is indulging in his honor, a young man of 36 years dies, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two little children, tragically after he has tried everything to survive.
"Since six months, three to five beds have always been occupied with cancer patients under the age of 45," Dr. Christiane Martel said alarmedly.
53% of patients admitted to the home Victor-Gadbois come from their home, 47% come from the hospital.
The problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians have no access to palliative care, i.e. to care that should relieve the suffering of patients when the latter have reached the end stage of their lives, both at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the home Victor-Gadbois and the home palliative care society in Montreal, are more or less specialized in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely this great inadequacy in Quebec's health care that makes sure that several doctors specialised in palliative care face the adoption of a law on the control of death and assisted suicide with concerns.
Since the month of October, a manifesto has been in circulation, signed by prominent figures of palliative care such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec's health system is not capable enough to ensure that all the right to high-quality palliative care is maintained before accepting death aid.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who was in the emergency room 14 days with great pain, without taking measures to relieve her.
I fear that patients will die only because they do not receive adequate health care.
And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients in spite of worst forecasts until the last day.
Hélène Richard's chances of survival were minimal when she discontinued a difficult chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was going to stop the treatment, she answered me that she was sorry I gave up the fight, she told me.
However, she told me I was at the end!
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who have asked to die thank the nursing staff for not allowing this desire after their pain has been eased by a team of palliative care.
However, it must be clearly stated that palliative care is not omnipotent in pain treatment.
According to Elsie Monereau, head of palliative care of the society of the home palliative care of the Greater Montreal area, 8% of patients do not respond to pain treatment.
At the end of life, the doctors often resort to the terminal sedation, which is aimed at sleeping either sporadically or permanently until the time of his death.
We can no longer do as if we do not perceive this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief will increasingly have the opportunity to access this terminal sedation.
Patients whose pain is not eased all say the same sentence, "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want you to put me to sleep", but "I want my pain to be eased."
The implementation of this report was possible due to a scholarship of Canadian health research institutes.
Real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials of the Road Construction Office, building industry companies, political parties and Italian Mafia specialists tell you every day what they know about a great "system" where construction, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso are involved.
An industry that was very expensive for Quebec's taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's strange how the system has been breaking down since we took drastic action," said Jacques Duchesneau, Quebec MP and former head of Montreal Police.
The scandal was revealed by him as a result of an in-depth investigation of the inconsistencies in connection with the contracts on road construction in Quebec, which the then Prime Minister had merely reluctantly agreed to.
The "Duchesneau Report" established a direct link between industry, secret financing of parties and bribery of officials.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he stressed that "the Ministry of Transport alone had saved a billion dollars in the contracts", because some of them had their instincts to get their share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought down two mayors", he adds, hoping that it will succeed in "showing the tactics behind the individuals".
A permanent anticorruption unit launched in 2011
The permanent anti-corruption unit launched in 2011 is also making great efforts with its troops of auditors, investigators and analysts of the government.
In addition, the police of the "Marteau-Truppe", which since 2009 has caused Montreal's "channelization cartel" to be more reticent in the artificial bloating of the contracts...
Over the last few weeks, she has conducted house searches and has raised charges for fraud and corruption against municipal officials such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, who is mayor of a suburb.
The next one would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his office as mayor of Laval, the third largest city in Quebec.
He is suspected of having repeatedly received lubricating fees in exchange for public contracts.
By the way, engineers from the Montreal Road Construction Office, as well as entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, were explicitly charged.
The latter has stimulated the Commission by explaining the functioning of the "system" for the receipt of public contracts.
For several years, he himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal to an intermediary associated with the Mafia who transferred the money to the Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
In the 2000s, Mr. Zambito had his hand in the game everywhere, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the liberals in power at the time.
He also agreed to have organized an illegal fund for former Liberal Vice-President Nathalie Normandeau.
Channeling contracts, the costs of which were artificially bloated by it
In Montreal the "system" of corruption worked smoothly.
The former construction engineer Gilles Surprenant described this in detail before the Commission: in ten years, he received gifts from the construction company, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and hockey games, as well as bribes worth 736,000 dollars in return for sewerization contracts, whose costs he artificially bloated.
Other officials of the Road Construction Office have admitted that they can be lubricationd by artificially blowing up the invoices with false additional benefits by 30-40%.
In addition, an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately overlooking a shadow budget that filled his cash with black money.
As a result of these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned at the beginning of November, which led Montreal into a serious crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first Montreal delegates to hit the alarm.
As mayor of the city district of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, she leaned against the sale of a municipal property that was purchased for 5 million dollars and resold for 1.6 million builders in the booming real estate market from 2010.
70% Black money in the election campaigns
From the investigation, which is finally carried out, she says that "it pulls on a thread that allows it to understand the functioning of the system underwent by ants in order to stop the evil and accuse the guilty".
She says that the procedure is "painful, but positive".
We are in the process of cleaning the wound, but we need only a unit of investigation for Montreal, as well as a supervision to prevent the return of questionable practices.
How to clean up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes, on the other hand, that "offers have stolen several hundred million dollars," but above all, they are concerned about the role of the "mandate carriers who are in the picture about tactics" if they were not involved in fraud!
Based on a share of 70% of black money in financing the election campaigns in Quebec, he jokes: "I was told that this was only a weak off-the-spot of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit the donations to parties to 100 dollars, which it believes would not change anything about the situation: "As long as election expenditure is not strictly limited, black money will be in circulation in politics."
He recommends a complete revision of the public procurement system and the financing of the parties: "We cannot fall deeper; by boldly going to the ground, we can rebuild the house on a more solid basis with more controls and laws."
If this story damages Quebec's international reputation and Montreal's, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh at taking a look at their own backyard...
"PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
This season you have adopted a new measure with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
One can explain it through a personal insight, but also through the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have come.
Every day I make progress on her side.
The technical staff also gave me a lot.
These elements encourage me to improve my level of play every day.
And in a game this is even easier.
It's all going very fast in football.
But I don't break out in enthusiasm.
Since my beginnings in the center of the preparatory training of the INF Clairefontaine until my season at Saint-Etienne, I have always made gradual progress.
They are thus making use of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The new additions of this summer are used to playing games with very high levels.
You also know that every training unit is decisive.
This leads to a player like me who has to offer foreheads and want to do his best.
By the way, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot about my game position.
He is supported by co-trainers like Claude Makele, who played in the same position as I did.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the task?
Of course.
Ancelotti brings respect to all technicians.
In the Ligue 1 there is currently no comparable person, and he is one of the best trainers in Europe.
He looks back on a rich experience and has won many titles with prestigious clubs.
He was in contact with big players.
I think he'll win more titles in Paris.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
At that time, I had just recovered from a series of injuries.
The trust he has placed in me is also an explanation of my achievements.
What do you think about the first part of the PSG season?
In the Ligue 1 Lyon took the place of the top rider.
But we're in ambush.
One of our most important goals is the Champions League: in this way we qualified for the eighth finale.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
We'll try to get as far as we can.
Everything is possible from now on.
However, we will have our words to speak against very good European teams.
First of all, we want to become the first of our group in front of Porto, so that we can play the replay of the eighth final as home.
Can the PSG become a large European association in the short term?
He's already got the budget for that...
In order to become a large European club, Paris has to win titles and make a name for itself in the long term.
This is not the case today.
The PSG is given the resources to take concrete forms of this project.
Would it be a great failure not to win the title in Ligue 1, as it was last season?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year we really love to sing this title.
In the last season, we were close.
In May we were disappointed because we were strong enough to bear the victory.
We finished the season with a very strong performance.
We have completed with 79 points.
Normally you should be master with 79 points...
But another team, the one from Montpellier, has achieved an even better season.
I think this year is the right one.
Even though the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux ring around the title, I think we have this stuff to win him.
Do you think the media expect too much from the PSG?
Given what has been invested and the players we have, it is normal that much is expected of us.
We accept it perfectly.
However, if we win at a home game against Troyes Ç, and you still find something that can be blamed on us, that is certainly a bit frustrating.
People wonder what people are still expecting.
We could never win with Ç every weekend.
We're not the FC Barcelona!
We're trying to draw up a game concept.
A team builds up with time.
We have proven strength in the Champions League.
Consider Manchester City, an association that has not been able for two seasons to qualify for the eighth finale, and which has also incurred huge expenses!
With regard to the invested sums, you were believed to have 15 points for the break!
That meant that our opponents and the French championship would be disregarded.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not good in the last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we will be the smiling winner and tell us that we have finally won it despite all the difficulties.
The PSG seems to be fully dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic's performance.
All the better, you're talking about a Zlatan dependency.
That means that Ibrahimovic is powerful and shoots many goals.
That's why he came and he proves he's the star of Ligue 1.
Everywhere he played, he's been thinking he's a great player and a world star.
Within the team we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects those who surround him.
What he did is really extraordinary.
This encourages the others to improve their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders worldwide, also allows everyone else to make progress.
How did you experience the 2012 EM with the French national team?
It's like a disappointment.
It was my heart to participate in this EM.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from beating out a little playtime.
I've seen things from which I've been strengthened.
Today I manage to make good games in the national team.
This has been my hope since my baptism with the "Bleus".
From what has happened in Ukraine, we have drawn our teaching, and today we must show a fine conduct.
What opinion do you have on the first months of Didier Deschamps at the head of the "Bleus"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualification group for the World Cup.
The National Trainer is strict, is close to the players and stimulates to win.
Like Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to compare.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the EM.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the "Bleus" to Brazil.
Does the discrepancy imposed in Spain on 16 October (1:1) represent a start-up?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone's been working for everyone else.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never experienced a similar game in my career.
With Bitcoin you can pay and sell without a bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchange based on central banks, identified transactions and handling fees between the parties.
Furthermore, as so often in these technologies, a political vision is tangible: the conviction that the current monetary system, designed by bank monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, the bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is both a virtual currency (but can be converted into dollars, euros, etc.) and a protocol for secure exchange such as BitTorrent, which allows the direct exchange of files.
Some 200,000 transactions have already been recorded with 15,000 computers on the network.
Some thousand web pages accept Bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment.
After reaching a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, the Bitcoin price fell to 2 dollars five months later before recovering today on about ten dollars (the courses are listed on the Bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing particularly impressive in comparison to world trade in real currencies or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown interest in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes Bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the greatest success", "in competition with the dollar or euro" and "like the conventional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as the "Credits" used to move forward in a video game that you can win or buy (and sometimes exchange back) games.
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, each time trade is controlled and processed by a central authority.
With Bitcoin, all network nodes are at the same time maintainers of the invoice book, auditors, money issuers as well as buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail.
With the difference that the user can choose a different address for each payment, which ensures anonymity.
A number of the related data is electronically signed by a double encryption system.
In this way, the network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
With the help of the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the Bitcoins traded are present in the public accounts' billing book distributed throughout the network.
The crucial step is to include this new transaction in this book.
This is done through a mathematical task that is started on the computers, with the winner, who is a kind of provisional central banker, having the privilege of adding this additional line.
This is a dispersal of the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file into a shorter and unique electronic fingerprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before the whole is "cracked".
The goal is to find the number that produces a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
If this number has been found, the other nodes can check effortlessly if it's the right one.
The transaction is therefore permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user wants to pay twice as fast (less than 10 minutes) with the same money to cheat, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other remains without link, since both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the task receives 50 bitcoins.
To prevent inflation, this reward is regularly halved, probably before the end of 2012.
The bitcoins in circulation are therefore limited to 21 million, but can be divided up to a hundred millionths, leaving a certain amount of room...
In addition, the difficulty of the task will be increased with any improvement in the computing power.
The life of the network has already had heights and depths.
The web pages that provide services for bitcoin were attacked and the bitcoin deposits were stolen.
"The vulnerability used does not concern the actual protocol," assures Pierre Noizat, who has just introduced paymium, which is a company for payment with real money and uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports on the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.
However, cash also shows these shortcomings.
Important actors such as Wikipedia refuse donations of this kind.
They are accepted by others like the WordPress blog platform.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the billing book and showed that almost 80% of bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November, a "mega lock sale" was launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a book on this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His system Paytunia corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses Bitcoin to validate the transactions that are cheaper.
In addition, the holder manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system can easily be implemented by dealers, and the latter do not need to install new terminals or computer programs.
You just need to specify an address that can be "photographed and recognized" by a phone, Pierre Noizat, who assures that he has thousands of users.
There is a general trend to consider hierarchical systems in favour of more horizontal systems.
"It will take some time for bitcoin to get through, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.
By the way, the ECB's report provides for the re-evaluation of the various risks considered to be high today in the event of a success of this currency.
We moved from Afghanistan.
And after that?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the USA are expected to follow at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take possession of its territory again, and for the Afghan people to decide their future without expecting anything from us.
In particular, we have punished the Afghan peasants by viewing them as terrorists.
And ourselves with our 88 killed soldiers, as well as the injured and the scorned.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often also of farmers who refuse an armed foreign presence, such as at the time of the Soviets.
They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even though Jihadists, Pakistani, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks have joined them.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by local insurgents, the latter will no longer be there if the Western countries become more discreet.
The withdrawal of the French troops from the base in Nijrab, which I observed from a hill planted with almond trees, which was financed by French loans, was done properly.
The truck and tank convoys flown by helicopters have reached Kabul without being attacked.
As of the end of 2014, there will be no more inflows from the Taliban in Kabul.
Since its irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996, the conditions have changed.
At that time Kabul was empty and the country was covered by war due to the struggles of the various insurgent groups.
At the time, their takeover of power was considered a kind of liberation and return to security.
The Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of the farmers overwhelmed by the Al-Qaida organization, but their situation has not improved to this day.
Former Mudahedin, Afghan government and current Taliban have a common desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The most important personalities of the anti-Soviet war came back to power in 2001.
They have turned into business makers by confiscating government land to sell it as a building land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, thus benefiting from the massive US award of subcontracts.
They have brought themselves into disrepute, and most of them were not themselves involved in the fights.
As I heard in the campaigns, people want a government that is not composed of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, just like those who could make use of the American funds: the capital flight is considerable.
The young people are filled with war and its ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have had contact with the modern world, and have enjoyed its benefits.
Some 65% of the population is under 25 years of age; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is one fifth of the total population.
In the cities the state schools are full of girls like boys.
These young people who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders will have to be provided with jobs.
All, including the armed parties, are possessed of mobile phones; television with its Turkish series, which represent a modern world, is watched everywhere.
An army is now in place.
Will the authorities under whose command it will stand be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already trying to restore the militias in the province that will escape the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the country of the mountains with strong local identities, should have benefited from a certain decentralization in the example of the Western nations, but by abolishing the office of the Prime Minister, which had existed since the Constitution of 1964, the USA wanted to make it a centralized state with a strong presidential force.
President Karzaï does not want foreign controls, especially on the occasion of the April 2014 elections.
However, its country has depended on foreign aid since the 1950s and long ago.
Industries have not been rebuilt, functional dams are not available and important irrigation systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported; apart from fruit and vegetables, nothing is produced.
The private initiative is given priority.
A country based on 30 years of war would have required State control of infrastructure.
The rumor was spread that Afghanistan had immense land resources.
This adds to the impression that the Western countries were only on the ground to empower themselves to do so.
Without energy to process the iron or copper ore on site, or without means of transport for exporting over the mountains, no mining is possible.
The Chinese have almost left Mes Aynak's copper mine, the international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) have their excavations done on the huge Buddhist site and remain the main employers of the province.
One day, it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are largely dependent on imports and exports, to restore normal relations.
The French martial forces were removed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional assistance: Girl and Boynymnasia, Institute of French at the universities, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a service of "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was discontinued in 2012 in dozens of mountain villages, has carried out numerous charitable work and measures for the rehabilitation of agriculture and has been carried out by a small French non-governmental organization in order to try to "win the hearts and spirits" and achieve the impossible task of reconciling aid and offensive actions.
This work, for which many local workers were required, has helped to suppress the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increasing agricultural areas.
What sort of souvenir do we leave behind after military spending of two billion euros?
A much more modest budget will contribute to improving local living conditions, which are often very hard at a height of more than 2,000 metres.
In the Embassy, dozens of written requests were received from the local authorities of the province of Kapisa for small agricultural projects.
In order to free farmers from the uprising led by foreign groups, which according to their own statements is their wish, the continuation of small, well-controlled and directly related civilian aid would be necessary for their benefit.
A Constitution with the Brechstange in Egypt
This is a new poker game by President Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt has decided to put everything on a map with regard to the declaration of constitution which has temporarily granted it unlimited authority, more than ever before, it has decided to put it all on a map.
To the surprise of all, he announced on Wednesday that the Constitutional Assembly would adopt its final version the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of state had granted this plenary two additional months to complete his work.
For almost two years now, Egypt has been based on a provisional, multiplely modified text, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal confusion.
This new initiative has only provided for an even greater division of the country.
For his opponents, the president persists in his "autocratic delirium" by continuing to "break his word" and "steps the right with his feet".
On the side of its supporters, it is assured that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as soon as possible and speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period of time forced the brothers to abandon their intention to explain the text section to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way of restoring his public and democratic legitimacy while the protest is raging throughout the country.
After confirming an interview with the American Week Show Time, Muhammad Mursi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in favour of it.
Especially the Egyptian people with this recourse to an overly rapid vote a ultimatum is put to put: "Either you vote for my draft or I retain the unlimited power of authority", the latter should, after the adoption of the Constitution, supposedly end.
Most of the Islamic members of this constitutional assembly adopted the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of Liberals have failed to comply with the call.
Shortly before the Constitutional Declaration in mid-November, they turned their backs on the idea that they were unable to apply their views.
Representatives of human rights organisations, religious minorities or civil society have acted equally.
11 persons, alternate members, were added to the decision-making process in all hurry yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslims.
It is not surprising that the articles were mostly adopted unanimously.
The commentators found it entertaining, by the way, that the only disagreement of the day... was expressed in the time for prayer, as some members of the panel felt that the pendulum clock of the constitutional assembly did not go exactly.
The text, which was adopted last night, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which drew all attention, remains the same with that of the 1971 Constitution and states that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law".
The Salafist parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is an important requirement, had the hope of replacing "the principles" with "the rules", which would have allowed more stringent application.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is proof of its good will and respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.
"Sin sanctity" is the answer of the liberals, who consider this only a propaganda blow.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution takes place through other articles.
In particular, they have in mind Article 220, which grants the University of Al-Azhar an advisory function, in particular with regard to the verification of conformity with the laws of the Sharia.
According to Egypt's specialist Sophie Pommier, this is worrying because "the persons who are asked for an opinion have not been elected and have no democratic legitimacy whatsoever.
You can see here the first signs of a theocracy".
The fears of the liberals are also fuelled by the fact that the next rector of this university is likely to be far less moderate than the current one.
"There is currently no concrete religious commitment to recognize.
With this constitution we remain within the framework of the bourgeois state.
Most lawyers who have worked on this text are not ulema, but academics who have been trained in the French system," says Alexis Blouet, who writes a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
He acknowledges, however, that "in Article 220 there can be ambiguity, since the terms used are derived from the religious vocabulary.
It refers in particular to the "Fiqh" [Islamic case law, Note. d. Red.].
And in the future, the question could be raised as to the extent to which civil judges are competent to decide."
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is strongly criticised by the far-reaching powers which it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslims argue that these are significantly reduced compared to the former regime.
Another point of dispute: the powers of the army.
In line with the military's wish, the examination of the defence budget is not presented to Parliament but to a National Defence Council.
Nor will there be a ban on civil proceedings in military courts, as requested by the human rights defence associations.
The latter also share their fears regarding the text they consider to be a threat to freedom.
The crime of blasphemy is maintained, and insults are now banned, which could have serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression, especially for the press.
In addition, no more article refers to the protection of women, emphasizes Heba Morayef by Human Rights Watch.
In your opinion, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to express himself on television last night, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
The proponents of the head of state will march on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists await sacred places, the navel of the world and a sea of Sole
The promised land unites in itself the glory of Bible truths, modern comfort and unspoiled nature.
AIF mentions you the five main reasons for visiting Israel.
Contradict the Holy Sites
Visit the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It means that all who bathe in this river receive God’s blessing.
Galilee is the place where Jesus performed his miracles: the transformation of water into wine at a wedding feast, the going on the water, the calming of the sea tower and fishing.
Here, too, Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
Most saints, however, are found in Jerusalem.
Believers take the path of suffering or cross-roads of Jesus Christ (on Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The path begins at the Roman fortress of Antonia, Pretorium, where the court was, and leads through the streets of the old town to the tomb church on Mount Golgotha, where the crucifixion site, the anointing stone and the tomb of Jesus are located.
In this Christian view, there is the navel of the world that symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
The monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem stands at the place where the tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus grew according to a Christian legend.
In Jerusalem there is also the most sacred place of the Jews - the wall of complaint, the remains of a temple that was destroyed by the Romans in 70 A.D.
Traditionally, there, people of different faiths leave papers with wishes, which then go in fulfillment.
Take a trip to the height
The ruins of the Massada fortress form the remains of the secret hiding place from enemies that Herod the Great built for his family in 25 A.D.
They are located on a rock wall in the mountains at 450 meters above sea level.
Only climbers can reach the ruins of their own power.
All the others bring an air cable car to this historic summit.
In the north of the country at 1600 to 2040 meters altitude is the famous ski resort Hermon, in which it attracts countless tourists in the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain you can get there with a shuttle bus.
The ski slopes have a total length of 45 kilometers.
According to an ancient legend, pagan gods were said to have lived on the mountain summit.
Visit Unique Museums
There are almost 300 museums in this country.
On just one trip, not all of them can be visited.
But at least the five most interesting of them should be paid a visit.
Among them is once the Israel Museum not far from the Knesset (Parliament).
There ancient Qumran manuscripts or scrolls from the Dead Sea, found in Felshöhlen in the Judean desert, are stored as well as about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
There the collection of works by Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso is exhibited.
In Akko you can visit the museum in Bad Al Basha, which houses several halls of ancient Turkish baths with sculptures of the visitors and bathers at that time.
In Caesarea you should visit the unique private Ralli Museum, where you can admire sculptures by Dali and Rodin.
There are neither museum leaders nor souvenir shops there.
Admission is free, and donations are basically rejected.
The fifth museum, namely the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells of one of the most shocking chapters of history.
The most touching section is the monument to the children, which was built to commemorate the 1.5 million children destroyed in the concentration camps and gas chambers.
When entering the room, there is complete darkness.
Stars are sparkling.
And the names of the Jewish children and the countries in which they died are heard.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Do something for health
The three main recreational areas of Israel are on the shores of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
There are swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanaries in each of the three places.
Amazingly, in the Red Sea, the water temperature is not below 21 °C and the air warms up to 23 °C.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and it is bathed all year round.
By the way, this unusual sea with a location of 417 meters below sea level is the deepest sea in the world.
Its turquoise blue water has a high salt content and therefore even carries non-swimmer easily on the surface.
The surrounding landscape is indescribably beautiful.
Visitors come here for treatments using salt water (natural salts) and medicinal sludge, as well as for the treatment of skin inflammation, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and for calming stressed nerves.
Touching the Secrets of Ancientity
These secrets house the old town of Tel Aviv, the town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through this city the famous sea road, which connected Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to tradition, Noah built his ark right here, and Perseus saved here the beautiful Andromeda with which he lived a long and happy life in this place.
Tourists like to stroll through the narrow alleys named after zodiacs.
Fortuna is said to be the legend after all who touch the walls in the alley with their zodiac sign.
In Jaffa you can find newlywed couples from all over Israel and even other countries at photo dates.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can roam through the Roman theatre and conquer the fortress of crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the most important city of Judea and residence of Roman governors, including Pontius Pilate.
Today evening concerts and operas are performed in the carefully restored theatre.
Destinations for tourists
If you're going to Israel, don't worry about your poor English skills: About 30% of the Israelis speak Russian.
The money in the trip is better not to take in euros, but in dollars that can simply be changed into shekels (current exchange rate: 1 dollar to 3.8 shekels).
In the city you usually get by bus, but in Jerusalem there is also a highway and in Haifa the only subway line of the country with six stations connecting the lower town with the upper city.
In fact, it's a underground cable car.
A journey within the city costs 6 shekels regardless of the transport, which is sufficient for a journey of up to 1.5 hours.
According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated in Israel on Saturdays.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, markets and shops are closed, and public transport rests.
And on Sunday morning the working week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and restaurants only kosher food is served, excluding pork, marine products, fish without dandruff and food containing both milk and meat products.
Instead, you have the choice between different dishes with hammuff and beef, soups and desserts (prepared with coconut milk), traditional Jewish humus paste, various sauces, fried balls of pured beans and peas (falafel) as well as fruits and vegetables.
In the streets of Israeli cities there are no rushing dogs.
For this, there are many well-nourished cats that rush comfortably and unlit through the streets.
In the evening you can even see them sleeping on the roofs of parking cars.
The cats like lively places and don't say no to treats.
Car rental costs depending on the brand between 37 dollars per day (Hyundai Getz) and 188 dollars (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
The insurance costs an additional $15 per day.
And bike rental costs 15 shekels a day.
On average, tickets for museums cost 30 shekels.
In figures
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most adventurers and return seekers came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the USA and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118,8 thousand Ukrainian tourists came to the praised country, which corresponds to an increase of 51% compared to the comparison period in 2010, before the visa requirement was abolished on 9 February 2011.
"The great and powerful" leads to Moscow: Migrants save money for language
While MEPs and citizens discuss the benefits of the law on binding language tests for migrants, criminals are already dealing with counterfeit certificates
Each year 13 million guest workers come to Moscow, St Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are the citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money for the maintenance of the families remaining in their home country.
On 1 December, a law came into force that requires every migrant worker to take a test that confirms knowledge of Russian language.
So far, this scheme applies only to migrants wishing to work in the service sector, in the municipal housing sector and in the retail sector.
However, the tests will in future become mandatory for all host workers, according to the Federal Migration Authority.
In doing so, one must not only take language tests, but also tests into Russian history and the foundations of legislation.
Language skills must be demonstrated both for the maintenance and extension of the work permit.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries where Russian is an official language.
It also excludes persons who have received their certificates and diplomas before the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Meaning, problem and protection of rights
The total number of examination bodies will be under the aegis of the Pushkin Institute for Russian, the Russian University of People's Friendship, the Moscow State University, the St Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
Migrants can take tests in all cities; already more than 160 corresponding centres have already been opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce the tests was supported by the representatives of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Authority.
On the other hand, before the law entered into force in the press, citizens asked the following question several times: What does the whole thing actually bring?
What changes does the requirement of having to show language skills, both for the Russians and for the host workers?
Above all, the counter spokesperson of the Migration Authority is about reducing the number of forced workers.
"Many are now talking about protecting the rights of migrant workers," says the head of the Federal Migration Office's Office in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelew.
However, their rights must be protected from departure.
Only an organized recruitment will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
There are problems with migrants without work, education, language skills and medical advice.
Sebelev is convinced that a future migrants will necessarily encounter people with evil intentions without language knowledge, who will put him in a dark, narrow barracks under the pretext of aid, where he will endure with dozens of his equal months without food and documents and will create 12 to 14 hours a day.
We reach many complaints from our migrants.
"In your home country, you will be promised the One, and on arrival you will cheat, get their passports removed and do not receive the promised wage," confirms the Head of the Labour Migration Administration of the Tajik Migration Authority, Tolib Schwaripow.
Don't yell, boss!
Nevertheless, many citizens of the Central Asian Republics, who want to earn their money in Russia, admit that not only do they not control the language of the target country, but they can hardly express themselves in writing in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much their fault, but rather the evil: only a few Turkmen, Uzbekistan and Tajiks can afford reasonable primary education.
For in their families there is not even money to feed the children, let alone to buy them decent clothes, shoes and school items.
As a teenager these children then immediately take the first opportunity to earn money.
"It is difficult without language knowledge," they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
With regard to the law, civil rights activists emphasize the following important aspect.
Only migrants with legal status have to take the test.
If you do not have this status, there is no examination and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile, most of the host workers continue to reside illegally in Russia.
"Welcome warmly" or "Access for unauthorized persons forbidden"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to get an official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic obstacles and, of course, linguistic difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration can be made quickly and only for a thousand and a half.
The staff of the Russian police know that our documents are mostly fake and we are not registered, and that is why cases of extortion arise.
"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," says the Tadskike Umed Huschkadamov to journalists.
"Do not stifle any costs for false papers"
Already on the day when the law came into force, it turned out that not only the registration documents of migrants can be fake.
Some fake certificates certifying the completion of the language test have already been seized by employees of the Federal Migration Authority.
The fake papers were printed with an ordinary color printer.
Of course, the new owners did not receive them for nothing: Every migrants who hoped to be able to save themselves the tests paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: this costs a migrant worker three thousand rubles.
In addition, the main direct task of protecting the system from corruption is to ensure that certificates cannot be bought easily, both officials and citizens agree.
For the moment, the authorities can only promise guest workers who first fall through the test that they will receive time for a basic language course.
In addition, new arrivals without language skills are offered jobs in areas where active communication with people is not necessary.
Interior ministry ignores illegal arms market
Share of legal weapons in crimes extremely low
The Russian Interior Ministry is planning a strengthening of the arms law for private weapons owners.
The authorities are thus responding to recent events: Injured in shootings at weddings as well as seven dead in the amok race of Moscow lawyer Dmitri Winogradov.
The police plan to ban the use of non-dead weapons in the public and raise the age of possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal supported the chairman of the Duma Security and Corruption Committee, Irina Jarrowaja, and promised that the changes to the Arms Act will soon be presented to the Duma.
Not all are satisfied that the Russian authorities want to fight the problems by "drawing the screws".
An open letter was published on the Internet, whose authors - representatives of various arms associations - call on the authorities to distance themselves from "insightless intensifications".
The percentage of crimes with registered weapons is very low, said the criminal lawyer, Wasilij Lesnikov, the Russian service of the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crimes with the use of registered weapons were committed over the course of six months in 2012, while a total of 1,168 crimes were recorded for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that an intensification of the law for private arms owners will not prevent criminals from serving on the black market.
According to the authors in Moscow, any weapon for little money can now be found.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior stresses that the spread of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
Weapons reach the black market via several channels.
There are five such main channels, says a former Colonel Viktor Baranez, who worked for ten years in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of a website that accepts gun orders
The first channel is the army or military, i.e. weapons stolen during the battles in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by both the Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," says Baranez.
On the second canal comes illegal weapons that are stolen by criminals.
Baranez explains that this includes weapons stolen from the police's arms chambers as well as directly from law enforcement staff.
Other illegally sold weapons come from military weapons camps.
In many military camps, explosions often occurred.
"There is evidence that some cases were arsons to cover up the lack of weapons," says the former military member.
According to Baranez, weapons manufacturers also contribute to the black market.
"Today, there are countless private arms factories that do not stand up to international competition and that is why the weapons are thrown under the hand of the black market, for example in Moscow," the expert reports.
Another channel of the Black Market is the smuggling.
Especially many guns and guns come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is its own, sometimes craft production as well as a mafia that organizes the smuggling," explains the former military member.
Where did the weapons come from?
Experts calculated the proportion of each of the five channels in the supply of the black market with illegal weapons.
In 2011, a report was prepared by the Center for Problem Analysis and Public Administration.
The experts analysed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and the Federal Service for State Statistics, criminological literature and publicly accessible data on portals on arms.
According to the investigators, the majority of the illegal weapons come from the army and the law enforcement authorities.
Half of all weapons in the black market are there due to the "debt of those responsible for dealing with weapons in their work," says the report.
According to the researchers, 17% of weapons come from conflict areas, 14% are from thefts in the production of weapons, and 5% are from illegal excavations.
A sales advisor from a arms store who does not want to be named guarantees that weapons found in illegal excavations have not been bought for a long time since they are outdated.
According to him, it's more common for dealers to get resuscitation in a weapons camp.
A gun, for example a TT gun, is purchased via a flag.
The weapon is issued and handed over by the fence.
"The dealer brings the weapon to the city and sells it there for 900 euros per piece with two magazines," he says.
"The police, of course, know everything and therefore, if it cannot comply with the crime detection plan, carry out periodic checks on dealers offering illegal weapons," adds the sales advisor.
"As in the luxury shop"
Buyers and sellers find the most common about acquaintances to each other.
I had looked at websites and blogs when someone got aware of me and suggested to come to the station "Begowaya" where a person would wait for me who would break me to a certain place where we could then negotiate the price.
The price for the weapon I only learned there
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
"To get a gun, I need a friend who has contacts," says the sales advisor. "I have such a acquaintance, but I don't trust him."
There are dealers in the markets, but there you have to go and date with a code such as "by Ivan Ivanovich, who lets the daughter lose a tooth".
At present I even come to a few strokes about a friend I trust.
He's just giving me the drums because he knows I'm not pudding it.
Novices are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military member Viktor Baranez tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he wrote an article on this subject.
According to him, the schemes have not changed.
He got a photo album where "everything possible" was pictured.
"I felt like I was in the luxury shop," remembers the military member.
According to Baranez, the buyer does not get the cat in the bag, but can try everything out.
As a potential customer, I do not just buy, but drive the seller into the forest, and there we set a target.
"I can shoot there, and if I'm convinced that the weapon has a good shot, we'll negotiate with each other," the expert describes the approach.
Shopping from the sofa
Internet search engines show search results for websites and groups in "Vkontakte", where weapons are offered "for various purposes".
No papers are needed or there are personal meetings.
"You only need the right sum of money," says the advertisement on the website "Buy a gun or gun".
There users place your orders and make inquiries.
Is it also sold to minors?
"Of course without a license", asks user "Iwan" (literally quote).
"Buy a TT. Moscow" is the Laconian request of "Fedorenko".
The Federal Security Service recently turned on countless web pages, and buyers who want to acquire weapons go to the network to pile up the service.
People come like hungry fish when feeding and then land in Siberia and are allowed to bake coal
Military commentator and former military member Viktor Baranez
I have heard from the following scheme: The website is usually registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
Those responsible shall accept the orders.
The buyer transfers the money via a bank machine.
"In response he receives a photo and a description of the hiding place of the weapon," reports the press speaker of the non-profit organisation "Pravo na oryzhie" Dmitry Kislow.
Viktor Baranez emphasizes that you can finally go out empty and come behind lattices when you place a request on a website.
The Federal Security Service recently turned on countless web pages, and buyers who want to acquire weapons go to the network to pile up the service.
"The people come like hungry fish at feeding and then land in the Siberian labour camp and are allowed to raise coal," he says.
A Makarrow for 100 US dollars
According to experts, when buying illegal firearms, prices range from 100 to 900 US dollars.
According to Dmitry Kislow of the organization "Pravo na oryzhie", you can buy a Makarrow gun for 100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait up to one and a half months.
The weapon is spent in military weapons camps of medium-range guards.
According to the Ministry of the Interior's official statistics, the number of crimes involving illegal weapons throughout Russia fell by 7% to 22.9 thousand from January to October 2011, while the number of discovered cases of theft and extortion related to weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosives decreased by 7.8%.
In the USA, fast-food and supermarket workers strike
Every fourth American youth is sitting behind the checkout of McDonald's
In recent days, massive protests against low wages in Walmart's and restaurants of popular fast food chains such as Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken have been taking place throughout the US.
No one can predict whether the protests will continue to swell or whether they will soon be back in the air.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several non-profit organisations on the left.
In addition to increasing the modest wages of simple Walmart and fast-food workers, the organizers of the protests pursue the goal of establishing trade unions.
So far, this sector of the economy has hardly been organised by the trade unions.
46 cents a year?
The protests started last week after Thanksgiving, on the so-called Black Friday, on which sales took place in the United States that attracted millions of customers, which sometimes led to hand-mixing.
On that day, some Walmart employees, of whom there are 2.2 million worldwide, laid down their jobs and worked together with trade unions and left activists.
Walmart sells all products, from diapers to hunting guns and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
On average, the goods in the Walmart branches are between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That is why many of the slightly paid Walmart employees buy only at their own workplace.
The prices and the product range made Walmart one of the largest companies in the USA.
According to critics, Walmart can often only sell the goods so cheaply because the employees are badly paid.
The latter also complain about heavy working conditions, for example missing forklifters or hand scanners.
The participants of the protests at the "Black Friday" demanded wage increases and expressed their anger that the contribution to corporate health insurance had increased from 30 to 100 dollars per month.
A typical Walmart employee who earns $9.5 the hour could not afford this increase, they said.
Researchers from the California University in Berkeley prove that if the company raised the average wage to 12 dollars the hour, it would cost Walmart 3.2 billion dollars.
That's about 1.1% more than they donate for wages now.
If Walmart would turn the wage increases completely on the customers, each purchase would cost them only 46 cents more in the future.
This would be for them per year compared to today's extra expenditure of only 12.39 dollars.
Supporters of Walmart are pleased to note that only nine states protested and did not cause any losses to the company.
The Black Friday took the next day at its 8 o'clock store on Thursday to midnight, and during this period Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, the Walmart cashes on the "Black Friday" carried out almost 100 million transactions.
In an interview on the website of the left-wing Huffington Post, Dan Fogelman, spokesperson of the company, claimed that the work was "less than five" Walmart employees, and that the protest action was only "a further PR trick" of the union, which organized the protests.
Free cash!
The protests continued this week in New York, where their goal was, however, not Walmart branches (which are not desired in this advanced city and therefore previously inexistent), but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says the company sells billions of portions, and yet you don't get sick, and you won't be paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member of the New York City Council
At present, the minimum wage according to federal and New York legislation is 7.25 dollars per hour.
In fast food restaurants, the minimum wage is gradually increased, but not too strong, and on average their simple employees in New York get $8.90 an hour.
Less than she deserves no one in this expensive city.
As it is possible to get out of New York with so little money, I am incomprehensible.
There was once a time when almost a quarter of all U.S. youths were standing behind the counter after school at McDonald's, but the young people were still living with their parents.
Almost one saw in it the main source of income or planned to stay there longer.
Now, in interviews with McDonald's staff, I'm constantly encountering people who complain that they have to get out of this wage and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment in the Forum of the Newspaper Wall Street Journal, whose author notes that it is not responsible to have children if you do not know how to feed them.
The participants of the protests, which started on Thursday at 6.30 a.m. before McDonald's on 40th Street and on Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashiers and cooks of fast-food restaurants receive a minimum wage of $15 per hour, more than a doubling of the current minimum wage.
They continued to call for the formation of trade unions in the fast-food industry.
The U.S. law forbids the management of companies to stand in the way of this objective and to warn or dismiss trade union members.
On the other hand, management does not make it easy for them.
The establishment of trade unions in the fast food industry is also difficult for objective reasons.
The most important reason is the high number of staff fluctuations.
Dissatisfied
There were strong protests that day also before many other fast-food restaurants in Manhattan.
The highlight of the protests was a meeting in front of the McDonald's on Times Square, where some local democrats spoke, including city councillor Jumaane Williams, who said, "McDonald's say it sells billions of portions, and yet you don't get sick days, and you won't be paid for your honest work!"
The demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, Mayor Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should jointly support the fast-food workers so that they can obtain a fair wage and reach the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves!".
According to New York Times, this was the largest action of its kind in the history of the US fast-food industry.
However, only a few hundred people were on site, not all of whom are employed in the fast-food industry, where tens of thousands work in New York.
It is not yet clear whether the spark of these protests will mobilize entire masses.
"To date, the brain can only be easily overshadowed"
The theme of expanded reality, popular with modern technologies, has recently been usually perceived by the lens of a special eyeglass.
At first, Google presented a working model at its annual conference in summer, and in November it became known that Microsoft had also filed a patent.
In conversation with the head of the group for interactive 3D technologies in the Microsoft lab in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, however, it becomes clear that the glasses were only a transit station for the scientists of the company.
It stimulates the possibility to manipulate virtual objects in the air with bare hands and create virtual open spaces.
- Please describe briefly what research your group is doing.
- We are dealing with the interaction of man and machine, but we want to expand the limits of this interaction.
So far, mankind has remained largely stuck in the phase of working with pixels on flat screens, which are sometimes also touched.
However, we want to look ahead for 5-10 years and anticipate the radical changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox consoles and the Kinect sensors are progressing, and nowadays no Xbox is sold without Kinect as everyone is interested in motion control.
- What else awaits us in the future?
- Although Kinect has brought interaction to a physical level, much is still happening on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the output not yet decisive.
We try to change this, work on real three-dimensional representation systems based on various technologies, including projections.
We need to release the computer world into our physical world and make it more tangible.
However, it is necessary that not only the user, but also his environment be recognized.
Then we could add virtual objects to the real world much easier.
And first of all, we should get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about language control?
She's popular, but isn't she overrated?
- It is certainly not the all-purpose solution, as it raises questions about privacy, because it is not always wanted to inform all the surrounding ones about its actions and intentions.
Actually, any kind of interaction with computers is good, but any niche in its particular niche.
For example, in the area of controlling objects at public places, we worked on a project where we experimented with short and tight gestures instead of inviting gestures.
The gestures were not recorded by the object camera, but by a bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, but could theoretically be reduced to the size of a watch.
But overall, the future belongs to mixed types of control, such as gesticism and language.
- How's that?
- We'd ask you, for example, to give you this spray can?
They say it and at the same time point it out.
- Usually, I'm just saying it.
- Oh, that would be very difficult to recognize.
- Does that mean that you want the user to adapt to what a machine can do at the time and what doesn't?
- Not necessarily, but this is a mutual approach.
I think that in the next few days we will have to work mainly on the development of new sensor types, which will enable people to respond more accurately.
This can be laser sensors, for example, because they offer a good resolution at depth, which is very important.
- What are your requirements based on your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors on modern cameras?
Is there a lack of resolution, depth, or anything else?
- The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional detection.
Of course, 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 fps would not be bad.
But the main thing is not the megapixel itself, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
Thus, all current technologies are not good enough for us, as the developers of the algorithms have more work.
It must not only be taken into account the resolution along the X- and the Y-, but also along the Z-axis.
The speed and number of images per second are also important.
The movements of the human being are extremely dynamic and openly said, the present 30 fps are especially for gestures too little.
Stephen Betishes developed a contact sensor in our laboratory in Redmond with a controllable processing delay of between 1 and 100 milliseconds, with today's commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not all understand how much that affects the interaction of man and machine.
For my work, I needed exactly that kind of device, only without contact control and with more images per second.
- Shouldn't the number of cameras have to be increased?
- Kinect is currently working with three "camera", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the second is a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB camera.
It does not serve to calculate the depth of the object.
More cameras could possibly solve the problem...
Or strengthen the problem as more calculations would be needed.
It would be nice to have a flexible, kinect-like system where we could play with different camera inclinations to see how this helps us to determine a position in three-dimensional terms.
- If I remember correctly, Microsoft, unlike Google, would not present his glasses to the public.
Don't you think that with regard to the application of the technology of expanded reality in everyday life, the glasses have the best prospects?
- Of course, it's not pleasant to keep a smartphone in the raised hand on the go, but I think the most great variant would be a "changing" extended reality in which we could switch from glasses to the smartphone via a cloud,
The glasses are a personal gadget and it contains its strength (privates can only see you), but at the same time also its weakness, because an extended reality by means of glasses prevents you from working on virtual objects together with others.
- Let's imagine for a moment that manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is not only accessible to Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also to normal mortals.
There is a problem that critics of this idea often point out: there is no tangible response!
The hands don't feel anything at all!
What answers does your group want to give to this objection?
- In my lectures, I often talk about the expanded reality as the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think that the eighth breakthrough could be the integration of tactile perception.
An interesting method is currently the use of the second hand as a somewhat unusual projection document.
She's doing great pressure!
However, there are also technologies that are actually aimed at giving the "images in the air" something hand-resistant, for example, creating interference from some directed ultrasound rays at a certain point where the finger is located, a feeling that is at present as weak as pusting someone over the handballs.
There are also bands for the wrist that affect nerve endings in the fingers, which is also a potential direction.
- Have you tried to overwhelm the brain?
It makes you think it feels what it should feel when it sees something?
- That's a good idea, so we haven't tried yet.
Here lies another task with which we will have to struggle for a long time, namely to let a person who is physically in a closed space believe, he is instead in an open, practically infinite space; here we work on concepts with treadmills (other than in gyms), moving platforms and large spheres.
So far, the brain can only be overly overly controlled, and there are many working years ahead of us.
This is what makes the work in the field of virtual reality so appealing to a researcher: on many topics we are only at the beginning.
Own taste instead of culture - rosebalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "Petersburger Avantgarde", which is dedicated to city dwellers who form the avant-garde of art and culture.
On the selected list, high-ranking representatives of the Petersburg art scene, whose success goes beyond the borders of the city and which often find recognition in Europe without being known in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, the red-dressed beards, who are once at the Russian museum, sometimes at the summer garden, sometimes at scene meetings or on vernissages.
Wherever the pictures of Kirill Miller are exhibited, they attract large masses of people.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg social-philosophical artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant personality of the Petersburg avant-garde at the end of the 80s and the beginning of the 90s.
He is also a man of the city and, by his presence on the street, enchants his fellow citizens with a smile in his face and gives them a good mood.
Recently, he caught a shooting organ and became a Petersburg film organ player, as he finally felt ready for this difficult role in terms of his artistic existence, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you always in red and not, for example, in yellow or turquoise in the city?
I have chosen the color red as a fashion designer that deals with the look and the image.
In this world, red is the compromise between artist, image advisor and society.
In society, everything that deviates from the grey norm produces aggression and bad behavior.
But I want to talk to people through my provocations.
Each of my past provocations was an invitation to the conversation.
- When did you know you had to be a painter?
- At an exhibition in the Kulturpalast Newskij, where my works were exhibited.
I understood I had to go this way.
Then the time of the old free but not officially recognized painters ended, and new and free painters like me were incomprehensible.
I became friends with the painters of the new generation, i.e. with the representatives of the "Gazonevschina", from which "Puschkinskaya 10" arose, and then it was only once that.
It draws me to the theatre, to fashion, to music, actually to everything, except literature.
It was important to me to be at the centre of the Petersburg culture, where the best creative artists should gather together.
In 1995 I occupied a space in Puschkinskaja 10, where there was a musical-artist club for the Bohemia, the house of the Petersburg Bohemia until the renovation work.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I also remember how Schnur got there with his project "Ucho Van Goga".
Schnur and his friends sang simple songs to the playback, carried tight jerseys and one of them was the today-winning composer Igor Wdowin.
When the group started to play live, it was her "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the time of "Halli-Galli".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it began his great career, but he learned the basics from us.
The gallery "D 137" or the club "Gribodov" also have its origin in the art clinic.
Our employees and regulars went there.
I'm a hero of the last century when culture meant something.
In the year 2000, there was a survey in the press on the award "Persons of our city".
I won in the category "Artists of the Year", and with that I was at the height.
It is not easy to work in new times according to old rules; I am a person of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: One can be famous without making a cultural contribution.
- Your work has an unmistakable style.
- Many of my pictures are real pearls and express clearly the topicality and sharpness of the thoughts.
I will have an exhibition with the theme "The Russian Museum as Clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
I used to be social, but now it hurts and is afraid to be like that.
In a clown, all this blurs and loses its tragedy.
I love Grotesque, and I have grotesque ideas.
For example, let us save the world by requiring that everyone has to dress up completely.
Now everyone pays attention to the clothes and focuses on the outside and not on the inside of man.
But perhaps you should not give a person your hand, but you should spit him in the face.
The deception disappears through the disguise.
A cultural city should have a hero like that.
Who if not me?
- Can commercial art also be beautiful?
- Nowadays, commercial art must be cautious, considerate and flattering.
We see the decay of cultures.
In the past, people formed large groups: Bohemian loved one another and the simple people the other.
Now there are micro-communities, and it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred dollars note that everyone likes.
Now you have to think about who you're going to like.
Now each cult star has about 100 followers.
- But there are several thousand of Stas Michailow's performances!
- To him abandoned women come, where the sexual-social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons 300 people and not 10 thousand, so there is less management, money, and everything goes down.
I have followers, and the most important thing is not to cheat on them and not destroy what was achieved.
In my youth I painted pictures that even hung in a series with works by Falk and Larionow.
I started with pictures that usually only come at the end of my career.
Nowadays, there are often misunderstandings.
It means: spiritual culture and consumer culture.
Consumer consumption has no culture at all, it's quite different.
I am a person of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money to be able to paint.
This is the culture I support.
- Kirill, what's Petersburg missing?
- Good cultural experts.
They say: Servants of culture.
But not every one of them can deal with culture.
With the real tsars it was different, because the tsars may not understand much of culture, but they understood that right experts are necessary.
There are currently good consultants in Moscow.
In Petersburg we have which experts may be, but the way is blocked because it requires more high-ranking experts, who properly evaluate the former and clear the way for them.
Now only one's own taste counts.
The same applies to the Erarta, however, with the difference that they honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and therefore some painters have to look for other museums.
- What's Petersburg for you?
- Petersburg is not the capital of culture; in Moscow there is much more culture and a corresponding breeding ground.
On our stones, art can only grow hard.
We need a cultural soil because, for example, we have more writers than readers, and that is not right.
In Europe there are many curious people who visit exhibitions or concerts.
That's much less with us.
Art must be modern again, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is financed by grants from the city of St Petersburg
Birth in Space
Earth in danger.
Global warming or collision with killerasteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with earth's inhabitants on board are looking for a replacement planet.
To save mankind, does the important question arise as to how we can reproduce in the weightlessness or on the replacement planet?
I do not think there are many options.
De facto there are only two real planets that we could at least live in hypotheticalally.
"Mars and Venus," says the scientific assistant of the Astronomical Sternberg Institute Vladimir Surdin.
However, while the conditions on Mars are comparatively life-friendly, on the surface of Venus there is a temperature of 500 degrees.
Life would only be possible in high altitude or in the orbit of Venus, in other words in space.
The researchers first dealt with the issue of reproduction in space in terms of the flora.
Experiments with plants were carried out half a century before that.
The fourth generation of peas bred in orbit did not differ in the least from the earthly species.
It followed the cultivation of insects, more precisely of tiny fruit flies (drosophila), in orbit.
In 1979, watchmen were sent to space to explore how weightlessness affects the development of embryos.
It develops a normal chick.
But then the problem begins.
"The problem is that the chick must find a stop; it must be able to stand on its legs and start to move," explains the laboratory leader of the Institute for Medical-Biological Problems RAN, Vladimir Sychew.
Without a solid underground, the chicks overflow wildly.
Ten hours later, the new-born instincts completely stumped.
The chicks did not respond to light and noise.
Four days later, they simply died.
"Two times we let chicks slip and then put the whole thing in place because it is simply impossible to work with them," Wladimir Sychew notes to the failed experiment with the chicks in space.
The last breeding cage with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in spring 2013.
However, on the biosatellite "Bion" there will be only the same sex species.
There was an experiment with rats already fertilized in space.
In principle, nothing special has been found.
"That was just with the biosatellites, but again it was only a single experiment, and the research needs to be continued," says Vladimir Sychew.
After the landing, the space councils received young people.
The problem of reproduction directly in space could not be solved so far.
The task is difficult.
Animals that are torn out of their natural habitat simply cannot follow their reproductive drive.
Unlike animals, man could in principle do so.
The Homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can create a similar emotional background.
For ethical reasons such experiments are not carried out.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
There was the greatest risk in Tereshkova.
The most valuable thing mankind has is the female organism.
Our gulls flew away, and no one on earth could have answered the following question: Do they survive the space flight?
Will she be able to bring a child to the world after this flight?
"Finally, no one answered this question," says the space veteran Wachtang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, just one year after her space flight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, bore a daughter.
The father of the child, Andrijan Nikolayev, was also cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman in space, Svetlana Sawizkaja, who was twice orbited and even worked outside the spacecraft, bore a son.
Nevertheless, there is still a risk.
We have very few cosmonauts, where after long flights everything went well and they got healthy young people.
"The more, the more dangerous it is even in the orbits," concludes Cosmonaut Waleri Poljakow, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation.
Yet mankind must look for new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection and artificial gravity.
The hydrolabor in the cosmonaut preparation centre is a mandatory station during flight preparation.
Here in a floating state the cosmonauts gain routine for work in open space.
The water represents weightlessness.
Even if adults feel water as pleasant, it is a strange environment; yet infants feel water as a natural element.
It's like the little ichtyanders are testifying that life in the land escaped the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is in the mother's belly for about 9 months and that it can then be used to water more easily.
In principle, this is logical, since from birth to first swimming only two weeks pass.
"That's too little time to forget something," says Baby swimming teacher Marina Aksenowa.
So while weightlessness for a newborn child is a much more natural state, the woman does not come out without gravity.
In the condition of weightlessness, the abdominal and pelvic muscles are retreating very quickly, thereby reducing the ability to extort the child.
All right, let's get rid of this by using abrasive tool.
For example, the birth could also take place in a special chamber to push the child out.
"But what happens then?" is the insignificant question of Waleri Poljakow.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the edification, the organism cannot train the skeleton and the muscles.
In orbit, a newborn child cannot be put in a load suit like an adult for training.
He will simply miss what is of fundamental importance to his life.
"This experiment, which we are carrying out together, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead to the introduction of an disabled person, a totally inappropriate person," says the director of the Bioethics Commission of the Institute for Medical-Biological Problems RAN, Igor Pestov.
So far, the birth of children in space is mere theory.
At some point, however, it will become reality when the earth's inhabitants in their spaceships break into a distant planet that will be home to their descendants born in space.
NKU-chef: Black system control fails by indebtedness of policy
The Czech Republic has good control bodies and adequate laws in connection with public procurement, but it is not in its application.
In the discussion for Aktuálně.cz, this is said by the Vice-President of the Supreme Control Office (Neuvyší kontrolní úřad, NKÚ), Miloslav Kala.
"A law is never perfect, but it must be applied properly - and I do not think this is the case with us," Kala comments on the current situation.
A similar result appears to be a joint control by Czech and German examiners.
As a negative example of practice, he leads Prime Minister Petr Nečas to the so-called "black system".
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not bother entrepreneurs with checks - is the system now prohibited or allowed?
"A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then the chairman of the government cannot simply come, and the control office, whose duty is now the control of compliance with the law, can hinder its activity," says Kala.
At the meeting of the Chamber of Deputies' Control Committee, you discussed a joint Czech-German project in which the laws of both countries relating to public contracts were compared.
What exactly was that about?
This is a parallel examination which we started about two years ago.
Simply put, it is about the European legislation defining how public procurement can be handled, on which national legislation builds, and finally there is the actual practical application.
We have compared all of this with each other, and although the examination has not yet been completed, we have been able to determine extremely interesting differences. Generally speaking, the laws in us are perhaps even a little "harder and more perfect", but the actual application in Germany is better in some parameters.
This confirms that it is not enough to set new and more precise rules over and over again. It is also necessary to deal with the actual application of the law.
How can the project help you? What results from this project?
Such a joint control could help us to stop trying constantly to perfect the laws and reduce and elucidate thresholds if this does not seem to have a particularly positive effect.
Economics means buying a thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and excluding illegal enrichment or even criminal acts.
But the reduction of thresholds for contracts does not guarantee that we also achieve this objective.
It may even be that we only burden the system with excessive "paperwork" in this way, and those looking for gaps in the system have much easier use of the system than if the thresholds remained higher.
They are talking about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech Procurement Act.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an authority similar to our NKU here, or does the system work differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the German counterpart to the National Court of Auditors is the Federal Court of Auditors, which is built up in a similar way to us and also has a college that is formed only slightly different. However, in principle both authorities work similar.
The competences are also comparable to some extent, but Germany is a state, i.e. there are also these invoicing courts in the individual federal states - in this the German system differs from ours.
The BRH may only control federal funds, which corresponds to our state resources.
Public funds managed by the districts and municipalities are subject to the control of the national accounting authorities.
As far as German legislation is concerned, is it easier than ours?
In general, I would hate to compare this without any specific information. Nevertheless, Germany is often referred to as a model in some respects, but one certainly cannot say that Germany is better in all things.
Is that because the examiners are better there?
That certainly is not the case, but as I said, I do not particularly like such comparisons.
It should also be noted that those countries that are a model for us are also facing problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn't have anything to do with cooperation with our authority, would they?
As far as Czech legislation is concerned, what was the significance for your authority of the revision of the procurement law, do you already feel any impact?
In view of the fact that this novelle is only in force for a short time, it has not yet been affected by our tests.
As our controls take place afterwards, we have to expect a certain delay here.
So far, we feel that we are more likely to have an impact in the preparatory phase of future controls - we have introduced the new control instrument on "acknowledgement of risks of economics" and we have examined and analysed these almost 14,000 public contracts - here, of course, the changes will have an impact, as the thresholds change, the conditions for certain types of tenders have been modified, among others.
Do you see the adoption of this law more positive, or is the system burdened with further bureaucracy?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction and hope that this adoption is confirmed.
However, the problem may arise that the rules are becoming more "severe" and can no longer be respected.
Already under the previous rules, persons subject to examination are liable to the institution (for example, in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, the Regional Council) in such a way that any non-compliance with the award law corresponds to a breach of budgetary discipline.
But does it make sense to make the law even more stringent?
I do not think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system and not punish those who have committed a formal error that does not affect the actual decision-making process.
Such a system only puts red tape under even greater pressure.
Where's the way out?
Let us first say which path is not a goal guide.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not lighten entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called "black system" - what does that mean?
Is the black system now banned or allowed?
A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then the chairman of the government cannot simply come, and the control office, whose duty is now the control of compliance with the law, can hinder its activity.
He can say, "We change the law and allow the thing," but he cannot say that we do as if nothing were.
The contract law contains relatively strict rules on the formal execution of certain operations - and this is correct for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, however, it is also tragic if the bidder is excluded with the best offer only due to form errors.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied properly - and that is what I think is missing.
On the streets there are isolated ice sheets, but mostly they are dry.
On the streets of the Czech Republic there are partly snow and ice sheets.
However, the roads are mostly easily driveable, sometimes increased caution is needed.
KaribaKarlsbad
In the district of Karlovy Vary, the streets were easy to drive this morning, and snow- and ice-smooths were isolated.
The temperatures fell to -5 to -10 °C, during the day it should become somewhat warmer.
In the region it no longer snows, and in the lower altitudes remains only a thin snow cover.
However, there are about 30 cm of snow on the coves of the Erzgebirge.
According to the district road guard, Nebel's view was limited.
The R6 motorway and the first road in the region are currently fully accessible.
However, attention should be paid, for example, to bridges on which the roads are sometimes required and smooth.
Also accessible are all traffic routes of the second and third categories, including mountain roads.
However, snow remains required or disembarked on these roads.
In particular, increased attention should therefore be paid to higher levels.
Districts of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
On some streets of East Bohemia there is danger due to ice smooths, higher locations and in the mountains there is sometimes still an excavated layer of snow on the roads, the road and motorway direction is reported on their websites.
The road championships warn drivers of ice smooths, which can occur especially in higher locations in the district of Pardubice.
Ice smooths may occur in particular on the second and third roadways in the districts of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy and Vysoké Mýto.
Roads I/43 and I/34 in Svitavy are chemically treated.
Snow is particularly located on the streets in the Giant Mountains and in the mountains Orlické hory.
A covered snow layer lies on the streets of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In East Bohemia it is mostly sunny or cheerful today, and it remains largely dejected.
The temperatures move between -3 and +1 °C, there is a weak wind.
Pilsen District
The streets in the district of Pilsen are well accessible today, but local attention is needed, and the driving mode is adapted to the weather.
This is frozen in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below the freezing point.
As it has snowed before and the temperatures subsequently fell, ice smooths may occur on the roads.
In addition, fog can be expected locally, but the view will improve in the course of the day.
This information is from the district road championships.
The D5 motorway is practically fully accessible, but increased attention is recommended by the road championships between 80 and 131 kilometres.
The first road tracks are mainly dry, but frozen.
However, in the south of the Pilsen and Tachov circles, ice smooths may occur in several stages.
The roadways of the second and third categories are damp, and therefore also the reference to possible required sections is valid here.
Drivers should be particularly careful on less frequent roads in the Böhmerwald area.
Olomouc District
Today, snowmachs have to count on riders who are on the road towards the altitudes in the Olomouc district.
After the use of scattered vehicles, snowmach remains on the Červenohorské sedlo pass and on the road towards Videlský kříž.
Nightly snow-driving forced the road championships to use, in the Šumperk district about 3 cm of new snow fell according to the street administration.
In the other areas of the district, the roads are usually fully accessible.
"In the Šumpere district, snow remains in the altitudes.
On the Červenohorské sedlo pass, the riders have to count on snowmate in the direction of Jeseník," said a staff member of the Šumperk street administration today to the ČTK agency.
Also their colleagues in the Jeseník district had to get out at night, according to their data, the roads are free and wet to the altitudes after chemical treatment.
In the Olomouc district, the roads are fully accessible, but in the Šternberk district, the drivers have to drive carefully in forest sections, as the roads are still wet.
Ústí nad Labem District, Liberec District
In North Bohemia, the road championships report several badly driveable road sections.
In addition to several places with snow or ice smooths, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice is blocked in the district of Ústí n.K. according to the traffic police.
The temperatures remain below zero even in deeper locations, so snow and ice will keep on the streets. There are no problems reported from the low plains, especially southeast of the Bohemian Middle Mountains, and the roads are generally dry there.
No traffic disturbances have been reported so far.
Ice sheets are reported in particular from the Štětí district.
According to meteorologists, there were ideal conditions during the night - rain and melting snow, at night cloudless sky and frost.
Of the main routes and of road I/13 on the border of the districts of Ústí n.L. and Liberec, poor traffic conditions are reported.
The blockage of the road between Telnice and Knínice was necessary due to branches that were pressed from the snow load to the roadway.
Šimon Ornest: At our concerts we want to collect positive energy
What do you think is going to happen in less than a month of the world's downfall?
This is one of those news of disasters that we people are so happy to jump on.
With our band The Tap Tap, we're rather making fun of it and saying that we're the only band in the world that can collect enough positive energy to stop or prevent the world's downfall.
In December, you will also realize a unique project with three concerts against the global downfall.
Can you introduce the project to our readers?
This is a national benefit event that we have been planning for two years.
For this purpose, we want to use the marketing potential of the Maya calendar, which is forecast to be at 11:10 a.m. at the end of December 21st.
On the day before, i.e. on 20 December, three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava will be held at the same time as from 21:00.
The end of the concerts is to be in about the time when the Maya calendar ends on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which is in a time zone around 12 hours ahead of us.
Who's that idea from?
Originally probably from me, after that we designed the idea together with our graphic artist Hanza Augusta.
Not only do we want to collect enough positive energy to prevent world ruin, we also want to think together with the public about the state in which we hand over this world to our children.
At the end of the Maya calendar, we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags and keychains against the global downfall, with which people can also support us via www.e-tap.cz.
The band The Tap Tap has also recorded together with other performers the so-called hymn against the world's downfall entitled "World Fall Out".
Already today the hymn on YouTube is very popular. Will it also sound like the benefit concerts?
Of course, in conclusion, provided that everything works and the world does not happen...
The hymn is to be sung at the same time by all performers on all three concerts.
In addition, the hymns are broadcast live in a direct circuit from Czech television.
The text of the hymn comes from Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main character of Jesus in the video clip, Xindl X sings with...
How did you get to work with both?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, which is related to the fact that we realize many benefit events and concerts...
We strive to involve these people intensively in our projects.
It has been shown that most people are interested in working with us and have fun.
What is the purpose of the proceeds of the concerts against the global downfall?
For the establishment of the barrier-free educational centre Studeo, which we have been working on for six years together with the Association Tap at the Jedlička Institute.
The students of the Jedlička Institute are regularly cared for by readers who help them with various leisure activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the means to visit the readers, we want to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedlička Institute, we are expected to create our own building, in which we will then move in with this project.
At each concert several groups and performers perform.
Which criteria have you chosen?
We wanted to put together a program that addresses all generations, including children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, Support Lesbias, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango, and Jiří Suchý perform.
You can find out more on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar "great events" also planned for the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at the Prague Spring, and we will also prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to be at the Czech House in New York, and I personally - if we are already in the USA - would like to combine this with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not very small, so far you have already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
However, The Tap Tap is a group composed of people with disabilities.
How do you handle these trips logistically and organizationally?
It's not as bad as it seems at first sight.
Five of our members are wheelchair drivers, i.e. the wheelchairs must be transported in the luggage room. In addition, of course, we have to drag a lot of instrument case and other luggage...
Nevertheless, it has always worked without problems, ČSA and British Airways have always been very well prepared for us, that sometimes I have wondered in part.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
Through your travel abroad, you have a comparison of what it looks like in the individual countries with accessibility, how to deal with disabled people, etc.
How have you experienced these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than with us, we were just in Russia witnesses that everything in the East is still in its beginnings.
About Prague, Moscow is absolutely unobstructed, where it is still unusual when someone is traveling in the wheelchair alone in the city center.
It's not even obvious there that you're leaving a wheelchair driver in the elevator, for example.
Fortunately, there are also associations who are trying to point out the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what way do we need to catch up with the developed countries?
There's still a lot of things we're hanging out in...
However, it should be noted that improving the situation always depends on the efforts of those concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is absolutely common for people with severe disabilities to move independently in public space, go to the museum, use toilets, etc.
However, it is not common for a larger group of disabled people to actively participate in the social events, in which we are a little ahead of the West with the band The Tap Tap!
Respect in the public and accessibility is one thing, but only when important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come from our ranks will things really start to change.
So far, these are only individual cases of particularly willful personalities.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but if we go back a few years, what motivated you to create a band in 1998?
At that time, I started as a supervisor at the Jedlička Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in doing something intensive.
And since I am a musician myself and play saxophone among other things, I have founded a music-AG together with a colleague.
Well, and in time, as our moderator, Láða Angelovič, used to say, something out of control (laughs).
But the band only became familiar in recent years, or am I wrong?
It is true that working with well-known singers has helped us, and we have also started to advertise actively for ourselves.
We have become aware that if you do something and you cannot see it outwardly, your own performance does not exist in a sense.
Moreover, thanks to the EU funding funds, we can afford good readers, high-quality equipment and so on.
Was it your goal to bring it so far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I have felt the potential that you can approach things differently.
Today, in the show business, one often copies the other.
This makes sense in its own way, as everything new is considered with caution and only after a long time is accepted.
There are only a few really unique things, and I dare claim that Tap Tap belongs to them.
The first impression the viewer usually has is of course pity; that is only natural...
But this pity is absolutely unnecessary because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned beings that we should regret.
It is people who are able to live and develop a full life, provided that they have the necessary means to do so.
I always say that if people with disabilities succeed, this is not only a progress for themselves, but for society as a whole.
Was it also helpful for this success that you are a strict boss, how to hear from many people?
If you want to do something good, you must not compromise in many things and you must also demand a certain discipline.
However, I believe that this is perfectly normal.
Some come to us with romantic ideas, and if they find that they have two times a week of sample, have to complete preparatory phases and spend a lot of time on concert trips, then the enthusiasm with many loses quickly.
That's how it works everywhere, in every band that wants to work seriously and achieve something.
The Tap Tap currently has twenty members.
How many of them were there from the beginning, i.e. since 1998?
It's just one thing: Láða Angelovič.
We're an open group, people come and go, you can't stop that.
Whoever has the will and the desire to participate is always welcome with us.
Takes place on the day before the forecast world downfall, Thursday 20.12.2012 at 9 p.m.
The venues are: Incheba-Arena/Prag, Fléda/Brno and Plynojem/Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
All three venues are finally connected by live-scircling and there is a common interpretation of the hymn "Weltgang falls off" of the band The Tap Tap.
The aim of the concert is to provide the resources for the provision of a multifunctional disabled education centre, which is to be established under the name STUDEO at the Jedlička Institute in Prague. Cost: CZK 25 million
Admission costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years free of charge, tickets are available in advance at Bohemia Ticket.
Poland and space.
Last week, Poland was admitted to a Council of Ministers meeting of the member countries of the European Space Agency (ESA) as the 20th member of this space authority. Poland is the second member country from the former eastern block (after the Czech Republic, which became ESA member on 12 November 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated in several ESA projects in the following years.
The path of Poland into space obviously began much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, Polish cosmos enthusiasts were already engaged in space, and they did not always come to understand it.
For example, I am reminded of the presentation by A. Šternfeld of 6 December 1933 in the Warsaw Observatory, where the author presented thoughts from his pioneer work "Entry to Cosmonautics".
However, the ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the listeners cold, and after years Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
Šternfeld won the Prix REP-Hirsch, which was donated by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch in 1934.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became an important advocate of astronomy and space.
In Polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski's world-renowned contribution to the development of space was honoured, among other things, by the fact that one of the craters on the face of the moon was named after him.
In 1925, a railway-draisine was built in Poland, for which a rocket-powered engine was planned.
Unfortunately, the author of the draft and the details of this project remained unknown.
It is not even clear whether the rocket should be used to launch or brake the draisine.
The information is exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry began to deal with rocket-powered missiles.
The research carried out by the Institut Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
It is clear from the documents submitted that research had been carried out to the stage of practical tests.
The research was of course interrupted by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937 the technical press appeared in the design of a photoelectric hunting rocket from Rohoziński, and in the following year the work "Rakieta - torpeda powietzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" was published by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky.
Both projects were concerned with the military use of the rocket drive.
Shortly before the war, all the projects for the military use of rocket technology were coordinated by the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Committee Doradczo-Naukowy).
The Committee was set up in 1937, but after two years of activity its work was completed from the beginning of the war.
Further articles on space were published in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Space Society (Polishe Towarzystwo Astronautczne).
The first mention of this society was made in 1954 in the November issue of the magazine Problemy, in which four extensive articles of space are devoted.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal to set up a space society.
At the time, there were already the first projects on satellite technology, and it was a good idea that the exploration of space would have the future.
Already in its beginnings in 1956, the Polish Space Society PTA sought to join the International Space Federation, which was founded in 1951, and in fact the PTA became a regular member already in autumn 1956.
The following year the first PTA chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), was appointed chairman of the International Space Federation.
He had this office until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has played a major role in the development of the highly successful meteorological missile (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish rocket for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
The rocket with a maximum flight height of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and did not weigh quite 5 kg.
Later, an improved version, the RM-1A, was built, and in 1959 a flight test with the two-step rocket RM-2 began in the Błődów desert.
The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another stage of development should already be able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should reach an altitude of up to 14.5 km and be used for monitoring altitude winds.
In 1962, however, further development was halted.
The first rocket of the type RM was replaced by the meteor-1 rocket developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket, its total length was 510 cm and the starting weight was 32,5 kg.
Three types were developed of this rocket (meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differed in the size of the transport space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A rocket has a transport room with a capacity of 0.4 litres, Meteor-1B over 0.34 litres and Meteor-1C over 0.62 litres.
The maximum flight altitude for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor 2 rocket was developed in the aviation institute, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a take-off weight of 380 kg and was able to transport a payload of 10 kg at an altitude of about 60 km.
The versions Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were then built.
It is also worth mentioning the accession of Poland to the COPPAR (Commission for Space Research) in 1960, followed by the establishment of a National COPPAR Committee two years later.
Poland also participated in space research with Soviet satellites as part of the Intercosmos programme, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became second interkosmonaut after the Czech Vladimír Remek.
The repeal of the Law on Non-profit Works is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court lifted the Law on Non-profit Works.
This decision aroused a lively discussion in the public.
It is certainly interesting to look at the problem from a broader perspective.
The liberalised economic systems in the EU and in the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the final effect, this means that the individual economies are in a permanent conflict.
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and the free, unlimited movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with careless financial speculations.
Due to the large differences in the value of labour (salts) there are price tensions.
This term shall be understood as a condition in which the manufacturer tries to exist in economic competition through imports of cheap goods, by "undercutting" the competition, thereby taking a greater market share and increasing its profits.
On a large scale, this means, for most companies, that they move their production abroad or buy it cheaply, or give up their business. The result is high unemployment in countries with comparable high labour costs.
As private capital does not bear any social responsibility or therefore no responsibility for the unemployment caused by it, public expenditure necessarily increases.
This situation is reinforced by the fact that the gentlemen are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and thereby replace the overall economic and social damage caused by them.
This situation is generally known so that concrete statistics are unnecessary at this point.
In the individual economies, the reckless practice of private capital creates a situation in which governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own population and thus attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, governments deliver private capital to their own people without regard to the social consequences.
This is particularly reflected in changes to existing laws.
The aim of these measures is to force their own people to accept the private capital dictatorship, particularly in the wage sector.
On the one hand, this is done through economic compulsion in the event of long-term unemployment, on the other hand by the circumcision of workers' rights.
The result is growing poverty, as well as increasing differences between the poor and the rich.
In Germany, there have been public food tax offices for the poor for some years now, which are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work.
The number of people involved is already going to the millions.
In the course of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there are cases where workers receive such a low wage that the state must increase its income to a minimum of existence.
Such a scandal was also revealed in the case of auxiliary forces employed in the German Bundestag.
There is no doubt that the savings measures in practically all the EU-South countries will go to the same situation where people are forced to emigrate under the pressure of a catastrophic crash of their social level (as was the case in the 19th century) or to pay for a hunger wage on the edge of society, hoping that sometime private investment capital will flow into the country.
Here, of course, the question arises as to where this capital comes from?
When it comes from another EU country, poverty only migrates from one country to another; or capital remains completely out of place, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt or Africa, employees work for a fraction of European wages at all.
This concerns Latin America as a whole.
Liberal theories and media claim that the state is not allowed to participate in its own economy with capital, and that planning economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital insists closely on its view that the state should not intervene in the economy.
But then you have to ask yourself whether private capital does not influence politics and thus the whole state in its own selfish sense or even direct it.
Here is the clear answer: Yes.
The proof of this is the existence of a virtually all - powerful lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, mutual prejudice, legislation in which virtually everything is rigid, but nothing punishable.
In Germany, the situation is such that in the absence of finance, a State Ministry of Finance is tasked with the development of legislative drafts by legal entities that are closely interconnected with the industry.
These draft laws will then be passed in the Bundestag.
All violence then ceases from the people, as the Western constitutions announce, but from strong financial groups that prefer their own interests.
Evidently, the liberal democracies are now rapidly entering a situation as described by Appian in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic at the time of Caesar and Pompeius: "The state has long been in decay, and the offices have been occupied with violence.
Against lubricating money, through illegal removal of advantages or with stone and sword.
The corruption grew incorruptible, and the people went to election with already bought voices" ... "People with character did not apply for offices, so that the state had no consul for eight months as a result of this decline" ... "One really started to talk about the only medicine in this difficult situation being a sole rule, and that a strong man had to be elected"... Appian thought of Pompeius, but the strong man was then Caesar, who permanently replaced democracy with the sole rule.
As can be seen, today's society, as in ancient times, is based on the reckless preference of its own advantage, without paying attention to the interests of society as a whole.
Private capital is already unable to recognize and enforce the advantage for society as a whole from its very nature.
The result today, as at the time, is an unprecedented decadence of the elites, who do not strive in the least for deeper reforms.
We must therefore look for the cause of the rise of fascism and communism in the reckless liberalisation of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
From today's point of view, the demise of these regimes in favour of liberal democracies can be seen as a certain break in which the next round is already taking place.
Especially disastrous is the fact that today's elites face the possible losses of hundreds of thousands of lives in the future, the humanitarian and social disasters of which we are already witnesses, as well as the crimes against humanity, as we know them from the older and more recent history, in perfect ignorance.
The repeal of the law on non-profit work is not a solution here, at least not a permanent one.
Under the pressure of global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to push down the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore due to the system.
The only solution is targeted political and social reforms that increase the state's capital participation in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society in favour of the state.
Israel: Laboratory of Chaos.
"...that nothing arises from violence or could ever arise" sings Sting in the song Fragile, whose most important verse in the chorus is "...that we may not forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons didn't want wars, there would be none," says the dying Good Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there were, as always, a number of reactions.
One is behind Israel and argues with its right to self-defense, while the Palestinians are called terrorists; the other, in turn, support the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the Israeli state, with the genocide committed by the Palestinian Arabs and call the State of Israel terrorist.
At this point I do not want to write about who is in the constantly recurring waves of the killer and who is victims; in the end, today's inhabitants of Israel, including the self-government territories, were born into the current political situation and did not experience the beginning of violence itself.
I am concerned about opening the eyes of the readers behind the scenes, looking at who the 95 years of tension (as from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small spot country in the Middle East are especially useful.
My thoughts are partly based on accessible historical facts, others are derived from them, and I understand that who or what group of people significantly influences the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is primarily a story of the struggle for power.
In every epoch we can make up an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
That which is less apparent is the question whether it was really always these personalities themselves who determined their steps autonomously, or whether there was someone behind their throne who directed their actions towards a predetermined goal.
We must admit that we are living in a time when the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hands of fewer individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power has not arisen within the life span of a generation.
Among these astronomically rich families there is a particularly prominent one that could be described as the head of the crack (I don't know if someone is standing above them, but I don't exclude this) - the Rothschilds.
Much is not written about them.
Understandably.
The first press agency (Reuters) was bought by the Rothschilds as early as the 1990s in order to stop the connection of its name with highly criminal acts, in whose background always stood the consolidation of its power, the increase of its wealth, or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all the central banks of the world, and against the countries in which they are not involved in the central banks they wage wars or prepare themselves for them (before the attack on Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq there were 5 countries, after the fall Ghaddafis remained only four, Russia being the central bank of the Russian government in the meantime).
Whoever tried to oppose this family had to pay for it with life.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew Rothschild's Bank of America's status as a central bank, began to issue his own (state) banknotes during the Civil War and was murdered in a theatre in 1865.
J.F. Kennedy began to issue his own banknotes and wanted to abolish the FED - he was murdered in 1963; Member Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after trying to sue the FED for causing the global economic crisis in 1929.
In the years 1859 - 1871, the Rothschild's global desire for power led to the formulation of a plan for the decommissioning of three world wars by Albert Pik, a Freemason of the 33rd and thus highest degree of knowledge.
The first war had the goal of eliminating the great monarchist states of Europe, by the second war in particular the colonial rule of Britain should be broken, and the third war should reduce the world population to about 0.5 - 1 billion people (such a number would provide its amenities and its luxury and would not consume so many resources), create a universal religion (ecumenicalism here is nothing more than the precursor) and ultimately lead to the takeover of absolute power.
The method with which the group of richest families works with the Rothschilds is the triggering of a crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution (order from chaos - order from chaos).
However, these solutions are wrong and always lead to worsening of the situation (see the establishment of the FED so that crises such as those caused by them in 1907 do not repeat).
After they succeeded in triggering the First World War through the murder of the Habsburg Throne of Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the Russian Tsar Empire by the Bolshevik Revolution.
The First World War ended with the sudden, military and economically unfounded capitulation of Germany (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of the Russian Tsar Empire), and the resolution of the Central European great power of Austria-Hungary followed.
In order to make the Second World War easier, the bankers created a latent conflict situation through politics by filling Germany with huge war repairs, thus creating the condition of impoverished masses, so that they only had to cheer under the Germans a sufficiently strong leader who offered the guilty named and simple solutions; another factor was the creation of the multi-national state of Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which was to take over the function of a fifth column and also to fuel the fire of war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds initiated the founding of the Zionist movement in which a branch sought the establishment of a Jewish state, as far as possible in the historical territory of Judea with Jerusalem as capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour declaration already mentioned created the prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; there were first conflicts with the resident Arab population.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler was tearing away from the chain in which the international bankers initially held him, or whether everything was going according to plan, it is difficult to estimate, in any case, the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the prerequisite for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and just as the war repairs against Germany prepared the ground for the Second World War, the proclamation of the state of Israel represents the creation of the focal point for the Third World War.
If the international bankers succeed in unleashing this war, the Jewish people will become victims in the front line of the battle, this time along with the Arab and Muslim populations of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of strife and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (you only think about how keen people divide themselves into followers and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim in the conflict between the Palestinians and the Israelites, where injustice only triggers injustice in an endless spiral of violence, with the greed of individuals and their striving for global power at the beginning?
It is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leadership, but the international bankers in Israel, as well as with us, the people, make their own choice.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, the Falke Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascism-sensitive politician loyal to the international bankers, who does everything to open up a war with Iran, which, in the face of Iran's membership in the Shanghai Organization for Cooperation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), could quickly extend to a global conflict, and in which, because of Iran's control over the only 2 miles wide road of Hormus, over 20% of the world's oil supplies, could result in a destruction of the world economy.
In what light are the words of David Rockefeller from 1994: "The only thing we need is an all-encompassing crisis, and people will welcome the new world order."
In its imagination, the new world order is a world of lords and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves a small group of financial aristocratics.
A world in which each newborn is implanted at birth a chip in order to subject this being to total control.
"And it does cause the little ones and the great, the rich and the poor, the free and the servants all to give themselves a mark to their right hand or to their forehead, that no one can buy or sell, then he has the sign, namely the name of the animal or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom; he who has understanding, let him consider the number of the beast.
For it is a human number, and its number is six hundred and sixty-six."
The movie Argo: When it's worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a Mob of protesting Islamic students occupied the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats as hostages.
For their release, they demanded the extradition of the fallen Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled to the USA after the revolution, who had kept the Patronate over his regime for decades.
There was no positive way out of this situation for the American government - it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, since this would have caused massive damage to the trust of its allies in other countries.
At the same time, it was unable to enforce the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution resulted in the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was a severe blow to the call of the united states, and the subsequent Fiasco in the violent attempt of hostage liberation made everything worse.
Finally, after 444 days of negotiations by the Algerian government, the diplomats were released.
The fate of the hostages caused at home a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian moods.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to the defeat of Jimmy Carter against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film Argo of the director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story that gave the USA a small partial victory.
Immediately before the occupation of the message, six ambassadors managed to flee.
It ended after numerous complications at the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
In cooperation with the Canadian authorities, the CIA succeeded in bringing refugees from Iran, helping them with an extravagant story to hide their true identity - they traveled with Canadian passports camouflaged as members of a film staff who supposedly visited film locations in the country for a science fiction film.
Combination of the genres
The plan developed by the expert for "Exfiltation", Tony Mendez, also required the cooperation of Hollywood.
In order to make the camouflage credible, articles on this film project appeared in technical journals, press conferences were held, and the fictitious production company had a real office.
The details of this operation were kept secret for a long time. The film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a special combination of several film genres.
On the one hand, he is a realistic political thriller, but at the same time a so-called "Caper Movie", i.e. the story of a successful Husar piece such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
Thus, the levels of mood change in the film - on the one hand, the documentary scenes from Tehran (in the title sequence, iconic contemporary photographs are shown, and there are no major differences in the film version of the same situations).
On the other hand, the looser passages from Hollywood, which come ironically and slightly overstretched.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at the meeting table, on the office floor, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has achieved a remarkable re-start of his career with this film.
From a smiled actor he has become a respectable director, and as an actor he is now no longer the goal of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after the crime No children's game (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the Thriller City without grace (2010).
At the same time, it's Affleck's first film that doesn't play in the director's home Boston.
The feeling for the atmosphere of the place was one of the characteristics that removed the previous films of this director from the standard Hollywood.
Affleck also proves this feeling in Argo, where Tehran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film play in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that really took place - the opening sequence of the first storming of the message is very impressive in its clarity, but nevertheless conveys the feeling of confusion and unpredictability that occurs when history moves somewhere.
Affleck also has a similar effect with his team in fictitious scenes (the wrong film staff on a bazaar in Tehran).
Too much action in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that history does not actually offer many exciting scenes in the cinematic sense.
But with the few, he works quite successfully, sometimes helping reality a little - which does not always work so elegantly (the scenes in which the threatening crisis at the airport in Tehran is turned off by a telephone call in America, or also the pursuit of the runway, seem somewhat artificial).
The weakness of Argo is its all too wide scatter, which is due to the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, but their figures deserve more space, and they are far from alone in the film.
Affleck’s film thus loses a bit of tensile strength. It is a film that can be followed with a certain interest and the design and the retro style reminiscent of a thriller from the 70th years.
However, he is very much invigorating.
However, as a reminder of a piece of history still alive in a certain way and as evidence of how the notions of the omnipotent and omniscient intelligence services were overlaid, he is sufficient.
Guidelines for inflating balloons, bananas and circuses
This year, the www.bankovnipoplatky.com server, which issues an annual survey on the most absurd bank charges, decided to organise the competition "Absurdest regulation or idea from the EU workshop".
"This idea brought us the plan recently presented by the EU to introduce a 40% women's rate in the management of large European companies," said Patrik Nacher, who is responsible for organising this survey, to the newspaper Právo.
Among the nominated absurdities are, for example, the European Court of Justice's judgment on the harmonization of insurance rates for men and women.
Until then, women enjoyed an advantage in life insurance because they represent a lower risk for insurance companies.
"More incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The vote will take place by the end of February 2013", said Nacher.
The controversial EU regulations include, among other things, the binding addition of bioethanol to fuels which, in their consequence, are natural, the prohibition of reliable mercury thermometers, only because they contain a relatively small amount of such hazardous substances, or also the directive on the size of chicken cages, which made eggs much more expensive this year.
Criticism has also gained in the past the factual ban on the use of the term "butter spread" or the ban on selling conventional light bulbs.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU-apparat often decides under the pressure of this or that lobby from trade and industry, whose claims are usually represented in Brussels by one or more Member States (for example, the Czech Republic is currently trying to enforce the demands of Czech banks by veto threat).
Lobby interests also argued that bananas of the highest class of trade in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and must not have "currency anomalies".
The European Commission defended itself with the argument that it merely harmonises the uneven national standards that would hinder trade.
The EU's standards of fruit and vegetables against the resistance of some countries have already been eroded by the fact that the previous directives would lead to food waste.
A candidate for the victory in this survey may be the EU regulation of last year, which, according to balloons, must be notified when selling that children under eight years of age are not allowed to blow up the balloon without the supervision of an adult.
The EU called for an American study that according to balloons is the leading cause of child suffocation.
A similar restriction already applies to children up to 14 years of age in the use of annual market tortoises.
Curiosity is also present at home
Relatively absurd is also a directive concerning European officials themselves - anyone who has an official role in the EU should not use the name Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the issue to Greece and must instead say FYROM (Former Yugoslavialv Republic of Macedonia).
In cooperation with the Association of Liberal Economists Laissez Faire, the Bankovnípoplatky.com server nominated the EU Regulation on the scope of food supplies in the field of a Member State.
The EU thus set the maximum level of food supplies that may have been in the Czech Republic on the day of our accession.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the fixed volume of mushroom canned, which threatened us with a high fine.
The survey organizers were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for not having a sea, or by the idea of providing funding for applications for grants.
These ideas were of course not from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are disadvantaged by having no sea.
We will request reimbursement from the EU," said Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) then Minister of Agriculture in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he argued that the cereal harvest had been very high and the state camps were overcrowded as a result of the so-called intervention purchases.
As the Czech Republic has another way to seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros, according to Palas.
The European Commission finally met the Czech Republic so far as to organise a tender for the purchase of cereals from countries which do not have access to the sea.
Grants for applications for grants were offered to the municipalities by the Ministry of Regional Development under the direction of Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), which should be the means of setting up applications for funding to Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
Although regulations will easily become the target of criticism in the Member States, the EU's efforts to regulate and thus also the effectiveness and development of the European Union as a whole, some experts believe that they are more worthy of recognition.
In the opinion of these experts, a more serious problem is the EU funding for projects that have nothing to do with the deepening of European integration, but which have been forced to do so in the budgetary negotiations of individual Member States.
Emotions also highlight the fact that, like other Member States in Brussels, the Czech Republic must fight for the right to use specific names of traditional products and not always win this fight.
Although the Czech Republic was able to defend the name "Olomoucké tvarůžky" after a six-year struggle with Germany and Austria, the domestic centre (Tuzemský rum), whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, our manufacturers had to rename it to "Tuzemák".
The term rum may only be used for products from sugar cane distillate, not for products from sugar beet.
In the official list of products registered in the EU, the Karlovysbader Zwieback, Karpfen from Pohořelice and Třeboň, or the Saazer Hopfen appear in the company of the world-famous cheese varieties Feta and Gorgonzola, Lübeck Marzipans or Parma ham.
With an EU brand, the Pardubicer gingerbread or the Hořic rolls can brag.
"People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur," Okamura claims.
Mr Senator, how do you get the idea of running for the President's office?
It's not about being Senator or President.
If everything worked in our country without problems, I would not run anywhere.
But I can no longer see how the Republic has been looting for 20 years, how thieves are running free, while people are increasing taxes and retirement age.
I had no ambitions to become a politician.
But if I see something that I do not like, I try to propose a solution to change it.
And since I am already over 40, and independent and partyless, I have no other way to influence things than to run for the office of a Senator or the President.
In the Senate you made it and then you made your way to the castle.
Don't you turn your back on your voters?
I have always told myself that I will start the struggle for the castle after the result of the Senate elections.
Later, I specified this and said that I would run for the President's office, provided I was elected Senator.
My goal, however, is not the function. The function is an instrument with which I can realize my visions.
For this I need as much influence as possible and a strong mandate as possible.
The difficulty, however, is not only that we, as a people in the pub and in front of the TV, make everyone want to change something.
In addition, the media, who want to rob you of honor, and who confuse the freedom of the word with freedom.
About me, for example, it was claimed that I would bribe journalists or that I was a consultant to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your visions.
You have taken up the struggle for the castle with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians as well as with retroactive statements of assets over 20 million crowns.
To do this, you need to change laws.
As President, you have no competences in this respect, and only the Senate as a whole can bring in legislative proposals.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I have worked to ensure that the guide remains a free trade, and this could be enforced.
The problem is small-spirited policy - if someone comes from the right or from the left with a good proposal, it is deliberately rejected, and that only stops the population.
As an independent partyless person, I have a far greater potential to gain support from all parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that without drawer thinking and party dogma, I can take from every party what is best for our country.
Do you see yourself as a human being in politics on the right or on the left?
From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people see me more on the left.
For me, however, this right-left thinking is completely irrelevant.
It's important to me that we move on.
It's not about whether someone belongs to the left or the right camp; I want to connect people.
I publicly support every good solution, even if it comes from the KSČM or the ODS, and I will also turn against bad ideas.
You don't mind if someone calls you populists.
But don't you confirm that by what you just said?
If you are setting up a business plan in a company, you also have an ideal destination and a vision.
And you want to get closer to this one.
I can call this populism, but all the proposals I have spoken about are already working in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without support in Parliament, you will only be left with keywords.
And in the long term, you won't get far in politics.
Or do you think that if you talk to the people for a long time enough, you will succeed, for example, in asserting the material and criminal liability?
I have no other way.
To convince politicians, journalists and the public and to try to bring them to our side in order to achieve these goals.
As President, it would not be a problem for me to ask the chairmen of the parliamentary parties live on television to lay down the material and criminal liability of politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And the addresses would have to say, if necessary, why they reject this.
A strong personality pointing to abuse can exert pressure on the political scene.
Just once take the direct election of the President, who was a merit of public pressure.
I say quite clearly that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my views and visions.
I have just started with politics and I am trying to find support for my programme for the majority.
I always try to judge things myself; and if it does not work, I will return to the private sector in six years.
That sounds a little bit like Okamura was supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know I can't do anything on my own, so I talked to several well-known personalities about whether they don't want to run for the Senate.
For example, I spoke to Radim Jančura, who, however, refused because of labour congestion.
In addition, I supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who found the fraud in trading light fuel oil.
I started my candidate with the condition that people are deeply dissatisfied, but now I am no longer sure.
Sixty per cent of the electorate did not go to the elections at all, and those who have gone have mostly elected representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independent people.
People have chosen such a Senate composition that changes will be very difficult to enforce.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, e.g. for the direct election of mayors and district heads.
Do you think about the establishment of a party of your own?
I haven't thought about it yet because I don't have time to review the past of any potential party member, and I don't have the money for it at all.
I don't even have money for the presidential campaign yet; in my transparent account there are only 20,000 CZK.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about asset statements, what do you look like?
I estimate my private assets to be around CZK 60 million.
In Prague I have a property worth 25 million, an apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection worth about 10 million, as well as an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Škodu Superb worth about one million. And then I have a few million on the account.
The Aston Martin was a children's dream by the way - James Bond always liked how he drove in the car, was gallant to women and fought evil at the same time.
You drive an Aston Martin, have a fortune of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to invest your own money in it.
That's not exactly convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Should I make a debt?
I've already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have sponsors shows that my program probably doesn't arouse too much interest.
And I am not obliged to challenge the campaign from my own resources.
The cost of the campaign is basically covered by my salary as a senator.
But I couldn't live from senator's salary alone; for example, I couldn't finance the English school that costs 30,000 a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I wouldn't run for anything.
So are you continuing to work as an entrepreneur to have your income?
Didn't you say you're going back to these activities?
But that's not related to the amount of salary.
As promised, I partially withdrew my activities.
For example, my deputy will be managing director of the travel agency in spring.
People want to see me as Samaritans who save the Republic.
But I have to live on something.
Which monthly income were you used to as an entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and that is still the case.
As President, I would, however, completely stop my business.
The full conversation can be found in the Saturday edition of Právo.
The MVRDV architects prove that the true adventures are not just in the head - from the example of nails and the recently built Buchenberg - 2 photos
"I find the building funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there's something interesting to see again," says Lisette Verhaig, a passantin on the edge of the street.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a large business nearby, says, "Well, it's beautiful, the house."
But I wonder what we need a bookstore for today.
All have internet, iPad and e-books.
No human goes to one of these old-style libraries today, right?
Spijkenis, a sleep town that is hardly in need of a visit in front of the gates of Rotterdam, is a unique record holder.
The 80,000-inhabitant community has the lowest education rate in the Netherlands.
A few years ago, in order to counteract this stupid circumstance, it was decided to contribute to general education and to rebuild the seven fictitious bridges shown on the euro notes as beautifully painted concretes.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And so the city fathers realized that there was only one way to become a master of statistics: a library must come here!
Winy Maas from the Rotterdam architectural office MVRDV, master of the great bar graphs and producer of funny, yes often cynical buildings, took the matter with familiar serenity and appeared for the competition hearing anno 2003 with five books under the arm and a grins on the face.
And while the jury was still stunned to look around and tangled with the axles, the naughty Maas stacked his exquisite comrades of the size into a pyramid and finished his actionistically supported speech with the words: "Dear Town Community!"
So this is my proposal for the Book Mountain of Spijkenis, for the so-called Buchenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million euros of expensive mountain has been laid up.
It is part of a revitalisation project, including underground garage, supermarket, post office and a few adjacent residential and row houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Buchenberg was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
This is the faceless small town resorts, which until now had no more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and an incomprehensibly ugly town hall, behind whose white facades one would be inclined to suspect a dairy factory in order to make a piece of contemporary architecture richer.
Above all, however, there is now the first public cultural building in the history of its existence.
The Long Way to Book
The first impression: Bucheldorado under cheese bell.
There is a lift that leads through the mountain massif in the middle of the mountain, but the true delights of space and reading open up in the walking climb of topography.
The all-glassed interior is bright and clear, the burnt clinker floor and the elegant lanterns speak indisputably the language of a public city square.
The urban ambience is perfect.
You're already looking for park bench, dog and football boys and girls.
And books, books, books everywhere.
"Normally, the bookshelfs stand along the facade, and in the middle lies a large, dark room, which is mostly uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We've put the classic room configuration on the head and turned the reading area from the inside to the outside.
The interior of the Buchenberg is skillfully used: in the middle are offices, internet library, chess club, environmental center and house engineering centre.
A special pleasure are the black bookshelfs, which are sometimes wall covering, sometimes brimstone, sometimes climbing gels.
Optics, hapticism and smell are strange.
Even incarcerated architects and construction engineers shake the head of the unknown building material.
"We wanted to work with recycling materials here," explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality of Spijkenis, on request of the standard.
And so one day we found a suitable waste product from agriculture in a French farm.
For many years in the Netherlands, one millimeter thin plastic fleece has been used in greenhouses and fields.
This is cheap and time-efficient.
The thin textile holds, two seasons, after which it is ripe for the bulk.
For the library, the nonwoven - for the first time in these quantities - was pressed to four centimeters thick plates.
Under heat and pressure, the so-called Agroplastic (KLP) discolors itself to a dark, homogeneous, loadable material, which smells a bit of new cars and a bit of sports shoe.
After 105 steps you reach the summit.
At the end of the almost 500 meters long hiking trip, you will not only be rewarded with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquets and potted ficus trees.
They provide atmosphere, but above all they provide the right humidity in the literary mountains.
Donation for the New Soul
"One would not believe it, but this house, despite its many glass surfaces, is a demonstration project in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.
Heated and cooled with heat.
Although the Buchberg is under a glass crash, the sun itself shines into the inside on sunny days only briefly.
The wide wooden glue binders, which stand across the glass facade, serve as a shade and absorb much of the sunlight.
The room climate is very pleasant.
The rest are done fully automatic rollos.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptics from the IT industry, already ventured to the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who even calls the Buchenberg a cuneiform "long-overdue soul".
The reason: For the opening a few weeks ago, every resident was invited to donate a book from his personal inventory.
For the time being, the optical gaps in the library - currently 70,000 pieces - are to be filled.
The concept has gone up.
The shelves are filled to the top.
"Nothing is worse than a semi-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation, every resident has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it's just for the decoration.
MVRDV has thus succeeded in the kingly discipline that is called the Factjargon Identity Foundation.
Cuneiforms has written literary history.
So young and uneducated she may be.
This is finally a starting point for identity.
Szabo: "Germans have to play a bigger role"
Germany has abstained in the vote on the reception of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, expert on US-European relations, Berlin thus balances at a narrow diplomatic level.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had initially signaled that it would vote against the application for an observer status of the Palestinians in the United Nations.
But then there was Berlin.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.
However, Germany must be careful due to its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don't think it supports the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to setting up a flight ban zone.
This was finally enforced by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on important international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because it is precisely changing its foreign policy away from a policy, which was, so to speak, managed by the US, towards a German foreign policy.
Furthermore, it is difficult for Europeans not to have a coherent and uniform policy.
The Germans thus find themselves between the fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they still have a bearing on their role, but they are on the way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy as they have France or the UK.
What does a "normal" foreign policy mean from the point of view of Germany?
It shows the willingness to take positions in national interests that are independent of those of the US or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. from exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of the other great powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests affected the attitude of the Middle East conflict and the UN vote?
On the one hand, Germany has large sales markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf States.
Therefore, it must be careful not to hit the public, but also the elites, in the Arab countries.
That certainly plays a role.
But I wouldn't want to give it too much weight either, that's not a completely one-sided relationship.
But it definitely plays an important role in German considerations.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the US by abstaining from the vote on important decisions, for example in the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe and even in the USA there is great understanding of the German position.
That is why I do not believe that this was such a dramatic break as in the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany will even play a certain role in this respect.
After all, it signals that as an international player it must be taken seriously and its interests should be considered.
There are different opinions on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The United States, on the other hand, has clearly voted in favour of a veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the US and many European nations?
Because of American domestic policy, these differences have always existed.
I believe that under Obama, the government may secretly have a lot of understanding of the European position.
But because of the political situation here, the government cannot, of course, represent this position publicly.
I think that the actual disagreements are not as big as they always appear.
If you look at the relations between Obama and Prime Minister Netanjahu, Obama is not so excited about Netanya's politics.
Is it difficult for Germany to agree its close relations with Israel and the USA on the one hand, and the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other?
I think that's what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
It would, of course, be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, which is not the case at present.
So they can't be part of a wider line and instead have to push things out of their own position.
That's what they're doing with the euro.
I believe that in the future, Germany will play a leading role in pushing Europe into a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, because of the relationship with Israel.
It's always been a sensitive subject.
But I believe that the Germans are aware that they have to play a more independent role.
Does Germany itself see itself in the role as an important international player - does Germany want to play a major role at all?
Or does Germany still have a hard lead role to play?
Germany is not yet used to it, it is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a bigger role.
For example, if we look at the euro crisis, then every time Germany takes on a larger role, various anti-German feelings become free.
That doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
This is actually the old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
Thus, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the USA.
It must be receptive to different neighbours and opinions and that is not easy.
Now the influence of the US in European policy is constantly decreasing, but the EU is currently filling this vacuum, who else is there?
The Germans will just have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, it's unpleasant and it makes them much more unpopular - c'est la vie!

"Market Protection" in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a well-known brand, Polo Ralph Lauren.
But what is Armani Polo?
There is a name which is officially registered in China, but which has nothing to do with the companies of origin.
Nevertheless, it enjoys protection for as long as the actual names don't complain.
And even then, it's not clear whether they're getting right.
"It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, lawyer at Taylor Wessing, who specializes in property infringements in Fernando.
Every week a new case ends up on my desk.
The imitators already have a few additional letters enough to allow them to register their brands.
So Gucci is simply Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada you can enter Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied in this way, such as the sports goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with entries of the trademark office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company had the trademark Zegna DF Puma protected, an art name that was also used by the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
The fact that the Chinese world champions are in the copying and the injured intellectual property is known.
In the big cities there are multistorey department stores that sell almost exclusively fakes.
But Pattloch's cases are different: On behalf of his clients, he argues that Chinese companies are officially entitled to use a name that is already protected elsewhere from the brand office.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai", a passenger brand.
The word is based on "Bang Dakuan".
This means women fishing for rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt
"This is harmful to business, you have to fight it," says Pattloch.
"The brand is watered down, the single setting disappears, the image damage is enormous."
The financial failures and the process costs of the sectors concerned go to the millions, especially in the case of expensive products.
According to the market research company CLSA, China with a volume of 15 billion euros per year is the third largest market for luxury products and the fastest growing.
However, deletions of dubios entries in the trademark register are difficult to achieve and go into money.
For up to nine years, the procedure can be carried out with uncertainty.
Pattloch reports on cases where the court rejected actions because, after the long term of the contested name, it had become a "marketability".
If the complainant was in a bad mood, he would even have to pay the Plagiator money because he violated his brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes the law of the jungle prevails here.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009 Daimler lost a legal dispute with the construction machine manufacturer Sany, the company that recently took over the German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
The Chinese can therefore still use an emblem similar to the Mercedes star.
The Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue-and-white logo that reminded of BMW; the dispute was simpled, Geely had to change it.
The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China to imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore who had the famous crocodile looked in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
The CTMO brand office in Beijing admits that there were bottlenecks there in 2010 due to too little personnel and space equipment.
Last year, however, one had returned to normality from the "necessary situation in the course of the work".
Thus, the inventory of unprocessed opposition proceedings had fallen by 22 percent.
Nearly 57,000 such cases have been concluded, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 oppositions still await completion in the office.
A great deal of effort is being made to address this problem.
As so often in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than 2010.
This is a record and means that for the tenth time in a row, China has launched the list of new applications around the world, the Authority reports.
This was also true for the stock of all valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan had been taken of fees.
This means that each application on average costs 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
Approaching it costs a lot, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the Group has been fighting a Chinese plagiator.
Although the Germans were able to achieve the removal of their illegal manufacturing of imitated motor vehicles.
But the imitator continued to secure the Chinese rights of the Freudenberg brand.
One has failed to do so, since family names could not be protected in Germany, says Hanno Wentzler, Chairman of the Management Board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO brand office rejected Munich’s opposition.
In the next two instances, Freudenberg was right, but the opponent continues to fight to this day.
You have to watch out for yourself.
Now the case is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a good conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "The procedure is extremely complicated and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs could hardly be estimated that the company's archive had to look through even a hundred-year-old files in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg offered the opposite in vain a "high six-digit euro amount" for settlement.
"That's how much we're worth," says Wentzler.
The dangers in the Far East are even threatening to come back to Europe.
That is, if imitators secure unprotected brands there.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
The Group has long given up this business, but he has been able to refuse registration.
"You have to be very careful," says Wentzler.
He and the lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be very careful in business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights, but the foreigners should also "register all that is worth protecting in China", as Wentzler says.
Otherwise this can become much more expensive than registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg was in the last act of his brand drama, you would probably have to pay the opposite license fees for your own name, Wentzler explains.
Or we are pushed out of the market in the segment in question.
World AIDS day: stamping, singing, helping
In Heidelberg, the choir imbongi - and in Swaziland, AIDS orphans are happy about it.
The story of a connection that overcomes far more than 8733 kilometers.
First of all, there is the stamping: Cowboy boots, basketball shoes, ladies' pumps and men's slippers are looking for a beat on the parquet floor, find it quickly.
One-two-three-four.
Only then do the voices of the singers slowly waver - old, bass, tenor and soprano - intimidating, embarrassing and persecuting themselves.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, almost lifts it from his fabric shoes when he brings it together with his smooth wild gestures.
It is Monday evening, in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the choir imbongi is testing a new song.
The fifty singers have come, between the ages of 23 and 69, from the human geneticist to the houseman.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple piece, each choir voice has a different text and it is also in a very foreign language: Zulu, spoken of by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and and parts of Swaziland.
Aid for self-help
There are around 34 million HIV-infected people around the world, which is estimated by Unaids, the United Nations program to combat AIDS.
23.5 million of these live in South Africa.
In Swaziland, 245,000 AIDS orphans live.
More than 40 percent of the population are now HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni, the association Voices for Africa Paten has found in Germany.
70 of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can take over a sponsorship.
It guarantees the child school money, school uniform and a warm daily meal at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means accountants or praisers on Zulu.
The Bantu language fluently cannot speak in this room, but can sing.
For almost ten years, the choir has practiced songs in this foreign soft language and occasionally brings them back to where they originally came from: to the south of Africa.
For 8 733 kilometres of airline from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the voice of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected
About 2,000 people live there, some still in simple clay and straw huts, a large part of them are children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents, because they have died from the HI virus.
In Esitjeni, there is little evidence of what is happening in Swaziland: the highest rate of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy worldwide, according to Unicef.
Circumcisions of the male foreskin, which are shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, are hardly accepted by the population.
More than forty percent of the people in Swaziland carry the immunodeficiency virus, dying in the middle of thirty is not a rarity.
During a joint African trip in spring 2005, the choir discovered the village, but above all the imbongis saw many children on the streets, which were not only lacking in parental care, but simply in everything: food, clothing, education.
There is no chance in a poor country without schooling.
At the beginning it was still the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school for a few euros a year and to allow him a warm meal a day.
But just a year later, the choir founded the "Voices for Africa" association, which has been taking care of the AIDS-waisen in Esitjeni almost professionally since then.
Facts on sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and tripper (gonorrhea).
Common viral STIs are HIV, human papilomaviruses, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
Filzlauze and scratches belong to the parasitic STI.
Who are the main groups affected?
Syphilis and trippers occur especially in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute assumes that at least four out of five of the syphilis cases reported in Germany are transmitted through sexual contacts between men.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia infections, trichomonades, candiosis (pilz), tripper and human papilomaviruses are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults in this country is relatively low - nevertheless, about 20 percent of HIV new infections are related to this group.
Among adolescents, Chlamydia infections occur much more frequently than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people aged 15 to 25.
Human papilomaviruses are also common in young people in this area.
How did the number of infections develop?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to reporting.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has more than doubled from 1697 diseases in 2001 to 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of HIV new infections has declined since 2007.
In 2011, there were some 2,700 cases.
That's about a tenth less than the year before.
What are some symptoms of sexual illness?
The infectious diseases may cause ulcers in the genital area, problems in urinating, exodus, lower abdominal pain, bladders or warts.
However, they often do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condomes can reduce the risk of infection, but do not offer 100% protection.
In part, pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be passed on through lubricating infections and close contact with the body.
Therefore, experts especially recommend regular studies in frequently changing sex partners.
Early diagnosed, most STIs can be cured and later avoided.
Through sponsorships, donations, and not least the gagen that the choir sings throughout Germany, a lot comes together.
"In total, we have already sent some 200 000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, the president of the association.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident and persuasive woman, manages the funds from Germany.
She also makes sure that the orphans are well accommodated, for example, with one of the grandmothers.
The Gogos, as the old women on Zulu are called, are the support of the village.
Some of them have received up to 14 orphans, give them a roof over their heads, and make sure that the children appear in their uniforms every day on time to school.
Those who don't have anyone come to the shelter house to Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid by the club as much as the two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" has created a sewing school, built two chicken houses and organized together with the American health organization PSI that many in the village have had an HIV test done.
This is not a matter of course, because as obvious as the disease throughout the country is, it is best to keep silently dead.
A king with 14 wives
"Aids is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Actually strange in a country where the king officially holds 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for its excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, it is also due to this state sanctioned form of life that the HI virus has spread so rapidly over the past decades.
But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus through the country.
Free condoms are at every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they are hardly used.
The culture is another - Flesh to Flesh."
To promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels through the South of Africa every two or three years and sings songs full of pain, martial spirit, confidence and black self-confidence, which many know at the southern tip of the black continent from times of apartheid.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language - so much recognition not only brings mood and joy, but has already drained some gruesome border soldiers a few tears.
The trip always leads to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their children.
Even if you can hardly find the small village on maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni river it is more than known.
"Go to Esitjeni, there is the light" the people there say.
And if you return the 8733 kilometers of airline to Heidelberg, to the pounding singers in the test room on Bergheimer Straße, you can see it there too.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The probe messenger has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice cap may be up to 20 meters thick.
NASA has demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the sun, there is also frozen water there, as shown by three studies published on Thursday in Science magazine.
The Messenger has found evidence that there is an ice blanket in the permanently hidden region of the planet.
This should be at least 30 centimetres and possibly even up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably came from comets or possibly asteroids that have been hit on the Mercury.
No one connects the discovery of ice with the existence of life on the planet, said the chief scientist of the messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on the Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
The findings could, however, help to clarify how water and other building blocks of life have come into other areas of the solar system.
Unremarked by the earth's citizens, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix are exploring the depths of space.
From time to time, they send pictures to the Earth: Small holes in infinite widths.
The picture comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, who circles around the sun behind Neptune, after the new definition of the International Astronomical Union of 2006, Ceres is not a "planet".
This picture of an infrared recording of the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of uncounted star generations: The oldest stars can be seen as blue points, and the pink "newborn" in the starry circle are heavier to identify.
This star-forming region - called unromantic W5 by scientists - has discovered the telescope Spitzer in the constellation Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6500 light years.
This dazzling glow of a dying star has recorded the Spitzer telescope of the Nasa.
The donut-shaped ring consists of material that the star found out in the dying process.
In the huge Trifide Nebula, 5400 light years away from the Earth, new stars are created from gas and dust.
The Nasa's Spitzer telescope shot this photo of the galactic birthplace.
The Plejaden cluster, also called "The Seven Sisters", can be seen at night with the naked eye.
However, with the telescope the colours are better applied.
The Helix nebula looks like a red age in this infrared photo to the viewer.
It is located 700 light years away in the Aquarius constellation.
Its similarity with an earthly continent brought this fog into the name North America.
A combination of normal and infrared photo ensures spectacular coloring.
This baby star could only be recorded in its full beauty by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and his rings: how these came about is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
They may be the remains of a Saturn monde, which disappeared without trace 4,5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and sharpest recordings of the Hubble telescope: The Hot tub galaxy
Depending on coloring, images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The photo published by the European Southern Observatory shows the trifid nebula, several thousand light years away in the constellation Sagittarius.
The name Trifide comes from the Latin word trifidus (three-part, three-part) as dark dust strips the glowing heart of the star-birth site three-parts.
In the constellation snake carriers, astronomers have photographed the advances of a cosmic carambolage: 400 million light years away from the earth, the cores of two melting galaxies are coming together and will inevitably collide together.
This star birth recorded the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who do not have technical abbreviations may call them Southern Fire Wheel by their nickname.
The photograph of the space telescope Hubble shows a cut-out from the iris nebula in the constellation Kepheus.
The 1400 light-years away consists of dust grains, which are ten to a hundred times smaller than ordinary house dust.
This image was assembled from optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light years away from the earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, recorded the space telescope Hubble for the Nasa.
The larger spiral galaxy called scientists UGC 1810.
In this star’s nebula is the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The starbow always produces new youngsters.
Also this star cloud, combined with the rosette fog, continuously produces new baby stars - 5,000 light years away from the earth.
In this brightly shining galaxy with a small black hole there is no dust yet, but only gas.
Researchers suspect that it was not until shortly after the big bang, when hydrogen was mainly found in the universe.
Our insights into space: The most important telescopes
The telescope was invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey - even before Galileo Galilei set up it for star observation a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have become ever bigger - and the insights they provide have become deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope in the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, there is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows glances into space over two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior life of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on the Canary Islands of La Palma is huge - only the mirror reaches 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
Nevertheless, it reaches a diameter of about 11 meters.
Disadvantage of the favorable design: The telescope is locked in its height angle - and thus limited in its mobility.
Also the hobby Eberly telescope in Texas is fixed at the height angle.
Its peculiarity: the high light-gathering force.
In fact, despite the relatively low mirror diameter, this is enough for the world's largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico), researchers are listening to the space for extraterrestrial signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
With the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI), each computer owner can help by providing computing power.
View of the Observatory of the European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here's the Very Large Telescope - which honors his name.
With its four mirrors in total, the telescope can also light the medium infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at the Chilean ESO Observatory.
Its main mirror is intended to include rich 42 meters - and to be made up of almost 1000 mirror elements.
However, images are expected at the earliest of 2018.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They offer two mirrors each with an average of ten meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which looks into the sky next to them with the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
A new, huge telescope is also to be created on the Mauna Kea - with a mirror average of thirty meters.
Here it is to marvel at an illustration.
The most important impressions from space, however, are provided by the space telescope Hubble.
Since April 24, 1990, it has already provided images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, space telescope Kepler has been searching for extrasolar planets - mainly those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, the Nasa announced that 1235 planetary candidates had been identified since the start of the mission.
The last take-off preparations at the Space Telescope Kepler are documented in the picture.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be shot in space at the earliest of 2018 on board an Ariane5 rocket.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to look for light from the first stars and galaxies for the big bang.
Scientists assume that there is also ice in the south-east of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data for this, as the messenger orbits far closer to the north pole around the planet.
Radar measurements have indicated for decades that there is ice on Mercury.
Through the 2004 launched messenger probe - the first one that revolves around Mercury - the scientists now have certainty.
Drink butter daily - and become 168 years old
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a Biblically high age.
There's even a museum for durability.
A search for traces in the country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a Biblically high age.
There's even a museum for durability.
A search for traces in the country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
The journey through the Talysch Mountains is to be called wildly romantic.
The minibus winds through the winding street, passing densely forested hills, tearing rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, you might think you're in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here lives the Caucasian folk group of the Talysian, of which not much is known, except that it speaks perfectly Persian as well as Asian and is very durable.
The end station is Lerik.
The small town is protesting with too heavy Soviet-time architecture that doesn't even want to fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, the journey from Azerbaijan's capital Baku is too difficult.
For the 323 kilometers you need eight hours, because the road is only single-track.
The magnificent wealth that the country owes to its oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived here in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has this stuff for tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous with the Eurovision song festival in May - and next year we have a festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She's the director of the Museum of Long-lastingness, probably the only one in the world.
Here the Vita is documented by about eight dozen Talyschen from the area, which is older than 100. Fatulayeva shows on a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
One child was born at the age of 136
However, the controversial star of the museum is the sheepherd of Müslümov, who is said to have grown 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And in view of the oldest documented man, who grew 122 years old, Müslümov's age seems extremely doubtful.
"1805 he was born here in the region, in 1973 he died," explains Fatulayeva.
The man was three times married and had 23 children, and at the age of 136 he must have had a daughter.
So, when he was a boy, did I get a couple of decades?
But also Rembrandt Scholz, an age researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has heard about the high-ends in Central Asia.
"A remarkable number of elderly people are also present in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "even in Sardinia many very old men live."
However, due to the lack of documents, there was no scientific evidence of age, especially since registers of persons were missing.
Every day, melted butter
The fact is, however, that the people of the region around Lerik often reach a Biblical age.
There are currently 20 people who are over 100 years old.
So why do so many high-level people live here in the south?
Asian travel guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talysian.
On the other hand, museum director Fatulayeva believes that it lies in the diet.
But that the calorie-rich food of the Talyssian is supposed to be so healthy, who love meat, bread and, above all, dairy products, many of which drink a glass of melted butter daily, does not appear plausible from the point of view of nutrition.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? Rubaba Mirzayeva lives in Cengemiran, a tiny settlement not far from the city of Lerik.
At the age of 97 she is still relatively young for these widths.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the whole Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a butter barrel, which she untiringly rolls back and forth.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and a daughter, both of whom have long been grandparents.
Two toddlers also jump around.
In the kitchen you prepare the guests tea, which is served in the typical, bake-shaped armadu glasses.
Mirzayeva's white teeth stand perfectly in line and link, under her headcloth she hides long, dark-blond pots, which her son proudly reveals before us.
I have always washed my hair with milk, so they never went out and kept their color.
"I never used shampoo either," says Mirzayeva.
Monthly pension is sufficient to live
She always ate what came from her own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
All my life, I didn't buy food once in the supermarket.
Then she tells of her husband who was in the army.
It was the worst in the post-war period.
But everything got better than the "loved father" Heydar Aliyew took over the row.
The propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult that is driven around the father figure of the nation, who ruled his country like a dictator, hardly knows borders in Azerbaijan.
Until 2003, he was in power and later his son Ilham took over the row.
After all, there is no need in Azerbaijan's elderly.
230 Manat (e.g. the same sum in Euro), Mirzayeva receives a monthly pension, for local conditions an amount of which you can live well.
And perhaps Mirzayevas is right for a long time: "The old enjoy respect in our culture."
They live in the middle of the large family, are loved, cared for and are happy.
If this is not a reason to stay alive as long as possible
The word "human rights" is missing in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rival rallys in Cairo reveal the deep division of the country.
The future constitution with the Sharia as a base is strongly controversial.
The Egyptian president did not share Pathos.
We have to make the transition.
"And that he succeeds lies in my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said in state television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, but above all to the Christian Copts, the Liberals, enlightened Muslims and seculars.
Because they all, so far hopelessly disputed in a confederation opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a God State on the Nile of Graces of the Mighty Muslim Brotherhood.
He had, as Muhammad Mursi said, almost apologised, temporarily cut down the competences of the Constitutional Court and expanded his competences to "save the revolution".
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save, about that the Egyptians are, the world is not quite clear.
Should the Judicative Be Disposed?
In fact, the 234 articles, which were whipped through by the Islamic-dominated 100-member constitutional assembly in a nocturnal, 15-hour Parforcerit, are partly worrying.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that the case law is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
But what does "principles" mean?
This was and is an interpretation matter and it is to be feared that the Islamists will use the Swammy formulation and the associated legal scope for a more stringent interpretation of the Sharia.
This suggests at least a newly added article: in all the issues concerning Sharia, the Alsar University had to be consulted, the most important Islamic institution of the country with great radiance throughout the Sunni Islam.
This does not have to be done, but it may mean that the clergy are supervising the legislation, which de facto would result in the espousal of the judicative.
Much in the draft draft is interpretation matter
Problems too: Civil military jurisdiction should continue to be maintained.
These courts served during Mubarak's reign to suppress oppositionists.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were in military detention.
The state should also, it is in the design, "to protect the true beings of the Egyptian family" and "promot their morality and values".
This is legally so unscrupulous that with the help of this article, state institutions could even control the content of film art and literature.
In the clear text, that means nothing but censorship.
No article, by the way, expressly sets out equality between men and women.
For this purpose, another forbids insulting or slandering the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what is an insult and how it is to be punished remains unclear.
Likewise dubios suggests the formulation that "indulgence of people" is forbidden.
Is there already a cartoon of the president or a joke at the expense of a lawyer?
Interpretation, as so much in the draft, which Mursi submits to the signature and in his words "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians for the referendum.
"The revolution has returned"
The opposition has been against the power of Islamists for weeks.
Tens of thousands gathered in uninhabited dissension on Friday evening on the Tahrir Square in Cairo and promised to bring down the Charter before it could enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, third-placer of the presidential elections.
Nobel Peace Prizewinner and ex-chef of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El-Baradei stated that the draft Constitution belongs to "the garbage mountain of history".
Via Kurznachtdienst Twitter, he accused the followers of Mursis of wanting to lead a "putt against democracy".
"When he calls the referendum, we'll go to his palace and drop it," said oppositional Jasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet sore," the Egyptian media quoted the opposition politician Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that they would not want to monitor the referendum, which would invalidate it.
"The Qur'an is our constitution."
On the other hand, the well-organized Muslim Brotherhood sounded for the demonstration of the area, but not on the Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other Nile River in front of Cairo University.
Many veiled women and followers of the Salafists took part and cried out, "The people demand the application of God's law."
They asked Mursi, "Pure the land!" and said, "The Qur'an is our constitution."
A struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir square, on which everything took its beginning, would probably have conjured up civil war-like states.
Mursis followers obviously didn't want to risk that.
The Muslim brothers explained that both the opponents of the draft Constitution and the advocates had spoken out loud and clearly.
Now be the time to let the people decide on the constituency in which direction the land should go.
A majority for the draft of the Islamists is considered safe.
"The word human rights does not even occur"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry about this forced constitutional process, which should have gone until February and involve all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EAHR) defended the Muslim brothers when they were in prison or in court under Mubarak.
It is not because he would share their view of the world, but because human rights are indivisible for him.
For this he was beaten, sentenced, detained.
"And now the word human rights is not even in the new constitution," he complains in conversation with the "world on Sunday".
Mursi's expansion of power to all three forces in the state had the lawyer resigned.
These measures are blatant violations of democratic rules and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the President de facto disembarked it," complains Saeda.
But without civil society organisations, democracy cannot work.
Saeda feels left alone, also from the international community, which considers the ideological direction struggle on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could be revenge.
A demonstrator on the Tahrir warns: "You are giving birth to a monster that you can no longer control."
Rakkisk from Norway: Is that the worst fish in the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living - not only in Europe but all over the world.
Could the country’s secret of success have something to do with the local appetite for pretty disgusting fish?
Take a selection of overripe cheeses.
They are placed in the midst of a pile of dirty, moist sportswear.
And call her there for a week.
For example, one has to imagine the nose-sucking smell of Rakkisk, one of Norway's great delicacy.
I am located in the small town of Farynes, about three hours away from Oslo.
There are snow, spectacular landscapes here - and this stubborn smell in the air that just doesn't want to disappear.
Rakkisk is a trout sprinkled with salt, which is fermented in water for up to a year, depending on how you would like to smell your fish.
When the darkness comes over the country in Norway and the weather gets colder, Norwegians flock to a festival here in Fangers, which is dedicated to this speciality, which is really very bribery.
"One eats it raw and then rinses it down with a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works in the local fire station, but also organizes the festival as a so-called "Rakfisk general".
Around us people consume small fish cubes and take large amounts of alcohol.
"Some people like the Aquavit more than the Rakkisk," says Havard.
Spirituose can suppress the smell.
I'm going to cost you a few hits.
If one avoids bringing Rakkisk close to the nose, he is not bad - for example, Sushi, who has a rather long bus ride behind him.
Rakkisk is the product of a very different, much poor Norwegian era, when there were no cooling options and fish were watered in airtight salt water barrels in autumn.
In the deepest winter, he was taken out after a long fermentation and consumed - no doubt under the help of alcohol - under the help of his senses.
Just before a generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country and migrated mainly to the United States.
Today the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a thriving labour market, high wages and a comprehensive health care system.
Even from Sweden, the old rival, who was far richer than Norway not too long ago, immigrants flock.
Rakkisk is considered something important - an essential part of Norwegian history, though strictly smelly.
He's one of the more expensive dishes you can buy here.
But actually everything is expensive here - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs proud 10 Euro.
Norway does not often make it into the world press, and most people do not seem to disturb it.
Here you still hate to mention Anders Breivik by name - those racist right-wing extremists who shot 77 men, women and children last year.
Instead, one refers only to the "event of 22 July".
Norwegians are struggling to accept that someone in their peace-loving country is capable of such brutal murders.
Since the early 1970s, one of the world's largest oil and gas industries has been the main responsibility for Norway's wealth.
"But oil is not the only reason why we're so good," says Anna, our waitress, distributing round tablets with ripe rakkiss and embodying the Nordic ideal with her long blond hair and stabbing blue eyes.
We are a people of caution, as they say.
Your English is exactly like that of most people here flawlessly.
We're not very depressing, we don't like bragging.
Norway has handled its oil wealth very carefully - a large part of the industry's revenues will be invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
In the years leading up to the world economic crisis, when all the money they did not own was thrown around, Norway held its wallet firmly closed.
"As long as we can ski in winter and hike in summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And, of course, Rakkisk eats," she adds with uncomplicated laughter.
I stand in the snow and stand for another dish - from Rakkisk I have enough.
Such an elk burger is definitely something else, and the juicy flesh is my mouth.
But in the evening, the instinct fish is back on the menu.
The hotel I am staying in is one of several venues that organize a Rakkisk dinner, where guests can vote for the best fish - or perhaps the most challenging - for the smells.
There is a live TV circuit to a fly-coated showmaster surrounded by tellers with Rakkisk.
The spectacle is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score do you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
"Here are our points, Havard."
You clap and laugh.
A man falls off his chair, perhaps overwhelmed by the Aquavit.
But maybe it's the strict thirst of the whole fish.
Mexico's Enrique Pena Nito is facing difficult start
While Mexico's future President Enrique Pena Nito prepares for his office, Will Grant analyses from the BBC the challenges ahead of him and the mixed feelings of his people.
The traffic in Mexico City is currently very bad.
Even on better days, this is an ever-clogged city, but on Monday a ring of steel was built, which locks several important traffic routes to the capital and causes chaos on the streets.
However, the aim was not to disturb commuters on their way to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new President Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the President's binding and take over the leadership of the nation.
He's facing a complex task.
Under the divorced government of Felipe Calderon, Mexico has been able to prove itself economically well, but the country is under control of a drug war that has already cost 60,000 people over the last six years.
"My government is strongly committed to reducing violence," said Pena Nicho at Oval Office earlier this week, President Barack Obama.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this objective.
Before joining the U.S. president, Pena Nito was the governor of his home state Mexico.
In this densely populated, vast part of the country surrounding the capital, opinions about the new head of state are shared.
A direct man
In the remote small town of Valle del Bravo, for example, one likes to remember him.
Residents of the resort attribute to him the development of tourism and the construction of the infrastructure.
To reach the city, one can drive on one of the motorways that Pena Nieto had built and which represents a great improvement compared to the brittle, hollow roads that once existed here.
Platettes with its name also hang outside a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We expect real and lasting changes from him," says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who works as Congressman for the Pena Nitos Party, who works PRI.
In particular, as regards security and the economy, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country needs so urgently.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was replaced by Vicente Fox in 2000.
The Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years the party has made great expectations of Enrique Pena Nito outside the Presidential Palace of Los Pinos.
He rejects the accusations of the opposition, the new President fails to do so.
He is a very direct man, very committed and has big plans for the country.
He is an excellent statesman, but above all he is also someone who can listen.
But on the other side of the state, not many people share this view of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The place is hidden under highway crossings and in many ways represents a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the community are of crucial urban nature.
At the beginning of this year, the military was deployed to fight the drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
On a spot of Brachland near a large garbage dump, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left alone in the last two years.
During the term of office of Governor Pena Nito, more than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico - a statistics that surpasses the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is notorious for its violence and the murders of innocent women.
Critics Pena Nietos believe that he at least did not address the problem of women's murder during his term of office appropriately.
But in the worst case, his government has closed its eyes to the problem.
In a concrete building, typical of the downgraded neighborhood, Irinea Buendia fights with tears when she shows me photos of her deceased daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes that she was murdered by her companion.
"When I got home from her, it seemed as if her body had been washed," recalls Senora Buendia.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the body star had already been used.
As her mother tells her story, a picture of Mariana looks down on us from the wall. It is attached next to a cross that bears a single word: justice.
But that's exactly what the family says she's been denied so far.
The authorities have treated me as if I were a brother-in-law, a troublemaker, a nörglerin.
They want you to simply accept their judgment and keep your mouth shut.
"But this is not possible if there were so many errors in form and failure," she says.
When President Pena Nieto receives the President's binding on Saturday, he also assumes great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been pitied by violent crimes over the last six years, and the new President has promised to take special care of this problem during his term of office.
"I hope as President he is the way he was as governor," says PRI Congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
However, the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza fear it most.
The Procuratorate claims that Bradley Manning did not complain of abuse
The Procuratorate contradicts Bradley Manning's accusations that he's been abused in prison
The hearing deals with Manning's time in the military prison in Quantico, Virginia
The defence seeks to reject the charge due to severe detention conditions
The U.S. Armed Force is accused of evading thousands of confidential documents
On Friday, the prosecutor's office tried to find out that army-privileged Bradley Manning - accused of the greatest disclosure of confidential information in the U.S. history - missed several opportunities to complain about the abuse he was alleged to have suffered in military custody.
During a cross-trial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Maj. Ashden finely explained that documents on weekly visits that prison officials had made during Manning's nine-month term in Quantico, Virginia, had no complaints about his treatment.
A day before the cross-examination, which was held as a result of a request for defence to reject the charge - Manning had already been punished enough by the hard term - Manning had said that he had considered suicide in prison.
The US Army intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010 is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The material was then published on the Internet by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed Manning as the source of information.
In the hearing on Friday, Fein went through with Manning the forms that officials had completed after their meeting with Manning during his detention in the Quantico Military Prison, where he had been in prison from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officials asked Manning questions and wrote his answers.
When Fein questioned him about the forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he had considered the treatment by his guards to be "excellent" and the treatment by the institution overall as "very professional".
The forms, so fine, contained no complaints about abuse, although the officials had asked Manning directly for his treatment.
Mr Manning replied that he had expressed his concerns orally and that the officials had discussed them with him and had indicated that they had not been logged.
"They wrote "no problems" (after discussing the concerns), and that did not necessarily mean that I didn't say anything at all," says Manning.
The judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment when he met with a committee in January 2011 who should investigate the thoughts of suicide he had mentioned on a form several months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during this meeting was to lower his observation status to the "prevention of injuries".
The military said it had assigned to him this restrictive status - one level under the threat of suicide - to his and the protection of others.
"I wanted to convince employees that I was fine and that I was getting rid of the observation status to prevent injuries (...) in order to achieve a higher quality of life from my point of view," said Manning.
On Thursday, Manning announced his arrest and transfer to Kuwait, where he was held almost two months before being transferred to prison of the Quantico Marine Base in Virginia in July 2010.
He said he had considered suicide in Kuwait and had once become unconscious because of the heat.
Not to know what is happening to him or to the outside world has been a burden.
"My world shrunk on Camp Arafjon, on this cage," said Manning on Thursday.
I thought I'd die in that cage.
When he was transferred to Quantico, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society.
He was only allowed a mattress, a blanket, flip flops, clothes and his glasses.
Manning said he tried to stay on the move because he was forbidden to sleep or to lie down on the day.
Always had to sleep with light, which penetrated from the outside into his cell.
When he turned around at night and could not see his face, he was awakened to return.
In January 2011, Manning's lawyer formally objected to the treatment of Mannings.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth Military Prison, Kansas.
On Friday, the judge Manning also asked about an accusation he had made in his statement on Thursday - so he had a night naked in his cell in Quantico and had to stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners during a morning count.
Manning said he had never had the opportunity to cover himself with his blanket during this count.
On Friday's survey, Manning stated that he had concluded from an order from his guard that he should drop the ceiling with which he could have covered himself. However, he admitted that no one had asked him to do so.
On Thursday, Manning said that he was forced to sleep naked the night before. He had previously tried to show an official that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning told the official that he could have used the bandage of his underpants or his flip flops to hurt himself, but he could not have done so.
That night, Manning said, his underpants, flip flops and glasses were removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account his arrest experiences and drastically reduce his detention if he is sentenced to the military court during his trial, which is scheduled for the beginning of next year.
The defense has indicated that manning will confess to be guilty of minor crimes, while other charges that are considered too extreme are to be challenged.
The continuation of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend, and the prosecution is expected to justify the terms of detention.
The Pentagon remains in its position that manning was held in accordance with the provisions applicable to all prisoners kept in Quantico under the highest security arrangements.
The charges against Manning include the favour of the enemy, the illegal publication of intelligence information on the Internet, the transmission of national defence information and theft of public property or documents.
If he is found guilty in all charges, he is threatened with a life sentence.
My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many people are forced to leave Mexico due to the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to accuse the immigrants - they call them hard times into memory, he says.
Navarrette considers Mexican Americans to be trapped between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and had arrived at the pass check when inconsistency in me widened.
Signs refer to two queues: one for "Mexiconos", another for "Extranjeros" ("Ausländer").
I stood there for a few seconds, unsure of what I should go to.
I grew up in central California and was called "Mexicoians" all my life.
An ethnic accelerator - just as my friends in Boston call themselves "Iren" or my friends in New York "Italian".
Later, I decided for "Mexican-American".
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home, there was no need for keypads or dashes.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, at least good enough to claim myself in this language at both ends of an interview.
But I do not have the vocabulary of a native speaker, nor do I get rid of my American accent.
So I took my American passport and put myself in the snake for Extranjeros.
I thought about that moment this week when future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nito visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda were all those issues that are expected to happen when the minds of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nito was also very interested in talking about the growth of the Mexican economy. It is a reason for Mexicans to remain in Mexico with the same probability today rather than emigrate to the United States.
It wants to join forces with the United States and Canada and to create a North American trading block, modelled on the European Union.
And Pena Nicho swore to continue the war of Mexico against the drug cartels, even though he did not mention any details in this regard.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never waste a single thought that the United States invaded Mexico in 1848 and forced the country to leave more than half of its territory under guard.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries and not in minutes, memories of this event cannot be overlooked.
As soon as a U.S. government official has only the mildest criticism of Mexico, one hears complaints in the Mexican press and among the elites of the country about how the Americans are threatening the sovereignty of their neighboring country.
And the children of Montezumas go on the war path.
Yet, the biggest challenge of Mexico is in truth the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Would you like to talk about resentments?
There's more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. People for whom the country offers opportunities, and others for whom it does not.
The only reason why so many people of Mexican origin live in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at one point in our family tree a person - perhaps a parent or grandparent part - was not offered a chance in Mexico and emigrated north.
And in most cases this person corresponded to a profile - dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our fidelity is theirs.
Not Mexico.
And although we may now be living the American dream, visiting good schools and getting good jobs, we must never lose sight of the American dream we live - not the Mexican.
Our identity may sometimes be blurred, but as far as our loyalty is concerned, this is not the case.
This is clearly the case with the United States.
Furthermore, we are aware that many members of the Mexican leadership do not like us.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a memorial of a humiliating defeat and look down on us because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In your opinion, our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
And then we would not see ourselves trapped behind the silk curtain - with a pleasant life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, born in Guadalajara and legally emigrated to the United States as a child, reminds me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are - and Mexican Americans take this bad.
While she is a U.S. citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans I know have the feeling that they are neither one country nor the other.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
One enjoys the best of both worlds, but none of them are rooted in them.
In Mexico we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States, we are seen as Mexicans.
How I should learn during my trip, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: some Mexican leaders and parts of education citizenship want to resume their connections with Diaspora.
They want to use Mexican Americans as provisional "messengers" for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues how great a visit to this country is and put pressure on the political leadership to intensify their ties with Mexico.
Well.
That won't happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And given the unfair distribution of income, the unbridled corruption and the violence of drugs, many of us are not so sure whether it is really a great country.
I'm afraid you'll have to go through it alone, Amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico a year and a half ago, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans have a grudge for how their family members were not treated so long ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more "mexican" than I thought.
Old Fights, New Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected foundation for peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to suffocate such a hope in the germ.
In the midst of the usual debt allocations, countless buildings were laid in Schutt and Ash, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed - and for the first time rockets from Gaza were struck near the Israeli metropolis Tel Aviv Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although Israelis and Palestinians seem trapped in their historical conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they want it or not - Palestinians and Israelis have become part of this confusion.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to believe that the deadly pathogen situation could finally end.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance, optimism seems anything but appropriate in view of the current situation.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on 21 November, this week's struggles have strengthened the hard-doing people on both sides.
The leader of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim to have pushed the Israelis back even though his group itself had to face great losses.
Although several Hamas leaders are killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip are infested in one of the most disolast and densely populated corners of the planet, Israel has so far failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining in the West Bank, controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
And Hamas leaders might conclude that they have time on their side.
Just as Islamists in the Arab world have gained influence, Hamas has been able to draw powerful and rich friends to their side.
Turkey, a re-strengthening regional power, once regarded as Israel's closest Muslim ally, has taken over for the Hamas party - just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic golf states.
Rejoicing Hamas adherents believe that around Israel there is an Islamic hemisphere - from Lebanon to the north, where the militant Hezbollah has the power, over Syria, where rebels could stand an increasingly Islamic mint before the fall of Bashar Assads, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And especially the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt - the most populous and most important Arab country by far - on the southern flank of Israel has changed the balance of the region permanently.
Hosni Mubarak, the laizist despot that ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time left for Hamas.
In contrast, Hamas is weakened in brotherhood and its leaders are more dependent on popular views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could prove to be an actor who cannot even be pushed out by Israel and the United States.
The Israeli hardliners, on the other hand, draw an opposite conclusion.
In military terms, Hamas is no longer a danger.
The Israeli missile defense system, "Iron Dome", has proved itself and many of the Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
At least for a while, Israel will be able to sleep more quietly.
In diplomatic terms, the United States is firmly holding to its position, and many European countries have made Hamas responsible for the latest violence.
Israel has done well in recent years, especially under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although missiles from the Gaza Strip have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free from suicide terrorists - not least thanks to the blockages that have been going into the West Bank and thus into the main part of any Palestinian state, which protects the Jewish settlements, which have been declared illegal under international law, are increasingly being expanded.
Netanyahu stands well. His Likud party, in the run-up to the elections on January 22, has allied under Avigdor Lieberman with an even more fighting group.
Why also hate these insidious Palestinians and leave them with their own state?
If they were in fact in control of the West Bank, would they not fire missiles just like their associates in the Gaza Strip?
No, it's better to keep them in check and punish behind the wall, if they dare to raise their heads.
Maybe the hardliners will be able to get through, but the Arab spring could make a strike through the bill.
Even if the Islamists now in power in Egypt and in other countries have little left over for Israel, they will first focus on the difficulties in their own country.
Israel's defense system is larger than that of its four Arab neighbours together.
A war with local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to repair their economy.
The fact that pragmatic President Mursi and Barack Obama joined forces to achieve a ceasefire could be a promising sign - and perhaps symbolize the beginning of a new era.
Israelis should also think more long-term.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking conspicuous steps towards democratization, Palestinians are still deprived of their right to self-determination - a powder barrel that will undoubtedly explode some day in the Israeli-occupied areas, just as this week a bus exploded in Tel Aviv Aviv.
The oppression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population, this situation will only worsen.
Bloody missions to repress Hamas in the Gaza Strip will increasingly demand their diplomatic tribute over the years.
Both sides need an outside impulse
The right answer is that which is represented by the more reasonable representatives of both sides, the majority of the rest of the world and by this newspaper: two states where Israel leaves for security purposes.
The hope - for the near future - is that the ceasefire will give outsiders more influence to enforce this solution.
Egypt, together with Turkey and Qatar, must now stop the supply of arms in the Gaza Strips and is better positioned than ever to convince Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, supplemented by territorial exchange and a common Jerusalem.
Outside Arab nations should also move Hamas and Fatah to an agreement.
This would do more for the creation of a Palestinian state than for the forthcoming application for UN observer status.
Obama must also help to move Israel to negotiate.
During his first term of office, he failed to present his own peace plan.
Far away in the white house, it seems as if he is also averse to participation.
But this is a pitiful, shortsighted perspective.
The United States has an important interest in a stable Middle East.
And this is a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian Single Cigarette Packaging Laws enter into force
Health warnings and body parts on neutral green packages equal for all tobacco brands
The world’s first laws on uniform cigarette and tobacco packaging have entered into force in Australia, replacing brand logos and colours with neutral, olive-green lids, which are also printed with drastic images showing sick parts of the body and infants suffering from cigarette smoke.
Apart from the different health warnings and pictures, the only difference between the packages in the brand names, which are printed in identical, small font, will occur on Saturday.
Australia thus introduces the world's strictest regulations on tobacco packaging.
The Australian Federal Government wants to remove young people from smoking by removing the glamorous image of tobacco consumption.
The government assumes that studies that have shown that people who have not started smoking at the age of 26 will not start with 99% probability after that.
"One can already see with children of young age that they understand the message to try to apply the tobacco companies with their brand image," says Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek. She quotes studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and the changes will only slightly affect the profits of multinational corporations, other countries are already considering similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the laws.
So it was said that the laws would favour black market trade, leading to cheaper and easier-to-reach cigarettes.
"The laws will lead to serious, unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobago Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer far greater quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.
Others, on the other hand, say that the laws have stimulated their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, notes that since British American Tobago, Britain's Imperial Tobago, Philip Morris and Japan Tobago failed to meet the highest Australian Court of Justice two months ago.
Zico has sold up to 6,000 units of wholesale trade and is waiting for new stocks.
It's a good business for us.
According to experts, the catch is in the popularity of social media with exactly the population to which the plan is addressed.
A number of Australian laws have banished tobacco companies from TV advertising, forbidding them to act as sports sponsors and forced most traders to stop using cigarettes in shops. Now tobacco advertising has changed to the Internet.
The Australian government has banned Internet advertising by local companies and sites, but has no influence on international sites.
"Whoever markets tobacco and has only a small area left to apply for its products does not come around the Internet," says Becky Freeman, researcher in health care at the University of Sydney.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman has noted an increase in experience reports on brands written by "all ordinary people".
You have to ask yourself the question: Is this just a private person who finds such a great favor in Marlboro-cigarettes that she even recorded a video for it - or does a marketing agency have to do with it?
British American Tobago Australia says that instead of marketing, the industry concentrates on dealing with the new laws.
It has even gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules - those countries are complaining to the World Trade Organisation about unfair trade restrictions, although none of the countries have greater trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected for mid-2013.
According to Plibersek, the government has conducted discussions with other countries that are considering similar packaging laws.
In 2001, Canada was the first country to prescribe photographic warnings.
They have now been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Harder laws will be considered in Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers show themselves defiant.
The pictures don't affect me.
I just ignore them.
"You just take a chicken and put the box away," says Victor El Hage when buying a cigarette box, on which a photo is printed with a mouth tumor.
Honestly, there's only one reason I'd stop, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, operator of the tobacco trade "King of the Pack" in downtown Sydney, says that the uniform packaging has made it difficult to fill its shelves.
"I used to need an hour to sort out a delivery, now I need four," says Yu.
"The government should have just completely banned cigarettes - then we would have said okay, that's it, we're closing," he clearly adds.
In a constantly electrified world, it is nice to be bored even
This Thanksgiving I spent unexpectedly five hours at the airport when our plane failed due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane.
So I had enough time to give myself a few thoughts about boredom.
I don't want to lie.
Waiting for a flight at the airport for half a day is quite annoying - even if books, magazines and iPhones (and, of course, tax-free shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and child development experts are leading boredom as something positive.
When it comes to them, it is okay for us - and our children - to be bored occasionally.
This forces the brain to lose in interesting ways of thinking, which may promote creativity.
And since most of us are almost constantly staring at some screen today, the benefits of boredom are no longer beneficial to us.
So should we welcome the boredom with open arms?
Yes.
And no.
I'll come back to that again.
However many people I have always assumed that boredom is a relatively up-to-date phenomenon that has developed with increasing leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011) does not see that.
"In fact, the boredom has a very long history," he says.
The Pompejis walls adorn a Latin graffiti over boredom dating back to the first century.
And then there is the question of how we actually define boredom.
According to John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom has been defined and discussed in many ways.
After a long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea in front of a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues concluded that boredom as the experience of "doing a satisfactory activity, but not being able to define it".
Boredom differs from apathy so that the person is not employed but wants to be.
In apathy, on the other hand, there was no urge to do something.
The key experience of boredom, he says, is in a "disturbing of the attention process, paired with bad mood and the feeling that time is only slow".
Boredom can almost listen to it as depression.
But Professor Eastwood, although these two states may be related, see bored people see the problem in their environment or in the world, while depressed persons see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we believe that we are boring, even if we have only difficulty concentrating.
In her study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention" - to German for example: "The Inactive Mind: The Definition of Boredom under the Aspect of Attention", which appeared in September in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science", Professor Eastwood and his colleagues point to an earlier experiment with which participants listened to a volume on which a person read a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud television program from the neighboring room that had nothing to do with the content. Others heard it at low volume, so it was hardly perceptible, while the third group did not hear these sounds at all.
The people who heard the hardly audible television said they felt more boredom than the two other groups - they had problems concentrating, could find no reason for them and attributed their difficulties to boredom.
When one tries to focus on a difficult or strenuous task, the disturbance of attention can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, if you are engaged in a monotonous activity - "as is the search for faulty products on a factory conveyor belt, music can distract and help you not to feel bored."
In fact, he says, we now know that round-bags and crickets, often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can even fight them by keeping people more physically alert.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to ram around learn more and keep more information than those who are forced to sit still," says Professor Fenske.
At some point, all of us get bored - my late flight, a dreaming speaker, a particularly tiring film.
But some people are more bored than others.
In order to measure these differences, researchers developed a "scale of boredom vulnerability" in the 1980s.
On the scale, statements like "Many things I have to do are repeated and are monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I don't have enough time for everything".
With the help of such scales, researchers have found that boys are more often bored than girls, says Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of Westflorida - especially as regards the need for more and a greater variety of external stimuli.
But in general, teenagers are quite a strained bunch.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a Pager.
He found that 32% of adults in school and doing homework were bored, while 23% said they were bored if they were not in school.
But only 3% of parents reported feeling bored.
Today, 21 years later, Professor Larson does not know whether the percentages of boredom have increased or fallen.
However, he is certain that "the youth will be considered particularly boring", mainly because children and teenagers do not have a major influence on their daily life course.
So back to my original question: Is boredom healthy?
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases, it leads people to take extreme physical risks and fall into gambling or drugs to relieve them - that's what studies have shown.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors investigate the relationship between boredom and creativity. This opinion is Professor Vodanovich, who has been exploring the subject for more than two decades.
"With the boredom, the brain wants to tell you that you should do something else," says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at New York University.
But the brain doesn't always know what to do right now.
If you're boring and you use this energy to play and cook guitar, you'll be happy.
However, television can cause a sense of happiness in the short term, but it will flee in the long run.
So if you provide an iPad to your bored child, you can get it off the boredom. However, it has not learned to entertain or control yourself, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds: "self-control is transferred from one situation to another."
The child not only learns to entertain but also receives more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should celebrate boredom.
Nor should we see them too critical.
Instead, our goal should be to feel comfortable away from the constant development of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds like we have to be more bored, but boredom is the tormenting, unabated desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that, in truth, people are only looking for a way to turn off and relax.
"In an environment in which we are constantly being overstimulated, it is difficult to get involved once the noise is silent."
In Colorado there is no clear guideline for the new marijuana law
The 19-year-old Community College student and football player Anthony Orozco stands in the southeast Colorado for a crime in court that will soon be legal in this state: the possession of a few fewer marijuana broths and a pipe with which he smoked them.
According to Orozco, he and some friends were on the road one September day by car in Lamar near the border to Kansas when they were stopped.
After police officers found marijuana in the car, Orozco was loaded for the possession of drugs and drug equipment - cavalier crimes, each with a penalty of 100 US dollars - and received a court appointment.
"We are treated like criminals," says Orozco.
But is he one?
In the uncertain weeks following the state's decision to legalize small quantities of marijuana for its own use, the response in hundreds of smaller drug offences depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of illegalities that revolve around marijuana are already dropped here and in Washington State, which approved similar measures.
The police authorities are no longer persecuting adults for possession to a small extent over 21 years, which will be permitted by law as soon as the new laws enter into force in the next few weeks.
But prosecutors in the more conservative districts of Colorado have announced that they are continuing to pursue and are still quoting people in court.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the Western Mountains, vote to prevent new, state-licensed marijuana businesses from opening up to their communities.
"This situation is developing so quickly that I don't know what will happen next," says Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, located east of Denver.
And also regulators in the state of Washington scratched their heads.
They are waiting for guidance to set up a licensing system for the production, production, distribution and sale of the drug - and have a deadline until 1 December 2013.
In Washington it is considered that Colorado is in any case ahead of most states as regards the regulation of marijuana. There the drug was legalized for medical purposes only and then for its own use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market. The state is therefore well suited to orientation," says Brian E. Smith, spokesman of the Washington State Department of Spirits.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than serve in the sense of a rough guide.
"We don't have a real precedent that we can follow," he adds.
The Washington Act, called I-502, enters into force on 6 December and thus also forms the endpoint of a grey zone in which the state licensing system does not yet exist, but the possession is legalized.
And unpleasant practical issues need to be clarified at this time - for example, how the state requirement of "adequate access" to licensed marijuana is to be agreed with the prohibition of cannabis shops around 300 meters around schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities.
" Nowhere will it be harder to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in Seattle's agglomeration area," says Ben Livingston, spokesperson for the "Center for Legal Cannabis", a recently formed research group.
On November 21st, Chief Oates sent his staff to Aurora an e-mail stating that the prosecutor would no longer prosecute smaller marijuana offences in persons over 21 years of age, and that the police would not seek "as of now" criminal charges for these crimes.
Chief Oates added that the police would continue to enforce urban rules on the regulation of growers of medical marijuana and continue to pursue drug dealers.
In Weld County, in northern Colorado, district attorney Ken Buck represents a more stringent view.
After the vote, he stated that his authority would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly in order to move consumers to withdrawal.
Currently, 119 persons have to take responsibility for the possession of about 50 grams or less marijuana in court, although many have also been charged with other crimes.
"Our authority has the duty to prosecute infringements that were committed at the time of the crime," Buck stated in a statement.
The reactions are even in places such as rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative, indiscriminately.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer show adults for possession of smaller quantities.
District attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to drop all outstanding possession procedures.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time exercising the right until it changes," he says.
Although 55% of the voters in Colorado supported the measure, it was clear from the outset that it would not be easy to reconcile the personal consumption of marijuana with the complexity of government and legal system.
And the conflicting reactions across the state promoted a profound discord among local officials in view of the great green experiment.
This is a "cultural barrier" for district lawyers, says Sean McAllister, an attorney from Denver, who represents defendants in charge of marijuana law and acts on the ground as a spokesman for the national organization for reforming marijuana laws.
"They have spent such a large part of their lives persecuting people for not yet accepting legalisation," he believes.
As the first countries to treat smaller quantities of marijuana such as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are traded as national cases for the legalisation of drugs.
While advocates and public officials are preparing for an age of legal sale, they are also nervously waiting for instructions from the Federal Government, which continues to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana as a criminal offence at the federal level.
Spokespersons of the legalisation movement hope that the Ministry of Justice will surrender.
Despite several spectacular arrests of consumers and sellers of medical marijuana, the Federal Government has allowed the most sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other countries.
Kevin A. Sabet, former Obama government drug policy consultant, believes that, although criminal officials are unlikely to enter doors to seize smaller quantities of drugs, they are likely to become stiff, to tolerate legal, state-regulated marijuana business under the new legislation.
Several cities in Colorado do not wait for the federal authorities to act.
Some local authorities approved Moratories for new marijuana business before the election day, although they could only open in about a year.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the west, decided on a six - month ban, which is likely to be adopted next week.
"We don't want to get into a position where we license someone and then face a big problem at the federal level," says Bob Nicholson, member of the City Council.
Our community voted against this change of law.
We are focusing on what the community has chosen and not on what the state has decided to do.
Still many questions are open.
Petronella Wyatt: I was muttered from Oxford because I am Tory
Not only university students today are attacked for their views
It has always been my greatest dream to get a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had attended that university that I once thought was the largest stamp of knowledge in the world, for a modern Greek symposia that promoted the great pillars of civilization - free thinking and tolerance.
But within two weeks of my entry into Worscester College at the end of the 1980s - where I had planned to study history - I had packed my suitcases again and thus led the first scandal of my life.
My father broke down in tears.
My friends were confused.
In the Evening Standard it was said that I would have gone because I had a problem with the fact that commilitones had sex in the neighboring room.
Author A N Wilson told me that I had left the university because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
But the truth was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran because I suffered from systematic mumbling and threats.
Not because of my rather unusual name, or because I had come from a private school.
One had only been harassed for one reason - a reason that, in this alleged cradle of enlightenment, seemed so narrow and cruel: My now deceased father Woodrow Wyatt was an important advisor Margaret Thatchers and I support the Conservative Party.
Why do I mention this right now?
Well, recent reports say that a new generation of students of moderate rights suffer similar persecution.
The organized and increasing hatred of Tory students in Oxford has now developed such dimensions that a group of them claimed the same equality protection last week to benefit gays, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College indicate that they are "often actively isolated, personally attacked and declared undesirable" because of their political views.
They demand a place in their college's equality committee to ensure that their opinions can be expressed freely.
Her situation was worsened by a recent documentary on political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", which Tories represented as an eccentric and neo-Nazis.
Among other things, it showed graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the Conservative Student Association of Oxford University, who was driving in a Rolls-Royce and protested with silver suit and silver-set walking stick.
At other universities, conservative students say that they are considered to be "a sin room for the introduction of higher tuition fees".
20-year-old Luke Black, Vice President of the Conservative Student Association of Nottingham University, announced in a Sunday newspaper: "There is a growing left tendency at universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even getting to know us."
Samuel Roberts, 21 and histories student in Corpus Christi, who initiated the request for greater protection, is of the opinion that such a climate is "uncomfortable".19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, president of the Conservative Student Association of Oxford, said that she had observed a growing rejection of students of moderate rights among JCR members.
"This poses a danger to the intellectual discourse and to the well-being of the members," she says.
In my first weeks in Oxford, I belonged to such a minority.
As an incredibly shy 18-year-old, I arrived in September 1986.
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its climax.
In the previous year, the university voted not to give Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary title due to cuts in higher education.
The atmosphere would even have frightened Stalinists.
In the first days of the first semester week, where new students meet each other and the tutors, I was given a taste of the future events.
I made the experience that the tutors not only tolerated the ridicule of Tory students, but even took part with joy.
Political issues such as the mining strike, privatisation and the rejection of sanctions against the apartheid regime of South Africa found their way into the wood-filled areas of the tutorial.
At my first of these events, I was to translate French texts from the 18th century into English. What was to come was not what I was meant to be.
"Miss Wyatt," said the tutor Harry Pitt (now dead), "please translate the first paragraph."
I stumbled.
Pitt was a little man with a face like caked dough, and quite hesitant.
"Do thatcher supporters refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked me.
The other students tickled.
In my eyes tears came up.
"I suggest that they take a few French hours in your spare time - so if you are not too busy with your social activities," Pitt urged me.
I returned to my room with a hanging head.
That night I was sitting alone in college at dinner when someone slightly tapped me on the shoulder.
It was an English student from the second year called James, who introduced himself as a member of the conservative student association.
"I know who you are," he kindly said.
Unfortunately, it's how it is.
Anyone who is suspected of being Tory will be urged.
It's bad enough for me, but they know that your father Margaret Thatcher is close, so it'll be worse for you.
Most Tory first semesters pretend to be followers of the Labour Party.
In a local pub, I later tried to adjust.
I insisted that I wasn't in all the points with Mrs. Thatcher.
This trick should prove unsuccessful.
A beginner in philosophy, politics and economics, who ironically visited Eton College as a conservative, said to me, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're dirty.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverted and dirty.
"How do Tories have sex?", one asked me.
They beat each other, don't they?
I felt that homosexuals must have felt before the more liberal legislation of the United States.
Would I ever be able to live a normal life at Oxford University?
Would I be able to meet like-minded people only after the intrusion of darkness?
Should I turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural inclinations?
The three years ahead of me extended before my spiritual eye to a purgatory of aggression and isolation.
The only tutor who openly recognized himself as Tory was Norman Stone, professor of contemporary history, who had his seat in my college.
He was hated not only to be a conservative, but also because he had advised thatcher about foreign policy and had written speeches for them.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place, found it provincial and small and rejected it for his Marxist-determinist history perspective.
In 1997, he accepted a professorship at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I started commuting between Oxford and my parents' house and found refuge with more open friends and family members in the city.
My father told me I hated Oxford, and why I did it.
He seemed disbelief.
During his time in the Forties, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said.
They would never do anything like that, not in my city of dreaming tower peaks.
Even my communist friends always showed flawless manners.
His damp eyes were sore.
Give the whole thing a chance.
I'm sure they're just fucking you.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance became weaker.
One of my male friends, also Tory supporters, had given up the pressure and denied his convictions.
During a tutorial the following week, in which another historian had seriously claimed that I was "an enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Although I was secretly torn from shame, I admitted that my parents had subjected me to brainwashing and called them "old clumsy".
The relief took only a short time.
It was my father who hit the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At that time he wrote two columns a week in the Murdoch press.
My door was locked.
I was hiding in my room, and after five minutes my heels gave up.
When they left, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
You're welcome to call me a whining cock.
But no 18-year-old should ever suffer in an educational institution under such intimidation and malice.
And even more tragic is that it was Oxford - a university that not only produced 14 Tory Prime Ministers, but still hidden behind an undeserved reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance of fame"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - Master of Couture", which was opened this week in London, ABC speaks to Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian fashionmaker.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital, worthy of hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
This was recognized by the designer at the opening of "Valentino - Master of Couture", a grand retrospective for which more than 130 clothes of the skin couture were put together, created by his "Maison" in the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his distinctive Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his distinguished clientele.
Valentino has always felt fascination for the smoky and distant world of the nobility.
In the first hall of this exhibition, which will still be on view until March 3, there are a variety of private letters and photos with the signature of the finest aristocracy, starting from the Princess Salimah Aga Khan, the Princess Marie Chantal of Greece and Margarita from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophys of his social rise from the modest fashion maker in the city of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international jet set.
Being in love with the nobility doesn't have to be a disadvantage.
"At least they don't put their chickens on your magnificent carpet, as some beautiful celebrities from pop music do," says Baronin Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s they lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We were all happy when we were invited to his home in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, who is closely friends with forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of fame.
And yet he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress of Valentino
Nor does the Argentine model Valeria Mazza forget the charisma of the fashion maker.
Many years ago we went home to dinner after a fashion show at Piazza di Spagna in Rome.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
At every detail of his apartment, decoration, food and music, one realized and felt his influence.
"All invited people felt important and loved," remembers the "top model", which started their career at the week of Haute Couture 1995 in Paris.
"He never comes out of fashion because his designs are works of art," she concludes.
Fashion Show of Origin
The life of Garavani is not a story of obsessity, rather of mutual love.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House has been transformed into a glorious and 60-metre long runway that suggests a roll exchange: the user takes the place of the model and goes along the runway to admire a dreamy "audit" wearing the masterpieces of Valentino, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristóteles Onassis, the costumes that Monica Vitti wore in "La Notte", or a wool and leather coat that belonged to the empress Farah Diba.
In this audience of fashion dolls there are names like that of Sibilla de Luxembourgo, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofía of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the fashionmaker, 2006
Many of these customers say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "unforgettable".
I remember perfectly.
It was a pants, a shirt, a vest "gillette" and a jacket from the Autumn/Winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift from him," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's museums.
"I prefer him to all others because of his great love for women and because he highlights our beauty," adds the ex- Duchess of Feria.
I like the colors he uses very much; they have a lot of light and underline the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Also the princess and opinion leader at the fashion Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg cannot forget the first time she wore a Valentino.
When I was a teenager in Italy, I dreamed of having the age and the opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses...
At the end of the 90's it finally came to pass.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a feast in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with flying skirt and a draped top with a décolleté that honours his name.
"It was a real dream," said Rodrigo d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino does not depend on fashion, its obsession is timeless," explains this Italian aristocrat, who lives between París, New York and Buenos Aires.
The princess D'Arenberg keeps her evening dresses from the fashionmaker "with absolute care", "because a dress is not only a dress, but also the associated memories".
The "king" of fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition in Somerset House is Marie Chantal Miller's wedding dress for her wedding with Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "Ragazze" (as the fashionmaker called his close-ups) were necessary to produce this ivory silk dress with pearls, twelve different embroiderys and a four and a half meters long tail.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority of the specialist press, this dress was a milestone in the Haute Couture at the end of the 20th century, "the return to the customers of the top society".
For years with the "savoir-être" of the elite, Valentino is now her best copy.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest award in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded with the honorary legion, cumulates Garavani as many honors as each of the husbands of his customers.
"I've always noticed his refinement, his peace, his well-kept and perfect exterior," admits D'Arenberg.
I saw him last time a month ago at a gala dinner at the Museum de Orsay.
He was sitting at the table of the countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
"He was flawless; the time leaves no trace of him."
And this says a princess...
The most difficult profession in the world: the human animals of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and health when they carry 70 kilos of sulphur over the steep, rocky roads.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others are literally working in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wiyaya, one of the 400 mine workers who earn their lives by bringing sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano to the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, he has to climb down to the ground of his crater every day, where the sulphurous gas flowing out of the earth solidifies in contact with the air.
After breaking out large sulphur stones that can weigh up to 70 kilos in total, he transports them into two bamboo baskets on his shoulders over the sloppy paths of stone.
It is only 250 meters up to the top of the volcano, which rises to a height of 2386 meters, but the exhausted carriers need more than 40 minutes to climb at the tortoise pace, keeping the balance and taking their steps carefully so that they do not slip and crash.
They know that every step can cost their lives, how this happened to a French tourist who crashed years ago on the steep slopes of Kawah Ijen.
Kawah Ijen's mine workers earn 5 Eurocents for every kilo of sulphur they destroy.
Upstairs, they walk the way between the tourists who photograph them like circus monkeys and walk with the tiresome heavy baskets three kilometers to the balance, which a mine company has set a little further down at an altitude of 1850 meters
The society is PT Candi Ngrimbi, who has been using the sources in the volcano since 1960 and (not better said) its workers, to whom she pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 Eurocents) for each kilo of sulphur.
This is then sold to the petrochemical industry for 10,000 rupees (83 Eurocents each), because this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used for the production of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for bleaching sugar.
"Since we normally carry 70 kg, we receive about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each route," explains Anto, who normally makes three routes a day.
For each route, he needs three hours after which he's completely done, but at the end of the day he's got 138,000 rupees (11,5 euros) together.
What looks like a miserable wage for such a sheer inhuman effort is, however, the triple of what he would earn with the field work.
"The daily wage of mine workers here, where 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) are paid per day at the coffee harvest, and the average monthly income is two million rupees (167 euros), is very high," explains the carrier, who previously worked as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village nearby, for a reason that is as important in Indonesia as the sulphur: "I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought them to Java to convert them to Islam."
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are irritated because of the toxic gases.
The 27-year-old Anto has been risking his life at Kawah Ijen for three years, whose sulphur has already left his first traces, although he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are stimulated by the toxic gases from the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay for reaching his dream.
"I'm going to work here for two more years because I want to open a shop or learn Spanish or French," he promises in a more than acceptable English.
This sympathetic and intelligent, but life-punished young man could work as a tourist guide, waiter or at the reception of a hotel, but instead he does the work of a carrier.
It divides a dirty wooden hut with other carriers and rises at two o'clock every morning, because the sulphur also flows out at night, where its characteristic yellow color glows in the darkness.
Challengeing the shadows, he rises into the crater in the light of a small headlight on his helmet, which he bought from his own money.
About 400 carriers load the baskets with sulfur on their shoulders at the crater floor.
Despite its great profits, the mine company has not mechanized sulphur reduction to save costs, and does not supply any equipment to the carriers who work on their own account and are paid by weight.
You will not receive a share of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) supplement per camera, which the guards of this nature park, together with the admission fee of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), require of tourists who are coming to photograph the volcano and the human carrier.
"This work is for the animals and not for humans" protests Madrusin, a strong 42-year-old supporter who has been working for Kawah Ijen for three decades since leaving school.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and assures that he continues to "as long as it goes" because he needs the money for the education of his three children aged between 10 and 18 years.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life.
Even if the sulfur burns the throat and itches the eyes when the wind suddenly turns and the miners get stuck in the thick columns that rise out of the crater, the men are so hard that no one complains about severe diseases ... of course, except the usual breathing problems, osteoarthritis, pain in the knees and bladders on the shoulders that have deformed from the weight of the baskets.
With the basket on its back, Unainik is only able to carry 50 kg with its 53 years.
Every day he and his companions break 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which are transported from three trucks across a goat path between the bush and the camp in Tamansari at 18 kilometres.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano was my whole life," Unanik explains, opening his mouth wide, in which some teeth are missing.
Of his five children, the elder also works as a sulfur carrier with his 30 years of age.
Time passes, but poverty continues generation in one of the hardest professions in the world: those who work as a human burden on Kawah Ijen.
Singapore needs babies to save the economy
The Singaporeians blamed them for having no children, for the career, stress and cost of real estate and child rearing.
"The population of Singapore must grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: we fulfil our citizenship and we create life!
It seems incredible that the verses are part of an advertising for mint coupons, but still - or just so - they became a viral video on YouTube at the beginning of this year in Singapore.
The sentences are part of a rapper song, the local sayings such as "slowing will be a "bao" (laib) in the oven to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising company BBH, which shot the video, holds the hope that the commercial spot will reach out in a funny way to draw attention to the problem.
Her creative director Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the power of music to bring people to fulfill their "national duty".
This is just something for the Internet, so we had to make it funny and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
When we reproduce, we are the worst in the world, so we realized that this is a topic that we had to take care of.
We knew that the government had tried a lot, such as the marketing of perfume with pheromones or the organization of speed dating evenings (fast flirts).
Possible that many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily lead to success.
So we thought, why don't we make something as creative as possible to address this problem, such as composing a rap?
1,2 Children
Whoever does not take this issue easily is the Government of Singapore.
Each year, she spends $1,300 on policy measures to encourage citizens to have more children.
A package of the government for married couples and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, prolongs maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But everything has so far had little success.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech city state in southeastern Asia, also known for the conservatism of its rulers and its strict social controls.
According to its national population authority, the birth rate is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time this rate was over 2 - which is also known as the rate of replacement - was in 1976.
So why don't the Singaporeians have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policy of the National Population Authority, says that this is due to "better training" and "greater career opportunities".
"This has enabled people, except to marry and form a family, to have much more options in terms of life's goals and set priorities," she explains.
These changes in social conditions have contributed to the higher number of single people and to the delay in marriage and birth, the result of which is the reduction of birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at a drastic increase in immigration in order to counter the reduction of the population has led to resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where the barely-cashed Xenophobia flourishes against many new immigrants, especially the Chinese, who are criticized for keeping the wages low and not integrating themselves.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the government party in Singapore achieved its worst election since independence last year.
Since the elections, an attempt has been made to correct the problem with higher contributions and charges for foreign workers.
Effects:
While the falling birth rate has the known impact on the economic growth of a nation, which has tax revenues, health costs and immigration policy, the example of Singapore also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to achieve that not so many small apartments are built.
It has already had an impact on the housing market.
The Urban Development Authority has begun to control the number of small apartments known as "shoe boxes" which may be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and have a large sales success.
However, there is concern that they can promote the life-style of the single person, and that they dissuade construction companies from building large housing for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director General of the real estate company EL Developers, says that his "shoe boxes" can be sold much faster than larger housing units.
They are so popular, and the units are sold out by days and even weeks faster than the larger housing units.
This leads to their being much better for our cash flow.
He admits, however, that the new standards give developers clearer orientations, which were previously set in motion by obstacles if they wanted to build too many small housing units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
Even if these new rules could pave the way for an increase in the national birth rate, the talks with the Singaporens working in the financial district can be seen that they will not have a major impact.
"People are stressed, the apartments and also the education are expensive, so it's being pushed out by many," says a young manager.
The children can have others.
"It is important for me to have my own money and time," says another man, about twenty years old.
Men and women lead their careers, stress and cost of property and education as reasons for not having children.
That is why the Singaporeians have the last word to give children - the government can still do so much.
The offline Private offline is online private
email-custom-header-Security
According to the dictionary, this is the property of private or "the area of private life, where one has the right to protection from any kind of interference".
What's private for someone under 16 years of age?
How is this definition applied to everyday life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he poses if he makes known on the Internet situations he would not share in real life?
El Periódico interviewed five young people between the ages of 10 and 15 who are often on the network.
In four of the cases, they linked the term to "something very own" on a personal level and "to the password and user" when they applied it to the social networks.
"My deepest secrets would not be announced in a post," says the 10-year-old Jorge, trying to explain the meaning of "private" in websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"These are very confidential secrets, my mother may know them, but not the whole world," he confirms.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or pictures of games.
I also spend my time with acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a photo that's not mine, or someone who makes the fool," he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong to publish obscene photos, nudes, crimes, or to write abusive or violent comments.
Jorge guarantees to know 35 friends he has in FB and nine followers in Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Among them is the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I signed up on Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if anyone answers me, I'm just uploading them up," he adds.
"The social networks are entertaining, I can speak quickly with relatives in the distance or with friends," he says.
He answers that he would never accept an invitation from an unknown person.
Even if someone recommended a stranger to him, he would ignore this.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask he admits not to know 20 of the people he has added to his list of friends.
"That doesn't scare me because we have something in common, for example music," he says.
According to the boy, no one made any indications or asked him for his address or telephone number.
"If someone pressures me or asks them for me, I simply remove him from my user account," he admits.
José reported to Ask after reading a recommendation in Twitter.
The boy is not unknown to experiences that are known today as cyberbullying.
The acquaintance of a friend was blackmailed in a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was," he assures.
According to José, the victim didn't close the user account.
"He just made it private."
He then explains a number of steps to safely configure a user account.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would if he was unsympathetic with me or if I wanted to wipe him out.
"But I know this is cyberbullying," he explains.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, a teacher in English with a degree in education and learning, believes that to guide the children and young people, it must be understood that it is the purpose of social networks to inform.
"The Internet was created as a medium for searching for information, but with the appearance of these pages, the rules of the game have changed," she says.
Porras explains that academic Marc Prensky, owner of a master's title in pedagogy at Yale University and author of the "Digital Natives and Immigrants" work formed these terms for explaining the phenomenon.
The digital natives are the children and young people who have grown up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants to teach them where we still learn," he says.
He explains that this is a complex issue, "because we require them to have a defined criterion on what may be spread, published or said, and this at an age where maturity is not sufficient."
"They should also be selective if it is most important for them to be popular with thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach children and young people what privacy is is to ask them questions that make them think.
"To tell you not to do it, doesn't work," he says.
Porras then mentions some possibilities: there are things you wouldn't tell a stranger. Then why do you do it on the Internet?
Or: Would you like to publish a photo of you, such as the one you published from a friend?
Do you know what the others are publishing about you?
Did you ask the other people for permission before when you labeled photos of celebrations?
And one more question: Do everyone need to know what you are doing at every moment?
Another point is to give them an understanding that they must act online as they do offline.
They're the same rules.
"Someone outside the Internet is dealing with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must apply to social networks," he explains.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teachers and educational consultants, commented that it is essential that parents carefully read the guidelines of social networks.
If they understand all sections, they have solid foundations to talk to their children about the importance of opening a user account on the Internet.
"For example, the age, or what you can share or publish," he explains.
According to Guardia, the children need to be reminded of the lesson "Don't talk to strangers".
Completion of the Unasur Summit without publication of Lima's declaration
The 6th summit of the Presidents of the Union of South America (Unasur) ended today in Peru without publication of the Lima Declaration, which was previously announced and should theoretically be signed by the seven present rulers.
Efe repeatedly tried to gain access to the signed document at the VIth Ordinary Meeting of the Heads of State and Government of Unasur. Sources in the State and Presidential Office initially announced that they would hand it over after the clause, but then declared that it would be published at some time on the website of the Peruvian government.
In the case of questions on the text, they indicated that the content was presented by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, in brief statements to the press.
Journalists' access to information about the summit was limited at any time.
During the day in the press room, only the picture of the presidential meeting without sound was transmitted with the message "Private Session, Limited Audio".
The few information that circulated among journalists was received by the press representatives of some of the Unasur's governments present at the meeting, but not by the Peruvian press speaker.
The only document that was disseminated during the day was the list of participating presidents, which caused discomfort among hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who requested more information.
The President of Peru then sent an e-mail to the media with the "Declaration" of the Summit, but it was the Humala Declaration and not the official document for the conclusion of the summit.
Last October, Peru was host to the IIIrd Summit of South America - Arab States (ASPA), and even on this occasion, despite the press's strong call, the so-called Lima Declaration, which had been announced before, was neither published.
On the official website of ASPA you can be convinced that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, Peruvian authorities stressed the existence of information systems for journalists, but to a large extent limited access to information.
The summit also ended with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to adopt a judgment of the Court of Justice of The Hague, which resolves a border conflict between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would accept the decision of the IGH that began in The Hague on Monday, in the trial that Lima launched against Santiago, to hear the pleas of both sides.
"We will follow and execute the ruling on the differences we are currently making to this international court," said Humala together with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile was, and continues to be, a country that adheres to international laws, seeks peaceful solutions to disputes, concludes agreements and submits to the international courts," adds Piñera and greeted Humala with a handshake in front of the flags of both countries.
The confirmation by both Presidents that they would submit to the IGH was made after Colombia, following a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which it considered to be a serious mistake, had filed an action against the Bogotá Agreement, in which it agreed to submit to the judgments of this International Court of Justice.
At the summit, the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner were present.
Paraguay, who has been excluded from Unasur since 2011, did not take part in the meeting after the resignation of his President Fernando Lugo.
The host President Ollanta Humala opened the talks on the morning and ended the summit shortly after lunch in Lima.
The head of state read the final document stating that 16 decisions were taken and the lines of action for 31 projects between the South American countries were established over an investment of a total of 17 billion dollars.
On the decisions taken, he said that the Unasur countries "will take significant steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, to which we extend the decisions on residence rights."
He stated that measures would be taken to "improve cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and organised cross-border crime, as well as measures to improve access to drugs and the Internet at low prices in all areas of South America and to act jointly and efficiently in the event of natural disasters".
With the crisis in Europe, "economic consolidation (in Latin America) should not take on triumphant traits, but should serve to expand our production performance and show our people a better future," added Humala.
"We have decided to give priority to a number of 31 emblematic projects, which should improve spatial links in South America and especially in rural and border areas... and thus unite our countries and open up new economic forms," said the Peruvian president in a read-only statement.
These projects would also include five Peruvians lying on the transverse axes of their territory from the coast to Brazil, two of which should provide better links with Ecuador, although he did not give any further details.
The final document also referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will be used for its resumption in the Union of South American nations", which it is currently excluded from.
The need for Latin America to continue to remain an integrated region for prosperity and peace and for good neighbourly relations was another aspect that was stressed at the summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before beginning his participation in the regional meeting, that on Saturday in Mexico he expected a meeting with his counterpart of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, to deal respectfully with the maritime conflict after a judgment of the IGH, which Bogotá called into question.
"Maybe I'll meet President Daniel Ortega on the morning (Saturday)," said Santos.
"We will review all these ways - they are not exclusive, and the agreement with Nicaragua also makes talks with Nicaragua necessary," he stressed.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we will treat this matter as civilised and respectfully as possible," added Santos.
Santos and Ortega would meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they intend to be present at the office of the new President of this country, Enrique Peña Nito.
As part of the summit, the Ministers for Defence of the Block met in advance to adopt the 2013 Action Plan, which aims to strengthen dialogue and consensus on the defence of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, even though the latter country is currently excluded.
Peru has the presidency at the time of the regional block.
"South America must learn to integrate citizens," says Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, today confirmed that the creation of a common citizenship is an objective, whereby "South America can actually learn something from Europe."
Correa, who took part in the 6th summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) that took place in Lima, explained to state television in Peru that the Europeans " perished in the second world war and in other conflicts" and "today are practically a homeland."
In this sense, he defended the project of creating a South American citizenship that is driving the member states of the Unasur.
"It is necessary to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries, as is already the case in the Andean community; however, there are still reactionary sectors that seek to return to the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador also supported the recasting of the Organization of American States (OEA) with the aim of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account those who have signed the San José Agreement on Human Rights.
Those who teach never commit themselves to anything, and in return we always sign the South Americans everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has its seat in Washington and is financed by the United States," he explained as an allusion to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa assured him that he did not regret this decision because he did not betray his principles, but followed his "deep democratic values and views on human rights".
He added that at the time there had been "founded presumptions that Assange would be delivered to a third country and that his proceedings would not be complied with."
He also criticized Swedish justice, who asked him to question him on his territory for alleged sexual offense, while "Swedish case law allowed this by means of a video conference that could have been carried out through the Ecuador Embassy in London."
Correa explained that there was a risk that the health and mental condition of Assange would be affected.
"Since he was in our message, I have not spoken to him, but the Ambassador has informed me that he has a slight problem with the lungs, but not a serious one," said the head of state Ecuador.
However, there is a danger that he might take physical and psychological damage because he was trapped in a narrow space and could not perform physical exercises outdoors.
"That would affect the health of every human being," he added.
Correa stated that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange since June in the message of Ecuador in London was to grant a free letter to travel to Ecuador, and that this was in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe. He underlined that there had been talks with London to find a solution for the imprisoned founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not deal with human rights, we do not use this word in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe , because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, conducts a number of proceedings at various European bodies," he said.
And "if the UK grants this free letter tomorrow, I believe this will be done."
And if Sweden questioned Mr Assange at the message of Ecuador in London or Skype, as Swedish case law permits and in other cases, the problem would be solved.
Correa took the opportunity to confirm himself as a defender of freedom of the press and said that what he does not tolerate is "the mediocre, the evil intention and the lie that depress the free expression of opinion."
"The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not the evil and perverted politicians, but bad journalists who are striving for profit and extortion," he said.
In this sense, he congratulated the fact that Ecuador was no longer ruled by such journalists "and is not ruled by the bankers or hetemones and captors" and predicted that it would "deepen the revolution in order to continue the way in this right direction" at a re-election.
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the Veto against Paraguay in the Unasur at least until his next elections, arguing that the organism "must remain hard and must not allow opportunism and none as a legally disguised coup" because it "was destroyed the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay."
The President of Ecuador also considers the wish of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the judgment of the International Court of The Hague, which favoured Nicaragua's maritime state sovereignty to negotiate with Nicaragua's maritime borders between the two countries, to be "absolutely entitled."
At present, this judgment is not being implemented.
It is a problem between a South and a Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the pursuit of a common path.
They need comprehensive treatment so that they can be overcome and looked forward.
He also relied on a good conclusion of the disputes over the sea borders between Peru and Chile before the same Court of Justice and said that "it is right for Latin America to call on international bodies if both countries undertake to accept the judgment even if it is very hard."
With regard to the possibility that he would stand as a candidate for the next presidential elections in Ecuador in order to succeed in his third mandate, he stated that he "sees this possibility with much optimism and joy, although sometimes it is very difficult."
Correa assured that if he lost the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life.
I have never been interested in power personally, but under as wrong circumstances as in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement had the belief that it was I who guaranteed this likely victory, so I must fulfill this responsibility," he said.
If I were to win, it would be my last period as President, then I would withdraw from public life.
This also applies if we lose.
"That's decided," he explained.
Correa also referred to the treatment of the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I was just talking to the vice-president of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, who told me that he had traveled there for a planned routine treatment, and that he would be expected to travel back to Cuba after the election campaign.
"In no case does it mean a relapse in the health condition of President Chávez," he said.
The Ecuadorian head of state took part in the 6th summit of the Heads of State or Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) in Lima today, which ended with the call for greater regional integration in order to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
The cause of death due to AIDS is a too late detection today
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed the result of the investigation: HIV positive.
"It was as if a bomb hit," he says about the moment when he received the diagnosis that the doctor "was trying to weaken" without recognizable success.
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to inform himself about it; and this with such a commitment that he was celebrating his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), in which he came after several fights in 1994.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was difficult to imagine in the early 1990s when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigmats.
At that time, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye, "because it led to a dead end."
At that time AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life.
However, many people still come to the hospital who know nothing about their illness and where the virus has already caused damage and exhausted their immune system, and who are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, i.e. after the first cases reported, "the great success today means that the survival of a patient who starts treatment in good time and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," said the head of HCG's HIV unit, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, saying that this information was supported by a respected scientific publication in April this year.
The specialist for infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, the scientists concluded that AIDS was not a death sentence, but that the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of impairment of the immune system of persons at the beginning of treatment, and that those more likely to be non-drug dependent: up to 30 years when counting 200 CD4 and 50 years when counting 500 CD4.
Simply put, the above statements mean that those who receive HIV-positive diagnosis at the age of 25 can "get problem-free 75 years as long as they are under control", said this expert.
In order to properly arrange this progress, it must be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans is now an average of 76 years.
Even if mortality has decreased significantly in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has decreased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (OnUSIDA annual report), it is true that 60 percent of patients in the national database have died since the AIDS was published.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and by May of this year there are already 187 deaths; however, it is assured that there has been universal access to antiretroviral medicines since 2005.
So why do people still die from it?
- In my opinion, the problem is not access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and so is in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years we have had no problem with the medications. The problem is that the people come in far advanced condition because they do not know their state of infection, i.e. in very late stages of the disease.
He makes a striking statement: "Nine out of ten patients come to us if they already have a accompanying infection. In order to influence global mortality, early diagnosis is required, which is why all persons who require this must be offered massive detection tests."
This proposal is approved by the experts and officials of the Consejo Estate de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (State Committee on AIDS Prevention in Jalisco) and also by the patients such as Fabrizio who had his test carried out at a private laboratory, for the only reason that it had made a friend of him who was already in the AIDS phase despite his young age and even had the Kaposi-Sarcoma (a cancer-like tumor) which is one of the usual complications.
Everything's different if you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die, and don't want to hear anything.
"If I have to die already, then instead of bursting three times," they say in my case.
The change was to improve, I feed well, drive sports and take the medications.
Today, his parents only know he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like everyone else.
"I work, do a lot, have an active but responsible sex life, I pay attention to my health and the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO in order to animated with his testimony those who today are afraid of the world's AIDS day.
They should test if they belong to the risk group. The earlier they know whether they are HIV-positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live responsibly like all people.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condome behind the loading table
There are large holes between the health programs and the simple citizen, explains Ricardo Salazar, journalist from Guadalajara, who has adopted the case of HIV.
And the most important thing is prevention.
In the places "the distribution of condoms was actually increased; earlier they were delivered individually, now they give us packages with a hundred pieces, which is already good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom," he said.
Young people are at risk for new infections.
"What do you need these?" is a common question of social workers, guidance staff in schools, employees in pharmacies and in the health system, who do not want to put up with young people, the correspondent assured.
He suggested reorientating this inefficient distribution; the condoms should be located not only behind the loading table but in output equipment in public toilets of facilities often visited by young people.
Promiscuity should not be promoted.
They should not be paid the beer and motel, as Governor Emilio González replied to the question of the distribution of conservatives under his administration.
"Sexuality doesn't look like this; it's best to bring the condoms closer to those who are already engaging in sexual activity," he put it to the point.
Key data of Jalisco
There are 13,435 accumulated cases (12.158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is in place of 4th new and cumulated AIDS cases, and 13th place in relation to HIV.
92% of cases of infection are over sexual intercourse, 6% over blood and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV because there are 4 or 5 people who do not know for each registered case.
After the Supreme Court of the United States has confirmed a judgment which does not recognise the restructuring of the liabilities of the Vitro Group, which was reached through a trade bankruptcy in Mexico, an unpleasant precedent is created for each national undertaking with branches in the neighbouring country which has payment problems.
Thus, it could be said that the procedures for the survival of the companies that allow the Mexican laws do not apply in the country of the stars and stripes contrary to international agreements.
In practice, the recognition of the judgment given on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale at the court in Bancarrotas for the northern district of Texas leads the Mexican companies to be helplessly exposed to the seizure of their property beyond the Bravo River.
However, the decision opens the door to the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico in order to refer three inconsistencies to the Supreme Court of the United States.
While the judge points out that the creditors must be subject to the bankruptcy law of the United States, the Court of Appeal of the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, first states that the main proceedings are the commercial bankruptcy treated in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation is not known in procedures in which companies with cross-border profiles are unable to pay.
In fact, the model law of the United Nations for the harmonisation of international trade law was created for this purpose, using the American Law Institute as a simpler.
Secondly, the judgment states that, without the vote of the companies after recognition of the liabilities in the bankruptcy mass which Vitro's branches had with their parent company, the necessary majority would not have been reached for the restructuring of liabilities.
However, this possibility is recognised by the Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case in which this scheme has been approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities were confirmed by the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles (Federal Institute for Trade Insurances).
It is also true that after the vote of the branches, the creditors of Vitro, the creditors who complained against Vitro in the courts of the United States, i.e. the vulture funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, had not reached a majority.
The vote would have taken 45% against 37%.
This is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, since 2008, Vitro has been blamed for its difficult situation as part of the major economic crisis in the United States, which struck the country.
For this reason, the González Sada family objected to the same appeals court so that the vote would take place in plenary, that is, by all judges, because only three voted.
If this is not accepted, the Cerciorare opposition, which calls for the review of the procedure by a higher instance, shall be filed by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The serious problem in this case is that the court left aside a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the Figura amicus curiae (friend of the court), which describes Vitro's proceedings in the context of the Act on trade bankruptcy, and which points out that it had strictly complied with the agreements signed by both countries in order to comply with Chapter 15 of the United States bankruptcy law.
It should also be noted that the country has been subject to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the established rules on the cases of cross-border inability to pay, which guarantee equality between debtors and creditors.
Two-banded carambol: a hit for vitro and for the country.
General balance sheet
After the announcements by the Mexican Air Transport Trade Unions against the former owner Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of a fraudulent administration, did not come forward for several months, the Asociación Sindical de Pilotos Aviadores (union of pilots) finally made progress.
The request made by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has now filed a criminal proceedings against the National Bank and Securities Commission, which is accused of disability of justice.
After that, the supervisory authority systematically refused to inform the main administration of a transaction carried out by the entrepreneur in order to withdraw from Bank IXE's trust account F/589 on the name of Mexicana de Aviación 198 million Pesos.
These funds were used to acquire shares of the Administrativeadora Profesional de Hoteles (the professional hotel management).
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Dragon Mart is surrounded
At a weekend meeting on a forum at the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of the bourgeois society decided to create a broad front to resist the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
As you know, we speak of a huge sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the country beyond the wall, supplemented by a living area for the employees of 150 companies.
In advance, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of Manufacturing Industry) has reached the goal of bringing together the governors in the southeast in order to resist the monumental establishment, which in part destroyed protected areas and is the mother of all the threats to the industry.
ACTA is dead
Because the government of a Senate request to explain the conditions and circumstances under which the Mexican ambassadors in Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, which is known under the English abbreviation ACTA, has already been archived in accordance with the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property.
As you know, these measures were taken, although the Senate had disregarded the possibility because it considered them to be a violation of freedom of expression in the social networks.
Homex Long-term
In the pursuit of paying long-term liabilities without affecting short-term liabilities, the building company Homex launches stock exchange certificates of over 500 million Pesos on the market.
The issue is the first of four equal emissions that promise an interest payment every 28 days.
Creation of Competival
Formed from NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet, leading Information Technology companies, a group of companies called Competival, whose goal is the service market of software clusters in Central and South America.
The corresponding investments amount to over 1.5 billion dollars.
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
Hector "Hetin" Reyes, the world drummer of basketball, was connected to basket sports for more than 60 years and has traveled all over the world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a great spiritual collection of the history of basketball in the country as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Before he was tied to the wheelchair by a stroke in 2008, Rexes was part of this sport for 6 years, whether as a player of lower classes, players of the first national league, authorised and head of the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or president of the Basketball Association.
"For my life, I have put up many hats in basketball, even several at the same time as I was president of the BSN, chief executive of the national team and president of the association in the 1990s," Reyes remembered when he visited Primera Hora at home in Bayamón, where he lived with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes doesn't overdo this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated with photos and memories of his long career and testify to it.
Bayamón in the heart
The most emotional memories are those that recall his time at the Vaqueros from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, where he celebrated his 15-year anniversary as co-business leader or managing director of the club.
"These were my best years, which I enjoyed most, because I was allowed to be part of eight Vaqueros championships since 1967 as managing director, co-business leader or coach.
There were many fulfilling years, including the five consecutive championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I agreed with a 1981 championship, the year of the debut of Jerome Mincy at BSN.
From then on, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a very good administrator," says Reyes.
I remember that Gene Bartow, who worked as a coach here and was employed at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said, "I have a very strong and 2 m big player.
Do you want him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow then recommended the free throw specialist Raymond Gausse, who was a citizen and one of our best pitchers.
I remember how he said that if Mincy had enabled a championship for Bayamon, Gausse would take care of another one.
The Vaqueros championship with Gausse was awarded to him, but already out of a distance, because he was already in the top position of the association in 1988.
At that time he preferred to enjoy his executions and those of Mincy in the national team.
I remember the first time we won the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico against the US.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we finished fourth, which should have been bronze, if not that Canadian referee, who had us repeat the last turn for the second time, Reyes said.
Was that group of the 1990 World Cup the best national team you've ever seen?
She is one of the best, as is the one who won against the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
My favorite, however, is the team of the 1991 Pan-American Games in Cuba, where we won gold and offered a fight to the US team, as they won against us at the bronze World Cup.
In that team, not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and Piculín (Ortiz) were there again, but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be there in 1990 because of a knee injury.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of personalities, but with which we won a gold medal and which brought us great joy was that of the pre-olimpic tournament in Neuquén, Argentina in 1995.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a substitute for the locked players because of the occurrences at the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal against any prognosis.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
That was without a doubt Piculín Ortiz.
His figures at the level of the international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated this level as much as Piculín.
And this without taking into account his career in the different leagues in which he played.
Who was the best coach from Puerto Rico?
That is a difficult question.
We had a number of good trainers like Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
I like Leo Arill's work.
What do you think is the best you've achieved in the union?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, which included the BSN from the beginning of the 90s to 17 teams in one season.
What else do you have to do?
There are things I would have introduced, such as the regionalization of the lower categories.
That the boys in Ponce, for example, play only in their territory and only meet teams from other corners of the island in the national playoffs.
Today, children make unnecessary travel and games.
At least I see the outcome of the required training courses and courses for trainers, table officials and referees.
I'm proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I like to listen to music, see videos of music of my time in YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and from time to time I go to a basketball game.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always at my side.
Larry Hagman is dead
Larry Hagman was born on 21 September 1931 in Forth Worth (Texas) and became famous worldwide with his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R". in the television series "Dallas", where he played a unscrupulous, secretive and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, is dead.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who came back this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died Friday afternoon due to cancer complications according to a family press release to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his beloved birthplace of Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role he liked most," said the family.
The Larry family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the celebrations of the Feast of Thanksgiving.
Linda Gray, who played his wife's role in the original and serial series, was with Hagman when he died in the Dallas hospital, said her publisher Jeffrey Lane.
He made everyone happy to know him.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived life in full swings," explained Gray in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed in 1992 with cirrhosis of the liver, and he admitted that he had been drinking a lot over the years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was detected in his liver, and he underwent a transplant.
In the years before "Dallas", Hagman became known on TV as a nice type in 1965 to 1970 with the Sitcom "Beautiful Jeannie" of the TV station NBC.
There he played the astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is put on the head when he meets an attractive "Jinn" (played by Barbara Eden) who will live with him at home.
He was also an actor of two comedies that were broadcast for a short time, such as The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His cinematographic works included critically rated roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful interpretation of the charming loathsome J.R. who made Hagman a superstar.
The dramatic series of the CBS television chain on the Ewing clan and other figures in its surroundings was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertisement "Who shot at J.R?", which was expected to create an episode full of emotions, where Hagmann's figure was almost killed, led to an international speculation, and millions of dollars were wagered in bethouses.
The series thus reached a record of audiences at the time.
When the answer became known in a chapter in November 1990, it was seen by an average of 41 million spectators who turned "Dallas" into the second most widely seen entertainment program since the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was Kristin who shot J.R. (interpreted by Mary Crosby).
J.R. had weakened her and threatened to present her as prostitutes if she did not leave the city, but others also had reasons to want to see him dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of Ewing as a corrupt, insatiable man with a charismatic smile: a staunch businessman and unfaithful husband who sought to have his alcoholic wife called Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what to stand on the tombstone of J.R.," said Hagman in 1988.
It should be called "Here lies the honorable citizen J.R. Ewing".
This is the only business he didn't win.
Victoria Principal, co-author of the original series, remembered Hagman on Friday as an "eminent personality on and out of the screen".
He is unforgettable and irreplaceable to millions of worshipers in the world and remains in our hearts who have had the happiness of knowing and loving him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast with great success in the TV channel TNT a few months ago.
The recording of five chapters for the second season was completed, and a sixth chapter was just turned, informing the transmitter.
There was no immediate explanation from Warner or TNT as to how the loss of Hagmann would be treated in the series.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who played classical works like "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she got Larry during her marriage with lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck at the theater stage in New York at the beginning of the 50's, after which he served in the Air Forces in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met and married the young designer Maj Axelson.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities live.
In 2001 he named his memoirs "Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True True) Tales about My Life".
"I wrote nothing of which I believed it could harm or harm someone in any way," said the Associated Press at the time.
After the liver transplant, he worked for liver donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist fearful patients.
"I advise them, give them courage, I meet with them when their operations are coming and after," he explained.
I want to give them some comfort, such as "no fear, it's a little uncomfortable the first time, but you'll be fine".
He also opposed smoking and participated in several campaigns.
Beginning of the courses studying the "end of the world"
Every week, students study apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs and global warming.
Every semester, when the professor of religion decided to hold a course over the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible hook: the end of the Maya calendar's "long back-counting" on December 21, many people believed that it meant the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what to expect in the following two months: the destructive Hurricane Sandy, whom some have called "deudarmaggedon", as well as a growing conflict involving Israel, the place of which the Christian theorists believe that the Apocalypse begins.
"I have not noticed that this will be the most apocalyptic semester that ever existed," said Charmé to students at the University of Rutgers-Camden (New Jersey) this week.
If someone analyzes what happened in the world today, as if we were thirty days away, this would be a really good period.
And he recalls that the bad is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only professor who offers courses about the "end of the world" this semester, which should actually be the last in history.
In Temple, Professor Barry Vacker gives the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World."
Every week, students study apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs and global warming.
"We are analysing why these ideas spread over time," he said, as well as the way in which hypothetical scenarios are offered that lead to a certain human behavior.
For example, if nuclear material gets into the hands of terrorists, a war could break out.
This month, the students analyzed films with apocalyptic content and examined how they could be compared to real life.
"I have tried to inform the students about what is possible, probably, credible and impossible," said Vacker.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, the professor of Latin American history Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, a assistant professor of art history and anthropology, formed a team to offer a course with the simple term "The End of the World".
"We don't take 2012 so that we always keep the option to be able to hold the course again, in case the world doesn't go down," said Restall.
Despite the "preliminary downfall", students have to study, create projects and participate in final exams.
In Penn State, the final exam is carried out on the eve of the Apocalypse, which is why the students have no other chance than "to continue working until night, where the world is supposed to end," said Restall.
The courses were very popular.
"In two hours there were no more places," Restall said about his course for high-average students who filled with 35 students.
Weeks before the beginning of the semester, we received e-mails from students who asked if there were still seats.
On the other hand, the students assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It's fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Rutgers-Camden for religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sect or religious mentality is actually only a question of consolation or its lack.
The 25-year-old student Will Weeksa for psychology and nursing explains that he has seen all apocalyptic films.
"I never heard of a lesson where this is being taught," he said.
I enjoy it.
But none of the students surveyed - and less a professor - declared to believe in the last date of December 21.
"Our first project dealt with Maya's prophecy, and in a certain way we discredit it," said Julie Zeglen, student last year in Temple, 21 years old and from West Chester.
Mayas never predicted the end of the world; it was just a key point in the calendar, said Restall.
However, he notes that in Western society there is an apocalyptic fear that leads back several centuries when people responded to changes in their environment with the prediction of the end of the world.
The Internet has increased these speculations.
"People don't think so elsewhere," he says.
This is mainly the case in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who is teaching in the Philippines this year, quickly answers the question of whether he would know a course there about the "end of the world".
"The Philippines does not participate at the end of the world," he wrote as an indication of an exception to a higher instance.
We have a gift from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that over the years many days were spoken by the last court, and said that if nothing happened on December 21, "people immediately think of a new date" or that December 21 was the beginning of a seven-year period after which the end of the world would come.
Students and professors take this date easily.
Several said they wanted to celebrate "the end of the world".
"Maybe I'm calling some friends so we can laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student for communication.
